<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK17">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from March 25 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-36, an act to implement certain provisions of the budget 
tabled in Parliament on February 24, 1998, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to be here this morning to take part 
in the debate on the implementation of certain provisions of the 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen something different from the government this year 
in that it has finally introduced a balanced budget.  The 
government predicts that this will be the case over the next 
three fiscal years.  However, its actions in this have not 
changed dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we have seen time and time again with this government it has 
taken measures to limit debate on various bills, including this 
bill.  It seems that it does not want members to do their job, 
that is, to examine these bills in this place and to represent 
the views of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has with this stage of Bill C-36, as it has time 
after time, tried to restrict the voices of millions of Canadians 
so that it can have its way and pass bills which may not serve 
the best interests of the people and of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has introduced an amendment to this bill 
which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-36, An Act 
to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 24, 1998, since the principle of the Bill, 
while charging the Consolidated Revenue Fund to establish and 
fund the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation, fails to 
guarantee that appropriate and objective accounting standards 
will be followed as advocated by the Auditor General.” 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had the pleasure of sitting on the public accounts 
committee and listening to the reports that the auditor general 
brings to that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I speak to the specifics of the measures that the 
Minister of Finance brought forward in his latest budget which 
are being implemented by this bill, I would like to take a moment 
to talk about the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The individual appointed to this position serves parliament as 
the watchdog of government, government finances and government 
departments.  He works for parliament, not the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This individual is charged with ensuring that the government is 
wisely spending taxpayers' hard-earned money and making sure that 
taxpayers get good value for their money.  In today's economic 
environment getting good value for our money is something that we 
all must do.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the scrutiny of the auditor general the government has had 
to become more prudent in its fiscal management, and I have the 
greatest respect for the office of the auditor general and for 
this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 contains legislation intended to implement many of the 
announcements made by the government in this year's budget.  The 
bill is divided into 13 parts, each of which either establishes a 
new program, amends existing legislation to alter program 
delivery or authorizes the federal government to engage in some 
new activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scope of this act includes the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation, assistance to reduce student debt, grants to 
encourage savings under registered education savings programs, 
and incentives under the Employment Insurance Act to provide a 
premium holiday in 1999 and the year 2000 for employers who hire 
young people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low income families will qualify for the Canada child tax 
benefit.  There are some minor changes, mainly cosmetic, which 
affect old age security and veterans allowances.  Other 
provisions of this bill include a wide variety of items such as 
raising excise taxes on cigarettes, reducing the excise tax on 
air transportation and allowing certain native bands to impose a 
7% value added tax on alcohol, tobacco and fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although many of my constituents in Cariboo—Chilcotin express 
some happiness with the fact that the books finally are balanced, 
they certainly do not feel this is the government's victory. They 
feel this is their victory.  They are the ones suffering the 
enormous tax burden like most Canadians.  They are also suffering 
the enormous cuts to health and social programs, a lot of them at 
the provincial level after transfer payments were cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While watching programs and services that directly affect their 
everyday lives such as health care and declines due to cutbacks, 
they have seen the federal government dole out millions of 
dollars on such things as free flags.  This is discouraging. Many 
of my constituents understand that we simply cannot continue 
living as we have become accustomed to in past generations, we 
have to start taking responsibility for ourselves and our 
families.  We have to stop living beyond our means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents are angry at the lack of prioritization by this 
government.  They would rather have a much smaller and more 
affordable bureaucracy.  They would rather see cuts in the senior 
levels of the public service than cuts at the service levels. 
They would rather have money go to programs and services which 
would benefit everyday lives instead of going into programs which 
are more symbolic and do not have a direct impact on everyday 
lives.  We saw that in the flag program and we see it again in 
the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance has stated in question period that my 
party is against education simply because we oppose this bill. 
That simply is not true.  What we oppose is the manner in which 
this government has established this fund.  After reading the 
editorials from my local newspapers and listening to my 
constituents, the biggest disappointments from this year's budget 
are that there is no tax relief and the government is not putting 
a real down payment on eliminating our huge debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure it comes as no surprise that my party feels there is a 
better way of dealing with putting our fiscal house in order.  We 
would introduce debt and tax relief measures as a way to 
stimulate job creation and economic growth.  This would help 
alleviate the much publicized brain drain which sees many of our 
brightest citizens leaving Canada in search of jobs and lower tax 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the view of many of our critics that we oppose 
many of the universal social programs that have become a 
cornerstone of Canadian society.  Again this is simply not the 
case. We do oppose the view that these universal social programs 
run by the bureaucrats are the best and the only way to care for 
the poor, the sick, the old and the young. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support a greater focusing of social policy benefits in hopes 
of targeting benefits to those who really need the help, doing so 
in a rational and compassionate manner.  Over the past decade in 
particular we have had to change how we live in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all more dependent on our families than we were before. 
We have had to take more responsibility for ourselves and our 
loved ones and we have to live within our means on shrinking 
budgets.  Our standard of living is much lower than it was even 
five years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there is a great deal of pride in the fact that we as 
a society are able to look after ourselves, our loved ones and 
those who look to us.  But Canadians also have a lot of 
resentment over the abuses within our system, the money that is 
wasted and the intrusion in people's lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear time and time again from those in my riding the 
resentment of my constituents over the smugness of the 
bureaucrats running these programs who say their way is the best 
and the only way. It brings out real hostility and resentment. 
People are sick of governments that arrogantly impose their ivory 
tower, socialistic philosophies which have diminished us 
culturally, socially and economically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in full support of the amendment brought forward by my 
party and in opposition to this bill and the tactics of limiting 
debate that the government is insistent on using in passing this 
bill.  Not only is it censoring both me and my colleagues and the 
members of the House in speaking on behalf of their constituents, 
it is also censoring our constituents as a result of the time 
allocations it has imposed on the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's action immediately preceding and with the 
announcement of this year's budget denied Canadians their first 
real budgetary surplus in decades.  As seen in the plethora of 
spending measures in this year's budget, including what many 
perceive as the Prime Minister's only real legacy, the millennium 
fund, we have seen this government return to its tax and spend 
ways.  The government had a wonderful opportunity this year. It 
could have given Canadians some real tax relief and start to make 
payments on our debt after years of mismanagement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government made a clear choice this year to keep 
Canadians overtaxed by introducing new programs that will only 
help a small percentage of Canadians.  The message from my riding 
of Cariboo—Chilcotin is clear. What a let down.  I urge all my 
colleagues to join me in opposing this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke—Lakeshore, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-36 moves the government forward in its commitment 
to implement the Canada child tax credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a few minutes to talk about this because I know the 
men and women in Etobicoke—Lakeshore who daily have to plan for 
their children and who daily in some way have to respond to the 
needs in their communities would like to find out a bit 
more about the child tax benefits and to see how that child tax 
benefit measures up in the goal of building a strong economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me start by quoting the Minister of Human Resources 
Development who described the challenge in two simple sentences: 
“Opportunity denied in childhood too often means chances lost as 
an adult.  Children are our future, so there is no better place 
for Canadians to invest”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 speaks to that investment in our children.  The vast 
majority of Canadians know how lucky we are to be living in 
Canada.  Most of our children receive a pretty good start in life 
but some are not so lucky.  I am speaking of the children who 
unfortunately experience emotional, behavioural, learning 
problems that affect their school performance and personal 
development, and those caught in the cycle of poverty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Others suffer from physical problems such as disease, disability 
or injury.  This is not only a personal tragedy but also a loss 
to the nation as a whole.  And so Canadians believe that their 
government should make it a priority to invest in the well-being 
of our children, the future of our country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments already provide substantial support for families 
with children but we need to do more.  The issue is not just how 
much support we provide but also how we provide that support.  In 
particular, we must do everything we can to tear down the 
so-called welfare wall.  We must ensure that parents on social 
assistance who rejoin the workforce will not lose all their 
benefits and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal, provincial and territorial governments have been 
examining ways to bring down the welfare wall and to improve 
assistance to children in low income families. We know the 
discussion that goes on around our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed approach is a national child benefit system under 
which the federal government will provide an enriched Canada 
child tax benefit.  In turn, the provinces and the territories 
would redirect some of their spending into better services and 
benefits for low income families, especially the working poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1997 budget started us on that road.  It proposed a two step 
enrichment of $850 million to the existing $5.1 billion child tax 
benefit.  The $850 million annual increase includes $600 million 
in new funds in addition to the $250 million for the working 
income supplement proposed in the 1996 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am showing here the direction in which this government is 
going from 1996 to 1997 to this budget.  In the first step, which 
took effect last July, the working income supplement was changed 
to provide benefits for each child instead of per family.  The 
maximum working income supplement is $605 for one income families 
and $1,010 for two child families.  It increases by $330 for each 
additional child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second step will occur this July when the working income 
supplement will be combined with an enriched child tax benefit to 
form the Canada child tax benefit. The maximum benefit for low 
income families will be $1,625 for one child families and $3,050 
for two children families and will increase by $1,425 for each 
additional child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those individuals who will benefit from this will definitely 
know that we are heading in the direction to alleviate their 
situation.  More than 1.4 million Canadian families with 2.5 
million children will see an increase in federal child benefit 
payments by July 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the national child benefit system social assistance 
payments made by provinces and territories will be adjusted in 
accordance with the increase in the child tax benefit. The 
provincial and territorial governments will then reinvest the 
savings from social assistance to improve benefits and services 
to all low income families with children whether they are on 
social assistance or working. We hope that in the province of 
Ontario this will definitely happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces are currently finalizing their reinvestment plans and 
are considering a variety of options including provincial income 
benefits, earned income supplements, extension of medical and 
dental benefits to low income working families and increased 
support for child care.  To ensure that aboriginal children on 
reserves benefit like other children from this initiative the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development is working 
with first nation leaders and provinces to develop appropriate 
reinvestment strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national child benefit system is an important initiative 
that deserves the support of all members of this House.  It will 
increase support to low income families and reduce barriers to 
work, building on the respective strengths of the federal and the 
provincial governments in achieving shared goals.  As part of the 
national child benefit system the federal government has 
committed to further enriching the Canada child tax benefit by 
$850 million annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget allocates $425 million as of July 1999 and a 
further $425 million as of July 2000 to fulfil this commitment 
and this commitment is to be worked out further with provincial 
and territorial partners.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government will continue working with the provinces

poverty and barriers to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be no more worthy effort than a new partnership on 
behalf of Canada's children.  This is why the government is more 
determined than ever to improve assistance to children in low 
income families.  This is why the government is more determined 
than ever to open up a broader and brighter horizon for low 
income families and their children by bringing down once and for 
all the welfare wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I ask members of the House to support Bill C-36 
which moves us closer to a goal that all of us in the House 
should support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-36, the 
budget implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent Liberal budget could have been historic since it is 
the first time in decades that our books have been balanced. 
However, the Liberals missed an historic opportunity in the 
budget to deal with the issues of most concern to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High tax levels, a crippling national debt, bracket creep and 
job killing payroll taxes have all been passed over by the 
government, despite the fact that these things affect the quality 
of life in our country, that these things reduce our standard of 
living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are subject to some of the highest tax rates in the 
world and the Liberals did nothing in the budget to address the 
situation.  In 1993 Ottawa collected $125 billion a year from 
taxes, but thanks to the Liberals Ottawa will suck $166 billion 
out of the pockets of taxpayers in 1998.  By the year 2000 
Canadians will be paying $48 billion per year in higher taxes 
than when the Liberals were elected.  That increase is equivalent 
to $5,000 per Canadian family.  It is these taxes that are 
sucking the lifeblood out of our economy and forcing many of our 
highly skilled workers to move to the more tax friendly United 
States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the recent budget the Liberals should have addressed bracket 
creep but they did not.  This insidious tax constantly pushes 
taxpayers into higher tax brackets even though their income 
remains unchanged.  Even the OECD called on the government to 
eliminate this sneaky tax.  Bracket creep represents taxation by 
stealth since taxes automatically increase each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has collected an extra $22 billion since bracket 
creep was introduced by the Tories in 1989.  Considering the 
present government's tax and spend mentality it should come as no 
surprise that it opted to maintain bracket creep, to maintain 
high tax levels and to maintain a source of income for its big 
government programs.  The 1998 budget contains $11 billion in new 
spending initiatives for 25 new government programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What it does not contain is real tax relief.  It utterly fails 
to recognize that there is a $583 billion national debt.  The 
debt load costs $45 billion each year to service.  That is $45 
billion less for important social programs like health care and 
education.  It is $45 billion thrown into the wind each year with 
no direct benefit for Canadians.  That is what our national debt 
load represents.  Yet the Liberals are patting themselves on the 
back for taxing Canadians to death in order to eliminate the 
deficit.  Meanwhile the monstrous debt load looms over our heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister had nothing to say about the serious debt 
situation which we now face.  In fact budget documents show the 
national debt remaining unchanged through the year 2000.  In 
typical Liberal fashion the government believes that if it 
ignores the problem it will go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not possible to sweep $600 billion under the carpet. 
Ignoring the debt today means that it will be passed on to the 
next generation tomorrow, and that is wrong.  According to the 
budget that is what the Liberals want to do.  The truth is that 
there was a surplus in 1997-98 of $3.2 billion but the Liberals 
blew it on new spending.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals had applied the surplus against the debt, we 
would have had an interest savings of $235 million a year over 
the next three years.  Rather than show a surplus on the books 
and face questions over excessive taxation, the Liberals simply 
spent the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of the nation's financial books, the auditor general 
accused the finance minister of cooking the books.  His 
accusations are well founded in standard accounting practices as 
a matter of fact, standard accounting practices the government 
has stubbornly refused to accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment put forward by my colleague from Medicine Hat 
addresses this issue.  The problem is that the Liberals have 
assigned $2.5 billion to the Prime Minister's Canada millennium 
scholarship foundation despite the fact that not a single 
scholarship will be handed out until the year 2000. It is not 
standard accounting practice, except in Liberal circles, to cost 
future liabilities into current budget figures, but then a lot of 
strange things go on within Liberal circles such as patronage 
appointments to the Senate in exchange for certain financial 
remuneration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time the Liberals have used this method of 
accounting for purely political purposes.  The auditor general 
twice criticized the government for doing the same thing with the 
Canada foundation for innovation fund and the $1 billion payment 
to Atlantic Canada for the HST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment put forward by the member for Medicine Hat would 
deny passage of Bill C-36 because the Liberals are cooking the 
books for pure political gain.  I think this is obvious to all 
members of the House, and I urge them to support the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to continue discussing the budget by pointing out 
the opportunity that was missed to lower taxes, particularly 
payroll taxes.  Even the finance minister's department states 
that payroll taxes kill jobs.  When the finance minister appeared 
before the finance committee in October 1994, he said that high 
payroll taxes were a tax on jobs and that it was ludicrous.  He 
certainly has changed his tune in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPP premium hike introduced this year is the largest tax 
grab in Canadian history.  It will kill tens of thousands of 
jobs.  Likewise, the minister has kept EI premiums at 
artificially high levels and he applied the huge EI surplus 
against the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>EI premiums for employees are $2.70, but the break even point is 
$2.  EI over the last few years has been taking in $8 billion 
more each year than it pays out.  These high EI premiums 
represent nothing more than a tax on jobs.  To the minister these 
high premiums have become necessary revenue to apply against the 
deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIB and small business continually cite high taxes, 
particularly payroll taxes, as the largest impediment to growth 
and expansion.  If the government wants to address unemployment 
it must get our tax levels down and encourage firms to hire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals just do not get it.  Government does not create 
jobs.  High taxes most certainly do not create jobs.  Big 
government and high taxes kill jobs.  They are an impediment to 
economic growth and lower unemployment.  The Liberals do not have 
a plan to create jobs as demonstrated by progressively higher 
taxes in each subsequent budget since 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Reformers have a plan for getting Canadians back to 
work and strengthening the economy.  We would reduce job killing 
payroll taxes and capital gains taxes in order to encourage 
investment in Canadian businesses.  We would eliminate the 3% and 
5% income surtaxes introduced by the Tories and only tinkered 
with in the budget.  As well, Reformers would increase the amount 
of the basic personal deduction and extend the child care expense 
deduction to all parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all, our efforts would reduce taxes by $15 billion by the 
year 2001.  This amounts to $2,000 per family of four.  This plan 
is directed toward providing a brighter future for Canadians, a 
future filled with hope and opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, when we examine the Liberal government's 
obsession with high tax levels and its continuing yearly tax 
increases, the hopes of many Canadians are erased and many 
opportunities will simply never arise.  Therefore, for these 
reasons I cannot support Bill C-36.  I urge all other members of 
the House to oppose the bill.

and known as the Budget Implementation Act, 1998.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot could be said about this budget, but I will begin by 
pointing out several of its shortcomings, particularly in so far 
as the Department of Canadian Heritage is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent days, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has passed 
herself off as the great defender of the rights of francophone 
and Acadian communities.  Her grand statements are beginning to 
sound like science fiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A hard look at the numbers and at what is actually going on 
reveals that the Minister of Canadian Heritage is cutting 
official language education funding by $22 million.  This is 
particularly hard on independent schools and associations of 
independent schools at a time when francization needs are 
glaring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 18, the minister announced that the Official Languages 
in Education Program was being renewed for a further five years, 
with stable funding, meaning that, despite the fiscal turnaround, 
the savage cuts of recent years are continuing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Commission nationale des parents francophones du Canada, an 
organization representing 11 provincial and territorial 
federations of francophone parents outside Quebec, reacted to 
this announcement in a release quite rightly entitled “Political 
will in free fall”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It says, and I quote:  “The announcement of another large cut in 
the Official Languages in Education Program for the next five 
years represents another disappointing chapter in the 
increasingly sorry turn that the future of official languages in 
Canada is taking—.  The ongoing erosion of the Official 
Languages in Education Program is indicative of the erosion in 
the political will of the Canadian government with respect to the 
development of minority francophone communities. 
It can be expected that teaching in French in the francophone 
communities will become a priority as resources dwindle”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the federal government was paying $268 million into this 
program at the time the Liberals were elected in 1993, the 
Liberals reduced payments to this program this year to $152 
million, or a reduction of 43% over six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Mrs. Johanne Lacelle, the president of the 
Commission nationale des parents francophones, “We are 
disappointed, because the educational needs in minority 
communities are pressing.  We are still far from having the 
quality education that would put us on an even footing with 
others.  Funding should be doubled or tripled rather than 
reduced.  Assimilation is on the rise in all of the francophone 
communities. 
More and more francophones are losing their first language, 
while more and more anglophones are acquiring a second language. 
These are the results of the present language situation in 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall that the Commission nationale des parents 
francophones revealed in 1996 that the bulk of the funding to 
provinces for official languages in education was going to 
anglophones learning French as a second language.  Finally, only 
the minister herself thinks that everything is fine and that 
francophones can be helped by reduced budgets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also called upon the Minister of Canadian Heritage, both 
here in the House and in the heritage committee, to substantially 
increase the funding allocated to the court challenges programme. 
The purpose of this program is to provide financial support to 
cases taken before the courts by groups or individuals who feel 
that their language rights have not been respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the minister has announced that she would not pursue her 
plan to cut 9% from this program.  What great progress for 
francophones.  By cancelling this cut, the minister will have to 
find the $250,000 this 9% represents elsewhere in her 
department.  So who will pay the price this time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time, there are about 10 cases before the courts, 
or in preparation, contesting provincial decisions on school 
administration or the creation of French language schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless the court challenges program receives a substantial 
increase in funding, some of those cases will have to be either 
abandoned or deferred, as the money will run out before the year 
is over. 
The past has shown that continuous recourse to the courts was 
the only way francophone minorities could ensure any sort of 
respect for their rights by the governments of the anglophone 
provinces, despite section 23 of the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In another vein, the 1998 federal budget makes no provision for 
funds for the multimedia sector or for loan guarantees to develop 
content in the new media, including the Internet. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT9"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT9"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, this was promised in the second red book, and the advisory 
committee on the information highway recommended setting up a $50 
million fund.  Last week, at the Standing Committee on Canadian 
Heritage, the representatives of Telefilm Canada indicated how 
important investment in the multimedia sector is to the 
development of television programs, videos and films. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government could and should also have announced the 
immediate abolition of the GST on books.  While the minister 
allocates $31 million a year to her program to assist 
publishers, the Minister of Finance pockets some $120 million in 
revenues from taxes on reading material. 
By continuing to tax books, the Minister of Finance is 
nullifying his colleague's efforts.  He is undermining the 
industry and limiting public availability of written material, 
thus hurting both culture and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is some of what is missing in the 1998 budget, which 
confirms that the Liberals are promoting certain values in their 
speeches and election campaigns but neglecting them when they 
deliver their budget.  It is all very well for the government to 
set ambitious objectives for its departments, but these are 
unattainable without the necessary financial means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 7 of Bill C-36 is intended to implement the raise in taxes on 
cigarettes announced by the Minister of Finance before the budget 
was tabled. 
While the Bloc Quebecois supports such an increase, it deplores 
the fact that the minister did not include measures to support 
sports and cultural events that may lose their sponsorship by 
tobacco companies, following the adoption of Bill C-71 by the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should point out that the Quebec government took the 
initiative regarding this issue by pledging to allocate part of 
the revenues generated by the tax increase on tobacco—that is 
about $12 million—to a Quebec fund for culture, sports and 
health. This initiative will be confirmed in the budget to be 
brought down by the Quebec government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parts 1, 5 and 10 of Bill C-36 deal with the government's 
millennium scholarship fund, the measures to support registered 
education savings plans, and federal assistance to students. 
In spite of these stopgap measures, one wonders whether the 
federal government truly wants to improve education, considering 
that, between 1993 and 2003, it will have cut over $10 billion in 
that sector, including $3 billion in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These federal cuts, which are partly responsible for the lower 
quality of our education system, have resulted in soaring 
tuition fees, thus contributing to the indebtedness of a whole 
generation of students and to a major increase in personal 
bankruptcies by graduating students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of providing financial solutions to these students, the 
federal government ties them down for a long time. With this 
bill, the Liberal government amends the Bankruptcy and Insolvency 
Act to extend from two years to ten years the period of time 
during which a discharge does not release the bankrupt from the 
reimbursement of his student loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot talk about education without deploring once again the 
chronic underfinancing of research and development, as we are 
about to enter the 21st century. 
This situation directly impacts on students, because they do not 
have access to modern teaching and research infrastructures, and 
because they are deprived of the stimulating presence and 
expertise of teacher scientists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that the federal government should 
stop talking about its noble values and boasting about its great 
initiatives. Instead, it should find the means to implement these 
projects and to take concrete and effective action, while 
respecting the jurisdictions of each level of government.

<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to enter the debate on Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to discuss a specific aspect of the legislation 
which perhaps many members have not mentioned.  It has to do with 
the authorization in the act to allow the Canada Development 
Investment Corporation to dispose and transfer its assets and 
liabilities including the Canada Hibernia Holding Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All Canadians have been interested in the Hibernia oilfields for 
many years.  It was back in 1965 that the initial investigative 
work was done in the oilfields to see whether this would have a 
significant potential for some of our poorer provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people may wonder why the member for Durham is talking 
today about the Hibernia oilfields.  My wife's family has deep 
roots in the province of Newfoundland. 
This is also something which all Canadians want to share and 
rejoice in. I do not think people realize that if the government 
disposed of its financial interest in the Hibernia oilfields, 
currently it would be about $2.5 billion.  We can imagine what a 
positive impact that would have in hopefully increasing a surplus 
in future years.

<A HREF="#LINKT9"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Hibernia project represents a partnership of Canadians for 
Canadians.  I was in Newfoundland a couple of years ago and I 
discussed a number of the financial aspects with legislators 
there.  They were very concerned about some of the cutbacks in 
the CHST and how they were going to be able to maintain some of 
their basic services through the CHST and also through the 
equalization payments system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During various periods in the history of Newfoundland a 
depopulation has occurred.  That has been a benefit to ridings 
like mine.  A great number of people from Newfoundland are now 
residing in parts of Ontario. They had to leave Newfoundland 
because there was no employment. Unemployment levels in 
Newfoundland are still unacceptable. With the economic activity 
that is going to be generated by Hibernia, unemployment levels 
are going to decline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A substantial investment in capital has already occurred in the 
Hibernia oilfields.  Most of this money has been spent in Canada. 
Capital expenditures of over $5 billion have already gone into 
this project and 55% to 60% of these capital expenditures were 
Canadian.  Sixty-six per cent of all employment was Canadian. 
Today as we speak there are over 250 jobs on that rig.  Of course 
that money goes back into the economy of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are currently projecting to increase the production up to 
20,000 barrels a day.  As the entire platform is developed they 
are talking about 135,000 barrels of oil a day. That is a 
significant and major oil discovery on our east coast. It is 
going to have a tremendous impact on the economy of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is good.  We all benefit.  The federal government taxes 
these people when they make profits.  The province of 
Newfoundland will get royalties from this and it also will get 
the spin-off jobs.  This is very positive for increasing the 
economy of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should mention the recent discovery at Voisey's Bay.  This is 
a long term project. When it gets going, Newfoundland will also 
be able to reap some benefits in the mining sector.  The mining 
and resource sector is anticipated in 1998 by the Conference 
Board of Canada to increase its revenues by over 80% in the 
province of Newfoundland.  Unemployment rates will decline due to 
this to 17.9%, which is still unacceptably high but is 
significantly lower than it has been in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In St. John's and other communities in Newfoundland there has 
already been a tremendous increase in residential construction. 
The Conference Board of Canada estimates that in 1998 the renewal 
of the housing sector will increase 14.8%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some foresighted government years ago which saw the need to put 
in that seed capital to get the Hibernia project going was very 
wise indeed.  This is a great opportunity for the people of 
Newfoundland to acquire economic benefits and to build a truly 
indigenous economy for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A concern I have about this issue is from time to time I hear 
people especially in resource based economies challenge the 
equalization payments system.  The equalization payments system 
is based on certain income levels that exist within a provincial 
jurisdiction and then it tries to equate them with the three 
wealthier provinces. Through that process there have been 
payments to provinces to help raise their standards so that we 
all have equality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is so great about this country. 
As Canadians we agree that we have to have basic standards, 
standards in health care, standards in social services, standards 
in unemployment insurance benefits, et cetera.  That is what 
makes this a great country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If people were to sit down and ask what it is that Canadians 
understand, it is that we have over the years created these 
sharing arrangements.  The people of Ontario and the wealthier 
provinces like Alberta and British Columbia from time to time 
have realized the importance of sharing in this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard people argue from time to time that the resources 
from a resource based economy should be excluded from the 
equalization formula. This means we would exclude the resource 
sector from the calculations.  The equalization payments would be 
skewed to allow the provinces that are utilizing their resources 
not to have to include them in the calculations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not have to tell anyone that the province of Alberta for 
years and years has been a net contributor to the equalization 
payments system and an economy very heavily dependent on the 
resource sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people were able to buy into the argument.  It seems that 
the new provinces, those now coming on with a higher resource 
sector must do so as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the arguments I have often heard members speak 
about.  They say that Newfoundland's infrastructure has 
deteriorated over the years, that they need time to build it up. 
They do not think they should be penalized by seeing their 
equalization payments decline at the same time that this is 
occurring.  They want to be given some breathing room, to be 
given a chance to catch up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the merits of that having been to Newfoundland and 
having understood that its infrastructure certainly is in need of 
significant capital injection.  However the reality is that we 
must as a country all live with common standards. For that 
reason, I believe it would be unwise for us to pursue that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now the province of Newfoundland receives equalization 
payments of somewhere around $1.4 billion.  We should all be 
rejoicing, including the people of Newfoundland, and saying that 
those equalization payments are going to come down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe one day Newfoundland will be a net contributor to the 
equalization payments system.  That is great.  Once again it 
shows how Canadians care and that in good times and bad times we 
can live together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to touch on one aspect of this legislation which I 
think perhaps a lot of members have overlooked.  It is the 
ability to allow the government at any time to dispose of 
Hibernia by orders in council without bringing further 
legislation to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very significant time.  Clearly somebody is thinking of 
doing just that.  As we talk, international oil prices are 
fluctuating.  It is clear that the government is going to be 
prudent in selecting a timeframe in which to undertake this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should know that our investment in Hibernia is really 
twofold.  We have a direct investment via the Canada Hibernia 
Holding Corporation.  That is an 8.5% interest in the entire 
operations.  Some of the bigger players are Mobil Oil, Chevron 
and Petro-Canada.  Interestingly enough we still own 8.3% of 
Petro-Canada so indirectly Petro-Canada also has an interest in 
the Hibernia oilfields. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just wanted to intervene at this time to talk about the 
equalization payments system, about how the rest of Canada, 
including the people of Durham, are very thankful that this has 
been a success for the people of Newfoundland.  At the same time 
I want to give them a little reminder that we are all in this 
club together.  We are all going to play by the same rules. When 
things get a little better for Newfoundland, it will also have to 
play by the same rules.  I am sure most people of Newfoundland 
believe that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I wish the people in Newfoundland well.  I was very 
happy the other day to see the first tanker shipment of oil leave 
the Hibernia oilfields. It marks a new day for the people of 
Newfoundland.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Wendy Lill (Dartmouth, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to address my comments today regarding Bill C-36 and my 
concerns regarding education in Nova Scotia and the country at 
large. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this budget and with the policies and directions this 
Liberal government has implemented over the past five years, it 
has created an educational deficit in this country which 
threatens our ability and our children's ability to grow and 
prosper in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my home province of Nova Scotia funding for post-secondary 
education has been ravished since the federal Liberals imposed 
their severe cuts to education with the Canada health and social 
transfer in 1995.  The provincial Liberals have matched the feds 
cut for cut.  The results are rapidly rising tuition fees, 
spiralling student debt and a serious threat to accessibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some sad, I would say outrageous, facts regarding 
public education in my province since the advent of Liberal cost 
cutting federally and subsequently provincially.  Between 1993 
and 1996 $50 million has been taken from provincial grants to 
school boards.  That is nearly a 10% decrease.  I have personally 
watched the tortured process by which school boards fight over 
whether to cut full day elementary classes, band, speech 
therapists or class sizes.  In the late hours of these meetings 
we hear them bickering over elements of education, none of which 
are frills but are all essential to the growth of our students. 
Yet that is what they are being reduced to doing now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1994 and 1996 there have been 764 teaching positions cut 
across the province of Nova Scotia.  That was a 7.5% reduction. 
Meantime enrolment has dropped by just 1.1%.  Is it any wonder 
some classrooms are overcrowded and many teachers stressed out? 
Specialist teachers have been hit especially hard.  By 1997 the 
education funding review work group identified a $33 million 
deficiency in special education funding.  All these cuts are 
directly related to the severe cuts imposed by the Canada health 
and social transfer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia there is also a new twist to public education 
which has been brought about again by Liberal cuts.  There is not 
enough money for textbooks, special needs students or the 
replacement of some of the overcrowded and substandard schools, 
yet the Liberals found the cash to indulge in a new scam which is 
called public-private partnerships to build new high tech 
schools.  The government has gone into partnership with some 
companies such as IBM and Systemhouse and others of its corporate 
backers to build and run schools.  They will not reveal the terms 
of the partnerships or the long term costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Liberal friends and corporate backers who make up the 
consortium building the private schools could not find the 
private money to finance the construction, the government quietly 
loaned them more than $45 million interest free. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some more facts about post-secondary education in my 
province since the budget cuts to education.  In Nova Scotia 
funding for university and community colleges dropped from $270 
million to $230 million this year. On average Canadian students 
who graduate now have over $24,000 debt in student loans. 
Declining government support means that universities must rely on 
tuition fees for an increasing share of their revenues.  Nova 
Scotia students are paying more than 22% of the university 
revenue in their tuition, this versus a national average of 
14.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The average tuition for arts undergraduates in Nova Scotia is 
over $3,700.  This is the highest in the country.  On average 
Nova Scotia undergraduates paid $500 more than the next most 
expensive province, Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of living for Canadian students in 1996 was over 
$12,000.  Expenses for an undergraduate arts student for the 
1997-98 academic year at Dalhousie totalled $9,000 in tuition, 
room and board and additional fees. 
Only the University of Toronto was higher among 10 universities 
surveyed by Statistics Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a surprise that Dalhousie, one of the proudest and 
oldest universities in the country, is now on strike.  There are 
117 professors at Dalhousie who have been laid off.  This 
university is now in the throes of chaos and again it has to do 
with our lack of commitment to post-secondary education in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is no surprise that the people of Nova Scotia have 
voted very roundly against what they see as Liberal cost cutting 
to some of their essential services and that includes education. 
They have voted with their ballot against Liberal policies in 
Nova Scotia and continue to do so also federally because they are 
concerned about the future of their children.  I think this 
budget is going nowhere to allay their fears on that score. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
want to give a few thoughts on Bill C-36, the implementation act 
of the budget.  This is a large piece of legislation and of 
course it results from some of the things that were tabled in the 
budget in late February.  I want to look specifically at some of 
the issues that are talked about, the millennium scholarship fund 
for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a few other things I should preface my remarks with, 
and that is the situation we are in fiscally in the country so 
that all these budget implementation things could happen at all. 
Of course when the budget was tabled last month the government 
talked about finally being in the position to have a balanced 
budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is super in terms of Canadians saying we do not have to 
deficit finance anymore and hopefully it will never happen again, 
but the question of course is how did we balance the budget and 
how is it that we are operating at a zero deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hate to be critical of government members patting 
themselves on the back so hugely that they would dislocate their 
shoulder.  That would be a most unfortunate thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But looking at how the budget was actually balanced there are a 
few questions to be asked.  I know Mr. Speaker would be just as 
concerned as I to know some of the answers to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the government will collect $35 billion more in taxes 
than it did in 1993.  I do not know whether this could be called 
cutting spending.  I hardly think it would qualify under that 
category.  I think of my home city of Edmonton where taxpayers 
have been asked to kick in $35 billion as part of the larger 
economy of the country, $35 billion more in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For my part of the country and my city, that equals about $1 
billion just for the city of Edmonton.  That is a lot of people 
working and a lot of people sending in their taxes to Revenue 
Canada to kick in our portion of this increased tax and revenue 
for the government of Canada.  It is about $1 billion coming out 
of Edmonton alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I think about it I would be amused if I were not so sad. 
When the relocation of the superbase happened in Edmonton it was 
treated as though this was a gift of largess from the government. 
It said you lucky folks, guess what is happening to you in 
Edmonton.  You will be getting the western Canadian superbase and 
we will spend hundreds of millions of dollars making sure that 
happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wonderful and there is increased economic activity in 
Edmonton.  We sure appreciate that but when it is treated as 
though it is some sort of gift from someone on high, it could be 
understood that the gratefulness is not quite that exciting. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1110"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT14"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT14"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1110

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all, if we are sending $1 billion more into the Government 
of Canada, then a $100 million return on a superbase is not 
exactly a great investment on our dollar.  When the government 
talks about partnerships and investments, I am no mathematician 
but I know that if I get $100 million spent in my community and 
then the government turns around and takes $1 billion in extra 
taxation and revenue from me then I am not exactly what one would 
call a winner in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to realize that the government is going to be collecting 
$35 billion more in taxes than it did in 1993 when it came in. 
Who is paying that?  It is the taxpayers who are sending out 
their cheques to Revenue Canada.  People all across the country 
want the budget balanced and this budget has done that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is also the debt which is the accumulation of all 
these deficits that have added up over the years.  The total debt 
now is $583 billion, which is an amazing amount of money. 
Frankly, I do not even know how many zeros that is.  However, if 
we break it down to the average family we are looking at every 
family of four in this country from Newfoundland to British 
Columbia being saddled with an extra mortgage of $77,000. This is 
just scandalous.  I am not sure that any government should be 
standing up patting itself on the back and saying it is terrific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make sure that debt reduction is the number one 
target but frankly I do not see it here in the budget.  When the 
budget was delivered, the Liberals said that if there was any 
money left over people could rest assured that they would put 
some of that money toward the debt.  There was a wink, wink and a 
hand on my wallet in my back pocket.  They were going to make 
sure to look after the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at pages in the House of Commons who are coming along the 
generation behind those of us who are getting a little older. Who 
is going to pay that debt?  I am sure every member in the House, 
regardless of political party, understands that we have close to 
$600 billion of debt.  Who is going to pay it?  We can stand and 
brag that we do not have to worry about this anymore because we 
are paying off our Visa with our MasterCard, but I think that 
certainly defeats the purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has slashed payments to the provinces by $7.4 
billion.  That is an incredible amount of money.  That is 16.5% 
of the reduction of the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, when you travel the country, as I am sure you do, 
and talk to people they say what their priorities are. They want 
to have a good health care system in the country. They want good, 
sound education programs. They want to make sure they have secure 
pensions when they reach retirement age.  I think everybody 
universally feels the same way about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, here we are debating a bill which includes the 
millennium fund right now which concerns post-secondary 
education.  How much help is it going to be?  It will touch 6% of 
the students in the country.  I think the far wiser thing the 
government could be doing is moving forward and realizing that 
what is important is not just to reduce the debt but to offer tax 
relief to all the provinces.  With a higher amount of money in 
transfer payments, the provinces unilaterally could then offer 
universal tuition reductions.  I think that would be a a lot 
better than picking students who are going to be able to benefit 
from this millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we talk about students, and I think of our pages who are in 
university right now, they are going to have their first degree 
under their belt by the time this millennium fund even kicks in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at how serious it is to offer real help to students 
and then look at this implementation of the Canada millennium 
fund, it looks to me like the Prime Minister, before he heads out 
at the turn of the century, wants this to be his shrine.  He 
wants this to be his personal legacy.  He will go out on a roll 
as the architect of this and they will build a statue saying he 
was the one who brought in the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were seriously concerned about students it 
would do something in this budget to increase the transfer 
payments it slashed so harshly.  It should put back the transfer 
funds to the provinces to ensure that under their jurisdictional 
powers they would have the money available to offer universal 
tuition cuts.  I think that would be a very refreshing thing.

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding tax relief there is not a lot in the budget that 
offers real cash back to the people who are paying billions and 
billions of tax dollars to the government.  The government will 
put a dollar in the pocket of taxpayers and say that is 
wonderful.  Then the old hand comes around to the wallet again 
and it takes $2.  That is not good arithmetic.  It is not good 
politics.  It is not good optics.  I know you would certainly 
agree, Mr. Speaker, that government has to watch where it has its 
hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the ultimate amount of money the government brings 
in, it is absolutely staggering.  I am looking at the budgetary 
numbers in the budget in brief.  Budgetary revenue is the amount 
of cash the government is bringing in.  In fiscal year 1998-99 it 
will be $151 billion.  All those zeros would hardly fit on a 
ledger sheet.  They would have to be written very small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is spending $104 billion on program spending. 
There is a balance of $46.5 billion.  The government says that is 
a lot of cash and it is terrific that it has $46 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we know where that exact amount of money is going?  It is 
going to interest payments on the debt.  It is frightening when 
we see that kind of thing happening because interest payments 
will just gobble up all the cash that should be going to other 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many tremendous programs, worthwhile programs.  We see 
some of them in the bill.  Should we be thinking about education? 
Absolutely.  This is what we talk about, that future generations 
need to have an education.  Is the government really concerned 
about education, helping students and making sure that tuition 
fees are low?  No.  Instead it builds a shrine to the Canada 
millennium scholarship foundation.  What good does that do other 
than provide a trophy, a plaque or a statue?  It does not do a 
lot of good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the amount of money going to various projects. 
Talking about education again, the Canada Student Financial 
Assistance Act on paper looks absolutely super.  We sit down and 
ask questions about whether this is the best way to address 
student finance.  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuition should be lowered and transfer payments should be put 
back to the provinces.  We should make sure that the provinces 
are able to deliver excellent quality post-secondary education so 
that kids are able to learn, get their degrees, get good jobs and 
pay taxes back to the government.  That is what it is all about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, today is March 31, the end of 
fiscal year 1997-98.  Today the budget book of the federal 
government is balanced for the first time in almost 30 years.  It 
will be balanced in the forthcoming two years, resulting in three 
consecutive balanced budgets in almost 50 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can be said that the post-deficit era has begun.  It is an 
era of new optimism and expanding opportunities for Canadians as 
we prepare for a new century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have an economy with historically low interest rates and 
inflation.  Thanks to lower interest rates, the monthly payment 
on a $100,000 mortgage is now over $250 less than it was in 
January 1995, a savings of over $3,000 per year.  The monthly 
payment on a $100,000 small business loan is now over $180 less 
than it was in April 1995, an annual savings of over $2,200. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have an economy that has created over one million new 
jobs since the Liberals took office in October 1993.  It is an 
economy with which the OECD says Canada will lead the G-7 nations 
in economic and job growth in 1998.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed we have reason to be proud as Canadians.  Not only will 
we be putting the debt to GDP ratio on a permanent downward 
track.  Our debt reduction plan will reduce the absolute level of 
debt, which I say to answer the anxiety of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier I spoke of the expanding opportunities for Canadians as 
we enter the new millennium.  The budget builds on action taken 
in previous budgets by proposing a Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  The aim of the strategy is to provide Canadians, 
especially young Canadians, with greater opportunities to prosper 
in a new knowledge based economy.  This strategy takes action on 
seven fronts.  Let me name them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the Canada millennium scholarships and Canada study 
grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second is increased funding for advanced research to 
granting councils: the Medical Research Council, the National 
Research Engineering Council and the Social Sciences and 
Humanities Research Council. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third is tax relief on student loan interest and 
improvements to the Canada Student Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth is measures that promote lifelong learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth is helping Canadians save for their children's 
education through Canada education savings grants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sixth is supporting youth employment through an employment 
insurance premium holiday for employers who hire young Canadians 
in 1999 and 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh is expanding access to advanced technology by 
increasing funding for SchoolNet, the community access program 
and the Canadian Network for Advanced Research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Canadian millennium scholarship program part of the 
budget let me say that the foundation for the program would be 
the centrepiece of the Canadian opportunities strategy.  It is a 
comprehensive strategy designed to help create new opportunity 
for Canadians by expanding access to the knowledge and skills 
needed for better jobs and higher standards of living as we enter 
the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of the Canada millennium scholarship foundation is to 
remove the barriers for low and middle income Canadians, 
especially young Canadians so that they can get the 
post-secondary education or the advanced technical training they 
need to get good jobs in the new economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning in the year 2000 Canada millennium scholarships will 
be awarded to over 100,000 full time and part time students each 
year over the next decade through an initial endowment of $2.5 
billion from the federal government.  This is the single largest 
investment ever made by a federal government to support access to 
knowledge and skills for all Canadians.  It truly reflects the 
commitment of the government to the youth of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For full time students the scholarships will average $3,000 a 
year.  Eligible students will be able to receive up to $15,000 in 
millennium scholarships over a maximum of four academic years of 
study toward undergraduate degrees, diplomas or certificates. The 
Canada millennium scholarship foundation is about access, not 
jurisdiction, with a challenge that is crucial to the future 
prosperity of Canada.  All levels of government have a legitimate 
role to play and a responsibility to work together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me touch on another item in the budget concerning allocating 
the fiscal dividend.  The fiscal dividend is the projected 
surplus of total revenues over total spending that would arise in 
the absence of any new tax and spending actions since the 1997 
budget.  In our 1997 election platform, “Securing Our Future 
Together”, we pledged that over the course of our second mandate 
we would allocate our budget surpluses on a 50:50 basis.  Half 
would go to investments in social and economic priorities.  The 
other half would go to a combination of tax relief and tax 
reduction.  This rule of thumb reflects the balanced priorities 
of Canadians.  The government remains committed to this formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 budget, the first in our new mandate, reflects that 
commitment. 
The formula will be used as a guiding principle for planning 
purposes.  Although the annual split may vary from year to year, 
already the impact for the 1998 budget over three years is 40% 
investments on social and economic priorities and 60% on tax 
relief and tax reduction.

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to another topic on tax relief if I may.  The budget 
delivers $7 billion of tax relief over the next three years. Yes, 
tax relief for low and middle income Canadians through an 
increase in the basic personal exemption and the elimination of 
the 3% general surtax on Canadians with incomes of up to about 
$50,000.  These are two measures that will take 400,000 Canadians 
off the tax rolls and reduce taxes for 14 million Canadians by 
the year 1999 and the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, let me ask all colleagues in the House to give 
their support to Bill C-36 which may be cited in short as the 
Budget Implementation Act, 1998.  When we do this I am sure 
Canadians will be proud of all of us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to be provided with the opportunity to speak to Bill 
C-36 and the official opposition amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was most unfortunate to bear witness to our government 
attempting to play fast and loose with the financial books of the 
country.  We have a world renowned organization of professionals 
called the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants.  Members 
of this group are contracted all over the world to audit 
financial records to maintain the integrity of financial 
statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance's recent methods of creative bookkeeping 
make a mockery of Canadian professional accounting practices. All 
the minister can say is that he knows better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the office of Auditor General of Canada.  His office has 
a budget of approximately $50 million.  Approximately 500 people 
are employed to scrutinize government programs and financial 
activities.  The auditor general has been most critical of the 
minister's creative bookkeeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government react to the very office set up to 
monitor its finances in the interest of Canadians?  It provides 
thinly veiled threats to its servants who are attempting to do 
the job they have been mandated to do.  It tells its own watchdog 
that the finance department is in charge and if the auditor 
general does not like it then the rules will be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that this is not an example of what Canadians 
can expect, should the Minister of Finance ever fulfil his goal 
of becoming prime minister of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of cooked books is just a symptom of the disease. 
Sometimes I wonder whether the Minister of Finance is conducting 
himself in such an irrational and questionable fashion merely to 
draw attention away from his failure to address the real problems 
of his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main element of the recent budget was the establishment of 
the $2.5 billion Canada millennium scholarship foundation, but 
the funds are not to be disbursed until the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians get little in the way of direction or assistance from 
the government for the years 1998 and 1999.  Finally, in the year 
2000 the millennium fund kicks in.  Who benefits?  In 1996 there 
were 1.7 million students.  The millennium fund will only help 2% 
a year with $5,000 grants.  It will not necessarily help the 
needy.  It will often aid those who already have sufficient means 
to fund their education.  It only helps those who are continuing 
their education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Millions of our youth do not have the interest, background or 
qualifications to gain the opportunity of this fund.  It will be 
limited to a few.  It will do nothing for those who do not go to 
our universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently attended a forum put on by street youth, just some of 
those who will not be eligible for the Prime Minister's 
millennium fund.  At this forum there was a great deal of soul 
searching and relating of tragic stories: abusive homes, alcohol, 
drugs, hopelessness, cynicism.  Name it and it was there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These kids are a major component of our next generation and 
society is doing very little for them.  They have been forgotten 
by the budget.  Indeed, they appear to have been forgotten by 
those who loudly profess to care for them.  Even though there 
were about 150 young people attending the session, there was not 
one Liberal or NDP member of this place to be found, even though 
the gathering took place in downtown Vancouver, their 
constituencies, miles away from my own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After cutting billions of dollars from transfer payments the 
government appears to think that our next generation's problems 
are to be handled by the provinces and territories.  The 
government attempts to characterize any critics of the Prime 
Minister's memorial fund as being anti-education.  They say the 
fund is all about a stronger future for our young people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Actually this government is more concerned with creating a 
personal political memorial for the Prime Minister than it is 
with assisting our youth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Reform Party and the vast majority of Canadians argue 
for debt and tax relief measures to stimulate our economy this 
government plays with the books to conceal any surplus.  It says 
it will look at debt and tax relief once the surplus surfaces, 
but can and will that ever happen if the minister has free rein 
over his bookkeeping practices? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of a millennium fund for students the Liberals have 
provided a millennium burden for taxpayers.  By the year 2000 
Canadians will be paying over $173 billion per year in taxes. 
That is $155 billion in total budget revenues plus another $18 
billion in Canada pension plan taxes.  This works out to $48 
billion more and is equivalent to about $5,000 per year higher 
for the average family than when the Liberals were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may be a coincidence, but the $5,000 figure arises here as 
well; $5,000 more per year for the average taxpayer and $5,000 
per year for 2% of our students who will be fortunate enough to 
obtain the millennium funds.  This government has made a 
unilateral decision to tax the Canadian family of four and give 
those tax funds to a minuscule proportion of our youth.  This 
government is not being overly compassionate or considerate 
toward youth—

government is not being overly compassionate or considerate 
toward youth.  It is merely taking from the family to create a 
memorial for the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now move on to a couple of areas of concern to my 
constituents.  This government promised to spend $30 million on 
crime prevention.  It has been having difficulty even maintaining 
the status quo.  In my community the officer in charge of the 
Surrey RCMP detachment has lost a number of his more experienced 
officers to other police forces and other agencies.  Why? 
Because it took until last Friday for this government to finally 
provide a pay raise so that these officers could feed and clothe 
their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government was more concerned with looking after government 
executives than it was with those who were in more dire financial 
straits.  Now that it has finally brought in the pay raise it 
may well be too late and may not be enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of keeping its commitment to maintain the salaries of 
its national police force in line with the average salary of the 
major municipal forces, this government has merely thrown them a 
bone.  There is little meat involved.  Many other officers from 
my community may be forced to move onto greener pastures.  It is 
unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has so much difficulty with its priorities that 
it fails to properly look after those who toil to preserve the 
peace in our communities, our police officers.  The former 
minister of justice and the former solicitor general were 
promising $30 million for crime prevention all the way back to 
1996, but little has been seen.  When it comes it will again 
likely be for a political purpose rather than being in the best 
interest of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will provide another example of the dreadful mismanagement of 
this government.  It is all hoopla and little action.  The former 
solicitor general was quite proud of the RCMP for introducing its 
violent crime linkage analysis system, or ViCLAS, a project to 
monitor and solve crimes of a serial nature.  It has been said 
that if the system had been properly used during the Paul 
Bernardo and Karla Homolka investigation the murders of Kristen 
French and Leslie Mahaffy may never have occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guess what?  The province of Ontario has learned its lesson.  It 
has managed to allocate sufficient but scarce resources to 
properly fund ViCLAS through the operations of the Ontario 
Provincial Police.  But where is the federal government with the 
RCMP?  I have been led to understand that the RCMP ViCLAS project 
is now under severe threat because this government has not found 
or made available the necessary resources to properly fund this 
worthwhile and world-recognized program.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine, the RCMP is forced to fly the Prime Minister to the ski 
hills but the government does not have enough money to fund one 
of the world's most advanced technological crime fighting tools. 
As with most things, this government is more concerned with 
trumpeting and taking credit for the program.  It is not 
interested in providing the funds to operate it efficiently or 
effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that thought I will end my comments on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I believe the

great interest that I rise in this House today to speak on Bill 
C-36 introduced by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have followed the whole debate on this extremely controversial 
bill with great interest. After reading the remarks made by a 
number of members, I was shocked to see those few colleagues from 
Quebec that sit across the way speak out in support of certain 
parts of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While representing the people of their ridings in Quebec, they 
support the Canada millennium scholarship foundation proposed by 
a Prime Minister seeking visibility. 
This is happening despite the obvious consensus of the Quebec 
coalition, which was reiterated by the Premier of Quebec in a 
press conference. I just cannot get over it. This seems to 
indicate a serious lack of consistency between what Liberal 
members from Quebec say in Ottawa and what the Liberal wing is 
saying in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its last budget, the federal government announced that $2.5 
billion had been earmarked for education and that he wanted to 
invest it in a new program, the millennium scholarships program, 
which, I remind the House, will not provide any relief to the 
existing education system, after cuts totalling $3 billion in 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It claims to be putting the fiscal dividend, that is, the budget 
surplus, to work by investing in education, skills development, 
assistance for low income families with children and health 
care, through the Canadian opportunities strategy. A better name 
for this strategy would be Canadian government visibility 
strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance cut federal transfers to the provinces 
for social assistance, post-secondary education and health as part 
of the joint effort to put its fiscal house in order. But I would 
point out that 52% of the results were due to the sacrifices the 
provinces have had to make. Now that this goal has been reached, 
the Liberal government wants to act alone and spend budget 
surpluses instead of making up for the harm done by cutting 
transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During yesterday's meeting between the Premier of Quebec, his 
education minister, the Prime Minister of Canada and his 
Minister of Human Resources Development, the two governments 
agreed to establish a negotiating framework for the infamous 
millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec already has its own scholarship program and post-secondary 
education priorities.  The two levels of government agree that 
there should be no duplication of programs and that Quebec's 
jurisdiction and priorities in the education sector should be 
respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, however, that the government opposite wants to 
celebrate the millennium by making a significant contribution to 
knowledge through millennium scholarships awarded to students 
over a ten-year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec coalition representing several organizations does not, 
however, have the same vision of what is needed to provide real 
assistance to students. 
At a press conference yesterday, coalition president Bernard 
Shapiro, vice-chancellor of McGill University, said, and I quote 
“We feel that the bill in its present form contains no 
appropriate provision whereby Quebec could use the important 
resources allocated to the foundation in a broader manner, 
consistent with its priorities.  Members of the coalition, 
including Quebec students, believe that the resources set aside 
for the foundation would be better used within the existing 
structures and budgets of Quebec's education system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois support this view.  It is obvious that 
the student population, the faculty and many other individuals 
are in agreement with the Government of Quebec's position.  This 
is blatant interference in a provincial area of jurisdiction that 
all governments, since Jean Lesage's day, have ardently defended.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Education is the soul of a people, its very backbone.  It allows 
it to develop as a society, to understand its origins and its 
past, and to plan its future.  It is the cornerstone of any 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Quebec have chosen to invest in the future of our community 
and of our society with a system of education which responds to 
the true needs of its students.  We have made a choice as a 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, on the other hand, with all the cuts it 
has made since coming to power in 1993, has decided otherwise. 
Now, having seen its popularity with students dwindling away, it 
is implementing a new program which will get the flag of Canada 
onto its cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But students are no fools.  They know who cut $3 billion from 
education, and that provincial governments have had to make some 
difficult choices and will have to continue to do so, because 
cuts in federal transfers to the provinces for health and social 
programs will be in the order of $30 billion from now until the 
year 2003.  We have a social deficit and it is time that deficit 
was remedied before it is too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are asking the federal government, given that Quebec has 
exclusive jurisdiction over education, to exclude Quebec from 
the millennium scholarship program, but with fair and full 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are using this battle against the deficit as a 
pretext to continue privatizating the Canadian economy and are 
now setting their sights on education. 
This private foundation, to be established under Bill C-36, will 
allow the companies funding it to decide, in a certain way, 
which students deserve financial assistance.  Will they make 
their choice according to the field of study that responds to 
their needs or the general needs of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the real budget for research and development of $310 
million and not $400 million over three years?  That will enable 
the granting councils to keep their heads above water, but not to 
expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not forget that we are at the bottom of the list of G-7 
countries in terms of research and development, and nothing 
indicates things will improve in the future.  How can we compete 
with rival countries?  How will we keep our brains?  How will we 
interest our young people in post-secondary education?  This 
budget provides no reassurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another failing of the budget is the fact that the Minister of 
Finance said not a single word about agriculture.  However, 
there are a lot of problems, which we will be coming back to in 
the House.  Barely 16 lines in 275 pages are devoted to Canada's 
rural regions.  The only reference is to the minister's having 
given the Farm Credit Corporation more money last year.  The only 
major expenditure in this regard is $20 million over five years 
and among a number of departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1991, the Liberal government has cut the agriculture and 
agri-food budget by $4 billion, and this year's budget contained 
other cuts.  There is a lot to be said in this regard, and we 
will come back to it in the coming months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out there are several failings in Bill C-36, but my 
colleagues will surely return to other very important aspects of 
the latest budget of the Minister of Finance. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-36, the budget implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget of 1998 represented a major shift in the fiscal 
fortunes of the Government of Canada.  It has taken 15 years of 
fiscal planning to achieve this balanced budget as the Leader of 
the Opposition mentioned previously in the House.  Policies 
including free trade, the GST, deregulation of financial 
services, transportation and energy, all implemented by the 
previous government, were necessary and appropriate.  They 
provided the framework and the basis upon which this government 
was able to balance the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make it clear.  The real heroes today are not 
politicians, or certainly not the members on the government side. 
The real heroes are ordinary taxpaying Canadians who have had the 
budget balanced on their backs and who endure the highest taxes 
in the G-7 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this budget the Liberals have gone from being a tax and cut 
government to now being a tax and spend government.  This should 
not be surprising because this was the government that led us 
down the path of debts and deficits beginning with former Prime 
Minister Trudeau in the early 1970s.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The biggest single spending initiative in this budget is the 
millennium scholarship fund.  Canadian taxpayers are contributing 
$2.5 billion of their money to a bursary fund that will not be 
delivered to students for three years. Even then it will only 
benefit 7% of students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What seems to be lost on the government is who in fact is 
making the program possible. It is ordinary taxpayers.  It is not 
the Prime Minister.  It is not the finance minister.  It is 
ordinary Canadians who as I have said have paid the highest taxes 
of any of the G-7 countries.  They have seen their income taxes 
as a percentage of GDP rise from 13% in 1993 to 14% now. Keep in 
mind that the previous government reduced income taxes as a 
percentage of GDP from 14% to 13% between 1989 and 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the Minister of Finance is retroactively allocating $2.5 
billion from last year's budget to this program, an act that the 
auditor general has spoken against.  The Minister of Finance has 
taken responsibilities away from the auditor general, the 
watchdog of the Canadian taxpayers in this House and provided 
them to the board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I recently asked the Minister of Finance in question period 
to provide the auditor general with access to the fund's books, 
he responded that if the auditor general would like to have 
access to those books, it will be arranged. The auditor general 
does want access to those books, yet nowhere in this legislation 
is their a clause giving the auditor general the access he needs 
to oversee the taxpayers' money. The departmental officials I met 
with last week confirmed that despite the minister's reassurances 
to the contrary in this House, the auditor general in fact will 
not have access to the fund's books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This represents the second time in two years that the Minister 
of Finance has set up an at arm's length foundation with a 
significant amount of taxpayers' money and appointed a separate 
auditor.  The last time was the innovation fund, $800 million to 
be allocated to medical centres, universities and research 
laboratories.  Now $2.5 billion will be administered without a 
clear and transparent auditing practice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the legislation the board for the millennium scholarship fund 
will appoint its own auditor.  This is contrary to common 
business practices where the shareholders appoint an auditor, not 
simply the management. In this case the shareholders are ordinary 
Canadians who are represented by this government. That is why 
this departure and this lack of accountability in practice is 
very dangerous.  It is also why the auditor general should be 
involved in overseeing such a huge allocation of Canadian 
taxpayers' funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the government or the minister not appoint an auditor 
themselves?  Instead it is going to be the board that appoints 
its own auditor.  It may be an arm's length corporation but I 
would suggest that the arms are very short when the government is 
going to be appointing a significant number of the members of the 
board.  The accountability is certainly not provided to ordinary 
Canadians who are footing the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the millennium foundation in this legislation 
there is a significant lack of clarity surrounding the criteria 
of need and merit.  It is stated very nebulously that the 
criteria is based on need and merit.  No further direction has 
been given to the board on this criteria.  Depending on the 
make-up of the board, the need or merit criteria could vacillate 
from one end of the spectrum to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that there are many young Canadians who need 
a higher education.  The need component for the millennium 
scholarship fund may be more appropriate than simply the merit 
component. There needs to be some type of guarantee that young 
Canadians who do not have the financial means to achieve a higher 
education are provided with a higher education.  Keep in mind 
that 7% of Canadians seeking higher education will benefit.  Only 
7%.  To have it nebulously stated as it is, is inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly students who demonstrate the merit frequently earn 
scholarships to higher education institutions.  They can 
participate in a higher education without the need for some 
gigantic memorial fund to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be remembered that the Canadians taxpayers who are 
footing the bill for this deserve and have now lost the ability 
to oversee the funds with this government's reticence to use the 
auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second point of Bill C-36 which is worth noting today is the 
changes to the RESP program. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><I>Investor's Digest</I> recently ran an article stating that the 
changes to the RESP policies will simply serve to complicate the 
current program.  I quote “The problem with the RESPs is that 
they are already too complicated for most investors.  The new 
grants will create more confusion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do town hall meetings in my riding. Often we talk about tax 
policy.  I have not had one constituent ask me to complicate the 
tax code. I have heard a lot of them say that the Canadian tax 
code is not user friendly and that it is inappropriate that 
citizens have to hire accountants to deal with their own 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the government do to address a crisis in higher 
education funding?  It complicates the tax code. This proposal 
serves to complicate a tax code that is already far too 
complicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give one example of the potential for abuse, there is a 20% 
top-up for individuals investing in an RESP, a matching where the 
government will effectively provide grants to those who invest in 
RESPs. It is a worthy intention to help provide and augment 
Canadians' savings for the higher education of their children. 
However we must always be wary of the first law of public policy, 
which is the law of unintended consequences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with departmental officials last week.  Nobody has 
explained to me why this 20% top-up will provide Canadians with a 
20% grant if they invest in an RESP. If, 20, 18 or 15 years down 
the road, the beneficiary of the program chooses not to go to 
university or to pursue a higher education for whatever reason, 
the government will at that point be getting that grant back. The 
money earned on that grant over that period of time will be left 
with the individual, the contributor, the Canadian investor. This 
creates a direct incentive to invest in RESPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recognizing that there is only a limited pool of funds out there 
for Canadians to invest with, it creates a direct disincentive to 
invest in RRSPs.  The government is effectively providing a 20% 
top-up for Canadians to invest in one investment vehicle and a 
similar disincentive to invest in the other, the RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By creating a policy like this, we will create a policy that 
will ultimately create financial insecurity for Canadians in 
terms of their retirement accounts.  It will create a crisis down 
the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No attempt will be made to recover the earnings from the 20% 
top-up.  The fact is it would be almost impossible logistically 
to do this.  Again this is going to create a decrease in the 
incentive to invest in RRSPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at another example of this government's propensity 
to tinker with economics as opposed to providing broad based tax 
relief, which was the appropriate measure that should have been 
taken at this juncture.  Let us look at the EI fund and the 
employment insurance holiday for employers hiring young 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party has repeatedly called for the government to reduce EI 
premiums to $2 from the current rate of $2.70.  We outlined our 
position in our plan for growth, which was our prebudget 
submission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has stated categorically time and time 
again that EI premium reductions will not create jobs, will not 
lead to increased job creation in Canada. I heard the minister 
speak recently to the board of trade in Halifax.  He stated that 
reducing EI premiums would not lead to greater job growth. Today 
the minister's agenda has obviously changed.  Why would he 
eliminate EI premiums for young people if he did not feel that 
the reduction or the elimination of those EI premiums would lead 
to increased job creation for young people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody wants young people to have greater opportunities to 
seek employment in Canada.  But we want all Canadians to benefit 
from reduced payroll taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have established that the minister cannot have it both ways. 
Effectively he is articulating that reducing payroll taxes will 
not have an impact on employment growth.  Yet he is implementing 
policies where effectively that is what he is doing for that 
intent. Effectively he is playing one group against another. 
Certainly young Canadians between the ages of 18 to 33 need a 
break.  But through this employment eugenics policy or this 
Pavlovian economics policy, he is creating a direct disincentive 
for Canadian businesses to hire other Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it is an example of a government that prefers to make 
decisions for Canadians as opposed to ordinary Canadians, who 
deserved broad based tax relief in this budget, to make their own 
decisions as to what to do with their fiscal dividend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While this government now brags about being in the black, many 
Canadians are still in the red because of its reticence to 
change fiscal policy for the better.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity again to stand today to support the 
official opposition's proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring the amendment to everyone's attention again by reading 
it because I think it is quite appropriate in the way this debate 
has been shaped and in the way the Minister of Finance has 
structured his budget in an effort to hide the truth and in 
effect impact negatively on the taxpayer who actually funds this 
hidden contingency fund that the minister has so carefully 
deferred to the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the proposed amendment by the official opposition: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>this House declines to give second reading to Bill C-36, an act 
to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 24, 1998, since the principle of the bill, 
while charging the consolidated revenue fund to establish and 
fund the Canada millennium scholarship foundation, fails to 
guarantee that appropriate and objective accounting standards 
will be followed as advocated by the auditor general. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that the auditor general has warned this 
government time and time again about its actions.  Even when it 
comes to some of the chief proposals, it seems like his warnings 
continually fall on deaf ears.  This is not a very good example 
for the people in this country who are footing the bill and 
paying hard earned tax dollars to see it squandered by the 
Liberal government in such ways that are inappropriate and 
despicable for the most part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another example of government manipulating the system in a 
cynical attempt to fool the taxpayer into thinking the government 
is being productive.  In this case we are talking about the $2.5 
billion that would have gone to debt reduction and tax relief. We 
owe tax relief to the taxpayer.  This is what should have 
happened with the $2.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the government doing?  It is just playing a shell game 
with the books and are becoming experts at it.  It should be held 
accountable for it.  Instead of translating a surplus into lower 
taxes for Canadians, the government is pretending that the 
surplus does not exist.  Instead of reducing the massive national 
debt standing at close to $600 billion, the government buries its 
head in the sand and pretends that there is no problem and tells 
taxpayers there is no problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time this government has tried to pull a 
fast one with the books.  As the previous speaker pointed out, 
last year the government was criticized for allocating the cost 
of the Canadian Foundation for Innovation of $800 million a year 
before the foundation was created.  It was all deferred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the government gave a $1 billion payout to the Atlantic 
provinces as an incentive to harmonize the GST in that region. 
Once again, this happened a year in advance of the payout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking through other portions of that act and at the 
proposed changes by the government to Bill C-36.  It sure likes 
to defer things to the future.  I think the small business 
community, the engine of our economy, should be paying particular 
attention to something in the bill which deals with employment 
insurance and premium holidays.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years 1999 and 2000, employers who hire young people 
between the ages of 18 and 24 will pay no EI premiums on their 
wages.  If EI premiums remain stable this will save employers up 
to $3.78 per $100 in earnings, a measure that will cost about 
$100 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is this?  They are deferring it to the year 1999, 
another deferred promise that will not take effect until the next 
year.  It gives the view that the Liberals are doing a great big favour 
to employers by bringing this change into the act. 
What is so great about it?  Right now there is about a $13.5 
billion surplus in the EI account.  By March of next year that 
will have grown to $19.6 billion.  Whose money is that sitting 
there?  It is the taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government were truly interested in helping employers, in 
pushing this economy along even more, it would give that tax 
relief directly to the employers, it would place it back into the 
hands of the employers and employees by an across the board EI 
reduction in premiums.  Then it would benefit someone.  Right now 
who is it benefiting?  It is sitting in an account.  It is the 
taxpayers' dollars.  All could be part of a relief plan or a 
benefit to the employer in expanding his business.  Anything is 
better than being in the hands of this government or a 
bureaucrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general has complained about each of these cases. 
What is the government's response to the auditor general's 
complaints?  It had the gall to threaten him.  The deputy finance 
minister fired off a letter to the auditor general telling him to 
mind his own business.  If that is not a shameful act, I do know 
what us.  The auditor general is hired to do a job and what 
happens?  The government threatens him for doing it.  In reply to 
the auditor general the government said that it could change the 
rules if it liked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general pointed out that if the government gets away 
with this it will open the door to future governments simply 
allocating expenditures from year to year regardless of when the 
expenses occur.  In other words, Liberal habits have become 
almost institutionalized.  Taxpayers spend an awful lot of their 
hard earned money on the federal government.  They deserve to be 
able to look at the books knowing that the government is being 
above board in return.  There is something unethical about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the real reason for the finance minister to continue 
the Liberal tradition of bending the accounting rules.  He wants 
to be able to keep a tight control on the fiscal reins so that he 
can better position himself to become the Liberal leader.  I 
guess that is the ultimate agenda.  He wants to become the 
leader.  After all, what better way of winning support than 
giving taxpayers a tax break just before a leadership bid.  Is 
that the plan of the finance minister and the Liberal government? 
There are personal agendas here.  I do not think they are 
acceptable to most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the finance minister a bit of strategic 
advice for free.  If he did the responsible thing now, pay down 
the debt and deliver tax relief today, he would find that his 
popularity would increase immediately.  Probably his chances for 
leadership would be better.  Everyone would rally behind him in 
much more substantive way and with good reason.  Is that not good 
advice?  The members across the way do not agree with that. They 
want to see more of the same.  Best of all, his popularity would 
be earned legitimately. 
Imagine that, a Liberal finance minister who became popular by 
being straightforward and honest with Canadians about their tax 
dollars.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to take part in the debate on Bill C-36, the Budget 
Implementation Act, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be addressing part I of the bill in particular, which 
deals with the millennium scholarships, a project which everyone 
knows is very dear to the heart of the Prime Minister and member 
for Saint-Maurice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know these scholarships will come from a special fund of $2.5 
billion, to be administered by a private foundation, starting 
with the year 2000 and running for 10 years. 
Some observers wonder, moreover, what is going to happen after 
that.  If there is a need, why should the federal government not 
be responsible for it always? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is already one somewhat foolish aspect of this project, 
which has just popped up out of the blue, or perhaps out of the 
head of our Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you know, there is a hue and a cry in Quebec at the present 
time, and just about everyone is against this federal government 
project, from stakeholders in education at the kindergarten 
level right up to university presidents. This of course includes 
students and teachers via the CEQ and the Association étudiante 
du Québec.  It should be pointed out, as well, that this 
coalition is being headed, most courageously, by President 
Shapiro of McGill University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, as I have said, this plan by the federal government is 
raising a great deal of opposition in Quebec. 
One of the best illustrations of this is a real gem written by 
Lysiane Gagnon on Thursday, February 26, in <I>La Presse</I>. Given her 
political opinions in general, Mrs. Gagnon is displaying 
remarkably clear thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The article is entitled “A demagogic and provocative project”, 
and includes the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Future generations will find no better illustration of the reign 
of the current Liberal Prime Minister than these millennium 
scholarships: the perfect example of a superficial and demagogic 
policy, of window dressing that does nothing at all about the 
real problems and that may even create a few new ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These scholarships will swallow up money that should have been 
put towards improving the school system, and they will contribute 
to the further deterioration of relations, if they can possible 
get any worse, between Quebec City and Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it pure 
coincidence or skilfully organized provocation? Hard to say. But 
one is stunned by this unbelievable federal intrusion in 
education. 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—The decent thing would have been to substantially increase 
provincial transfer payments, now that Ottawa has put its fiscal 
house in order. This would not have been a question of 
generosity, but rather repayment of a blatant debt. But there was 
the vanity of the Prime Minister, who wants his name associated 
with some sort of government handout, not to mention the 
deep-seated need of any government for maximum visibility. A 
direct gift to taxpayers brings in more votes than turning money 
over to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>—Three years of budget cuts have left the universities in 
deep financial trouble, with the result that the quality of 
teaching and research is deteriorating. 
</UL></UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And Ms. Gagnon goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point attracting more students on campus, if it is 
to give them an inadequate education and devalued diplomas?—If 
the Prime Minister was even remotely sincere in his wish to 
stimulate education, he would have provided assistance to 
schools, through the responsible governments. But obviously, when 
it comes to votes, it is more productive to distribute maple-leaf 
bearing cheques to post-secondary students—all the more so 
because they, unlike primary school students, have the right to 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarships will be grafted, God knows how, onto 
an already existing grant system. 
Either they will based on different criteria, and this will 
thwart provincial policies, or they will be based on the same 
criteria used for existing scholarships, and this will be a 
patent case of duplication of services. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is probably in light of this that, yesterday, the Premier of 
Quebec made a proposal to his federal counterpart. The 
management of Canada being what it is, if Canadians ever want to 
have access to these scholarships—although we have doubts about 
the federal government's attitude—the government simply has to 
reach an agreement with the English speaking provinces concerned, 
as there is no grant program elsewhere in Canada. In Quebec, we 
have a loans and grants system. Such an agreement could meet 
identified needs and suit provincial governments. 
It is up to the federal government to come to an agreement with 
these provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As usual, it is different in Quebec, where we have a very well 
organized grants and loans system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the spirit in which, when they met yesterday, the 
Premier of Quebec, with the coalition I referred to earlier 
firmly behind him on this, gave the Prime Minister of Canada an 
amendment to be included in this bill as clause 46.1. Let me read 
it for the record. It concerns the right to opt out with 
compensation, which would be totally legitimate, appropriate and 
proper for the Canadian government to give the Quebec government 
in this context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under an agreement between the Lesage and Pearson governments, 
Quebec has had the right to opt out of loans programs since 
1964, because the Canadian government is not involved with 
bursaries. If it now wants to get involved, why not include, in 
the same spirit, this opting out with compensation clause? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read this amendment, which we endorse and which would be 
added as clause 46.1. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>46.1. When a province has established and administers a financial 
assistance program for students to ensure equal opportunities 
regarding post-secondary education, the ministers shall, at the 
province's request, conduct negotiations with this province to 
come to an agreement with respect to the fair compensation it 
should be paid in lieu of the foundation's activities in the 
province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this would settle the matter. This is full of wisdom, as 
the Quebec government has often been these past few years, 
especially since 1994. 
I think it might meet both the needs of Canada, if these are 
indeed—which is questionable—needs expressed by the education 
community and the public, and those of the Quebec government and 
National Assembly in terms of use of funds and transfers. It is 
important to know that the coalition has the support of the 
Liberal Party as well as that of the public, including students. 
This would improve the grants and loans situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it would be the wise thing to do, in 
addition to being in keeping with the underpinnings of the 
Canadian Constitution, where it is clearly and plainly stated 
that education is under provincial jurisdiction. That is what we 
are asking for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
the education critic for the NDP I am very pleased to speak in 
the House to Bill C-36, an act to amend certain provisions of the 
budget tabled on February 24. 
I would like to focus my comments on the budget and how it 
impacts or whether it alleviates the crisis facing post-secondary 
education in Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund illustrates very well the government's 
failure to recognize the crisis facing post-secondary education. 
If we talk to students and to student organizations like the 
Canadian Federation of Students, which has done a lot of analysis 
and evaluation of what is the reality and the situation facing 
students today, we find out that the average debt for students 
graduating this spring will be $25,000.  In fact, worse than 
that, approximately 130,000 student loans are in default. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There have been reports of a 700% increase in student loan 
bankruptcies from 1989 to 1997.  What is a very shocking fact and 
statistic is that now 25% of all bankruptcies are as a result of 
student loans in 1997.  This means that at the end of 1997 there 
was something like 37,000 bankrupt graduates.  This is a very 
dismal state of affairs.  It illustrates very graphically the 
crisis facing post-secondary education where student are 
graduating into poverty and where more and more students are 
declaring bankruptcy.  In the recent budget the number of 
graduate bankruptcies was projected to be 216,000 by the year 
2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal members and the government have stated that the new 
budget, the showpiece of which was the millennium fund in 
education, is something that will address this crisis.  Many 
members in the oppositions parties and in my party have exposed 
the fact that the millennium fund would not even come close to 
compensating for the years of cuts that have taken place in 
post-secondary education as a result of policies of the Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium fund will provide a fund in the budget of $2.5 
billion.  That sounds like a lot of money, but the fund will not 
even begin until the year 2000, which means that students will 
still be left with virtually no help or resources until the year 
2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in the year 2000 when this fund begins we will be looking 
at a contribution from the fund of $250 million per year over a 
10 year period.  When this is put in the context of the funds 
that have been taken out of post-secondary education by the 
federal government, the real picture begins to emerge.  By the 
time the fund starts in the year 2000 we will have lost over $3 
billion from post-secondary education as a result of federal 
government policies and cutting back on education and transfers 
to provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very serious situation caused by the Liberal government 
that is now offering, with all the spin, rhetoric and talk about 
the legacy for the year 2000, the millennium fund.  When the 
surface of that fund is scratched and examined we see that it 
offers very little assistance to students.  It will only help an 
estimated 7% of students.  It will provide—we are not sure 
whether it will be grants or scholarships—assistance to only 
about 7% of students who are actually in need.  That puts the 
picture in perspective as to whether or not the millennium fund 
will actually address the needs before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another very troubling factor about the millennium fund is that 
it takes us down the slippery slope toward privatization and the 
corporatization of post-secondary education. A lot of concern has 
been expressed by student organizations and by people in the 
educational field.  Certainly the research we have done in the 
NDP suggests the course of action the government chose in setting 
up the fund was to set up in effect a private foundation.  There 
was a named chair representing a very large corporate interest in 
Canada.  This does not bode well for the future of post-secondary 
education.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very important to the country is the notion and the principle of 
publicly funded post-secondary education.  What we will see with 
the millennium fund is a private board being set up that will 
have the ability to set criteria as to how grants or scholarships 
will be administered, taking it out of the public realm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario a lot of concern has been expressed about ongoing 
privatization.  At the University of Toronto a fund to assist 
students in need was turned into a scholarship fund after the 
intervention of the president of the Bank of Montreal who sits on 
the board of governors.  There are the same kinds of concern 
about the millennium fund because of the uncertainty about who 
will qualify for assistance or the level of assistance, whether 
it is a scholarship program and whether or not there will be 
creeping corporate influence in terms of setting criteria as to 
who will receive scholarships or loans.  We have not yet received 
information from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are very disturbing facts about the millennium fund.  The 
first is the lack of real financial support it will provide, 
given the level of cutbacks that we have had.  The second is the 
fact that it is taking us down a road of privatization and 
corporatization of post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue I would deal with around the millennium fund has 
to do with how it was set up.  We heard in the House yesterday 
concerns expressed about the situation in Quebec.  I understand 
the concerns that have been put forward by members of the Bloc 
Quebecois about the lack of consultation around the establishment 
of the millennium fund.  However, let us be very clear.  It was 
not just Quebec that was left out of the picture. It was all 
other provinces as well that are still waiting for a phone call 
from the Prime Minister or someone representing the government to 
inform them about what their role will be in the millennium fund 
and in setting up the criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is another indication of unilateral action being taken by the 
federal government.  I would like to ask government members 
whether or not they think this is their new kind of federalism: 
unilateral action and no consultation with provincial government 
even though post-secondary education is a provincial jurisdiction 
and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the NDP think this is an absolutely incorrect way to go 
about implementing the millennium fund.  We believe there should 
be co-operation and discussion involving the setting up of a 
national grants program using the funds from the millennium fund 
as the beginning of a national grants program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point I will make is that one of the things that was 
discovered in the budget was that buried in some of the 
background material were plans to change the bankruptcy laws.  It 
was a most cynical ploy by the government. On the one hand we 
were told that the budget would help students, that the 
millennium fund would help students.  On the other hand the 
finance minister was very quietly laying plans to change the 
bankruptcy laws which will make it much more difficult for 
students to file for bankruptcy and will extend the deadline from 
two years to ten years.  This is a most cynical ploy by the 
federal government and illustrates why the millennium fund will 
not do what needs to be done in terms of providing federal 
funding for post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by saying that there is growing opposition 
and concern about the fund as people begin to realize that it is 
not doing what it is purported to do by the government.  There 
has simply been a lot of political rhetoric about the fund, but 
the stark reality is that it will not help the students in need 
in Canada today.

am pleased to be able to speak to Bill C-36 and the Reform

is what Reformers have been calling for, for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to make it perfectly clear that we have reservations 
with respect to the budget.  One of the first and most important 
is the provision of the millennium scholarship fund. 
We have been advocating for years that there needs to be greater 
funding for post-secondary education.  We were advocating putting 
money back into the CHST during the 1993 election.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The big problem is that the auditor general has found the 
government to be distorting the financial statements to make 
itself look good in this House and elsewhere.  The auditor 
general gave an interview in which he said  “You cannot record 
something just because you announce the intention of doing 
something.  There is a difference between an expenditure and a 
future commitment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have in this country families who intend to have children, 
but an intention expressed does not mean they qualify for the 
child tax benefit.  The day the government is willing to hand out 
a benefit based on an intention will be the day when it would be 
within its purview to announce an intention and have it show up 
in a budget as if it had been an expenditure. We just do not 
accept that at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also find that while the budget is balanced it has been 
balanced by increasing expenditures.  It is no secret that 
interest rates in Canada came down not as a result of government 
actions but as a result of a worldwide phenomenon.  The 
government has certainly garnered the benefit from that. However, 
it is not as a result of its doings.  The government's reductions 
in direct program spending amount to 5.3% and it has increased 
the amount it has taken from taxpayers by 71%.  We are not giving 
the government any kudos for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also find that the government is refusing to reindex to 
inflation the personal income tax system.  It had an opportunity 
to do that in this budget, but it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, Canada pension plan payments will be increasing year in 
and year out.  From our research it appears that by the year 
2000-2001 there will be roughly $9,000 more in net tax burden for 
Canadians.  I do not think there is anybody in this House or 
anybody in this country who thinks they will be that much better 
off in 2000-2001 to be able to carry that extra tax load. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to leave this House with a couple of word pictures 
because they say a picture is worth a thousand words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the cold war there was a policy called MAD.  It was an 
acronym for mutually assured destruction.  It was an assurance 
that no one would survive in the event of a nuclear war. 
Everybody would lose and nobody would win.  I would like to 
propose a new meaning for that acronym, which is that Canada has 
the mother of all debt in this country at this time.  Our debt is 
$576 billion.  It has been said a lot of times in this House and 
it has been said a lot of times across Canada, but not everybody 
knows it yet, so it certainly is not lost on Canadians to say it 
one more time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that Canadians have not been completely apprised of the 
debt they have.  I just spoke in a high school in my riding and 
unfortunately some of the young people there did not know it. 
When they heard how much it was and how much they personally are 
inheriting from previous as well as present governments they were 
not one bit happy.  MAD describes their state of mind as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are definitely opposed to the continuation of spending and 
taxing and the maintenance of a debt which we do not have to have 
in this country.  There would have been a balance left over this 
year if it had not been spent.  We would like to see that go back 
to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking that nuclear bomb illustration a little further, what is 
the fallout from a debt bomb?  We have the highest taxes in the 
G-7.  Bracket creep erodes every person's income in this country. 
The danger of overspending is that there will be a slight rise in 
interest rates and all of a sudden we will be back into deficit 
spending.  Nobody wants that, particularly the young people of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have high unemployment and low wages.  Wages can only get 
lower as the cost of doing business goes up with the taxes that 
are locked in by this budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are mad.  They wanted tax relief, they expected tax 
relief, but they did not get tax relief.  They are upset that the 
debt will not decrease this year.  They did not want a millennium 
fund to polish the Prime Minister's image.  What they wanted was 
real tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another illustration from the cold war.  There was a 
movie called “Dr. Strangelove”.  I cannot quite recall its 
subtitle, but it went something along these lines:  “How I 
overcame my fear and learned to love the bomb”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a debt bomb in this country.  We have a Prime Minister 
and a finance minister who have overcome their fear of the debt 
bomb.  They have learned to love it.  They want to pass it on to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of that movie the mad scientist, sitting astride his 
bomb, was having the ride of his life.  I believe that is an 
accurate description of our government today.  It is astride the 
debt bomb, it loves it and it wishes everyone could be aboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want off.  They do not want to ride this to its 
obvious conclusion.  At the end of the movie we did not see what 
happened to Dr. Strangelove, but we know what the end will be if 
we do not get our debt under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not want debt in this country.  We do not want higher 
spending.  We do not want taxes.  What we want and what the 
Reform Party is calling for is responsible government.  We oppose 
Bill C-36.  I oppose it on behalf of my constituents. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-36, which 
we are addressing today, deals with the implementation of certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 24, 
1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate will provide me with an opportunity to raise, and to 
criticize for the most part, certain political choices made by 
the Minister of Finance, as well as to draw attention to 
everything he has not done and to the Bloc Quebecois' fiscal 
proposals he has not followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is boasting that he has managed to put 
public finances back on a sounder footing. I wish to speak out 
against what the Liberal government has done to attain that 
goal, and also what it has not dared to do. 
In order to attain its goals, it cut transfers to the provinces 
along with employment insurance benefits and failed to index the 
tax tables. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transfers to the provinces were cut by $7.2 billion annually, 
which accounts for 52% of all the spending cuts the Liberal 
government made in 1994 and 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cutting employment insurance benefits means that people who lose 
their jobs are not as well protected since the reform, while the 
fund shows a surplus of billions of dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the government has not done is indexing the tax 
tables.  The Minister of Finance has taken advantage of the 
increase in revenues, in part as a result of not indexing the 
tax tables, GST credits and child tax benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is instructive to look at how the Minister of Finance has 
succeeded in putting his fiscal house in order, but it is 
particularly interesting to think about the choices the Liberal 
government has refused to make in order to attain those results. 
It has not made a serious attack against waste, respected its 
commitments, or really reformed the taxation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as an attack against waste is concerned, year after year 
the auditor general criticizes the spending of billions of 
dollars by the federal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for respecting his commitments, I should remind the House 
that, in 1995, the Minister of Finance promised a 19% reduction 
in his departments' spending over three years.  In fact, spending 
was reduced by only 11.5%, so the government could have cut 
another 7.5%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also asked for income tax reform and the Liberal government 
could have undertaken a review of corporate income tax to help 
job creation, and one of personal income tax to improve fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The suggestions made by the Bloc Quebecois were flatly rejected 
by the Liberal government, even though our finance critic did an 
extraordinary job in proposing concrete solutions to the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Liberals do when the first surpluses appeared? They 
could not keep themselves from doing what they have always done, 
which is to spend.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the Liberal government's contributions only 
accounted for 11.5% of the federal spending cuts, the Minister of 
Finance is making 51.4% of the new expenditures provided in the 
budget. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance have 
decided to reward themselves for eliminating the deficit, instead 
of rewarding those who actually did the work, namely the 
provinces, the poor and middle class families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Out of all the new Liberal expenditures, the $2.5 billion for 
the establishment of a millennium scholarship fund was the 
initiative most strongly criticized by the whole community. 
As we know, the Premier of Quebec is trying to solve the issue 
with the support of a coalition that includes a number of Quebec 
stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Premier of Quebec proposes that clause 46 be amended by 
inserting the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Withdrawal with compensation 
</I></B></P><P align=left>46.1 When a province has established and administers a financial 
assistance program for students to ensure equal opportunities 
regarding post-secondary education, the ministers shall, at the 
province's request, conduct negotiations with this province to 
come to an agreement with respect to the fair compensation it 
should be paid in lieu of the foundation's activities in the 
province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that negotiating with the federal government for fair 
compensation takes a lot of effort and energy, often with little 
likelihood of success.  In this case, we hope that the federal 
government will take some responsibility and that, for once, it 
will be able to come to an agreement with Quebec on the 
millennium scholarship program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They know that education is an area of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction.  For over 30 years, Quebec has had its own system 
of loans and scholarships.  All of Quebec's education 
stakeholders are opposed to the plan, because it does not meet 
Quebec's priorities in this area.  The only way to avoid 
duplication is to come around to Quebec's way of thinking.  We 
hope that the Prime Minister will grant Quebec's request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that the auditor general is critical of the 
government's spending practices. The foundation's funding has 
been included in the 1998-99 spending forecasts, although the 
money will actually be spent in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things we criticized about the budget had to do with 
the Minister of Finance's transparency.  We would have liked to 
see the actual figures, in the right columns, so that we could 
have had a real debate about the surpluses but, instead, this 
year's surpluses have been concealed by including spending that 
will take place in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau said that, if a 
government had such an excess of revenue and undertook to ensure 
the part of the common good that fell outside its jurisdiction, 
there arose the presumption that that government had taken more 
than its share of taxable capacity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec has said no to the millennium scholarships, and I hope its 
wishes will be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also employment insurance.  Those to whom the federal 
government owes a large debt include the unemployed, but the 
government has decided to ignore them.  The budget speech is 
clear:  the unemployed have no problem and the EI program will 
not be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bloc Quebecois members have introduced six private members' bills 
with suggestions for improving the employment insurance program. 
The federal government has accumulated $6 billion in savings in 
its fund.  We asked that the eligibility criteria be restored. 
In 1989, 83% of unemployed workers were eligible for EI.  This 
dropped to 43% in 1997.  The percentage has dropped steadily 
since 1990. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to analyze this phenomenon, which has gone on for eight 
years, the minister has just ordered his department to do a 
study, in co-operation with Statistics Canada. 
Meanwhile, the unemployed are losing out.  In committee, we 
moved that this clearly inadequate percentage be studied. 
We would have liked a report analyzing the effects of this new 
employment insurance policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government continues to amass the surpluses without paying 
out a cent more.  In 2000, the surplus will reach $25 billion. 
Premiums will not be lowered in 1999.  They will be reduced by a 
meagre 10 cents in 2000—not enough.  The Conseil du patronat 
was very clear on this point.  They wanted a substantial 
reduction in premium levels to permit the creation of jobs in 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only employment insurance premium holiday will be for 
employers hiring young people between 18 and 24 years of age in 
1999 and 2000. 
The measure applies to two years only.  It is shortsighted.  We 
would have liked the government to consider other clienteles 
strongly affected by the new employment insurance measures, 
especially those aged 45 or older, who often find themselves 
unemployed.  We know the focus of business is on young people 
with experience, those in their thirties, and that older people 
find themselves without work and the possibility of finding any. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also introduced anti-deficit legislation.  It would control 
government spending.  We deplore this government's refusal. 
This anti-deficit legislation may be found in five Canadian 
provinces, including Quebec, in 48 American states, in France and 
in New Zealand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were very disappointed at the policies proposed by the 
Minister of Finance in this budget. 
The Bloc would have advocated creating no new programs, 
reimbursing the provinces for the Canada social transfer, 
changing how the employment insurance plan is managed, 
implementing targeted tax cuts and passing anti-deficit 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have preferred the minister come to an understanding 
with the Bloc Quebecois.  A number of people have expressed 
their disappointment with the Minister of Finance's budget.  We 
would like the Minister of Finance in the future to accept some 
of our suggestions for lightening the tax burden of Canadians and 
Quebeckers. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on a point of order, I 
rise to ask for the unanimous consent of the House that the order 
for second reading of my Bill C-237, standing on the order of 
precedence, be discharged and the bill withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there consent that the hon. member 
withdraw the bill as indicated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to address Bill C-36, otherwise known as the 
Canadian millennium scholarship foundation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like everybody to realize one thing.  This scholarship 
supposedly is about education.  I have great difficulty in 
believing that.  I do not think this is about education at all. I 
believe that it is actually the Prime Minister using taxpayers' 
hard earned money in order to boost his own ego, so to speak. And 
just to add insult to injury, we have only to look at the 
announcement he made to appoint the chair of the foundation prior 
to this legislation's even being introduced to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That to me goes a long way in saying exactly what this is all 
about.  They have talked time and time again of the great effort 
they have put into addressing the budget in order to bring this 
new found money into the education fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Number one, it was not this government that balanced the budget. 
It was the Canadian taxpayers, the hard working taxpayers in 
Canada who sacrificed a lot to see this happen.  A lot of them 
suffered time lost from their families, something that money 
cannot compensate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the arrogance of this government when it says that it 
balanced the budget.  I question that.  It is just not so.  We 
look at what has happened in the last few years.  This used to be 
a society in which only one working person had to go out to make 
a decent living for the family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In most cases that is no longer possible.  Both parents now have 
to work in order to survive.  It is not for little extras.  No, 
it is to survive in this country which we say is so great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have become unpaid slaves to the government in many cases. We 
have accepted this because we were led for many years to believe 
the government was looking after us, that the government was 
taking care of the problems and we would not have to worry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gradually through the years taxation crept up.  The government 
said we have to do this in order to pay for this.  We bought 
that.  The government said it was good, it would benefit Canadian 
society.  We thought the government was very knowledgeable.  We 
agreed to work a little harder and to pay a little more in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along came another issue and the government sold us under the 
guise that it is good for society, that it will make us better, 
caring, sharing human beings.  We bought this and bought this and 
bought this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now Canadian taxpayers are waking up to one simple fact. 
Taxpayers definitely are caring and sharing human beings but this 
government lacks any of that sort of compassion. This government 
has become a tax addicted parasite on the taxpayers of this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were led to believe that if we worked hard we could 
contribute to our own type of special retirement plan, that if we 
were diligent and invested wisely we could retire early and in 
comfort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sad to say that in Canada this is just about no longer 
possible.  The harder someone works, the more they are taxed. The 
more they put away to retire, the faster the government figures 
out how to get in there just like that and take it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government takes it no longer with one hand but with both 
hands, from a person's bank account, their wallet and their 
wife's purse. It will even take from a child's inheritance in 
order to say it will help you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When someone asks for help from this government, they stand in a 
line.  They are lucky if, when they phone, there is anyone on the 
other end.  It often is a machine telling them to dial back later 
when it is not so busy.  That is the caring, sharing feeling of 
this lousy government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at this for one moment.  The government is 
saying it will give back $385 million in the scholarship fund. 
It slashed over $7 billion from education and health but it will 
give back $385 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is like cutting off a hand to save a finger and then saying 
we helped you, we fixed you, we made it better, aren't we nice 
people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That snow job no longer works in this country.  I think this 
budget came a bit early.  It should really have been introduced 
on April 1.  There is no doubt in my mind about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what is happening in the EI surplus.  We have 
mentioned time and time again what is happening here.  This 
government is taxing employers and employees into poverty. We now 
know that there is a $13.5 billion surplus in the EI program 
alone.  What does this government do?  It says it will give back 
a few pittance to the employer and the employee.  It tells us 
that because it raised it so high it can now cut back a bit and 
call it a tax cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is like an armed robber taking $100,000 out of a bank and 
giving back $10 in the hopes he will not be sentenced. He feels 
that by giving some back he is not altogether bad. That is not 
going to wash too long in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people are starting to wake up.  We have received phone call 
after phone call into all our offices.  I do not even believe 
there is a member across the way, although they may not like to 
admit it and maybe will not admit it in public, who has not had 
phone call after phone call every day from people who are just 
getting by or who are not getting by at all because they are 
being taxed to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we put that question to the Liberals here in the House, 
which I did a few days ago, one out of eight or nine 
I questioned says that in all the time they have been here 
since 1993 they have received two phone calls.  That is hard to 
believe.  In fact, I cannot believe that.  I think somebody is 
fudging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  They must have had their lines cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  Either that or they tapped into the 
machines.  “There is no human being on this end so I cannot 
answer questions.  Phone back at a more suitable hour”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That means one minute, I hope, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I was not just checking the wind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson:</B>  It is not blowing that good. We have 
seen how ill the wind blows from that side of the House many 
times.  In fact, we are still trying to pay for some of the moves 
they have made here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems we do have our priorities really mixed up in this 
country when we allow situations to go on as we do today such as 
with the blood scandal and the part the government has played in 
that.  I also have great difficulty with the millennium fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government came to power it has put closure in this House 
38 times, more than the PCs believe it or not.  I heard 
complaints back then about this type of dictatorship but it goes 
on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I see closure has again come to this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Closure may come later but for the 
moment the hon. member's time has expired. 
<P><A NAME="LINK36"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to rise in this 
debate on the budget implementation bill.  I noticed that my 
colleague from across the way was talking about which way the 
wind was blowing.  I was pleased to see last night which way the 
wind was blowing in British Columbia.  It seems to be a very 
Liberal wind after that byelection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to talk a bit about one component of the budget. It has 
to do with tax reduction.  I do not know and I do not believe 
there is a great deal of argument in the country about the 
desirability of tax reductions.  Regardless of whether one is in 
the centre or in the left or right of the political spectrum, 
most Canadians would see tax reduction as a desirable goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I think what is important is the way tax reduction is 
to be achieved.  One of the important aspects of the budget was 
that there are some very important principles underlying the 
types of tax reductions in that budget. 
I would like to take a moment to enunciate some of those, give a 
couple of examples of how that works.  Then if I have a moment 
toward the end, I am going to compare that to some of the 
suggestions which have come from some of the opposition members. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT36"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT36"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1300

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle upon which the tax reductions are based is 
that tax reduction should begin at the bottom. As we have the 
fiscal manoeuvring room to provide tax reduction, it should be 
provided first to those Canadians at the lower and middle income 
levels.  We start at the bottom with those who can least afford 
to pay tax and then expand the reductions upward as our fiscal 
dividends expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very important principle. We saw that clearly enunciated 
in the budget with the raising of the basic personal exemption. 
This will take some 400,000 Canadians off the tax rolls. In 
addition we saw it with the 3% surtax being eliminated for those 
people earning under $50,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle in respect of tax reduction is that it is 
important to target tax reductions to achieve important social 
objectives.  Again we saw that in the budget.  In the budget we 
saw such things as the $850 million tax credit being provided to 
low and middle income Canadian families with children.  That is 
in addition to the $850 million that was provided in the previous 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw that in a series of tax reductions in respect of 
obtaining post-secondary education.  We saw a targeted tax 
reduction to achieve the very important social goal of providing 
access to post-secondary education.  We saw tax reductions to 
help Canadians with disabilities in addition to the actions that 
were taken in the previous budget.  We saw other specifically 
targeted measures such as a caregiver tax credit. On a smaller 
basis a tax reduction is being provided to volunteer emergency 
workers which is particularly important in a rural area like 
mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another principle which the finance minister enunciated, 
developed and crafted his budget around is the importance of 
providing tax reduction in line with one's fiscal needs.  We saw 
that very clearly.  We saw a government with the help and support 
of all Canadians bring a balanced budget to this country for the 
first time in a generation and a half. Then once the fiscal 
dividend was at hand, the government started to provide the tax 
reductions.  That is the appropriate way to do it, to make the 
reductions once the government is in the fiscal position to do 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth principle is a principle which some of my colleagues 
who sit across the way should listen to very carefully.  The 
government has the responsibility not just to taxpayers but to 
all Canadians.  If it simply takes all of the government action 
on the tax reduction side, then substantial numbers of Canadians 
will not be impacted and will not benefit by that action.  In 
putting whatever type of fiscal plan together within a budget, 
one needs to remember the principle that not all Canadians are 
taxpayers, but all Canadians deserve to be considered for support 
by the federal government as they may require. We clearly saw 
that in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw $2.5 billion for the millennium fund, direct spending to 
help people access post-secondary education.  When you come from 
a rural riding like mine, Parry Sound—Muskoka, the cost of 
post-secondary education tends to be higher because students need 
to live away from home.  That is a particularly important thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw the increased funding to the granting councils.  We saw 
the $1.5 billion restoration of the previously scheduled 
reduction to the CHST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were non-tax measures, but they were measures that were 
important to Canadians.  They were able to benefit Canadians who 
may not necessarily be taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to look at those principles.  They are 
important principles.  They are Liberal principles. 
They are principles the finance minister crafted within the 
budgetary measures.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to look at what some of our colleagues across 
the way were suggesting in terms of budgetary action.  Many were 
enunciated during the previous campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all it was interesting to note that both the Reform 
Party by 1999 and the Tory party which had a date of 2000, were 
projecting balanced budgets far after we were able to achieve it. 
When talking about one of the principles, the interesting part 
is they wanted to provide tax action before they were willing to 
balance the budget.  In essence they wanted to borrow money in 
order to provide tax cuts rather than bring the fiscal dividend 
forward and provide tax cuts in a sustainable manner.  This is 
clear in both parties' platforms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at some of their tax measures, they certainly would not 
result in a bottom up process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories' 10% across the board tax reduction means the more 
you earn, the bigger the tax break you get.  That is the exact 
opposite of the principle the finance minister is using, which is 
from the bottom up.  The Tory approach is to provide the largest 
tax decrease to those who earn the most.  We who come from 
Ontario know full well the results of that type of approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party had a similar approach.  It suggested a 
flattened tax regime and an average $2,000 savings for a Canadian 
family.  When there is a flattened tax regime with an average of 
$2,000 it means the more you earn, the higher your income, the 
larger the tax reduction you will receive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most interesting and telltale signs of not adhering 
to those principles that I enunciated should be in the budget, 
was the Tory suggestion that the corporate tax rate, not the 
small business tax rate, but the corporate tax rate be reduced 
from 28% to 24%.  This would mean that companies such as Canada's 
chartered banks, those cash starved corporations, would receive 
more than a 10% tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Tories, rather than suggesting that tax reduction come from 
the bottom up, suggest a corporate tax reduction from 28% to 24%. 
The impact of that is to put oodles of money into those cash 
starved institutions, Canadian chartered banks. That is the type 
of principle they want to bring to tax reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me summarize.  As we deal with the budget and the component 
of tax reductions, what makes it a successful budget, what has 
brought the support of Canadians to this budget, what has brought 
that Liberal byelection victory in British Columbia yesterday is 
the principle of providing tax relief from the bottom up.  It is 
targeting tax relief to achieve important social goals.  It is 
achieving our fiscal dividend first and then providing tax 
relief.  Most important, it is remembering we have a 
responsibility to all Canadians and not just taxpayers but also 
including them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the reasons this budget has the support of the 
Canadian people.  This was very clearly demonstrated yesterday in 
British Columbia.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure to engage in today's debate on Bill C-36, the 
budget implementation act.  I hope not to address what this 
government has done for Canadians but rather to point out what 
this government has done to Canadians.  I will discuss what 
Canadians wanted from this budget and how this budget affects 
Canadian families and students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On budget day the finance minister stood up and smugly told 
Canadians that he had slain the deficit monster.  Well, I 
disagree.  The deficit has been fought on the backs of the 
taxpayers.  The hon. secretary of state was mentioning “We did 
it. The government did it. We did this, we did that”.  It was 
the hard work of the Canadian taxpayers that balanced this budget 
and I do not think the government should lose sight of that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member mentioned a balanced budget.  He was trumpeting 
his own government's balanced budget. 
In 1993 we were saying that could be accomplished within three 
years.  The government scoffed at that, yet it put in place the 
same kind of plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sent out a householder survey in my riding of 
Dewdney—Alouette and had over 500 people respond on questions 
having to do with the budget.  I will take a few minutes to touch 
on some of the results and point out some of the things Canadians 
wanted but did not get from the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of government spending, 72% of the people who 
responded in Dewdney—Alouette said that spending should be 
reduced.  Only 3% of the respondents believed government spending 
should be increased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of interest on the debt and initiatives for debt 
reduction, 96% of the people who responded believed that 
government should set real goals and timetables to lower the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the point of deficit spending, my constituents were asked 
whether they believe the government should pass legislation to 
prevent deficit spending from happening again.  Overwhelmingly, 
constituents sent a clear message.  Of those asked, 92% supported 
the notion of this type of legislation preventing future deficit 
spending which of course has led to the enormously huge national 
debt of close to $600 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the tax burden imposed on Canadian families is enormous. 
Canadian families work half the year just to pay their tax bill. 
For most Canadians, forgoing a second income is not even an 
option.  For those who decide to stay at home and raise their 
children, they are unable to take advantage of some of the 
deductions for families who choose to have their children in 
care.  We would like the government to address that and to have 
equity for all Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians wanted the government to cut spending.  They wanted 
tax relief.  They wanted the government to address the debt. What 
did Canadians get?  They got higher spending on the part of the 
government, higher taxes and a government that is on the brink of 
falling back into the deficit gorge with any fluctuation in 
interest rates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will briefly touch on the millennium scholarship foundation. 
As some members mentioned earlier, this is not really about 
education, it is about the Prime Minister using taxpayer dollars 
to boost his political profile. The way this was handled in the 
budget was quite surprising.  I find it quite unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government simply cannot record something just because it 
announced the intention of doing something.  There is a 
difference between an expenditure and a future commitment.  The 
finance minister lost sight of this fact. The very finance 
minister who is trumpeting the budget for what it does for 
education slashed and burned health care and education funding by 
$7 billion.  That is a fact that cannot be lost on Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few members mentioned B.C.  I am glad they realize where it is 
now because there will soon be blowing an ill wind from the west. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals really had a concern about education, they could 
never have cut to the degree that they have cut since 1993 and 
then make these half measures, not even half measures, not even 
quarter measures, to try to convince Canadians that they care 
about education.  Words are empty if they are not backed up by 
actions.  Canadians are starting to realize that a budget that 
pretends to address all these concerns in not even quarter 
measures just does not match up with the actions the government 
is implementing in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking to two university professors about the millennium 
scholarship foundation. They thought it was a good idea until I 
pointed out to them that the students at their institution would 
not be eligible for these scholarships.  This is due to the fact 
that they teach at a public institution that is privately funded. 
Students who choose to go to that type of institution do not 
have the opportunity to take part in the millennium scholarship 
foundation. That is a shame because this is not even a quarter 
measure, as I mentioned before.  It does not address the concerns 
of the majority of students in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak to over 60 high school 
students.  I was explaining to them the concern with the debt and 
why we need to address that debt which is close to $600 billion. 
They asked me how that was possible. I used the story of 
overspending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government chooses to overspend year after year, the debt 
piles up higher and higher.  I had to explain to those high 
school students that $45 billion goes to interest on that debt 
alone and is eating the heart out of our social programs.  They 
were shocked that this could happen in our country.  They asked 
me how it happened?  I said because the governments of the day 
put us in this shape because they did not take care of the 
financial house of this country. I am sorry to say, but the 
Liberal government started us along this path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I explained the so-called debt contingency retirement plan of 
the finance minister. He wants to dedicate $3 billion to debt 
retirement on that total of almost $600 billion. There is a big 
if. That is if that money not needed for other spending. I see it 
as an escape clause that could be used at any time for the 
finance minister to dedicate to any other kind of spending 
without having to put it to debt retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we treated our mortgages on our homes in the same way the 
government is treating the national debt, we would be hauled off 
and put into a place not nearly as nice as this for not meeting 
our financial obligation.  We must have this house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This finance minister's plan does not address any kind of 
substantial debt retirement plan.  That debt was created over 
years.  There has to be a plan to get that debt down.  The future 
of our country hangs in the balance as a result of that.  This 
government must take note of that and do something about it.  It 
must do something soon with a concrete plan; not an if plan, not 
a plan that if we do not need the money we will put it to debt 
retirement.  It has to be a committed plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was talking to those high school students they were 
shocked at the state of our country.  They asked me why I wanted 
to get into politics. I was a teacher prior to this.  I said this 
country needs people who are willing to stand up for their 
future, for our children's future, for the future of our nation 
and set a course to address the major concerns in this country. 
That is why I entered politics.  We hope to influence the 
government to look at these concerns and these issues and address 
them with concrete plans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for that reason that I cannot support Bill C-36. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
some displeasure that I rise in this House today to speak on Bill 
C-36 to implement certain provisions of the 1998-99 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, on behalf of the citizens of my riding of Verchères, 
whom I have the honour of representing in this House, and all 
Quebeckers, I have the duty and responsibility of conveying our 
profound disappointment with this misleading and shamefully 
partisan exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, this budget may seem extremely positive. After 
all, is it not the first balanced federal budget in nearly three 
decades? 
Does it not contain very good news for the taxpayers? The fact 
is all this is a smoke and mirrors, a cover up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of a sudden, after four years of intense deficit reduction 
efforts on the backs of the provinces, the unemployed and the 
most disadvantaged, as soon as a surplus is achieved, the 
Liberals are starting to spend left and right again. Really, once 
a Liberal, always a Liberal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury, the federal government has once again 
decided to invest the money saved at the expense of others in 
areas over which it has no jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine this, after accumulating in the employment insurance 
fund billions of dollars in surpluses at the expense of employers 
and employees to help wipe out part of its deficit and cut back 
billions of dollars in transfer payments to the provinces, 
forcing the provinces, including Quebec, to make difficult 
decisions, which have been made courageously, in the areas of 
health and education, the federal government has the nerve to use 
a substantial portion of the extorted money to encroach yet again 
on provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, members will note that the provinces got hit with 
52% of federal cuts; yet, according to the last budget, they are 
entitled to only 23% of the new expenditures. However, while 
federal spending was cut by only 12%, it accounts for 51% of the 
new expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important to the federal government, when it comes down 
to it, is the visibility of providing services directly to the 
public and getting into their hands as many cheques bearing the 
maple leaf as possible.  This is an underhand strategy: Ottawa 
seeks to make the Quebec government look bad by hampering its 
progress toward a balanced budget, so that it can look good at 
Premier Bouchard's expense as the provincial election 
approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the Liberal government wants to rush to the rescue once 
again with new initiatives in areas of provincial jurisdiction 
in order to lighten the burden of misery it itself has imposed, 
and continues to impose, since $30 billion or so in cuts still 
remain to be made across Canada by the year 2003 in education, 
health and social assistance. Some would call this absolute bunk, 
yet the federal government is quite open about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As proof of this, the President of Treasury Board is quoted in <I>Le 
Soleil</I> of March 8, 1996 as saying “When Bouchard has to make 
cuts, those of us in Ottawa will be able to demonstrate that we 
have the means to preserve the future of social programs”. 
Edifying, is it not?  Is this the co-operative federalism they 
delight in referring to on the other side of this House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Liberals understand that this strategy leads 
nowhere?  When will they understand that Quebec cannot be bought 
for billions of dollars?  They have put this strategy in 
practice over and over during the past three decades with 
somewhat disappointing, even catastrophic, results.  They have 
been unable to slow the rapid growth of the sovereignist movement 
and have plunged Canada into the perilous spiral of debt from 
which it is hard to extricate ourselves today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its prebudget document, the Bloc Quebecois asked that a 
significant portion of the surpluses for the next two years be 
given back to the provinces as tax points, to compensate them—at 
least to some extent—for the drastic cuts made by the Liberal 
government during its first mandate to transfer payments for 
health, post-secondary education and social assistance. However, 
it seems that, as with the surpluses generated in the employment 
insurance fund, Ottawa has decided to keep control of that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has urged the federal government to make sure 
the employment insurance fund is used only by those who 
contribute to it. 
We continue to condemn the misappropriation of funds by the 
federal government with the employment insurance surplus. That 
surplus is constantly increasing, because of the more strict 
eligibility criteria imposed by the government and maintained 
against all logic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But it is in research and development that the duplicity of this 
government is most obvious. Indeed, while the Liberal 
government's rhetoric has been impressive, we have seen very few 
concrete measures. The Bloc Quebecois has asked that, at the very 
least, funding for granting councils be restored to the 1993 
level. However, the Liberals have only pledged to restore that 
funding to the 1994-95 level, thus making Canada fall even further 
behind in research and development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget speech, like the one last year, was full of grand 
phrases regarding the importance attached by this government to 
research and development, and so on.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will, if I may, quote a few of the gems in the finance 
minister's budget speech about research and development.  First 
of all, the minister said, and I quote:  “For 200 years in Canada 
prosperity and knowledge have gone hand in hand.—The 
creation of jobs in the new millennium will be anchored in two 
essential components: the infrastructure of innovation, and the 
infrastructure of skills and knowledge”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And he went on to say:  “There can be few things more critical to 
determining our economic success in the next century than a 
vigorous, broad based research and development effort. 
The fact is the more R and D that is done in Canada, the more 
jobs that will be created for Canadians”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are we to square these fine words with the meagre resources 
committed and the highly questionable decisions already made by 
this government with respect to R and D? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On numerous occasions in the House, I have seen government 
members rise and claim that R and D into sources of renewable 
energy is one of their greatest priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing could be further from the truth.  Two years ago, Ottawa 
announced that it was terminating its modest annual contribution 
of $7.2 million to the Tokamak magnetic fusion project in 
Varennes, now the largest R and D energy project in Quebec. 
Magnetic, or nuclear, fusion constitutes a very promising form 
of producing a large volume of energy in a clean, safe, 
environmentally responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, I have been trying to understand the twisted 
reasoning that led this government to make such a ridiculous 
decision.  On numerous occasions, I have questioned the various 
stakeholders and have met with inconsistent, incomplete and 
incomprehensible answers.  Not only will the $70 million already 
invested in the project over the last 20 years be lost forever, 
but the technological, industrial and economic shortfall for 
Quebec and for Canada could be colossal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other industrialized countries have realized the importance 
of nuclear fusion research and some are even spending as much as 
10, 20 and even 40 times more than Canada in this very promising 
area of research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to point out that Quebec, which is already 
receiving a lot less than its fair share of federal investments 
in research and development, is facing an even greater deficit 
with the end of the federal government's financial participation 
in the Tokamak project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Paradoxically, Ottawa is pouring billions of dollars into far 
less promising areas and paying particular attention to Ontario. 
I am thinking of the federal government's decision to focus on 
the development, production, marketing and sales of Candu 
reactors, whose reliability and environmental safety record 
continue to be questioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What explanation is there for such stubbornness and false 
economies on the back of a province that is not receiving its 
fair share of research and development funding, in an area where 
dividends are potentially so numerous and so high compared to 
the modest annual investment required?  I take this opportunity 
to again express my indignation and to appeal to this 
government's common sense in this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to have talked about the millennium scholarship 
foundation, but unfortunately, as time is short, I will close by 
taking the few minutes remaining to remind the hon. members of 
this House that Quebeckers are not fools.  They have had it with 
fancy speeches aimed at nothing more than raising the profile of 
the government on the backs of society's disadvantaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from being a prophet of doom, I would like to repeat to the 
Minister of Finance what many analysts fear. After creating 
surpluses, he cannot just rest on his laurels and spend wildly 
to then fall back into the same bad habits.  Instead, he must 
structure public finances so we will no longer have to face the 
nightmarish deficits passed on to the people of Canada over 30 
years by successive Liberal and Conservative governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Part VIII of the legislation addresses the phase-out of the air 
transportation tax levied on air travel as a percentage of ticket 
prices.  Coinciding with this phase-out is the commencement of 
NavCan's user fees for large aircraft and for the reduction of 
federal funding for this not for profit corporation which was 
created to provide air navigation services on a commercial basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The air transport tax will be completely off the books by 
November 1, 1998.  At that time NavCan will be cut off as planned 
from government funding and will have to operate on its own. That 
is the way it should work.  Once a government service has been 
commercialized and is financed by charging fees to those who use 
it, the taxes previously collected to pay for the service should 
be reduced.  Otherwise the result is double taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this is what we may see happening to operators of 
light aircraft.  Although November 1 is also the date for the 
commencement of NavCan user fees for small aircraft, there is no 
plan to ease the tax burden on the general aviation sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is a great supporter of user pay, but operators 
of light aircraft are already paying and paying and paying 
increased Transport Canada charges and new airport user fees, for 
example, the infamous fee to pee that so many pilots talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Particularly galling is the excise tax on aviation gasoline 
which is poured into the government's general revenues.  Aviation 
gasoline is taxed at a much higher rate than jet fuel.  Jumbo 
planes fuel up and pay 4 cents of excise tax per litre while the 
tax rate for aviation gasoline is 11 cents, a full 7 cents per 
litre difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not in our national interest to charge and tax general 
aviation into the ground.  Commercial aviation needs a healthy 
general aviation sector to be its pilot recruiting and training 
ground.  That is the way it has always been.  However, in the 
face of spiralling costs in the form of taxes and fees the number 
of licensed pilots in Canada has been steadily decreasing for 
years.  Double taxation of operators of light aircraft will only 
make matters worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must not follow the example of some European countries 
which have killed private flying by overregulating airspace. 
These countries are now forced to seek foreign pilots to fly 
commercial aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noticed a good omen.  The finance minister has received a 
letter from NavCan's president proposing a solution to the 
problem.  NavCan has requested that the 7 cents per litre 
difference in excise tax rates levied on jet fuel and on aviation 
gasoline be eliminated, and that NavCan be permitted to collect a 
similar amount from aviation gasoline sales to finance air 
navigation services for smaller aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the finance minister to carefully consider NavCan's 
proposal.  It is only fair to offer a revenue neutral, user pay 
system to the operators of small aircraft similar to the deal 
being given to major operators of commercial aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also solid common sense to tie fuel consumption to 
financing the air navigation service.  This way there is not only 
no double taxation of light aircraft operators but heavy users of 
light aircraft would automatically pay more than infrequent 
weekend flyers.  Equally important, NavCan would not have to 
waste money and effort tracking down and invoicing individual 
pilots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As air transportation taxes are the sole transportation issue 
deemed worthy of a mention in Bill C-36, I would like to use my 
remaining time on a more general issue. 
I have to admit that I am somewhat encouraged by the budget being 
balanced for the first time since 1969.  However, my enthusiasm 
evaporates when I consider how the Liberals managed to do it.  It 
was not done by cutting wasteful spending.  Of this I can assure 
the House.  The Liberals continue to spend money, coddling their 
corporate darlings such as Bombardier and Power Corp, not to 
mention simply squandering money on things like the free flag 
program.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals brought the balanced budget into being by 
increasing taxes 37 times, by slashing health and education 
transfers to the provinces and by hoarding big UI surpluses so 
that they could disguise an ongoing deficit.  It is truly the 
Canadian taxpayers who dislodged the deficit as increased 
revenues actually counted for 69% of deficit reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Spending days are back.  First there was redbook two in which 
tax relief and debt reduction were given second billing to 
spending. Now the budget makes it abundantly clear that the 
Liberals have not learned a thing.  What we are witnessing now is 
a foolish rush to spend any surplus to maintain unity within the 
Liberal caucus:  pork, pork, pork. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than basing its spending plans on contingency reserves, 
the government has displayed its contempt for debt reduction by 
essentially arguing that it is not necessary: don't worry, be 
happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than consolidating the budget balance so that it stays 
balanced during the next economic downturn, the government could 
not wait to start spending again.  Thus we have more than two 
dozen spending increases, totalling over $10 billion over the 
next three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals seem to feel that they have to be big spenders even 
though Canadians would be happy with a responsible government 
that provided stable funding for the things Canadians count on, 
those things that governments do best such as health care, a 
national highway system and education.  The Liberals cannot 
resist grand gestures like the new millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hate to be cynical but I am afraid this place eventually makes 
all of us a bit cynical.  When considering spending projects, the 
government's number one concern is to get the lion's share of any 
glory to be gained.  I wish the government would think of how it 
could best help Canadians rather than how to use taxpayers' money 
to boost the its political profile.  How else can the millennium 
scholarship fund be explained, except as a gesture to boost the 
government's profile? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the fund is not about post-secondary education.  It will 
not restore slashed education funding or provide students and 
parents with tax relief so that they can better afford to save 
for tuition and repay student loans.  It is the same old 
malarkey, the tax and spend approach.  If the Liberals were so 
concerned about education, why do they not just return some of 
the $7 billion they took away from the provinces in transfer 
payments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are such defenders of post-secondary education, why did 
they do away with the Mulroney scholarships program which was 
really the same as the millennium scholarship fund?  It was 
another political ploy like the one we are getting now.  I 
predict that the ultimate fate of the millennium scholarship 
program will be the same as it was for the Mulroney scholarships 
as soon as that one time political benefit has been exhausted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am heartbroken.  I could have gone on for another 20 minutes 
on the millennium fund.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to participate in this debate on Bill C-36, but not to 
say that I am in favour of it, because I certainly am not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give you an example of the sort of thing that happened 
back home, in New Brunswick, last week. While the Liberals were 
boasting “Canadians are happy and so are post-secondary 
students”, 
last week, universities held a rally to let the federal 
government know how hard hit they have been by cuts in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Provincial cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> An hon. member across the way said “provincial 
cuts”. If these were only provincial cuts, why did the Premier 
of New Brunswick and both his finance and education ministers say 
they had to be made as a result of federal cuts? And by the way, 
the Liberals are still in office provincially in New Brunswick. 
Perhaps not for much longer, but they are still there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, the government is telling us there is something 
good in store for post-secondary students starting in the year 
2000. It is important for Canadians to know that things are not 
as good as they are made out to be. At present, university 
students have to spend between $25,000 and $30,000 to get the 
education they need to enter the labour market. The proposed 
changes to the tax credits might save them $3,000 but they still 
will not have a job at the end of the day. 
How are they expected to pay off their debts then? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what the government should have done is increase funding 
for educational institutions in order to reduce the cost of a 
university education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example. This week, New Brunswick announced it would 
cost 10% more to attend university. This announcement came 
immediately after the federal government said it would improve 
its program for education and that it would benefit post-secondary 
students. It is obvious that university students are having a 
hard time. They expect to see their debt level rise to as much as 
$40,000 in the years to come. These young people who attend 
university accumulate huge debts, which they are then unable to 
repay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Turning to the scholarships that the government plans to award, 
only 7.1% of all students in Canada will benefit. 
Let me give you an example. If, in the Beresford region of New 
Brunswick there are 100 students who want to go to university, 
only seven of them will get scholarships. It is the same across 
the country, in Vancouver or anywhere else. Therefore, not many 
people will benefit from these scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, these scholarships will be awarded based on merit, 
that is to say, they will be given to those who have good marks. 
They will definitely not be awarded to the poor, when we know 
that some students have to work at McDonald's or in other 
restaurants or convenience stores to earn a bit of money so they 
can pay off their debts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government really missed the boat, unless it deliberately 
chose to launch a big advertising campaign in Canada by saying it 
would give money to students, without spending that much. 
The numbers may seem impressive—millions of dollars for 
Canadian students—but once you split the money among all the 
regions, it does not amount to much. Again, only 7 students out 
of 100 will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has a greater responsibility than this toward our 
young people, because they represent the future of our country. 
They are the ones who will take over from us, and getting them 
into debt is not the right thing to do. As I said, the government 
has a responsibility to help these young Canadians, and it is a 
good investment for the future of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I oppose the government's budget. I oppose the way 
the government tried to convince Canadians that it was supportive 
of our young people. Our young people are not getting government 
support. They go to school from grade one to grade twelve, and 
then they have to fend for themselves. 
To make things worse, the rich have a better chance to get these 
scholarships than the poor or middle class people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I met with students who came to my office. They told me they 
would be penalized if they worked, because the following year the 
government would deduct 80% of their earnings, thus making it 
impossible for them to get a student loan or scholarship.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These sorts of things have young people across Canada really 
worried.  I have used New Brunswick as an example because that 
is where I come from and I had last week's example, when students 
from the Université de Moncton marched in the streets. 
University of Fredericton students did the same, to let the 
government know they were being poorly treated.  This is what is 
really happening in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> In Quebec too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> Students in Quebec, in Manitoba, in Ontario, or 
in British Columbia feel the same way. 
They are not happy with the budget of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that our Prime Minister is selective when he visits 
universities, and perhaps chooses those attended by the wealthy. 
He should come and visit New Brunswick and see the reception he 
gets.  He should come and visit an area of the country where 
people are living in poverty.  He should come to my region and 
see what he is doing to our young people and how they are not 
helped by the 1998 federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have the nerve to travel around the country boasting 
that they have done something good for Canadian students. 
I say that this is misleading, as only 7% of students will 
benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is smoke and mirrors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin:</B> The best thing to do would have been to invest in 
institutions, so that everyone would have received the same 
treatment and the costs would have dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I am not alone in paying attention to this bill. 
Young people in my region are telling me very clearly that the 
federal government's budget does nothing for them and they do 
not support it.  The government should be aware that the young 
people attending universities represent Canada's future and give 
them the education they need for the future and for the economy 
of the future.  That is what we need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, I was at the community college in Bathurst.  The first 
question the students asked me was “Where are we going to find 
jobs? 
How are we going to pay our tuition fees?”  They are very 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a responsibility, and I come back to that 
because it is its responsibility to lower costs for Canadian 
students and to do the right thing once and for all.  They 
cannot always be thinking of themselves, their patronage 
appointments and the millions they are giving to Doug Young. 
They should look at what is going on with our young people.  That 
is much more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not support Bill C-36.  I say the government should do more 
important things for young people, invest where it would help 
them, give them a chance to go to university, to study and to 
enter the labour market free of debt and not obliged to declare 
bankruptcy.  What are we giving our young people?  They go to 
university and then they go bankrupt.  What a great start to 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope there are some Liberals who will put a bug in the ear 
of their minister on behalf of our young Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my comments today 
will primarily have to do with the confidence one should have in 
this government, and particularly the Minister of Finance, 
regarding the measures included in Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything is a matter of confidence, because we are trying to 
figure out the government's true intention in proposing these 
so-called social assistance measures, particularly the millennium 
scholarship fund, which has a budget of $2.5 billion. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I say this is a matter of confidence? Because, in my 
opinion, it was more important for the government and for the 
Minister of Finance to come up with some program or scheme that 
would hide any budget surplus generated during the last fiscal 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By now, everyone knows that the government could have brought 
down a budget with surpluses totalling $3 billion. However, if 
the government had done that, it would have been forced to help 
those taxpayers who are paying for these budget cuts and these 
new programs. The government would have been forced to reduce 
taxes, and possibly employment insurance contributions. 
It would have been forced to take other measures that would have 
cut into its own revenues, at a time when it is building 
surpluses that will reach some $30 billion, or more, in the years 
2000 to 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it is a matter of confidence, because the auditor general 
said that by establishing the millennium scholarship fund, the 
Minister of Finance is including in this year's budget an 
expenditure that he will make in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his last report, the auditor general had criticized the 
minister for acting like this. The issue then was the Canada 
Foundation for Innovation. In that case, the government had 
agreed to budget $800 million for a foundation that did not yet 
exist. 
That would enable the government to inflate its deficit by $800 
million, which would serve its purpose since it could convince 
the taxpayers that the government ought to continue to make cuts 
at the expense of the unemployed, the poor and all those most in 
need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By inflating its deficit, the government claimed it was justified 
in maintaining its budget restrictions.  Here is what the auditor 
general thought of this:  The 1996-97 deficit is over-estimated by 
$800 million.  This is because an operation relating to the 
Canadian Foundation for Innovation was recorded as a liability, 
which is contrary to the accounting conventions set out by the 
Government of Canada in Note No. 1 of the financial statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $800 million was reported as an amount owing to a body which 
did not exist as of March 31, 1997.  The foundation had no legal 
existence until April 1997. 
What is more, the funding agreement between the Government of 
Canada and the foundation was not signed until July 1997.  The 
government fiddled with the figures and made this expenditure 
appear a year before the fact, because this served its political 
ambitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Far from showing any remorse, the Minister of Finance had, 
moreover, done the same thing with the harmonization of the GST 
in the maritimes.  The government had already earmarked $1 
billion for this operation, although there were no agreements in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After these two experiences, there is still no remorse 
forthcoming from the government.  After the business of the GST 
and the $800 million for the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, 
it is repeating the offence a third time by setting aside $2.5 
billion for the millennium scholarship foundation. 
It is posting them in the books now, even though the first 
cheques will not be issued until the year 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Once again to avoid showing surpluses, which would not be 
in its interests because it would bring too much pressure to bear 
on the government. Would the same be allowed of individuals? 
Would an individual be allowed, for instance, to enter the 
expenditure of funds in this year's income tax return to avoid 
reporting income? Would Revenue Canada let him do this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge any Canadian to enter in 1997 expenditures which 
will actually be made in 1998, as the government and the Minister 
of Finance have done. 
I can tell you Revenue Canada would immediately catch it and ask 
him to review his financial statements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would a small or medium size business be allowed to do the 
same? Could it enter expenditures this year to avoid showing a 
profit at the end of 1997? No, this would no be allowed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the Minister of Revenue to tell us whether he would 
allow a small or medium size business to enter this year 
expenditures that will not be made until next year, in order not 
to show a profit and, thus, avoid paying income tax on this 
amount. Yet, that is what the government is doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what it is doing with the millennium scholarships. Any 
program would have done just as well for the government; what 
mattered was not so much to help students as to gain visibility, 
to show a zero deficit in order to keep pressure at bay. That is 
what the main goal was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we trust government that claims to want to help students but 
does it through a process that is secretive almost to the point 
of being undemocratic, a process giving people the impression it 
is doing them a favour when in fact it is pursuing purely 
political objectives? 
This action by the government is despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Helping students was not the government's intention. In fact, 
even though it could now rectify the situation somewhat by giving 
that money back to the provinces, which would be in a better 
position to use it for educational purposes, the federal 
government has so far refused to consider this possibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This confidence issue will remain until the government 
demonstrates its willingness to be more transparent and to use 
accounting practices that comply with the general rules 
recognized by the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, 
and until it demonstrates that its intentions with regard to 
helping a particular segment of our society are not purely 
political but truly meet the needs of these people.

the Reform Party has long called for equal tax treatment for one

this is part of our Reform blue book and was a central part of 
our 1997 election platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be offering a child care credit for all parents 
regardless of the method of child care they choose.  Research

children is one of the best methods of fostering secure 
attachment and preventing problems in adolescence and adulthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to a national poll fully 94% of Canadians identified 
lack of time to spend with offspring as a serious stress on 
family life.  In a poll conducted last year 92% of Ontarians said 
it was preferable for a young child to be at home with a parent. 
Yet the government implements tax policies which discourage and 
in fact discriminate against such an arrangement.

limited liability ahead of human suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report Justice Horace Krever said that Canada has a moral

Mr. Justice Krever did his job as a commissioner on a royal

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister tell this House, without blaming the provinces

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
sometimes governments are called upon to make tough decisions as 
a matter of public policy.  When we look back on the tragedy of 
the tainted blood, it is plain that the period 1986 to 1990 
stands out.  It stands out because it is a period during which 
those responsible could have and should have acted.  Had they 
acted, many of those infections would have been prevented. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every government in the country thinks it is good public policy 
to provide assistance to people who were infected in that period. 
That is the reason we put aside more than $1 billion to assist 
the more than 22,000 people who were infected.

with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that close the door forever on his talks with these people?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the hon. member shamelessly exploited victims for his

</I></B></P><P align=left>The record shows that I have met more than once with the very 
people who were in our company yesterday.  In fact, last Thursday 
I spoke by telephone with Mr. McCarty to tell him personally 
about the decision that was coming Friday.  It was not because I 
thought he would like it.  I knew he would not, but I wanted him 
to hear it from me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a minister who accepts his responsibility, who has met 
with victims.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC):</B>  That is right, Mr. 
Speaker.  He spoke long distance.  This is the minister of remote 
control.  Why does he not meet with them eyeball to eyeball. He 
can explain to them what he has explained to this House and they 
can determine whether or not he is sincere in what he is talking 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have talked about this issue for weeks and weeks and he has 
successfully dodged the bullet. The fact remains that there are

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what the hon. member obviously does not know is that I have met 
with those victims.  I have met with several of the people he has 
referred to.  I have met with them on more than one occasion. 
Last week, as I said, I spoke to them directly to tell them what 
the decision of the governments was.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some tens of 
thousands of Canadians have been infected by hepatitis C,

They only ask to be treated equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is to the Prime Minister.  We can tell a lot about 
leadership when an individual has made an error.  I ask the Prime 
Minister today to right the error of hepatitis C compensation to 
those innocent victims. 
<P><A NAME="LINK108"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
what the hon. member sees here is a decision, a responsible 
decision, taken by every government in the country.  We looked at 
the record and saw that during the period in question something 
could have been done, but it was not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a physician I know the hon. member is well aware that every 
medical procedure involves risk as well as benefit.  As a matter 
of public policy one cannot go back and erase the risk of the 
past, but we can deal with the period during which those 
responsible should have acted and did not, and that is what we 
have done.  Those are the people who will be assisted by 
governments throughout this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK109"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the very 
day we get that kind of an answer we have the health minister 
fighting vigorously in his cabinet for tobacco cash—$100 million 
for tobacco cash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is what the hepatitis C victims say:  “Why would that 
money go to tobacco instead of going to us?”  That is my 
question to the health minister:  Why would that money not go to 
the victims of hepatitis C?  They do not want two tiers of 
victims. 
<P><A NAME="LINK110"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member would do well to be careful what he believes 
about what he reads in the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me come to the point of his question because I think the 
hon. member misses the rationale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governments of Canada, all of them, have agreed that the 
appropriate rationale in terms of assisting those who were 
infected with hepatitis C is to look to that period when 
something could have been done to prevent it.  That is the reason 
we will be providing, by way of an offer to settle the 
outstanding claims, over $1 billion for the benefit of over 
22,000 Canadians who might have been kept healthy.

individual banks until this government took office.  There was no 
national ombudsman until this government took office.  The 
industry committee which has been very active in monitoring 
bank activities did not play that role until this government took 
office.  We do not have to take a back seat to anybody in terms 
of our control of what the banks are doing.

according to Elections Canada the Tsuu T'ina reserve donated more 
than $19,000 to the Liberal Party over the past four years.  That 
is money that should have gone to housing or health care or to 
fight illiteracy.  Instead it went to the Liberal Party 
fundraisers.

Our patriotism emanates from and has its source not only in 
ourselves and in our relationships with our fellow citizens, but 
also in the majesty of nature and the physical grandeur and 
beauty of our great dominion from the misty Grand Banks of 
Newfoundland to the Rocky Mountains, Vancouver and Queen

pay tribute to Almonte Douglas Alkenbrack, a former member of 
Parliament who represented many of the people in the riding of 
Prince Edward—Lennox and later on Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington who are now my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Douglas served this House and the people of Canada from 1962 to 
1979.  His brother, Wesley Alkenbrack, attributed Doug's 
remarkable success in the political arena to the fact that he was 
a people's man. A devout member of the Conservative Party, Doug 
never lost the sense that he was the people's representative for 
his riding, whether those people were Liberal or NDP, black or 
white, rich or poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before becoming involved in the all-consuming world of politics, 
Doug was a lumberman, co-founder and partner in the R.W. Kimmerly 
Lumber Company in Napanee from 1937 to 1962.  His job took him 
through all parts of Lennox and Addington and Frontenac county 
where as a businessman he would gain the reputation as a straight 
shooter and a hard worker.  It was no doubt this reputation 
gained as a businessman was part of the secret of his success as 
a politician. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before and after I was elected in 1993, Doug was always generous 
in sharing his opinions with me. As a rookie MP, the House of 
Commons can appear intimidating at first glance.  Doug was always 
just a phone call or a visit away.  He wanted to make sure I was 
representing the people of Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and 
Addington in the best possible way because, as he would say, they 
deserve no less. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 Doug Alkenbrack in co-operation with the Lennox and 
Addington Historical Society published a book of his poetry 
entitled <I>Rhymes of a Back-Bencher</I>.

wish to extend our heartfelt sympathies to Doug's wife Nan, his 
daughter Eleanor Grennell, his son Dr. Douglas Alkenbrack, and 
also his brother Wesley Alkenbrack of Napanee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almonte Douglas Alkenbrack was not only a colleague but a dear 
friend.  May he rest in peace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to read from one or two of 
Mr. Alkenbrack's poems. This one says a lot about the riding and 
is entitled “Homeward”.  There is a preamble:

years kept me busy but I was always glad to get home to Napanee 
usually each weekend.  In November 1968 I was glad enough to 
write this, entitled “Homeward'. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It's great to go down to the Capitol<BR> 
Where there's plenty to hear and see<BR> 
Of our country's might, as they talk all night<BR> 
Of a free democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And they say it is good to be understood<BR> 
In committee or caucus hall<BR> 
Or in strong entreat from a Commons seat<BR> 
Where governments rule or fall.<BR> 
But there's one thing better that I prefer<BR> 
And the best that can happen to me<BR> 
Is to homeward wend, on the glad week-end<BR>

</I></B></P><P align=left>Doug was elected in 1962 for Lennox—Prince Edward and served 
this House and his party with distinction until 1979.  As a 
former counsellor and later the mayor of Napanee, Doug brought a

respectable gentleman by his peers on the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doug was, as his brother Wesley characterized him, a people's 
man who devoted his life to his parliamentary and riding duties. 
Doug was an unpartisan individual who was receptive to ideas and 
input from those who claimed they did not support his party's 
views.  He saw the good in people and the work of the individual

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK181">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-36, an 
act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 24, 1998, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak to this bill, the Budget 
Implementation Act, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very important thing in this bill is that it would establish 
the Canada millennium scholarship foundation. 
This project has been rejected by the whole education community 
in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw it yesterday. Representatives at the elementary, 
secondary, college and university levels, administrators, unions, 
all Quebeckers clearly expressed their opposition to Bill C-36. 
They accompanied Mr. Bouchard, who came to Ottawa yesterday to 
give Mr. Chrétien a proposed amendment that would satisfy 
Quebec's education coalition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Withdrawal with compensation 
</I></B></P><P align=left>46.1. When a province has established and administers a financial 
assistance program for students to ensure equal opportunities 
regarding post-secondary education, the ministers 
</UL>
<that is, the federal and provincial ministers 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>shall, at the province's request, conduct negotiations with this 
province to come to an agreement with respect to the fair 
compensation it should be paid in lieu of the foundation's 
activities in the province. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment is not just the position of the Government of 
Quebec, it is also the position of the entire coalition, which 
represents all those involved in education in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is recognition that the federal government might be 
entitled to a certain degree of visibility.  It wishes to ensure 
that the people who receive money from this program know where 
it came from.  I believe that desire may be legitimate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This ought not, however, to be done at the expense of 
efficiency.  The bill contains some things that are completely 
unacceptable.  The way the foundation is set up and the 
administrators appointed, and the means they are equipped with, 
is duplication, in my vocabulary. 
It is creating, alongside the structure that exists in Quebec to 
provide financial assistance to students, another structure 
which will not only compete with the entire system in place in 
Quebec, but will also disturb it.  It is important for those in 
the rest of Canada to understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, there is already a system of loans and scholarships in 
place. As a result, the average student debt load in Quebec is in 
the vicinity of $11,000 on graduation, as opposed to $25,000 in 
the rest of Canada.  The explanation for the difference is that, 
since 1964, Quebec has exercised its right to opt out in 
accordance with an agreement reached between Prime Minister 
Pearson and Premier Lesage.  Quebec has developed an incredible 
expertise in this area.  I believe it to be a model that is the 
envy of all of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when they want to put the millennium scholarships in 
place, the reason the Quebec coalition is opposed to the federal 
position is not because it will make more money available to 
students, but because it is necessary to ensure that this money 
will fit properly within the jurisdictional framework set out in 
the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, education is a provincial jurisdiction.  When I hear a 
phrase like the one used recently by a Liberal MP that “we are 
not interfering in education, we are going to give money to 
students”, this is evidence of gross ignorance of Canada's 
history, and of the fact that, for Quebec, jurisdiction over 
education is something sacred. It is one of the cornerstones of 
the Confederation pact of 1867.  It is therefore important, and 
it is necessary that a solution be found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government took a reasonable attitude and made a 
proposal. Both parties agreed to appoint negotiators: on the one 
side, the deputy minister of human resources development and, on 
the other side, the Quebec deputy minister of intergovernmental 
affairs, assisted by officials from the ministry of education, to 
try and find a mutually satisfactory solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will be monitoring developments very 
closely, and I was very surprised by the Prime minister's answer 
today, during question period. He said these negotiations could 
take place and Bill C-36 did not have to be amended, it could be 
passed as is. That is absolutely impossible, since paragraphs 
29(1) and 25(2) provide that the foundation may not enter into an 
agreement with the provinces to delegate the management of the 
millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, if the federal government wants to show good faith 
following yesterday's decision to have negotiations, if these 
negotiations are not simply a way to buy time, the federal 
government should make a move. It could for instance set aside 
Bill C-36, at least as regards the millennium scholarships, or 
include a provision to the effect that, if an agreement is 
entered into by Quebec and Ottawa respecting the management of 
the scholarships, this agreement shall become part of the act 
following the negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that it be made very clear that Quebec has 
control over the development of its education system. Yesterday, 
the coalition's spokesperson, Mr. Shapiro, who is the dean of 
McGill University, came here to speak on behalf of all 
stakeholders there. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1520"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT64"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT64"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1520

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot call Mr. Shapiro a separatist. McGill University is no 
hotbed for separatists.  I think there are people there of all 
political stripes, including federalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Mr. Shapiro and stakeholders in education have one 
concern.  They say that instruction is an integral tool in the 
development of the individual.  Certain things are learned at 
the primary, secondary, college and university levels, and 
equality of opportunity will not be assured by awarding 
university scholarships at the end of a program of studies on a 
merit basis.  There has to be enough money available at all 
levels of education, especially at the post-secondary level. I 
think it is important for us to reach an acceptable outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the federal government achieve its visibility objectives 
while the Government of Quebec and education stakeholders 
achieve their objective of efficiency?  I think, in order to 
reach an agreement, that a way must be found to achieve both 
objectives—that is federal visibility, a condition the Prime 
Minister himself put on the table, and provincial efficiency, 
which holds together the coalition of education stakeholders in 
Quebec.  So we have before us the opportunity to come up with a 
solution to a problem that could last several years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was the manpower issue, you will remember.  It took a 
strong consensus in Quebec lasting a number of years and 
repeated questioning here by the Bloc for the dam to finally give 
way and agreements to be reached ensuring Quebec control over an 
important aspect of manpower and training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be similar cases in the future, including the whole 
matter of the youth strategy.  How can Quebec be given 
responsibility for manpower training with the federal government 
retaining control over the youth strategy?  This is an example 
of work yet to be done, and the whole matter of the Canada 
Millennium Scholarship Foundation is another one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, all the vital forces in Quebec education were 
represented in Ottawa. 
These people came to tell the Prime Minister of Canada “We want 
a solution that will allow the money to be used efficiently in 
Quebec. We want to make sure it will not be sprinkled here and 
there for reasons of visibility, which would lead to unacceptable 
results. We cannot afford to waste money in the education 
sector”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1994 to 1998, the cuts to federal transfer payments 
accounted for 75 cents out of every dollar the Quebec government 
was forced to cut from the budgets for health and education. The 
situation is urgent. The federal government must negotiate in 
good faith. These negotiations must be conducted properly, which 
means that, as regards the millennium scholarship fund provided 
for in Bill C-36, the government must not act as suggested by the 
Prime Minister today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill must not be rammed through the House by the federal 
government. 
Rather, we must put things on hold and give time to the 
negotiators to find a solution in line with the amendment 
proposed by the Premier of Quebec. The purpose of this amendment 
is to allow a province that administers a financial assistance 
program designed to ensure equal opportunities, to reach an 
agreement with the federal government for fair financial 
compensation in lieu of the foundation's activities in that 
province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the request made by the Quebec government, but it is 
also the request made by all stakeholders in Quebec's education 
sector. I hope the federal government will give favourable 
consideration to this request from all Quebeckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak to this budget on behalf of the 
constituents of Dauphin—Swan River.  After surveying the 
constituency, I can report that their priorities differ from the 
priorities of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than 66% of my constituents said they wanted the reduction 
of the $583 billion debt to be the priority of any surplus.  Over 
56% said that their second priority was the reduction of the GST 
and income taxes.  Another 9% made tax relief their first 
priority.  Ten per cent wanted increased spending after the debt 
was paid down.  Only 3.2% of my constituents agreed with what the 
government is doing by increasing spending before paying down the 
debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the best things about being an MP with the Reform Party 
is that we are not only free to vote, we are expected to 
represent the views of our constituents, especially when our 
constituents' views conflict with party policy.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not lost my role as deputy critic for national unity, nor 
have I lost my standing committee memberships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what the Prime Minister did to the independent 
member for York South—Weston and Warren Allmand when they would 
not go along with the orders that came down from the top.  Warren 
Allmand was kicked out of the chair of the justice committee and 
the member for York South—Weston was first kicked out of the 
Liberal caucus and then the Liberal Party of Canada by the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867, the BNA Act, assigns 
the House of Commons the responsibility for authorizing all new 
or increased spending in taxes.  Under section 54 the crown and 
cabinet can only recommend new spending and taxes.  They cannot 
authorize, at least in theory.  Let us not forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through their member of the House of Commons the people are to 
be free to express whether or not they think increased spending 
or taxes is what they want.  That is how it is spelled out in the 
Constitution.  That is the theory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trouble is that theory is often fiction and the truth is 
very strange.  Instead of MPs who are here to serve and express 
the will of the people on spending and taxes, the government 
seems to think MPs are here to serve and express the will of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week we celebrated 150 years of responsible government, 
beginning with Baldwin and Lafontaine.  In fact, Joseph Howe 
established responsible government sometime earlier in Nova 
Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is responsible government?  It means that the crown and the 
cabinet are to be held responsible to the elected House, the 
House of the people, the House of Commons.  The House of Commons 
is not responsible to the cabinet.  Somewhere along the line we 
got it backwards and now backbenchers are expected to fall in 
line with whatever the Prime Minister and the cabinet send down 
from on high.  Responsible government is not working the way 
Joseph Howe, Baldwin and Lafontaine and so many others thought it 
should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is time to try some new ways of making sure that 
spending and taxes theoretically authorized by this House are 
supported by the people, the voters, the taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the answer?  How about the grassroots solution? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax and expenditure legislation in my home province of Manitoba 
requires that tax increases be authorized by the voters through a 
referendum.  Tax and expenditure legislation also holds the 
premier and the cabinet of Manitoba personally and financially 
responsible for any budget deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone once said that hanging concentrates the mind 
wonderfully.  Tax and expenditure legislation concentrates it 
wonderfully on the priorities of government and on careful 
management of the public's money.  After all, it is not the 
crown's money and it is not the Prime Minister's money.  It is 
not the cabinet's money.  It is not even the MPs' money.  It is 
the public's money held in trust to be spent only as necessary in 
a responsible manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone might say “We cannot do that.  We have never done it 
before”.  My first response to that is to list the seven last 
words of any dying institution or organization.  The seven last 
words of a dying institution are, “We've never done it that way 
before”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already pointed out Manitoba's pioneering use of tax and 
expenditure legislation.  Alberta has also enacted tax and 
expenditure legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even this House passed a very weak version of tax and 
expenditure legislation, the Spending Control Act, in the 34th 
Parliament.  The Spending Control Act was brought to this House 
by Don Mazankowski in 1992.  Most of us say it was too little, 
too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Spending Control Act the finance minister was required 
to aim for statutory targets on program spending and to justify 
any deficits.  The statutory targets were in effect up to March 
31, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the current finance minister really wants to make his mark on 
Canada and federal government spending policy, if he is really 
serious when he says that the mistakes of the past finance 
ministers to run deficits for more than 25 years will never be 
repeated, then he should bring in tax and expenditure legislation 
as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, one of those past finance ministers who spent us 
into a $583 billion debt, excluding liabilities, was the finance 
minister who delivered the budget speech of 1978, the current 
Prime Minister. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are glad the Prime Minister stayed in parliament long enough 
to be here to take advice from the Reform Party on how to begin 
cleaning up the mess he helped create in the 1970s.  However, 
there is still a $583 billion debt plus at least as much in CPP 
liabilities that need to be cleaned up.  If we go at the rate the 
Prime Minister and Minister of Finance propose it will take well 
over 200 years to clean up the mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister likes to compare Canada to the standards 
for European Community membership:  budget deficits at no more 
than 3% of GDP and public debts at no more than 60% of GDP.  What 
the Minister of Finance and Prime Minister forget is that those 
standards apply to the total deficits and debts of all levels of 
government: federal, provincial and municipal.  Maybe it is just 
selective memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if we deal only with federal debt, we are at between 70% 
and 75% of GDP.  If we add the current CPP liability we are at 
something like 140% and 150% of GDP.  If we add health care 
liabilities for the next 20 years, even I do not want to think 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance do in 
the last parliament?  They cut $4 billion in funding for health 
care and offloaded even more of the liability on to the 
provinces.  If that is Liberal social conscience, I would like to 
know where is the conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Prime Minister really wants to do something in the new 
millennium for Canada's youth then he should take steps to make 
sure that Canada's youth are not saddled with a huge public debt 
and high taxes for the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance should bring in 
tax expenditure legislation that does the following.  First, I 
suggest they should require the public accounts to be balanced 
over the life of a parliament.  Second, they should require 
public approval for any new or increased taxes.  Third, they 
should require any budget surplus to be applied to lowering the 
debt and taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, members of the House should never forget that they 
have a constitutional responsibility to authorize only the 
spending and taxes people want.  Tax and expenditure legislation 
would go far in sending a clear message to Canadians that we 
understand it is their money and that we take our responsibility 
to them seriously. 
<P><A NAME="LINK184"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to speak to the debate at second 
reading of the budget implementation act.  I will take a little 
different tact from what my peers have done.  They addressed a 
number of aspects of the budget and I concur with their comments. 
However, I want to take a little different direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first point out that I believe this has to be a good 
process. Surely this is where the parliamentary process should be 
at its best.  There can be a tendency, though, so I am told, due 
to the pressures and demands on our time, to lose sight of the 
fact that the decisions made here affect everyday people. 
Incrementally the lives of every Canadian are affected by every 
decision made in the House.  This is particularly true of budget 
decisions, something of which many Canadians have become 
painfully aware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I think it is useful to remind ourselves of whom it 
is we are here to serve.  It is the people of Canada and their 
positions on the issues of the day.  Are we reflecting their 
position?  How will individuals in our ridings be affected by the 
decisions we make? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us always be primarily mindful of the impacts on everyday 
Canadians and their families, not the partisan lobby groups that 
promise to re-elect us, not the self-proclaimed cultural elite 
that feel compelled to decide for us what Canadians need, and not 
the political favours being traded. Let us decide on the basis of 
how it will affect the lives of members of our constituencies who 
put us here.  Let us reflect their concerns and make common sense 
decisions consistent with their desires and best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is within this context that I wish to make my comments on 
behalf of the families I represent.  In Canada we pride ourselves 
on being fair and non-prejudicial. 
Yet for years we have tolerated an injustice perpetrated on the 
families of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The tax policies of this “liberal” government send a signal to 
parents who wish to be the primary caregivers of their children 
and raise them at home.  That message is that this choice has no 
value.  However, if they pay someone else to care for their 
children it does have value and is recognized in the tax 
treatment.  The government is telling us, through its tax 
treatment, that parenting has no value or at least far less value 
than institutionalized care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's message is negatively prejudicial against 
parents who wish to be the primary caregivers of their children. 
Over and above that, studies indicate that institutionalized 
child care is generally speaking—not always; there are always 
some exceptions—not in the best interest of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under current tax laws in Canada, parents who choose to pay 
someone else to care for their children can claim the expense. 
Those who can or choose to forgo other activities and invest the 
majority of their time into the care and training of their 
children are told by our tax department that their efforts have 
no value.  Therefore no tax considerations are given.  This is a 
bad message.  It is unfair and detrimental to the stability of 
our nation, and many families are calling out for changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has its priorities wrong by stating that 
parenting has less value than non-parental care, as implied by 
the tax treatment, and Canadians know this.  We clearly recognize 
that not every one is able, due to circumstances or other 
personal reasons, to provide full time care for their children; 
but that is not a reason to treat unfairly those who choose to 
commit full time effort to caring and training of future 
generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason the Reform Party has been calling for 
unfair prejudicial treatment to end by working to see implemented 
a child care deduction to all parents, including those who care 
for their children at home: $5,000 for every child under seven 
and $3,000 for every child seven to twelve years of age. Parents 
who can and want to should be encouraged, not discouraged, to 
provide as much direct parental care as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we take this position?  It is what many families are 
calling for.  It is well backed up by sound research that 
increased parental care is in the interest of the children.  So 
it follows that it would be in the long term best interest of our 
country.  They are our future citizens, our future leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to refer to some thorough and respected research done 
on this very topic.  The research I have today is from a well 
known research firm, the National Foundation for Research and 
Education on the Family.  I will quote from a study it did for 
the Ontario government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It found by more than a 10 to 1 margin that Ontarians felt it 
preferable for a young child to be at home with a parent than to 
be in institutionalized day care.  It also found 77% of parents 
who had their children in non-parental care would have preferred 
to have provided parental care in retrospect.  In addition, 
parents prefer family to day care.  Given the choice between day 
care and a relative, 73% said that a relative would be preferable 
to institutionalized day care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on.  I have a number of studies, but for the sake of 
time I quote from a cross-Canada study done in 1991.  The 
question was:  “If you had the choice, would you stay at home to 
raise your children or would you work outside your home and use 
day care?”  Of course 70% said “Certainly I would prefer to 
stay home”.  It was by far the majority, yet we have tax 
policies and tax treatment today which say this has no value but 
institutionalized day care does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason I brought this matter forward today.  For some 
time now the Reform Party, as part of its policies, called for 
change in this area and for fair treatment of families. 
We argue that parents should have access to at least equal tax 
treatment which is not dependent on how they choose to care for 
their children.  It is a reasonable position.  Reform cares about 
families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from our policy book one of our key principles that 
has been foundational to the Reform Party and the reason I raise 
this issue today.  Our seventh principle says that the Reform 
Party recognizes the importance of strengthening and protecting 
the family unit as essential to the well-being of individuals and 
society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize in our policy book that it is the duty of 
parents to raise children according to their own conscience and 
beliefs.  We further affirm that no person or government or 
agency has the right to interfere with the exercise of that duty 
as long as the actions of parents do not constitute abuse or 
neglect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party recognizes the important work that parents do. 
We want to give them every opportunity and encouragement to 
invest in the lives of future generations.  Why?  Because it is 
in the long term best interest of a strong and healthy society in 
the years to come.  Unfortunately the Liberal budget like many 
before it does not respect this principle or the work that 
parents do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-36, an 
act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 24, 1998, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened to 
the members who spoke before me and raised specific issues 
relating to the budget measures. I want to present a more global 
view of the measures proposed in the 1998-99 budget. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comments will be based on the fact that last year, as members 
will recall, the Bloc Quebecois said that the budget for the 
year now ending underestimated certain revenues, and that by the 
end of the fiscal year the Minister of Finance would end up, as 
is the case today, with sizable surpluses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, as members will certainly recall, the Minister of 
Finance said the Bloc Quebecois had not done its homework, that 
its predictions would not come true, and that there would be a 
deficit of some magnitude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surprise, surprise, the Bloc Quebecois was right. The Minister 
of Finance managed to get more revenues than anticipated, with 
the result that the deficit became that much smaller. However, 
taxpayers also saw their income get smaller, because the 
additional money was taken from their pockets by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year, it feels like we are watching the same scenario 
again. It is like the sequel to last year's scenario. Once again, 
the Minister of Finance will not divulge the true revenues that 
can be anticipated in the new fiscal year that begins tomorrow. 
This brings me to some important considerations if the government 
is to treat Canadian taxpayers with respect. After all, they are 
the ones who provide the government's revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that if the government collects more money than 
it needs, then it is overtaxing Canadians. 
This is the sort of situation we are currently in.  It was not 
the case last year.  Revenues were higher than expected, but 
expenses were greater than the expected, or even actual, 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the budget measures proposed, next year's deficit is 
supposed to be zero, which means that any excess revenue will 
amount to a surplus.  If only a few dollars are involved, for 
heaven's sake, we are hardly going to claim taxpayers have been 
overtaxed.  But we are not talking about a few dollars here, we 
are talking about billions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at a 24-month period, we are talking in the order of 
between $20 and $30 billion.  A huge sum.  Especially since the 
Minister of Finance is not declaring it. 
As a member in this House I am concerned, because the budget 
measures have to be approved by this House.  We are debating the 
fiscal year before us in order to reach a conclusion through a 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But if what we are debating is incomplete, when will we debate 
the use of these potential surpluses we expect will materialize? 
Our expectation is all the stronger because the same situation 
occurred last year, and we were right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are debating now and will vote on is not the whole of the 
budget, which will be managed next year.  I fear, and I do not 
think I am alone, that revenues in the order of several billion 
dollars, indeed tens of billions of dollars, will be beyond the 
reach of the democratic control exercised by the members of this 
House. 
The government is making arrangements to use the money as it 
pleases. Will it pay off the debt with it? I wish it would, but I 
do not think that is what will happen. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance was quite clear in his budget 
announcements. He will apply to paying down the debt at most $3 
billion, an amount he has set aside in a contingency fund. If 
there are contingencies, then this amount will not be available 
and the debt will not be paid down, while billions in extra 
revenues accumulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If any money is applied to the debt, at the rate of $3 billion a 
year, I can tell you that it is going to take 200 years to pay 
it off. It seems somewhat ridiculous to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I want to get back to what I wanted to say. What will the 
Minister of Finance do with extra revenues during the fiscal 
year starting tomorrow morning? There is nothing in the bill 
about that. In fact, the Minister of Finance, who is a Liberal, 
has been very conservative; he has taken a liberal approach to 
spending and a conservative approach to revenues. Well, we are 
used to seeing people  change colours overnight. It seems to be a 
real fad lately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have the finance minister, who is conservative with 
revenues, telling us that revenues will match expenditures 
exactly. But in fact, we know—we can tell and foresee—that he 
will have perhaps $10 billion, between $8 billion and $12 
billion, at the end of fiscal year 1998-99. Where will this money 
go? Who will be responsible for deciding what it should be 
allocated to? The members of this House perhaps? Certainly not. 
There is nothing about that in these budget provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will most likely be covered in an addendum to operating 
expenditures, indicating that the amounts were used for this or 
that purpose, or else a fund will be established to carry forward 
the amount for God knows what new project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that, with this budget, with the measures we are 
debating here, the Minister of Finance is hiding several billion 
dollars, the use of which cannot be debated democratically. And 
democracy is something we care very much about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by saying that the Minister of Finance lacks 
transparency here and is failing his duty. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK193"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak against Bill C-36, the budget implementation 
act.  I would like to start by giving the House a few reasons for 
my rejection and my constituents' rejection of the budget 
implementation act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing of course is that budgets are more than just 
numbers.  A federal budget is about people and it is an 
opportunity for the government to express the hopes, dreams and 
aspirations of the people of Canada through an annual budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget this year has some hopes, dreams and aspirations in 
it.  Unfortunately it covers only those dreams and hopes of two 
people, the finance minister who has dreams, hopes and 
aspirations of being the prime Minister one day, and the Prime 
Minister who is developing this millennium scholarship fund so 
that he will never be forgotten in Canadian history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can say with certainty that this Prime Minister and this 
government will never be forgotten by this Canadian public ever 
for what they have done to the Canadian people when it comes to 
the dreams, the hopes and the aspirations of those Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several problems and many things wrong with this 
budget.  One problem that was identified by the Reform Party and 
also by Canadians overwhelmingly is that there is no plan to pay 
the debt down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a huge problem for Canadians and for any federal 
government because it takes a huge portion of the federal budget 
to service that debt. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555
<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why that is such a problem.  That money for servicing 
the debt could be put into transfers to the provinces for health 
care, education and programs that really make a difference to 
Canadians.  This government has failed Canadians in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conducted a survey in my riding.  Ninety-four per cent of 
those in my riding responded in favour of debt reduction.  They 
said that 20% to 50% of any budget surpluses should be directed 
in this area.  This budget fails to address that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point is there is no net tax relief measures in the 
budget.  The Liberals will boast that Canadians will be better 
off after the budget.  That is like jumping from the frying pan 
into the fire.  I have heard it said that to cook a frog put the 
frog in the pot, put it on the stove and slowly turn up the heat. 
Before you know it the frog will not jump out of the water. He 
will just sit there and get cooked. That is what this 
government is doing with this budget. It is cooking Canadians to 
the point where we cannot stand the amount of taxes in this 
country.  I will get into that a little later in my remarks 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituents of Okanagan—Coquihalla value some of the 
programs they get from government.  They want a strong health 
care system.  They want a system that will ensure that they can 
get a decent education.  They want a government that will provide 
vital services like national defence, foreign affairs and a 
criminal justice system that actually works for law abiding 
citizens.  These are the types of programs for which Canadians 
are proud to say they pay taxes, for those programs that mean so 
much to all of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the hardworking people in my riding do not want to see is 
their tax dollars being wasted on programs that are not 
essential.  The best example of this is the interest we have to 
pay on the debt as a result of Liberal and Conservative 
governments time after time living far too high on the hog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayers are paying about $45 billion a year just to pay the 
interest on our national debt.  The average taxpayer pays over 
$21,000 in federal taxes. Roughly one-third of that goes to 
paying the interest on the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of British Columbia in particular are feeling more 
than a little abused as a result of the taxes they pay.  B.C. 
today has the highest taxes in all of North America.  The average 
family income in British Columbia is approximately $58,000 a 
year.  The average tax bill for those families is approximately 
$29,000 a year.  That is an overwhelming amount of tax for one 
family to have to pay.  While all Canadians need tax relief, it 
is needed nowhere more than in my province of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hardworking people in my riding are tired of seeing their 
tax dollars flow to Ottawa and never return.  This government 
continues to take but puts little back into the province of B.C. 
Last year transfers from the federal government accounted for 
only 7.9% of the provincial revenues.  That is the lowest in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other provinces receive much higher amounts from the federal 
government.  For example, 43% of Newfoundland's provincial budget 
comes from the federal government.  For New Brunswick that figure 
is 45.5%.  For Quebec 17.6% comes from federal coffers. The 
Canadian average is 16.9%.  For British Columbians it is at 9.7%. 
Once again the rest of the country gets the gold and we know 
xactly what B.C. gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government continues to take from B.C. and does not give 
back.  I will give members an example.  Fruit growers in my 
riding have experienced this firsthand.  In 1997 orchardists in 
the Okanagan and Similkameen valleys were devastated by the worst 
hail storm in 100 years and other severe weather related 
disasters. Fruit growers sought immediate assistance under the 
Agricultural Marketing Programs Act, to no avail.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of agriculture blamed the banks when in fact the 
orchardists and the people of British Columbia knew it was not a 
problem with the banks, it was a problem with the federal Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, it took less than one month for the maple syrup 
producers affected by the ice storm to begin receiving 
compensation.  In fact, a new program called the ice storm 
recovery program was designed to provide an additional $50 
million for part time farmers, specifically meeting the 
conditions of these producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>B.C. fruit growers, on the other hand, waited almost a year and 
are still waiting while the producers in central Canada wait less 
than a month.  Where is the fairness?  Where is the equality in a 
system like that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another problem in my riding and in British Columbia is in the 
softwood lumber industry.  The industry is in serious difficulty 
because of the federal Liberal government's mishandling of the 
export quota system.  In 1995 the Liberals struck a softwood 
lumber deal with the Americans.  They say they made the deal to 
ensure fair treatment of our lumber products being exported to 
the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Liberals actually did was put themselves of telling 
every Canadian lumber firm, no matter how big or how small, how 
much lumber they can export to the U.S.  As a result of this 
bureaucratic nightmare it has cost my province and my riding jobs 
in that softwood lumber industry.  That is not good enough from 
this government and we want to change that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see my time is running out.  There are so many things that are 
wrong with the government's handling of the budget but I will not 
have time to address them all.  However, I would like to close 
with the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus of the budget should have been debt reduction and on 
tax relief.  The constituents of my riding said so and Canadians 
from coast to coast said so.  Instead, the focus has been on new 
spending in a sphere of provincial jurisdiction, the $2.5 billion 
scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the biggest flaw in the new millennium scholarship fund 
is its abuse of the Constitution.  The government continues to 
abuse its constitutional spending power by spending without 
consultation and without co-operation in the provincial areas of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started off this afternoon saying that budgets are about 
people and should be about people, about dreams, about hopes and 
about aspirations.  They should be about a government that has a 
vision that is going to carry us into a new era in the year 2000. 
However, this budget fails to do that.  This budget should have 
been about young people who are looking for their first job, 
about young people and young families who want to buy their first 
homes, about single mothers who are trying to make end meets and 
for the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that the government has let those people down. 
That is why I am proud to stand opposed to the budget 
implementation act, Bill C-36. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to

introduced by the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Frontenac—Mégantic, I cannot go along with this 
bill. The budget that was tabled contains many inequities, one of 
which is the millennium scholarship foundation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These scholarships are an obsession that is making our Prime 
Minister sick.  They are raising a ruckus, not just with Quebec 
but with all the provinces, because he is going to show the 
scholarships, which are worth $2.5 billion, in the spending for 
1997-98, when the bill has not yet been passed and when this 
amount will not be spent until the third millennium, over two 
years from now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are looking at a disgraceful duplication of public funds. 
Once again, I am reminded of the duplication we have in the 
Department of Agriculture with a Holstein cow. When her 
production is used for commercial milk, she comes under the 
jurisdiction of Quebec's agriculture minister. 
When her production is used for industrial milk, she comes under 
the jurisdiction of the federal agriculture minister.  One cow 
and two agriculture ministers to look after her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it will be the same for a student.  The Government of Quebec 
has been giving scholarships and loans since 1960.  Now, the good 
Prime Minister of Canada, out of generosity, and a wish to see 
the maple leaf on the cheques, is again going to duplicate 
structures and this is going to cost hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we had one Holstein cow and two agriculture ministers, we 
will have one student and two levels of government offering 
scholarships.  In reality, this will not mean one cent more for 
the student. That is the sad and unfortunate fact of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec Premier Lucien Bouchard, accompanied by most of the 
university presidents, came to Ottawa yesterday to meet with the 
Prime Minister of Canada, and to try to bring him back on track. 
Since the Prime Minister does not wish to lose face, the task 
has been entrusted for the next two months to two deputy 
ministers—who have already succeeded in breaking certain 
impasses—to keep the PM from losing face while allowing Quebec to 
opt out of these famous millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind the House that clauses 29(1) and 25(2) do not, in 
fact, allow Quebec or other provinces to opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will not be the milk cow that will be penalized in this case, 
but the students. When they mess with our future, when they mess 
with our children, that is really tragic.  I trust that the 
government will get back down to earth within the next few 
months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point that prevents us from accepting the Minister of 
Finance's bill is the fate he has in mind for the hundreds of 
thousands of housewives.  I have had the pleasure of speaking to 
dozens of women in my riding who belong to the AFEAS.  I have, 
for instance, met Mrs. Yvonne Provençal and Mrs. Marie-Paule 
Giroux of the Disraeli region.  In Lac-Mégantic I have had the 
pleasure of meeting with AFEAS members from Piopolis, Woburn and 
Lac-Mégantic, and they too have shared their concerns with me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are totally justified in being concerned, for the Minister 
of Finance plans to consider total family income when determining 
the amount of old age pension they will receive. 
This is true for most women who stay at home or on the farm to

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, your mother, who played the role of nurse, 
educator, seamstress and cook and who comforted you when you were 
young, was not on any company's payroll. To determine the amount 
of the cheque she will receive when she reaches 65, the 
government will take her spouse's revenue, A plus B divided by 
two, to obtain an average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the great majority of cases, homemakers will again be the 
first ones to be penalized, which is very sad. 
I hope my Liberal colleagues opposite will stand up to make the 
finance minister, a millionaire who has completely lost touch 
with Canada's and Quebec's reality, come to his senses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that convinces me to vote against Bill C-36 is the 
two year EI premium holiday that will be given to employers 
only. My colleague from the New Democratic Party, who defeated 
the former Minister of Human Resources Development in the last 
elections, was telling us this week, and rightly so, that we are 
opening a door that will allow employers not to contribute to the 
employment insurance fund. That is dangerous for workers, who pay 
ever increasing EI premiums without being fully entitled to 
benefits. That explains why it is estimated that the employment 
insurance fund will have a $19 billion surplus next year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us turn now to another issue that prompts me to vote against 
Bill C-36. Two weeks ago, here in Ottawa, during the recent 
biennial convention of the Liberal Party of Canada, Dr. Wagner, a 
distinguished resident of Saint-Hyacinthe, put the following 
question to the Prime Minister of Canada: “Mr. Prime Minister, 
are you going to put money into hospital care?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Wagner knew full well that, during the last four years, the 
Liberal government has cut nothing less than $42 billion in 
transfers to the provinces. Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, 
Ontario and all the other provinces had to cut in health care and 
seniors' homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to point out again that the government has no idea of 
what is going on in the countryside, in our villages and in our 
towns. The finance minister is no model for the government. 
Instead of doing the right thing and paying his taxes here in 
Canada, he has registered his fleet of ships in some tax havens. 
It is a crying shame to have this guy managing the $160 billion 
we put in his hands, year in and year out. If he were to do the 
right thing and to pay his taxes here in Canada, he might have 
more money to manage, we might have less money to pay and he 
might do his work a little more conscientiously.

rise to speak on Bill C-36, the budget implementation act.  The 
reason I will be very resoundingly voting against the bill is 
that contained within the bill is the fact that the government is 
not adhering to standard accounting practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The words of the auditor general are: “I believe the change 
will open the door for governments to influence reported results 
by simply announcing intentions in their budgets and then 
deciding what to include in the deficit or surplus after the end 
of the year once preliminary numbers are known”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an unqualified person.  This is the Auditor General 
of Canada who is expressing severe concern about the way in which 
this Liberal government is currently administering the finances 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stand on behalf of a number of people when I come here in my 
role as the member of Parliament for Kootenay—Columbia.  I would 
like to refer to an e-mail that I received from one of my 
constituents on March 2, 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constituent writes that her husband is employed at a planer 
mill.  His income is over $60,000, which sounds like a lot of 
money, but she said I should keep reading.  She said they have 
just sent in last year's income tax and, if it is correct, they 
will have paid $21,552.91 in income tax, Canada pension plan and 
unemployment insurance premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This works out to almost 31% of the couple's income.  If sales 
taxes, hidden taxes, municipal taxes and the others are added, it 
means that almost 50% of their income goes to taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The woman goes on to say that there are four of them living on 
her husband's wages.  She worked at B.C. Gas until January 1994. 
She quit because in 1993 her husband and she paid more in income 
tax, Canada pension plan and UI premiums than the amount of her 
take-home pay and she was earning almost $20 an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The couple has a daughter living at home who works part time and 
a son who is presently attending college.  She said that their 
budget is very tight, to say the least.  They are at the point 
where they pay the bills, buy some groceries and put gas in their 
vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The couple has not taken a holiday since 1993.  Since the woman 
quit work, they have had to replace their furnace, hot water 
tank, washing machine, dishwasher and the fence around their 
yard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the winter of 1996-97 the couple's roof leaked. 
Therefore, last summer they sold their car so they could afford 
to replace the roof.  They are now driving a 1984 Jimmy that they 
repaired with the balance of the money they got for their car. 
They have just one vehicle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The woman concludes that it is no wonder local businesses are 
having hard times.  She and her husband cannot afford to buy 
anything that they really do not need and she suspects that many 
others are in the same boat.  Unless they get a break on taxes 
they will not be spending any more than they have to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can this constituent have any confidence in the investment 
that she, her husband and her family have made in this government 
when they, one way or the other, turn over 50% of their income to 
this and other levels of government and when this government is 
not even adhering to the watchdog, the Auditor General of Canada, 
who says that the way the government is doing its books is 
effectively cooking the books? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter I referred to is not the only one I have received 
from constituents who have expressed concern about the way this 
government so cavalierly mismanages the finances of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the election I had a rather interesting experience.  The 
Liberal candidate accused me of going into a senior's home in 
Revelstoke and taking in a bogus financial adviser to tell them 
what was going on with Liberal government policy.  I was told 
that I had scared those seniors so much the Liberal candidate 
could not even get the ear of the seniors in this home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was rather laughable because, as I pointed out to him in 
debate during the campaign, the adviser who I had taken in with 
me was a civil servant in the employ of the government, in the 
human resources department, who had gone to advise the seniors on 
the policies of the government.  These are the policies that are 
going to rip off 75% of their income over $24,000.  The only 
thing that Canadians got from the speech of the finance minister 
was that the government was going to look into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not adequate.  That is not even remotely adequate 
because Canadians want to be able to look after themselves. 
Canadians want to know what the rules are going to be.  In this 
piece of legislation the government is walking away from the 
recommendation of the auditor general who says that the 
government is doing it wrong, that it is breaking the rules with 
respect to the $2.5 billion millennium fund, that it cannot do it 
that way.  What did this government do?  It said that it will 
invent new ways.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, the finance minister said on March 18 in 
this House “Let us understand that the world evolves, things 
change and governments must adapt”.  What cannot be adapted at a 
whim by this finance minister, this Prime Minister or this 
Liberal government are accounting rules.  Accounting rules are in 
place so that the seniors in my constituency, so that this woman 
in my constituency who has written this heartfelt letter, can 
have a feeling of confidence that this government is being 
straight up and straightforward and is putting all of the numbers 
on the table.  It is not doing that according to the auditor 
general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not anything that was fabricated by the Reform Party. 
This came from the Auditor General of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What were my constituents to think when the finance minister 
stood to say that he was going to remove the 3% surtax, which was 
imposed by the Tories when they were in power, for 85% of the 
population?  He said this as though he should be getting some 
great credit.  In fact, what he failed to tell us, which we all 
knew anyway, was that it was a deficit elimination surtax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has this government boasted of?  This government has 
boasted that it has eliminated the deficit.  So what right does 
this finance minister have to keep even 15% of Canadians paying 
the deficit elimination surtax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is called honesty in government.  It is called full 
disclosure.  This government is not into full disclosure because 
it knows if it was the people of Canada would take the time to 
listen and realize that they are being sold a bill of goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will be successful in passing this budget 
implementation bill because of its majority.  By virtue of its 
majority it has shut off debate in the House of Commons and we 
will be voting on it tonight.  The government has brought in time 
allocation to force this thing through.  This bill will do 
nothing more than change the rules in the face of the auditor 
general who is saying, “No, that is wrong.  You can't do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really do not know what goes through the mind of Canada's 
naturally governing party.  That is the way it visualizes itself. 
It is here forever.  It will assume the centre of the road.  It 
will say anything and do anything to assume the position of being 
Canada's naturally governing party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have to wake up.  We have to call on these people to 
be accountable.  If enough of us stand up, if enough of us speak 
up, sooner or later the government jig will be up. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Aileen Carroll (Barrie—Simcoe—Bradford, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this debate is about the provisions in the recent 
budget, a budget that was made possible because the Government of 
Canada carried out the wishes of Canadians.  Their message was 
loud and clear:  eliminate the deficit and get our fiscal house 
in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have accomplished that.  Now Canadians will be the 
beneficiaries of the sacrifices they have made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This budget commits 80% of new spending to two of Canadians' 
highest priorities:  health care and more opportunities to 
improve our knowledge and skills in competitive workplaces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can think of no better way to direct our resources than to 
help young Canadians prepare for the 21st century.  They are the 
leaders of tomorrow and we must do what we can to ensure they are 
able to meet the challenges of the knowledge based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year we introduced our youth employment strategy which 
helps young Canadians make the often difficult transition between 
school and work.  Through programs such as Youth Service Canada, 
Youth Internship Canada and Summer Career Placements we are 
helping our young men and young women to gain valuable work 
experience which will help equip them with the skills necessary 
for today's labour market.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will build on these foundations with new measures that 
encourage youth employment and, equally important, we will ensure 
that all our youth are given the opportunity to fulfill their 
education potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Governor General said in last September's Speech from the 
Throne, there is no better way to mark the millennium than to 
invest in Canadian youth.  That is why we announced the Canada 
millennium scholarship fund.  Hon. members know that over 10 
years the fund will award scholarships to more than 100,000 full 
and part time students and it will do so annually.  It will begin 
with an initial endowment from the federal government of $2.5 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard concerns expressed that the millennium scholarships 
will infringe upon provincial jurisdiction and will duplicate 
provincial programs.  I want to ensure hon. colleagues that this 
will not be the case.  The Government of Canada fully recognizes 
that education falls under provincial jurisdiction, but our 
history shows that both the federal and provincial governments 
have worked together to assist Canadians who face financial 
barriers to learning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal role goes back to the post World War II years when 
we first provided assistance to veterans who wished to complete 
their post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no need for apprehension regarding infringement.  The 
millennium scholarships will be administered by a millennium 
scholarship foundation, an independent body which will be at 
arm's length from the federal government.  Part of the 
foundation's mandate will be to consult with provincial 
authorities and the post-secondary education community to build 
upon existing programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1964 the Canada student loans program has helped make 
post-secondary education more accessible by providing students 
with loans.  This government has continued that tradition and in 
the 1997 budget we extended interest relief from 18 to 30 months 
for borrowers having difficulty repaying their loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are expanding assistance even more.  All borrowers will 
receive tax relief for interest on federal and provincial student 
loans and we will provide a 17% tax credit for the interest 
portion of what they repay each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Quebec does not participate in the Canada student loans 
program, the province is entitled to compensation if its program 
has substantially the same effect as the CSLP.  With respect to 
reduction of student debt, the Government of Canada will review 
provincial measures with Quebec to see if they have a similar 
effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also addressing the challenge of helping families finance 
their children's post-secondary education long before they reach 
the post-secondary level.  The new Canada education savings grant 
will benefit all families, but especially low and middle income 
families.  The secret is to start early and to make regular 
contributions.  The government will encourage this through the 
savings grant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if a family contributed $25 to a registered 
education plan every two weeks for 15 years, their child would 
have $4,700 available for each of the four years of higher 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous two budgets included measures to make RESPs more 
attractive by raising the annual and lifetime contribution 
limits.  The new Canada education savings grant will pay 20% on 
the first $2,000 in annual contributions for children up to age 
18.  The maximum annual grant will be $400 per child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saving for your child's education through RESPs means you will 
benefit from the savings grant and the tax-free growth of 
investment income.  The savings grant will make RESPs among the 
most attractive savings vehicles available for a child's 
education.  RESPs will definitely be one of the best things 
parents and other relatives can do for their children, for nieces 
or nephews. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of children, hon. members will recall that in the 1997 
budget we enriched the Canada child tax benefit by $850 million 
effective this July.  We promised further enrichment and we are 
delivering on that promise in this budget.  We are committing an 
additional $850 million, spread over two years, beginning in July 
1999 and again in July 2000.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, the budget proposes to increase the dollar limits for 
the child care expense deduction by $2,000 for children under 7 
and by $1,000 for older children.  This measure will provide tax 
relief of about $45 million for some 65,000 Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As honourable members have pointed out on more than one 
occasion, we must continue to address the unacceptably high youth 
unemployment rate. The youth employment strategy is tackling that 
problem as will provisions under the new Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  But we are also addressing youth unemployment quite 
specifically by challenging the private sector to hire more 
Canadian young men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers who hire youth between the ages of 18 and 24 in 1999 
and 2000 will pay no employment insurance premiums for those new 
workers.  All companies will be eligible, not just small 
companies as was the case in the new hires program which ends 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that this new measure will reduce payroll costs 
for employers by $100 million annually in both 1999 and 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The budget clarified the Government of Canada's intention to 
make effective changes in the guaranteed income supplement, GIS, 
and the spouses allowance program, the SPA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will move the beginning of the GIS/SPA payment year from 
April to July.  This will give needy seniors an additional three 
months to submit their income statements.  This will ensure that 
the income tested payments of these individuals will not be cut 
off and the definition of income used to calculate payments will 
be more in keeping with those used for income tax purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I began this debate by saying the budget is the result of 
sacrifices made by Canadians to eliminate the deficit and ensure 
fiscal responsibility.  I congratulate Canadians for their 
determination to stay the course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All hon. members can help us move in that direction by 
supporting Bill C-36. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, contrary to the last speaker I certainly do not intend 
to be supporting the budget implementation act.  The problems 
with it are quite massive. However, we cannot deal with 
everything at one time in one speech; 10 minutes is just too 
little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are good things in the budget but there are a lot of 
things that could have been done differently, that could have 
been done properly, that could have been done in keeping with 
what the provincial governments around Canada would like to have 
seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duplication and the wasted money were just dripping from the 
last member's speech.  I could see it and feel it.  I believe 
that had this budget been properly prepared we would see a lot of 
benefits going to Canadians in actual dollars that are now going 
to be wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to deal with education for a minute since that was 
a topic recently brought up.  We have in Canada two essential 
elements to our society that are really the basis for everything 
else.  Those two elements are health and education. Without a 
good solid health program properly financed, people are not 
capable of working, and without education they will not know how 
to do the job in the new economy that has developed after the 
industrial revolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has great taxing powers and is able to 
use those tax powers to take a lot of money from all of us.  That 
is not a bad thing in itself because some provinces certainly 
need a bit more help than others.  However, when the federal 
government takes money away from taxpayers and from provinces, as 
it flows through Ottawa a certain amount is going to stay in 
administrative fees, in commissions, regulations and all kinds of 
things. 
In this balanced budget the funding for education was to go 
through the hands of the federal government.

all students in this country the money for education should not 
have gone into this millennium fund, this $2 billion, $3 billion, 
I cannot remember the exact figure now that we start talking 
billions of dollars.

<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was certainly a pleasure to walk down to that other 
place to receive a blessing of sorts for duties that we do here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to finish off with the education theme.  The basic 
concept is that money has to be spent in the most efficient, 
effective way possible.  The things we are doing in Canada and in 
the government should not be simply for our political benefit. We 
should be doing things for our constituents and our provinces 
that are in their best interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of education, the best interest of Manitoba as I was 
explaining—I will not speak for other provinces—would be to 
have that money flow directly to the provincial government as 
opposed to being put through the millennium fund or through other 
federal government programs that require duplication of 
administration, extra boards, extra audits and those kinds of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priorities in government spending can be seen differently by 
different parties, but some basic truths and beliefs should 
always be adhered to.  One of those is that if we spend ourselves 
into a big hole and get into big debt over the years, at some 
point we will have to get out of it.  The province of Manitoba 
has taken its budget and shown the way for the federal 
government. 
It has done this by attacking the debt at the start of a budget 
surplus or a balanced budget.

</I></B></P><P align=left>By doing a front end attack on debt the amount of interest that 
has to be paid at the start is lowered.  The government seems to 
want to do it at the end.  Things change over the years and maybe 
it will never get done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on the Manitoba budget, not because it 
is a perfect budget but because of the instruction it can give to 
the House.  I understand Manitoba's debt is around $6.8 billion. 
The provincial government put $150 million against the debt in 
its last budget some few months ago.  It kind of promised, as did 
this government, to do something about the debt.  In fact it had 
promised $75 million toward the debt.  It doubled that because of 
the compound effect of paying off the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the compound effect of the extra $75 million was factored 
in over the 30 year debt repayment plan it was worth $300 million 
and knocked nine months of payments off the books.  Hon. members 
will notice that it has an actual plan.  It is not just some 
promise that it is maybe going to happen or that it will work 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of investment, if members want to look at it like 
that, will pay big dividends in the area of social programs, 
education, health or any of the things as I explained earlier are 
the basis of society and have to be in place for anything else to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the present time interest on the debt is costing Manitobans 
about $520 million every year, which works out to $450 per 
person.  If we did not have to pay the interest and that money 
were left in the hands of Manitobans, most people would spend it 
and the first thing we know jobs would be created and everybody 
would be better off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was pleased to speak on a couple of points.  I hope the 
government in future budgets will take heed of our words.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-36, an 
act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in 
Parliament on February 24, 1998, be now read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Portage—Lisgar, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the House and add a few 
comments to this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I looked at some of the stats and listened to some of the debate 
in the House today.  I wondered why is the Liberal government 
trying to postpone all of these goodies further down the road 
instead of implementing them pronto as the need is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange the government would want to wait until the year 
2000 to bring forward the scholarship fund if there is a 
desperate need for it.  I would have thought the government would 
have said it should be retroactive when I look at the debt load of 
students today and the need that is there.  Why not make it 
retroactive?  That is where the need is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the statistics, we probably lose 10%, 15% or perhaps 
as many as 20% of our graduates to the United States where they 
are able to acquire better job opportunities.  What is the 
government doing?  It is probably delaying the inevitable that 
sooner or later government will have to realize that jobs are 
either provided to people in our country or amalgamation takes 
place with the U.S. so that there are job guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brought me to thoughts about the years when I grew up. 
Across the way are Liberal members who have that shade of colour 
I have in my hair and maybe some of them are even minus some 
hair. They will probably remember some of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I finished elementary school and was only fortunate enough to go 
through grade 11 because of health problems in my family.  My 
younger brothers and sister were able to go to university.  What 
did it cost my folks at that time to send one of their kids to 
university? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my younger brothers loved to raise a calf or two each 
year.  That calf put him through university.  He did not have to 
go to the bank to borrow money.  Dad gave my brother the calf at 
its birth. He looked after it and raised it. Dad supplied the 
pasture. My brother had funds to go to university.  That was very 
easy.  Nobody was denied this opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that it was so easy in those days? They had their 
priorities right.  They did not have taxes taken off every little 
bit that they sold or every little bit that they earned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first year as a farmer I only rented 60 acres of cropland 
from a neighbour.  After I had the crop harvested I was wealthy 
enough to buy a brand new pick-up truck. It was one of the 
fanciest trucks; it was two toned, had a radio and all the extras 
you could get.  The cost of that pick-up truck was $1,400 
Canadian, which took me less than 1,000 bushels a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today a half-ton truck with all the extras on it will cost at 
least $35,000.  At the price of wheat today at least 10,000 
bushels will be needed. 
If we look at the 10,000 bushels, it is not just the wheat, but 
first of all at least 50% has to come off for taxes. Therefore at 
least 20,000 bushels will be needed to buy that truck. It is 
astounding that things have gone this way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the young pages.  They want the opportunities that I 
had and that my brothers and sister had. They had the opportunity 
to get an education.  If they wanted to, it was there.  The 
finances were there.  There was no problem. People could afford 
to send their families to university. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today that does not hold true.  I talk to my constituents.  A 
mechanic said to me one day “This is my wage.  This is what I 
take home or what I should be taking home, but after the taxes 
and all the other deductions come off, I can barely afford to put 
food on the table without sending my kids to university. They 
have no opportunity to go.  If you do not have somebody who will 
co-sign for you, it is pretty hard to get student loans even at 
the bank.  It is not that easy”.  That is why I feel for the 
younger generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why has this happened?  How did we get into this mess?  I look 
at the $600 billion of debt, and I look at the $42 billion in 
interest to service that debt and then look at this millennium 
fund at $2.5 billion.  Something does not add up.  There is $42 
billion blown into the wind.  Why?  Because politicians for the 
previous 30 years thought that if they wanted to maintain power 
in this House they had to buy votes by making promises. Promises 
can only be made and kept if you pay for them.  If you do not pay 
for them, it is going to cost you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked about buying a pick-up truck.  What did it cost me to 
operate that truck?  About 15 cents a gallon for the gas; an 
imperial gallon, not a litre. Today a litre of gasoline costs 50 
to 55 cents and 24 to 26 cents of that is for taxes. This is what 
the young people are dealing with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are standing up in this House and saying “Look what we are 
doing.  We are giving you a tremendous opportunity.  You will get 
$2.5 billion for education”.  It does not make sense.  Why does 
it not make sense?  Because this could have been avoided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of a prime example of something I have seen 
happen so often on the farm.  When you had milk cows in the early 
years you pail fed the calves because you had to ship the cream. 
You wanted to sell the surplus, so you did not let the calves 
have everything that they wanted.  You pail fed them. We would do 
that all winter long and they would be used to it.  When Dad 
banged the pail they knew it was time to come to the trough and 
get their feed. That was simple.  They enjoyed doing that and we 
enjoyed giving it to them because we saw them grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then when summer came and the sunshine was bright outside and 
Dad decided to lead them out to the pasture, they all took off. 
They liked the grass.  It was good.  But Dad knew if he wanted 
healthy calves and wanted them to grow fast, they still should 
have some milk.  What would he do?  He would bang the handle of 
the pail and they would come running.  He had to make sure there 
was enough milk or else they would run right over him if they did 
not get what they wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what governments have been doing for the past 30 years. 
They have been banging the pail of luxury and saying “This is 
what we will give you”.  Now they have all their constituents 
out in the pasture and they are very hungry. There is no more 
grass left. They are suffering.  They are saying “I am banging 
the pail, come and get it”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing left to get, except the debt of $600 billion. 
That debt is financed by foreign companies or foreign investors 
to the tune that one-third of that $42 billion is flowing out of 
this country and we will never see it again. I do not want to be 
pessimistic.  The Reform Party has come into this House and has 
impressed these things on the government and finally we do have a 
balanced budget, which is the right step.  But $600 billion of 
debt still has to be looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the Liberals going to find a miracle?  Are they going to 
somehow change straw into gold?  I do not know what is going to 
happen, but I wish everyone well because I think the pail has run 
dry.  Maybe some day the Liberals will also find out that people 
do not follow the pail any more and then what will happen? 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-36, the budget 
implementation bill.  I would like to deal with a number of 
issues. My colleagues have spoken quite eloquently on the faults 
of Bill C-36.  I am going to deal with a few other issues and how 
we can revamp and rejuvenate our economy so that we can provide 
for a better future for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 is a microcosm of what this House does repeatedly.  It 
nibbles around the edges of an issue rather than taking the bull 
by the horns and addressing the issue. Rather than dealing with 
the larger issues of debt reduction, poverty within our country, 
educational problems, problems of tax relief, egregious rules and 
regulations that choke off our private sector, the government has 
chosen to nibble around the edges and not really deal with the 
meat of the matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the education issue, the millennium fund in principle is 
good.  We have to provide moneys so our students can have the 
funds to be educated in post-secondary institutions. However, 
there are some significant failures within our education system 
which the government has an opportunity to deal with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a chasm exists between the needs of the private 
sector and the ability of our education system to fill those 
needs.  Large numbers of jobs within our country go unfilled, 
primarily because there are no students to fill them.  The 
government should work with the private sector and the 
educational institutions so that the students in the institutions 
today understand what are the future needs of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was down in the United States recently.  They have done some 
innovative work in that area.  It is for that and other reasons 
many Canadians go south of the border to find employment.  In 
many cases they find a more lucrative and challenging environment 
in which to work. That is a shame, because those students could 
stay within our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at the example of the United Kingdom. They have built some 
innovative links between industry and the private sector, the 
private sector, education and government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, students should be provided with apprenticeship 
possibilities.  Provide them with apprenticeships in professions 
that are going to be needed in the future.  There are many needs 
the economy of the 21st century will require filled.  We as a 
country have to look at the future, anticipate those needs and be 
aggressive enough to provide that information to our students. It 
is our role to provide those opportunities to the youth of today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the government on its RESP and child tax benefit 
plans.  These are things we have said are good.  They will enable 
people within the private sector to have more moneys so as to 
provide for their needs and give them the ability to be 
functional members of our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to our economy, the government could have addressed 
the issue of tax relief.  Even in my province of British 
Columbia, if you can believe it, the NDP has actually taken the 
step to look at the successes of Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba 
and Ontario and has adopted a tax reduction strategy, albeit a 
timid one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government not do that in any meaningful way? It has 
proven to work in country after country after country.  High 
taxes kill jobs.  Lower taxes will enable the private sector to 
be more aggressive and create jobs.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill C-223 put forth by the 
member for Portage—Lisgar.  I think he deserves an enormous 
amount of credit for putting forth his private member's bill, 
which goes to the heart of a very serious issue affecting members 
of the lower socio-economic groups as well as middle income 
groups, to enable individuals to obtain their first home, to move 
from the large pool of renters to the pool of home ownership, 
thereby ensuring their ability to have a roof over their heads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 does just that.  Its purpose is to provide for the 
deduction of interest paid by taxpayers on the the first $100,000 
on a mortgage loan secured on the first qualifying home acquired 
by taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Portage—Lisgar spoke about this matter in the 
first hour of debate and made a very eloquent argument in favour 
of the bill.  I would like to support what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill addresses a number of concerns and illustrates a number 
of benefits.  For example, it would lower the tax burdens of 
individuals and would ensure people would have more money in 
their pockets.  This is particularly important in view of the 
fact that over the last several years individuals have been 
living with fixed incomes.  Their disposable income has been 
eroded over time through bracket creep and the introduction of 
some 34 tax increases over the last four years. Therefore they 
have less money in their pockets to provide for basics such as 
home ownership.  Bill C-223 would increase the amount of home 
ownership and housing affordability.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding of Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca the issue of affordable 
homes is extremely important.  There is a large pool of 
individuals who would like to own homes but cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Finance said in his speech, that a taxpayer's choice of 
accommodation, owning versus renting, is a personal choice, for 
many people it is not a personal choice.  For those people who 
are in the lower socio-economic groups owning or renting is not 
an option.  They do not make enough money to own a house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we ensure that these people have enough money to 
eventually have the security of home ownership?  Bill C-223 does 
just that.  It would enable people to deduct the interest on the 
first $100,000 of mortgage from their taxes.  This will not 
benefit the rich.  It will not benefit the speculator.  The bill 
specifically states that it only deals with the first $100,000. 
The bill specifically deals with those individuals in the lower 
socio-economic groups and those individuals who are first time 
homeowners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides an economic stimulus to the economy.  It 
will increase the number of housing starts, put people back to 
work and generate more money through the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill put forth by my friend from Portage—Lisgar is a win, 
win bill.  It should not have any opposition.  If one looks at 
the arguments put forward by members of the government, one sees 
that their concerns were addressed by my colleague.  They are 
understandable questions from the government, but they are 
questions that have been answered and meet the objective not only 
of our party but of the government to ensure that people, 
particularly those with the middle and lower incomes, are able to 
finally own homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Renting is not something that people in lower socio-economic 
groups want.  They want the security of home ownership.  They do 
not like to rent.  Renting takes away from the disposal income 
that they could use for other necessities such as food, clothing 
for their children and education needs.  All these things would 
benefit those people who need it.  Bill C-233 does just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also provide equity between homeowners with 
mortgages and those who do not have mortgages.  Arguments against 
the bill have been that it would likely increase the price of 
houses.  The price of houses is a function of supply and demand. 
We have an enormous demand but we do not have the supply.  Bill 
C-223 would provide an influx of money that would provide a 
stimulus to the job market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other issues to deal with.  The bill can be seen as a 
backdrop against the declining disposal income of all people, the 
decrease in affordable housing and the declining economic 
situation of people from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I live in a city where housing is very expensive.  There are a 
number of cities like that.  This issue affects people who would 
like to own homes from Newfoundland to British Columbia.  All 
provinces are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of affordable housing is serious.  There has been 
declining funding for affordable housing because of the declining 
amount of resources governments have to spend.  We understand 
that.  We have to live within our means.  If the government is to 
withdraw the amount of funding for affordable housing then it 
should at least give people the ability and the tools to provide 
for their own housing.  Bill C-223 would do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should consider other options like expanding the 
RRSP to allow for a registered home ownership plan of $5,000 
beyond the current maximum for first time home owners, for those 
people who are purchasing homes for under $200,000. 
If they were able to do that perhaps they could put money away. 
Perhaps they would have the economic tools to finally own a home 
and provide security for themselves and their families.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing measures for RRSPs are not adequate.  The Minister 
of Finance is considering carving away our RRSP maximum.  That 
will take away the ability of people to provide for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is good that RRSPs can be used toward the down payment of a 
first home.  The government should be complimented on that.  The 
government should also adopt Bill C-223, put forth by my 
colleague from Portage—Lisgar.  It would be a fine complement to 
that measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the government should also consider being innovative in 
providing tax shelters for individual Canadians who are prepared 
to invest in a home.  Perhaps it should consider incentives for 
builders to provide affordable housing.  This would remove the 
onus from the government and place it on the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If governments are fiscally restrained, why not allow the 
individual to provide those funds?  There is a large pool of funds 
in the private sector which could be used for investment.  Those 
moneys could be targeted toward affordable housing.  Why not 
provide a tax break for investors who are prepared to put up the 
money and fill the gap? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also a social situation.  A home, a shelter, a roof over 
our heads is a basic necessity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support Bill C-223, which was put forward by my colleague from 
Portage—Lisgar.  I would ask the government to support it for 
all individuals.  The bill is primarily designed to address the 
huge need that exists for affordable housing, particularly for 
first time homeowners and those in the lower and middle income 
brackets. 
<P><A NAME="LINK232"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak today to Bill C-223.  I begin by commending the 
member for Portage—Lisgar for introducing the bill.  I commend 
him for providing the House with an opportunity to debate a very 
important principle, the principle of tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt in my mind and in the minds of my 
Progressive Conservative colleagues that this nation is 
overtaxed.  Once the House agrees on this then we can seek 
solutions.  However, let me be clear.  Tax relief solutions must 
be for the benefit of all Canadians.  Tax relief must be 
equitable and it must be efficient.  Bill C-223 does not meet 
this requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very simple question to answer here.  The question 
is, if surplus money is available, who will decide how to spend 
it?  Will it be the Liberal government or will it be the Canadian 
people?  We in the PC Party put our trust in the people.  By 
putting money back into the pockets of Canadians we will let them 
decide how to better their own lives.  That is why my party has 
proposed raising the personal exemption threshold to $10,000 for 
every Canadian.  That is the fair way to approach this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friends in the Reform Party are suffering from an identity 
crisis on this issue.  The Reform Party trumpets itself as being 
the promoter of simpler and flatter taxes.  This bill is neither. 
This is a call for a subsidy, a target tax break that benefits a 
few.  When we enact legislation that targets only certain members 
of our society we are necessarily excluding others.  In this case 
we would be doing nothing for the poorest members of our nation 
who are unable to even begin thinking of buying a home.  Once 
again equity does not exist.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The message regarding our tax code is a tired, yet appropriate 
cliché:  keep it simple.  This bill at the very least adds 
another line to our already cumbersome income tax form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accountants are the overall winners with tax legislation that 
adds to the present complicated reporting nightmare that many 
Canadians are enduring as we speak.  We need to make a collective 
decision that simplifying our Income Tax Act is a worthy goal. 
Then we need to strengthen our resolve to use our tax laws only 
to raise revenue, not to set public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fairness is conspicuously absent in this bill.  The bill 
proposes that the interest paid on the first $100,000 of a 
mortgage loan secured by that first qualifying home acquired by a 
taxpayer would be allowed as a deduction for tax purposes.  The 
problem is that $100,000 worth of property is not equal across 
this nation.  The same home that sells for $100,000 in one part 
of the country might easily command twice that in my riding of 
Markham.  Even if we were willing to complicate the Income Tax 
Act, we certainly could not accept a tax initiative that does not 
treat all citizens equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another component here which should give all of us in 
this Chamber great pause.  If we were to allow tax deductions for 
mortgage interest we would be opening a Pandora's box.  It would 
be good if the bill's sponsor would reflect on how sure he is 
that the Liberals would not move quickly to subject our homes to 
capital gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to Bill C-223, we do not even have to wonder.  We 
need only reflect on the words of the member for Etobicoke North. 
He stood in this House and said “If we allow the interest to be 
deductible, then surely the capital gains on the sale of the 
principal residence should be taxable”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason a capital gain on a principal residence in not 
taxable in Canada now is that we do not consider an investment in 
a principal residence as an investment.  It is the ownership of a 
private home.  Then he continued on to say “You can't have your 
cake and eat it too”.  This leaves little doubt in my mind as to 
the intention of this Liberal government if we were to pass Bill 
C-223. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other dynamics at play here and they need to be 
explored.  At present there exists great acrimony within Liberal 
ranks.  On the one side we have the Minister of Finance and his 
ever dwindling allies who know all too well that Canada's 
finances are still a long way from the Utopia he tried to sell in 
his budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pushing and prodding them are the Minister of Health and his 
band of 1970 style tax and spend Liberals.  They were thought to 
be extinct until recently when a small colony of 101 of them were 
discovered in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House watch this battle with great 
concern.  We do so because when the palace coup is complete all 
hopes for tax relief will be finished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that we need greater vision than that which is represented 
in Bill C-223.  We need to put aside all partisanship on the 
issue of comprehensive tax reform and come up with an acceptable 
alternative.  This alternative must be effective in putting money 
back into the pockets of Canadians.  It must be equitable so as 
to produce real bottom line benefits for all Canadians.  We need 
to ensure it makes our tax system less cumbersome so that people 
can spend less time reporting to Revenue Canada.  More 
importantly, we need to just do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate what my colleague from Kings—Hants said on February 
4 when I say that a tax break is better than the status quo, but 
the public will is on side with those who seek comprehensive tax 
cuts.  Let us not miss this opportunity. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo—Chilcotin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to rise to debate Bill C-223, an act 
to amend the Income Tax Act with respect to the deduction of 
interest on mortgage loans.  Before I get into the speech itself 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the member for 
Portage—Lisgar for all his hard work in seeing this bill come to 
fruition and debate in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is to provide for the tax deduction of 
interest paid by a taxpayer on the first $100,000 of a mortgage 
loan to first time home buyers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us here have had the experience of purchasing a home.  It 
is a huge investment which gives a lot of security and joy. 
However, it is also the cause of a lot of stress and doubt. 
This, in many cases, is not simply the purchase of property, but 
the purchase of a home.  A home is for families to grow together 
in, a place of security and a site of well-being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the physical house may hold some importance for 
families, it is the psychological and social aspects of a home 
that people hold dear to them.  A house is for living, but a home 
is to cherish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One may wonder where I am going with this.  In today's economy 
many young families simply cannot afford to purchase a house to 
make a home.  Many young people start out facing an enormous 
financial burden, as most already have a huge debt load from 
pursuing their post-secondary education and getting started in 
their lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing the economic realities that most young people face 
today, they have some other debts to pay, such as credit card 
debts with large balances.  There is also the unseen debt that 
every single Canadian faces every time they pay a tax and also 
the enormous national debt that has been built up over the 
decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at this bill as an intervention toward tax 
reduction.  To put it more simply, young people today simply 
cannot afford to purchase a house on top of all the other 
expenses and taxes they have to pay.  Instead of purchasing a 
home many couples, in essence, withdraw from their disposable 
income and throw money into rental properties that they will 
never recover and never receive benefits from when they could be 
using that money toward creating equity in a house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money saved in taxes could be used for paying down other 
debts or to increase their savings.  In essence, buying a home is 
the largest single step that most people take in achieving 
retirement security.  It is an investment that lasts a lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-223 would provide Canadians with an extra opportunity to 
purchase their first house by giving them a much needed tax 
break, making ownership more feasible.  The economic spinoffs of 
such a move would also help local economies, especially the 
Canadian housing industry.  It would also benefit the industries 
that supply furniture, finishings and fittings that go into 
equipping and maintaining a home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This initiative, Bill C-223, which has been brought forward by 
the hon. member for Portage—Lisgar, has widespread support from 
a variety of groups and individuals.  In the short time I have I 
would like to quote from one of the supporters, although the 
theme expressed here is shared by many other organizations.  I 
speak of the national trade association of the manufactured 
housing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After reviewing the content of Bill C-223, the association said 
they “support both the logic behind the provisions of the bill 
and the limitations that have been applied.  Limiting the 
benefits to first time homebuyers and the first $100,000 of a 
mortgage will have a highly desirable effect of increasing home 
ownership among our young families”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The association goes on to say “In our opinion, increased home 
ownership is of considerable benefit to the homebuyer, the 
community and the greater economy.  Home ownership helps to 
foster stable families and stable communities.  More housing 
demand will stimulate new housing development and produce 
secondary benefits throughout the local economy”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the provisions of this bill would create a very 
enviable situation.  I am sure that I speak for many of my hon. 
colleagues on all sides of the House when I say that stimulating 
the economy is very desirable and something that should be 
encouraged as much as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at my own riding of Cariboo—Chilcotin, I know that I 
would readily support any initiative, whether federal, provincial 
or local, which would have a positive economic spinoff for our 
local economy.  With the economic downturn in the province of 
British Columbia we are in need of initiatives that will boost 
local economies.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some opposition to the idea proposed in the bill. 
However, I feel this opposition is unwarranted.  Opponents 
suggest that this would give an unfair financial advantage to 
homeowners over those who rent.  This is simply untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are provisions by Revenue Canada that benefit those who 
own rental properties.  Many types of expenditures are deductible 
from rental revenue in the year they are incurred, including 
property taxes, insurance, advertising, maintenance and repairs. 
Also interest paid on money borrowed to purchase or to improve 
rental properties can be deducted.  Savings experienced by rental 
property owners can be passed on to tenants in the form of lower 
rents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been some concern in recent years over the brain drain 
that has plagued Canada.  With the highest level of taxation in 
all the G-7 countries, many of Canada's finest talents leave our 
country in search of jobs in the United States.  Why do many 
Canadians leave for jobs south of the border?  Very often it is 
for a lower rate of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently all U.S. mortgage interest payments are deductible. 
When homes are sold the vendors do not have to pay capital gains 
tax on the first $500,000.  Bill C-223 would place Canada on a 
more level playing field with the United States and may make the 
decision to remain here a lot easier for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I encourage members of all parties to support the 
bill.  This initiative can play an important role in serving as a 
building block for not only a stronger family unit but a stronger 
local community and a stronger economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of the bill would provide great and needed benefit, 
particularly to young Canadians who despite their economic 
vulnerability bear enormous financial burdens.  Young Canadians 
would be given the opportunity to set down roots and to eliminate 
some of their debts while at the same time being helped to 
prepare for the future.  This is something we could all be proud 
of.  It could even mean the difference between the same 
individuals staying in the community or leaving the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I thank the member for Portage—Lisgar for introducing the 
bill and for his initiative with regard to tax reduction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
delight to stand in the House of Commons to speak on behalf of 
families across Canada and to add my words of encouragement to 
the government to show a little compassion for families, 
especially young families starting up and buying their first 
homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure to speak in favour of a tax break, something 
the Liberals just cannot get into their heads.  If there is a 
little surplus, would the Liberals turn it back in terms of a tax 
break?  No.  Most of them think they better put it away for an 
election fund.  They think they better keep that money ready in 
case there is an election.  Then they can haul out the millennium 
fund.  They would have all this money to reduce the debt and to 
reduce taxes and everything will be tickety-boo, great. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals will win the election because they will have all 
this money.  It is unconscionable.  It is terrible that they hang 
on to their money to use for political purposes.  Meanwhile, they 
are shutting their eyes to the needs of Canadian families, young 
people and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us is a private member's bill.  I wish we could 
strengthen Private Members' Business.  In my observations in the 
few years I have been here it seems the ideas which best 
represent the needs and the wishes of Canadians are presented in 
Private Members' Business.  Those are the times when we get 
motions and bills like the one before us today which say to the 
House of Commons, to the government, that there is a need out 
there which has been identified by an elected representative. The 
individual MP has raised a matter that has been chosen and we can 
vote if it is a votable motion as this one is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the motions go by after debate for an hour and are set 
aside and nothing is ever done. 
What a total waste of the time of representatives elected by the 
people to run the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Portage—Lisgar has brought forward a very 
important motion that would provide for a tax break on the money 
used to pay interest on a mortgage.  I think that is absolutely 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a young man, and of course that takes us back 
decades, it was considered a big expenditure to buy a home.  At 
that time when my wife and I bought our first home.  The capital 
expenditure was $20,000; that was the price of our first home. I 
remember saying to my wife that a mortgage for 25 years was a 
long time.  The amount of money we had borrowed was $14,000 and I 
calculated that we would pay over 25 years about $14,000 of 
interest and $14,000 against the principal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking in round numbers, in case anyone is out there 
checking my mathematical credentials.  I have rounded off 
liberally.  If anyone wants the exact numbers, I will provide 
them.  However this is a fact.  To purchase a home at 6.5 % over 
25 years one pays about 50:50 interest and principal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does that interest go?  It goes into the profits of people 
who have invested money through their banks and other financial 
institutions.  The financial institutions turn around and give 
people like my wife and me a loan in the form of a mortgage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely incredible because as a home owner borrowing 
money I have to earn the money, pay taxes on the money and then 
with the money left after all the taxes pay interest. What 
happens to the people who receive the interest?  They end up 
paying taxes on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact any business can deduct an interest cost as 
part of their business.  Why can a family not deduct their 
interest cost as part of operating and providing for their 
family?  My colleague is setting forth an eminently sensible 
proposal.  I am amazed because I have read into what other 
members have been saying in their speeches that they will 
probably vote against it.  It just blows me away.  Why would they 
do that?  Why would they continue to make it difficult for young 
families to get ahead, to buy homes and to start building some 
capital savings for their future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the government is most interested in tax, tax, tax and 
preferably tax the taxes, which it does too.  That is another 
speech that I will give at some other time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all members to vote in favour of the bill.  It is a very 
good bill.  It is long overdue.  It would put us, at least in 
this area, on an equal level with our American neighbours. 
Goodness knows what kind of a brain drain we have because our 
brightest young people are going to the States with its 
favourable tax situation and favourable job situation with a much 
lower rate of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important measure.  I urge all members to use 
their heads, to think independently and to carefully analyse, as 
we have done, the implications of the bill.  Let us not hide 
behind technical excuses, that we cannot do this because of that. 
On and on they will go.  Let us not do that this time.  Let us 
rather make a bold decision to do what is right and to vote in 
favour of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The mover of a bill 
in Private Members' Business is afforded the opportunity to 
recap.  I must make clear, though, that the mover of the bill 
having spoken will terminate debate.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I thank all participants in the debate on this private 
member's bill.  I appreciate their thoughts.  I especially 
appreciate those of my colleagues in the Reform Party who 
supported me in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill concerns a tax refund or a tax reduction.  This will 
make home ownership more achievable for many.  It is my intention 
that young families would reap the benefits of the legislation. 
My concern has been to do something right in the House to benefit 
future generations.  I have children and grandchildren so that is 
why the bill is so dear to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the aftermath of the government's budget it has become 
apparent to Canadians that the Liberals ignored their demands for 
tax relief.  Canadian taxpayers shouldered the load for the 
elimination of the federal deficit, but the Liberal government 
apparently has no interest in giving them relief through tax 
reductions.  This was a serious oversight on the government's 
part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a great opportunity for all members to support the bill and 
take a small step in righting that which was not done in the 
budget.  This is especially important when we realize that we are 
asking young families to deal with a taxation burden never seen 
before in Canadian history.  Going into the next century they are 
being forced to service Canada's $600 billion debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A representative of the Toronto-Dominion Bank stated that on a 
typical 25 year mortgage at 6.35% first time home buyers could 
claim $1,700 on their income tax.  That is a tremendous amount of 
money for some young families.  That is a good amount of extra 
money for a young family that is starting out. It would be 
especially good, considering that federal taxes will continue to 
increase to service our needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members agree that the family is an essential building block 
for a strong society they should support the bill.  By making it 
a little easier for families to acquire homes and build up some 
equity in them we would be supporting an essential building block 
of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If hon. members explain the bill to their constituents it would 
be widely supported.  History has shown that in times when 
Canadians have been able to afford homes there has been a 
tremendous uplifting effect on the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have received numerous letters from individuals and groups in 
support of the bill.  Those people with knowledge of the housing 
industry have given very positive support because they realize it 
will make home ownership more attainable for Canadians and 
therefore will create beneficial spin-off effects for the 
Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Young families would have extra money for appliances and 
furniture.  They could possibly purchase big ticket items which 
were previously out of reach.  They might be able to afford a 
better car or they might be able to put a few dollars away for 
education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true that there is a program that allows putting RRSP 
funds toward a home.  After many young people pay for rent, 
clothing and food there is no money left for RRSPs.  The bill 
would give them a hand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members of the House will recognize the bill as 
something non-political to give young people the opportunity to 
invest, to own a home in which they can build equity and in 
future years will be an asset for their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the building of the country and the homes that 
were affordable at the turn of the century and compare them to 
the homes of today, I wish and hope that every young couple could 
afford a home in the future.  The quality of the homes has 
improved and the quality of family life will have to improve.  I 
hope that we as a House take that issue seriously.

bill. I congratulate them for that.

exercise their right and support the young families that would 
love to move into these new homes with a tax break, that they 
will receive some beneficial effect of carrying the burden of 
debt that we have put on their shoulders, and that they can have 
a more comfortable home doing it.

false and misleading statistics during the debate on Bill C-68, 
the firearms act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I obtained the RCMP commissioner's letter by using an access to 
information request.  Here are some excerpts.  They are rather 
long: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP investigated 88,162 actual violent crimes during 1993, 
where only 73 of these offences, or 0.08% involved the use of 
firearms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP investigated 333 actual homicide offences, including 
attempts, but only 6 of these offences involved the use of 
firearms according to the statistics provided to the Firearms 
Control Task Group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We determined that our statistics showed that there were 73 
firearms involved in a violent crime compared to the Department 
of Justice findings of 623 firearms involved in a violent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is of particular concern that the Minister of Justice and the 
Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police relied on these 
statistics while Bill C-68 was being processed in Parliament as 
evidenced by statements in the report, “Illegal Firearm Use in 
Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The incorrect reporting of RCMP statistics could cause the wrong 
public policy or laws to be developed and cause researchers to 
draw erroneous conclusions.  Considering the data is clearly 
marked as belonging to the RCMP, we must accept ownership and 
responsibility for the harm the data may cause.  For these 
reasons, something must be done to remove it from circulation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the Minister of Justice to explain why the RCMP's 
analysis of its own firearm and violent crime statistics has 
never been made public? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The misleading analysis of the RCMP data was introduced six 
times into the Alberta Court of Appeal by the Department of 
Justice and interveners supporting the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister explain why the RCMP's analysis of its own 
firearms data was never introduced into the Alberta Court of 
Appeal?  Why was justice department lawyer David Gates removed as 
a federal government lawyer in the provincial court challenge of 
Bill C-68?  Why was a government lawyer replaced by a lawyer from 
the private sector midway through this important case?  Did Mr. 
Gates object to the affidavits being filed by his own department? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On September 3, 1997 Tony Dittenhoffer, senior researcher for 
the Canadian Firearms Centre, sent an e-mail message to CFC's 
director of policy and programs, Gordon Parry: “It is important 
that we have full explanation on the public record”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister explain why Mr. Dittenhoffer did not make this 
important information public when he appeared as a witness before 
the Alberta Court of Appeal? 
Why is the minister ignoring the advice of her own bureaucrats?

Police Association which said that the misuse of RCMP firearms 
and violent crime statistics in public, in Parliament and 
possibly the courts “will result in a justifiable lack of 
confidence amongst Canadians”.

that has been shattered by the revelations in the RCMP 
commissioner's letter.

take great objection to some of the allegations made by the hon. 
member and I will answer him in the same manner that he chose to 
ask the questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote word for word from the letter that the minister 
tabled in this House from the RCMP dated March 20, 1998: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am responding to Lorne Gunter's column of March 15, 1998 titled 
“False stats used to support gun registry”.  The column did not 
indicate that on December 30, 1997 the RCMP commissioner wrote 
the Department of Justice indicating that we had reached an 
understanding on the statistics and how they were reported in 
“The illegal Movement of Firearms in Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was simply a different methodology used by the RCMP and 
the Firearms Smuggling Work Group in interpreting the original 
data. As part of our examination, we were focusing on criminal 
incidents in which a firearm was actually used in the commission 
of a crime.  The Firearms Smuggling Work Group's examination 
criteria were broader, gathering information on all firearms 
recovered by police and categorizing them according to their 
circumstances.  Not surprisingly, this generated a discrepancy 
which was the source of our original concerns. With this 
methodological approach we are satisfied that the conclusions of 
the smuggling report are reasonable, and are satisfied that there 
is no need to amend the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to once again state that the RCMP continues to fully 
support the new firearms legislation and its objectives.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-68 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have been listening very intently to the comments 
by the hon. member from Yorkton—Melville as well as to the 
parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on the same subject matter.  It has been brought to the 
House's attention that the data on which Bill C-68 has been based 
are seriously flawed.  On July 21, 1997 the commissioner of the 
RCMP wrote to the deputy minister of justice informing him that 
the RCMP data used by the government and by the department 
officials during the debate over Bill C-68 were in fact flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is shocking.  The statistics that were put forward and the 
references in both letters mentioned by the hon. member in the 
opposition set out that there is a serious problem here that has 
to be addressed.  The commissioner states unequivocally that the 
incorrect reporting of the RCMP statistics could cause wrong 
public policy or laws to be developed and cause researchers to 
draw erroneous conclusions. That was in July 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of water under the bridge and a lot of things 
have happened since that time, including a challenge to the 
Supreme Court of Alberta by four provinces and two territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The serious question is have those statistics been put before 
the Alberta Court of Appeal without qualification, without 
correction if that is what is necessary?  This is a very serious 
matter if that is in fact what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The allegations by the commissioner himself that they do not 
want the RCMP name attached to these statistics unless 
corrections are made speak in and of themselves to the confidence 
that the RCMP has in these statistics. Yet there is no 
disclosure, there is no open dialogue here on the part of the 
government.  What we are getting here is that the RCMP is now 
satisfied, or certain members may be satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to know what has transpired from the time the 
commissioner wrote to the minister or deputy minister and what is 
this talk of methodological difference or somehow this has been 
glossed over. What does methodological difference mean?  Does 
that mean economical with the truth?  Does that mean these 
statistics have been used to spin a certain purpose or a certain 
objective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many concerns that arise out of this bill, not the 
least of which is the broad widespread opposition that exists in 
rural parts of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost element again is something that has been exposed as 
being completely erroneous.  The government suggested that it is 
going to cost $48 million.  It has already exceeded $100 million. 
It is going to exceed $500 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent information that has surfaced and been brought forward to 
the House must cause the government serious concern.  There are 
questions that have to be answered by the minister or by the 
government.  If the conclusions that have been drawn, conclusions 
the government wanted Canadians to draw, are based on seriously 
flawed statistics that do not truly represent the incidence of 
violent crime and the use of firearms in the country, that is 
something that has to be addressed and has to be corrected soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The e-mails and letters that have been sent back and forth 
between various government officials and members of the RCMP have 
to be looked at in a very close and meticulous way before we go 
any further with this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has a duty to the House of Commons and she has a 
duty as a lawyer to slow the process down and give Canadians the 
truth on what has taken place in this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the opposition it is my responsibility to ask 
questions.  As members of the government it is their 
responsibility to give us answers, and truthful ones. 
<P><A NAME="LINK243"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as the minister answered in the House, we have been truthful and 
we have brought forward all the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This question has been discussed many times.  Not only is the 
RCMP now satisfied with the report, the hon. member should also 
understand that the firearms smuggling work group conducted the 
original study.  Membership of the group included experts from 
the RCMP, the Ministry of the Solicitor General, the Canadian 
Association of Chiefs of Police, the chief provincial firearms 
offices in both Quebec and British Columbia and the Ontario 
Provincial Police.  The group selected the researchers and the 
principal researcher was under secondment from Statistics Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently, the RCMP reviewed the statistics—they were 
available—this time counting only those guns actually used in 
crime.  If you ask a different question you must expect a 
different answer, and that is what happened in this case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Commissioner Murray stated in his letter of December 30, 1997 
which was quoted earlier: “The RCMP now understands the scope 
and methodology of the original”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also question about the firearms mentioned in the 
original RCMP letter and cited by the hon. member for 
Yorkton—Melville.  The member indicated that only 73 of the 
88,000 violent crimes investigated by the RCMP involved firearms. 
This is simply not possible.  Statistics Canada indicates that 
there were 195 firearms homicides in that same year and more than 
8,000 firearms robberies were committed.  Given that the RCMP is 
responsible for policing about 25% of Canada, if this is true 
then the investigation is a larger proportion than that indicated 
by the member. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that recent events in the United States have 
shown us again that this legislation is important to Canada and 
to the safety of our fellow Canadians.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>LABOUR SPONSORED INVESTMENT FUNDS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
is the last and final day for working people in the provinces of 
Ontario and Quebec to invest in labour sponsored venture capital 
funds as RRSP contributions.  Their timeframe has been lengthened 
due to the time lost during the ice storm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indications are that the contributions to labour sponsored 
venture capital funds for this year will be down dramatically, a 
total of $505 million by March 1, compared to $1.2 billion in 
1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry officials feel this slide in contribution rates is 
due to the changes made to the tax system where the rate of 
contribution or the maximum allowable contribution has been 
lowered from $5,000 to $3,500.  The maximum tax credit was 
reduced to 30% from 40% and the minimum holding period is raised 
to eight years rather than the previous five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another rule upsets the industry in that a person is disallowed 
from reinvesting in a fund for two years if that person withdraws 
money out of the fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these factors have had a devastating effect on the health of 
these important financial instruments and we cautioned the 
government that this would happen were these changes put into 
effect.  At the current rate of decline in less than two years 
labour sponsored venture capital funds will be out of investment 
capital to invest in the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conventional lending institutions, chartered banks especially, 
have not been meeting the needs of industry with adequate supply 
of venture capital.  No matter what they say in their ads or 
their promotional material the fact is small to medium size 
businesses willing to expand their operations and grow their 
businesses and create jobs are being turned down flat when they 
go to their banks for business loans.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not seem to matter how good your business plan is or 
what your ideas are for increasing your business.  More loans are 
being turned down than are being granted. This is unlike in the 
United States where banks are required through the community 
investment act to reinvest some of their profits every year into 
risk ventures that otherwise would not necessarily qualify for 
business loans.  No such regulation exists in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banks will tell us about the small business loans they have 
actually given out, but a more telling figure would be to know 
how many they have turned down in the same period of time.  This 
is all the more reason then that labour sponsored venture capital 
funds are important to small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of Manitoba 80% of all venture capital put out 
last year was through the Crocus labour sponsored venture capital 
fund.  In other words small businesses that are tired of going to 
banks and being turned down end up entering into an equity 
position with the Crocus investment fund. I am pleased to say 
there are more businesses in my inner city riding of Winnipeg 
Centre that have benefited from these funds than any other riding 
in the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance and his department have stated in 
letters to the Crocus fund that they recognize the problem.  They 
feel that perhaps they have gone too far in limiting the access 
to using the funds for RRSP purposes.  They have promised to 
monitor the situation. To quote the Minister of Finance “action 
will then be taken if the situation warrants it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of the numbers now made public, $505 million down from 
$1.2 billion and the fact that within two years these venture capital 
funds will be out of capital to invest in the community, will the 
Minister of Finance review the situation now and make the 
necessary changes for the next RRSP season? 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all I would like to 
remind the hon. member that as a result of the generous tax 
assistance provided by the federal government and many provincial 
governments, labour sponsored funds experienced very rapid growth 
in the past few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the decision was made to limit the tax assistance, LSVCCs 
had about $2 billion in assets. Despite the fact that LSVCCs 
raised about 50% less in the RRSP season which followed the 1996 
budget, their total assets surpassed the $4 billion mark at the 
end of 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, let us not forget that the LSVCCs are not the only 
providers of venture capital in this country. During 1996 the 
amount of venture capital in Canada rose from $6 billion to $7.1 
billion.  The availability of venture capital for Canadian 
businesses has never been greater.  In fact, I pose the question, 
is there sufficient capital available to meet the demand?  Let me 
provide a few figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of 1996 labour sponsored funds had $1.4 billion 
available for investment in small businesses.  They invested 
about $400 million in 1996, a record year for them. Based on this 
information there seems to be no evidence of a shortage of funds 
available for investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not to say as the hon. member has mentioned, that there 
is no need for ongoing monitoring of the situation.  On the 
contrary, preliminary figures do indicate that LSVCCs invested in 
excess of $600 million in businesses during 1997.  This 
investment pace combined with the possibility of large amounts of 
redemption could signify, at least in some provinces, future 
shortages of venture capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's RRSP season was the first under a reduced tax 
credit.  We need to analyse the results, the adequacy of the 
supply of venture capital and the efficiency of tax incentives at 
improving access to capital for small and medium size businesses 
to be able to determine if changes are warranted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the hon. member as in fact the Minister of 
Finance has assured him, that this government will continue to 
monitor the situation very closely and take measures to ensure 
that venture capital is in supply in strong measure in this 
country.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, some time ago I raised with the Minister of Industry the 
subject of innovation and research and development in Canada. In 
particular I wanted to know why the minister and this government 
had not made research and development a priority.  Why do they 
continue to let Canada fall behind the rest of the world in this 
area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance in his most recent budget stressed that 
our goal must be “to make Canada not just a participant in the 
modern economy, but a world leader”.  That is right. The problem 
is that budgets have put Canada further and further behind. All 
experts agree that Canada suffers from a serious innovation in R 
and D gap. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>President Clinton of the United States recently stated that 
sustained prosperity requires a continuous stream of 
technological innovation. That is quite right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister might say that they have increased funding to the 
three granting councils that finance research and provide grants 
to students. 
Those three research agencies have seen their budgets restored in 
this last budget to 1994-95 levels.  In other words, this last 
budget simply restored some of the cuts.  By the year 2000-01, 
Canada's support for basic research and education for researchers 
will be no higher than it was six years earlier.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are no new dollars, no new investment in R and D.  That 
simply is not good enough. Others in Canada agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of NSERC, the National Sciences and Engineering 
Research Council, recently said that more will have to be done in 
the coming years to build that capacity up to a competitive, 
world class economy.  Even the Secretary of State for Research 
and Development has said the same thing.  The president of 
Memorial University, just as an example, has said that Canada is 
acting like a third world country when it comes to R and D. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a vital trading nation. We need to get the message 
through to the government that we have to invest in the future. 
Other industrialized nations have listened and taken action.  I 
mentioned President Clinton who has proposed future spending 
increases for institutes in the United States which are 
significant in comparison to ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The National Institutes of Research, the U.S. counterpart of the 
Medical Research Council, would see its funding rise by 50% by 
the year 2003, which is after steady increases through the 1990s, 
unlike in Canada.  There is a 10% increase for the National 
Science Foundation, the U.S. equivalent of NSERC, building up to 
a 24% increase by the year 2003. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on, but the point is that Canada is simply not in 
good shape when it comes to R and D and innovation.  In fact 
while our funding has decreased, Australia, Germany and France 
have doubled their funding on basic research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the OECD studied this question, it called Canada a middle 
technology country along with other countries such as India, 
Greece and Mexico.  Of the top 14 countries, only Italy's record 
on R and D spending is worse than Canada's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not only embarrassing but it places Canada on a very 
dangerous path.  Relying on other countries to do our basic 
research for us is simply not acceptable because it means that 
the information we get will be based on their priorities, not 
ours.  The fact that Canada grossly underinvests in research and 
development is an important reason why the Canadian economy is 
left with more than 1.5 million people unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that Canada simply cannot continue in this way.  We know 
that being competitive is the way in which we will make our way 
in the world.  It is time this government and this minister 
recognized that and acted accordingly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Canada's innovation gap was 
first mentioned in 1995 when the OECD stated that Canada had low 
levels of R and D expenditures and industrial innovation when 
compared to other developed countries. Since that report was 
released, this government has in fact taken bold initiatives to 
improve the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have created Technology Partnerships Canada, a $250 million a 
year investment with the private sector, to assist the 
development and commercialization of new technologies. As of 
April 1, 1998, TPC will have approved $521 million in R and D 
investments which will lever $2.2 billion in R and D and 
downstream investments by industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We established the Canada Foundation for Innovation, an $800 
million partnership investment to renew research infrastructure 
across Canada.  The CFI issued a request for proposals on 
December 9, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also renewed our commitment to the networks of centres of 
excellence by making this program permanent at a level of $47 
million annually.  Over 400 firms and industry associations are 
network partners who have benefited from leading edge research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We established a partnership between the Medical Research 
Council and the Canadian Medical Discoveries Fund to help bridge 
the innovation gap for life sciences research through investments 
which will commercially exploit research in universities and 
hospitals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given the Business Development Bank of Canada a new 
mandate to support the growth of knowledge based, export oriented 
small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working with private and public sector partners to ensure 
that all of Canada's 16,500 schools and 3,400 libraries are 
connected to the Internet by 1998.  We are also setting the 
conditions for Canada to become a laboratory for the creation of 
interactive, multimedia learning software and networks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions demonstrate clearly that we are committed to 
making Canada an innovation based economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to
