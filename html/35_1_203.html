	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today we have the very special honour of having the presence in 
Ottawa of Western Samoa's High Commissioner to Canada, the 
permanent representative of Western Samoa to the United 
Nations, His Excellency, the distinguished Neroni Slade.
<P>
	His Excellency has just returned from Haines Junction where 
he addressed federal, provincial and territorial ministers of the 
environment on the real threat climate change poses to the very 
existence of Western Samoa and other small island states.
<P>
	Later this afternoon he will also speak at a joint meeting of the 
Standing Committee on Natural Resources and the Standing 
Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development about 
this critical issue.
<P>
	Hence it is with great pleasure that I take this opportunity to

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I would like today to honour chemistry professor Pierre 
Deslongchamps of the University of Sherbrooke and offer him 
our warmest congratulations on his appointment to the 
Académie des sciences in Paris.
<P>
	Known for his work on organic synthesis and on the concept 
of stereoelectric effects, Mr. Deslongchamps has been a 
professor at the University of Sherbrooke since 1967. The 
Académie des sciences in Paris is one of the world's most 
prestigious societies in the world and brings together top 
researchers in the fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, 
natural sciences, biology and medicine. Its members are the 
20th century's greatest scientific minds.
<P>
	A highly respected scientist, Mr. Deslongchamps has been a 
fellow of the John Simmon Guggenheim foundation in New 
York since 1979, a member of the Chemical Institute of Canada 
since 1980, a member of the Royal Society in London since 
1983, and a member of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science since 1988.
<P>
	Professor Deslongchamps' international reputation brings 
honour to the University of Sherbrooke, the Eastern Townships 
and the Province of Quebec as a whole.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Royal Roads Military College located in my riding is 
closing this week and is being gutted.
<P>
	In this House the Prime Minister assured me that Royal Roads 
would become an educational facility and would receive the 
same deal as Collège militaire royal in Quebec. The reality has 
been completely different.
<P>
	CMR received $25 million over three years. Royal Roads 
received the same, but had $5 million promptly removed. 
Conditionality was linked to the deal on Royal Roads but not to 
CMR. Most appalling of all, ministers of this government are 
having secret negotiations with developers to sell up to 300 
acres of pristine old growth of Royal Roads property for a 
condominium development.
<P>
	The treatment of the staff at Royal Roads has been nothing 
short of reprehensible. Previous educational facilities 
purchased by the college, including the school's oceanographic 
teaching vessel, have been removed. No such parallel exists at 
CMR.
<P>
	This government, in collusion with the province, is 
destroying this superb educational facility. Despite what the 
Prime Minister says, CMR in Quebec has been given 
preferential treatment and Royal Roads and the people of B.C. 
have been shafted.

	<B>Mr. Jag Bhaduria (Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville, 
Ind. Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again we are seeing the Canadian 
dollar fluctuating on any given week. Last week the dollar 
surged to a half year high of more than 74 cents U.S. This week 
the dollar has lingered near the mid-73 cent level.
<P>
	The Bank of Canada's response is to once again jack up its rate 
for the first time in almost two months. High interest rates are 
having a devastating effect on our economy.
<P>
	For more than a year and a half I have consistently been 
emphasizing that we must have lower interest rates. The interest 
rate must come down even if we are faced with a slight increase 
in inflation. The bogeyman of inflation did not succeed before; 
it killed the growth of our economy.
<P>
	A country that is fully employed with some inflation would be 
better than what we have now. We have a 9.4 per cent 
unemployment rate that does not include 700,000 part time 
workers who cannot find full time jobs. We have a triumvirate of 
destruction of the economy in this country namely-

	<B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Ontario, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
draw to the attention of the House the case of Ms. Susan Shewan. 
Ms. Shewan, who is a constituent of mine, is also a musician and 
songwriter of considerable talent.
<P>
	Unfortunately she is involved in a protracted dispute with 
Canadian Airlines International and the Government of the 
Yukon Territory over the alleged unauthorized use of a future 
album cover drawing, lyrics and music related to Ms. Shewan's 
song ``The Magic and the Mystery''.
<P>
	The drawing, lyrics and music from this song about the beauty 
of the Yukon are similar to items used in certain advertising and 
promotional material by both CAI and the Yukon government.
<P>
	As a single parent with limited finances, Ms. Shewan does not 
have the resources to pursue a lengthy and protracted legal 
action to protect her copyrighted material.
<P>
	I call upon the Yukon government and Canadian Airlines 
International to respect the intellectual property laws of Canada 
and Ms. Shewan's copyrights to her original works and resolve 
this outstanding matter forthwith.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MISSINGCHILDREN">MISSING CHILDREN</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, each May, Child Find Canada holds its Green Ribbon 
of Hope campaign. The aim is to increase public awareness 
about Missing Children's Day on May 25.
<P>
	Community members are asked to show their support of the 
missing children's issue by prominently wearing a green ribbon. 
Proceeds generated by the green ribbon campaign will enable 
Child Find Canada to continue its mandate of assisting in the 
search process for Canada's thousands of missing children and 
the education of children and adults about abduction.
<P>
	The concept of the green ribbon of hope was originated by the 
students of Holy Cross Secondary School in Ontario following 
the abduction and subsequent murder of one of its students, 
Kristen French. In memory of this tragedy, the students and 
faculty have generously directed that their idea for the green 
ribbon be used exclusively by Child Find Canada.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>

	Child Find Canada receives no government funding, 
depending entirely on the corporate community and the Green 
Ribbon of Hope campaign. For the sake of our children, I ask all 
members to support this very worthwhile program.

	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, B'nai 
Brith Canada is our country's senior Jewish advocacy 
organization with a 120-year history.
<P>
	Through its lodges, regional offices, League for Human 
Rights and Institute for International Affairs, it has built a 
national and international reputation for service to the 
community, promoting human rights and fostering tolerance and 
respect among all Canadians. It has been a world leader in the 
fight against racism, anti-Semitism and discrimination.
<P>
	A grassroots membership organization, it has served the 
Jewish community and Canada with distinction on issues such 
as immigration and refugee policy, law enforcement, 
international human rights, the treatment of Jewish 
communities overseas, intergroup relations in Canada, as well 
as a host of charitable activities and voluntary action.
<P>
	On the occasion of its annual meeting in Ottawa this weekend, 
I urge all members of the House to join me in applauding the 
work of B'nai Brith and in wishing it future success.

Canadians direct access to him through Internet.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in order to reach him, Canadians must 
subscribe to and use the services of an American company, 
CompuService, located in Ohio.
<P>
	Why did the Prime Minister not use a Canadian network, 
which, in the opinion of experts, does exist and is currently 
available at no charge?
<P>
	How can we believe a government that tells us it gives priority 
to Canadian content on the information highway when 
information on members and the House of Commons is being 
broadcast on the Internet from Switzerland?
<P>
	The Prime Minister's electronic photo op yesterday sent a 
disquieting message to Canadians: in order to talk with their 
Prime Minister, they have to pay user fees to the Americans.

question on the environment in a year and a half''.
<P>
	We are now seeing why this minister has been such a failure as 
Minister of the Environment. She simply does not recognize an 
environmental question when she hears it.
<P>
	How quickly the minister chooses to forget my recent 
questions regarding the clean-up of Canada's worst 
environmental disaster, the Sydney tar ponds in Nova Scotia, or 
my colleagues' questions regarding MMT.
<P>
	When is the Minister of the Environment going to take charge 
and quit whining that her failures are due to the opposition? 
When is the minister going to take charge of her own department 
and pass some meaningful environmental legislation?

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, some 
controversy has arisen relative to the diversion of public funds 
originally slated for the development of Nova Scotia highway 
104.
<P>
	This funding has now been redirected to a tourist trail in the 
riding of the minister of public works. In lieu of the original 
federal-provincial funding agreement for the upgrading of route 
104, a toll funded highway is now being envisaged.
<P>
	This is unacceptable. There have been 40 tragic deaths since 
1986 in death valley. People's lives are far more important than 
developing a tourist trail.
<P>
	Yesterday in this House the Minister of Transport told us that 
his government had permitted this diversion of public funds at 
the request of the Government of Nova Scotia.
<P>
	Given that the highway improvement program calls for a 
written agreement in these cases, I call on the Minister of 
Transport to table all correspondence and documents relative to 
this backroom deal.

	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the proposed public service cutbacks are causing quite 
the stir across the country, particularly in Newfoundland, where 
the jobless rate remains unacceptably high.
<P>
	In my riding for example, there is concern about the 
restructuring and downsizing proposals for Canada employment 
centres, and about the workforce adjustment policy, job 
security, seniority rights and the desirability of making 
departure incentives available to all employees.
<P>
	Although the government has taken a step forward with its job 
swap offer, there still is a great fear that the level and quality of 
badly needed services will suffer at the worst possible time. I 
share those concerns.

<P>
	To mark the opening of the festival, Her Royal Highness 
Princess Margriet of the Netherlands took part in a midday 
ceremony at Major's Hill Park to launch the 1995 edition of the 
festival. The festival also coincides with the 50th anniversary of

Davidson has vowed to wheel his son across the entire province

Jesse is 14.

anti-worker attitude of Liberal members is reflected in every 
page of the report on the national marine strategy tabled by the 
Standing Committee on Transport.
<P>
	The report contains many negative comments on the 
supposedly excessive salaries and on job security. On the basis 
of two recent disputes, the committee recommends that a 
commission of inquiry be made responsible for reviewing all 
aspects of labour-management relations. The Liberals are set to 
call into question a smoothly operating negotiation system in 
order to resolve a problem that exists only at the Port of 
Vancouver.
<P>
	May I remind you that, since 1975, only 27 working days have 
been lost as a result of strikes or lockouts at the Port of 
Montreal, out of a total of more than 7,000 working days.

	In the first period Liberals were given penalties for boarding, 
the gravy train that is. Another penalty was given for charging 
the taxpayer. The Liberal pork patrons went offside with 
Canadian voters. The overburdened taxpayer delayed the game

blood. They will get the final score in the next election. When

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="UNEMPLOYMENTINSURANCEREFORM">UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE REFORM</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, although somewhat late in the day, the Minister of 
Human Resources Development finally used some common 
sense and decided to give up his two-tier unemployment 
insurance system, with one tier for the seasonally unemployed, 
with reduced benefits, and the second tier for the rest, with more 
substantial benefits. However, there is still cause for concern, 
since the minister said he still wanted to make frequent 
claimants less dependent on unemployment insurance and 
planned to submit new proposals to cabinet very shortly.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister confirm that his government has 
definitely abandoned the minister's baby, and I am referring to 
the unemployment insurance reform proposal for a two-tier 
system, and is he prepared to make a commitment that the new 
proposals will not penalize frequent claimants, although the 
minister seems to be saying that he still has the same objective 
in mind?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.
<P>
	As the member knows, we had a wide variety of 
representations, studies and examinations. It was certainly 
recognized that the primary objective of UI reform must be to 
help people get back to work. We can use that system not simply 
to pay basic benefits but to also enable people to get the tools 
they need to restore themselves back in the labour market. That 
is still the primary function of our intention on unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	We saw with the various options we presented, one of which 
was the two tier proposal, that it would add complexity to the 
system and probably additional cost. I think we can find a much 
better alternative which will simplify the system and at the same 
time provide a much better set of work incentives for people to 
get back in the workforce.
<P>
	We are still very much on target and on aim to enable 
Canadians to get away from unemployment and get into 
employment, the whole purpose of our reform.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to what the minister said in his 
answer, and after trying very hard, I think I understood the 
minister was giving up his plan. I want to commend him for 
doing so, since a minister who admits his mistakes gains in 
stature. Would that others followed his example.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> My question is directed to the Prime Minister, 
and I hope to get an answer from him. Since the government is 
about to review its unemployment insurance reform, will he 
promise to stop using the Unemployment Insurance Fund to 
finance new intrusions by the federal government in provincial 
jurisdictions, especially in manpower training?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Human Resources Development will 
table a bill this fall that covers all aspects of the question asked 
by the Leader of the Opposition.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, since the Minister of Human Resources 
Development claims he will stay the course, in other words, 
restrict access to unemployment insurance for frequent 
claimants, does this mean, and my question is directed to the 
Prime Minister, that the government's real objective is not to 
make the system more effective but to reduce costs by 
restricting access and reducing benefits, which means it will 
again be hitting hard at the unemployed?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the minister said a few minutes ago, the 
government's objective is to ensure that people can work. This 
government's objective is to create jobs, and the aim of reforms 
in unemployment insurance and other social programs is to 
make it possible for people to work with dignity instead of being 
completely dependent on unemployment insurance or welfare.
<P>
	That is why the minister wants to reform the system, and we 
will have a chance to discuss this when the minister tables his 
reform proposals this fall. This reform is badly needed, because 
<P>

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	As fighting intensified in Sarajevo, the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs indicated yesterday that he was unhappy with the current 
situation, stating that the peace plan was going nowhere. He also 
indicated that he would soon be consulting with the French and 
British authorities, hinting that a pullout from Bosnia could be 
closer than ever.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister confirm what his Minister of Foreign 
Affairs said yesterday about the possibility of Canada 
withdrawing its peacekeepers from Bosnia in a few weeks?
<P>
[English] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Canada calls on both 
parties to withdraw their forces from the zones of separation.
<P>
	Canada's position all along has been that the conflict can only 
be resolved at the diplomatic table, politically, not by military 
means. That is still Canada's position.
<P>
	The minister made it very clear Canada will not withdraw its 
forces unilaterally. We are consulting with our partners, France, 
Great Britain, et cetera.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
could the Prime Minister or, again, the parliamentary secretary 
tell us whether Canada is prepared to consider UN 
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali's suggestion that UN 
troops in Bosnia be reduced and regrouped?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the situation is obviously very complicated in that part 
of the world at this time. As the hon. parliamentary secretary 
said, Canada belongs to a group of countries ensuring a military 
presence in the area and we have agreed not to withdraw without 
first consulting with our partners. The French have indicated 
that they were contemplating pulling out, but if and when they 
do, it will not be unilaterally, since they have asked us not to 
withdraw our forces unilaterally.
<P>
	As far as we are concerned, any suggestion from the UN 
secretary-general deserves to be considered because 
peacekeepers are under UN command.
<P>
	So, consultations are under way with the secretary-general, 
and we will inform the House of any new development.

<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development has failed to 
reform anything. His plans for a two tiered unemployment 
system are now on the back burner, as are income contingent

not even make it to the back burner. We fear the minister is going

	Reform of social programs is a very high priority for the

consultations with the provinces. Members of Parliament have 
held consultations across the land over many months. We will 
put all the discussions together and take them to cabinet during

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr.

but the fact is Canada's social safety nets are in a terrible mess.
<P>
	The federal government's influence over medicare is 
diminishing, CPP is headed toward bankruptcy, consultations 
with the provinces are going nowhere, UI is unreformed and 
Atlantic Canadian workers are quitting their jobs to get on

	A government that proclaims to be the architect and defender 
of social safety nets is now presiding over the demise of those

delighted to have his support. It is great that the Reform Party is 
now getting more and more Liberal.

program hurts not only Canadians dependent on those programs 
but also taxpayers.
<P>
	Every member of the House knows there is absolutely no way 
the federal budget will be balanced unless there is social 
program reform and reform of social spending. If the Minister of 
Human Resources Development cannot lead that overhaul, then 
someone else in the government must be assigned the job.
<P>
	With the Prime Minister prepared to provide leadership on 
this subject, since his government's budget is undermined by the 
failure of this minister to overhaul social funding, is it the 
Department of Finance that will now be providing the leadership 
for social reform?

I named an extremely able minister to be in charge of this very

<P>
	Given the condition of our public finances and the fact that the

have the opportunity for themselves and their families to return 
home from time to time, once a year in fact.
<P>
	Of late the policy has involved a reduction in the amount of

<P>
	A key recommendation of the Fraser report was that the 
federal government not expand the native only commercial 
fishery. In his rush to conclude the AFS agreements by Monday, 
the minister expanded this native only commercial fishery to 
include early chinook salmon on the Fraser River.
<P>
	Can the minister explain why he broke his commitment to 
follow John Fraser's recommendation not to expand the AFS 
commercial fishery?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Delta 
for his question. I know of his interest in the protection of the 
salmon resource.
<P>
	However, the member will know that what the Fraser panel 
reflected on, both in the report and in the press conference which 
was held, was the need to ensure that early sales agreements 
were signed in order to ensure that proper management routines 
were put in place.
<P>
	I would have thought that the member would have wanted to 
stand in his place, given his comments on this matter in the past, 
and reflect out loud on the fact that this year for the first time 
since sales have been implemented we have agreements in place 
fully two months earlier than was the case last year. All of these 
agreements were reached by the May 15 deadline put in place by 
the federal government. As a consequence of the early 
agreements, we will have the best managed, best conservation 
regime in place for salmon this year for the sales programs in 
British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
is quite correct. Mr. Fraser recommended the early signing of 
the native fishing agreements so that workable enforcement and 
management regimes would be established prior to the opening 
of the first fishery.
<P>
	However, by allowing the native commercial fishery to start 
within days of signing the agreements the advantage of the early 
signing is lost.

	<B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

is possible for aboriginal people to make and keep agreements in 
good faith, and who believes it is possible for the people who 
represent the First Nations and the Government of Canada to sit 
down and come to reasonable terms on a reasonable sales 
agreement, would come to the conclusion that having reached 
agreements two months early, having met the requirements of 
the Fraser panel report and having negotiated in good faith, is a 
matter to complain about. That is a matter to celebrate.

question is for the Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Last week, the auditor general reported that the Department of 
the Environment has not established a program for the disposal 
the federal government's PCBs, nor has it estimated the total 
cost of such an operation. The auditor general also confirmed 
that no funds have been earmarked to cover the cost.
<P>
	Since the Minister of the Environment has committed herself 
to disposing of the federal government's PCBs before 1996, will 
she tell us what the total cost of this operation, which 
supposedly is already in progress, will be, and where the 
departments should cut in order to find the necessary funds to 
meet her objectives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government decided to put an end to the never ending search for 
a site precisely because $20 million was spent on the fruitless 
search for a federal site between 1988 and 1994. I felt that this 
expenditure related to the green plan was no longer justifiable, 
and I asked Public Works Canada to resume sending these 
products to Swan Hills in Alberta from the month of March 
onwards.
<P>
	Negotiations are ongoing and, as the former minister of the 
environment will explain to the hon. member, the cost of 
disposing of PCBs is not Environment Canada's responsibility. 
Each department that is responsible for PCBs must pay the cost 
involved in shipping them to Swan Hills. In addition, under the 
supervision of Public Works, we are already negotiating with the 
Department of National Defence, among others, to also ensure 
that we will not have to absorb the storage costs and to ensure  
that we will be able to dispose of all of the federal government's 
PCBs by the end of 1996, as was promised in the green plan.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
minister is looking for sites, we can show her the ones we found 
last week.
<P>
	How does the minister expect us to believe her promises when 
her colleague from Public Works has said not only has no 
contract been negotiated with Bovar Inc, the company which 
will be disposing of the PCBs, but also that it is still much too 
early to forecast the related costs or the timing of the disposal of 
the federal government's PCBs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is precisely why I 
told the House last week that I took the decision at the end of 
March to stop spending federal money on the search for a site in 
addition to Swan Hills. I turned to negotiations instead. That is 
what I explained last week.
<P>
	The Department of Public Works is in the process of 
negotiating with each department to find out the quantities of 
PCBs and where they will be shipped, and I am certain that 
negotiations have already begun in the Atlantic provinces. The 
hon. member for London issued a press release in March 
regarding PCBs and the disposal plan-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

Can the minister guarantee that she will use all the resources of 
her department to ensure that the company will be held 
responsible for the complete restoration of this site?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to follow up on the 
points made by the auditor general last week on contaminated 
sites, it is the view of the government that when a company 
occupies a site and has a signed leasing arrangement with the

millions of dollars. We intend to ensure that if any decision is 
made about a change in location of this operation, all the costs of

	Because of the more recent indications of the European 
Union's likelihood of moving on the issue, we are pursuing on 
an urgent basis with the European Union, with the United States 
and Russia, with other countries directly involved in the issue, 
to design and agree on what is called a more humane trap so that 
we can resolve the issue during the current calendar year.
<P>
	However, I acknowledge to the member opposite that time is 
short. We shall need to consider as a fallback position, if the

realizes that time is of the essence.
<P>
	As a former trapper I can verify that the Conibear trap which 
kills the animal instantly rather than inflicting the suffering of 
leg hold traps, has been available for many years.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern development 
what his department is doing to encourage Canada's trappers to 
change over to non-leg hold traps as soon as possible, in order to 
avoid a major blow to the local economies which such a ban on 
Canadian furs would cause?

put significant amounts of money-I do not have the exact 
amount-into  training and into the development of a more 
humane trap.

	The problem is that we think no matter how humane the trap is 
there will still be European backlash against animal furs. We are

Surprisingly enough, Mr. Speaker, my question is for the

a penny.
<P>

understands what is going on, I point out that under the present 
program for older workers Montreal has 4 per cent of the 
Canadian population and receives over 11 per cent of the full 
support for older workers right across Canada, which I think is a 
substantial contribution that we are making.
<P>
	We have put forward as one major element in looking at social 
reform in the country how we could provide greater assistance to 
older workers. All we need now is the co-operation of the 
Quebec government to join us in that enterprise. Then we can 
jointly arrive at an effective answer.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last Wednesday I asked the minister of Indian Affairs 
what he had done about serious allegations regarding the misuse 
of band assets, capital project funds and housing moneys on the 
Yellow Quill Reserve.
<P>
	I am now in receipt of a letter from a band member who says 
that the Indian affairs department has finally admitted that the 
$2 million deficit was due to ``incompetent bookkeeping''.
<P>
	The band may have a financial management plan in place, but 
band members want to know what the minister has done to 
determine where the missing millions went.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe I responded to the 
question last week. I would be pleased to take the member's 
letter under consideration. Again I emphasize that there are 605 
First Nations out there. Over 80 per cent run their affairs well, 
and I never hear the Reform saying that is good. Some 152 of the 
remaining 200 have remedial action plans in place and we are 
working with them.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	We are working with the people to make sure they do the 
things the Reform allegedly wants. I quote the leader of the 
Reform Party when he said that his goal was to dismantle and 
decentralize my department's function, funding and 
responsibility and transfer them to local aboriginal agencies of 
government.
<P>
	If the Reformers are complaining, that is good. That is 
democracy. At least they are showing an interest in what is 
happening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to hear that the minister will take the letter 
under consideration, because it is addressed to him.
<P>
	The minister of Indian affairs cannot continue to ignore band 
members requesting financial accountability of their chiefs and 
council. As the minister knows, this is not an isolated case 
despite what he claims.
<P>
	To pay for the so-called incompetent bookkeeping band 
members must forgo much needed capital projects and social 
programs. They have called on the minister to uphold his 
fiduciary obligation to them.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the same minister. What 
steps will the minister take to hold chiefs and council financially 
accountable to all band members and guarantee that abuses like 
this will never happen again?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, a letter is being drafted, in 
response to that letter, to the member. A full review is under way 
in this instance and I wanted to advise the member of it.
<P>
	I repeat that members of the Reform Party never look at the 
good side of what is happening out there. They take isolated 
cases like they did on immigration and on anything else in the 
House that they oppose, such as the gun laws. I say they should 
go and talk with the people they represent. I can assure them that 
most people want to do the honourable and just thing for native 
people to get true self-government and to bring some dignity 
into the process rather than single out individuals in the House 
and come close to defaming them.

	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Essex-Kent, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	In recent weeks we have read about the projected closures of 
all agricultural centres across our rural communities. These 
services provide a very vital service for agriculture in Essex and 
Kent counties as well as other rural areas.
<P>
	What will the minister do to maintain agricultural 
employment services across Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I point out to the hon. 
member and members of the House that as part of our reform 
program we are presently engaged in a major reinvention of the 
way the department provides delivery of services. It is our 
expectation that by this time next year we will have 
substantially expanded the level 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12724"> 12724 </A></B>
<P>
of service to rural areas by providing more delivery points at 
areas where they have major responsibilities.
<P>
	In terms of the special activities under the agricultural 
employment service, we are prepared to sit down with the 
agricultural community, the Canadian Federation of Labour and 
the horticultural society to work out ways to have direct 
partnerships with the agricultural community in the rural areas 
and to both have a facility in which we share in the opportunities 
that the centres can offer for jobs and employment. That is part 
of the new partnerships we are trying to establish in 
reorganizing the department.

	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister responsible for Public Service 
Renewal.
<P>
	In its budget, the federal government announced that the 
public service would be reduced by 45,000 positions over three 
years, including more than 12,000 in the Ottawa-Hull area. The 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal seems to be 
unable to give specifics about the extent of these cuts, stating 
that it should be a rather large number, but that he does not know 
the exact number because it varies from department to 
department and from day to day.
<P>
	Are we to understand from what the Minister responsible for 
Public Service Renewal said that the decision to eliminate 
45,000 public service positions was an impromptu, last minute 
kind of decision?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member from the opposition knew 
anything about public administration, he would know that, when 
plans are made that affect departmental administration, it is 
clear that each department will come up with a different plan and 
that surplus notices will be sent out on the basis of evolving 
needs.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	It is therefore impossible for any department to indicate today 
what it has done because, obviously, its plans are implemented 
on a day by day, week by week basis, and the answer that was 
provided is correct.
<P>
	What is important to know is that we are going ahead with our 
plans to streamline the public service; we are in the process of 
implementing the measures announced in the budget with 
efficiency and competence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réjean Lefebvre (Champlain, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if, as 
the minister claims, this was not an impromptu decision, does he 
undertake to release the department by department program 
evaluation report, which resulted in the decision to lay off 
45,000 public servants, and to tell us how the work force 
adjustment program will be carried out?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, the budget tabled before this House clearly spells 
out the government's fiscal plan and its impact on each 
department.
<P>
	The government had the courage to make the decisions 
required. Unfortunately, this means that certain positions will 
have to be eliminated. We acted in a humane way, providing 
programs such as early retirement or buyout packages and, so 
far, the unions feel that the budget is being implemented 
appropriately and efficiently, in an effort to accommodate the 
public service.

	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently an American tourist was acquitted of assault 
for spanking his five-year old daughter. Every parent in Canada 
was on trial.
<P>
	Last June the minister stated that the government was 
reviewing section 43 of the Criminal Code. This section permits 
parents and educators to physically discipline their children 
using reasonable force. The minister also stated: ``I know of no 
plan at present to propose a change to this section''.
<P>
	My question is for the justice minister. Will the minister state 
today the outcome of the government's review of section 43, and 
regardless of that outcome will he reaffirm his support for 
section 43?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am satisfied the 
section in the Criminal Code complies with our obligations. I 
can tell the hon. member and the House that the government has 
no intention to introduce any change to section 43 of the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a supplementary question. If the minister has no 
intention of changing section 43, why in the world is his 
government continuing to fund the Children's Bureau review of 
section 43?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I made clear in my 
response to the question when it was last put, because we are 
signatories to international conventions and treaties we are

<B><A NAME="12725"> 12725 </A></B>
<P>
obligated like other civilized countries to do an audit of our laws 
to ensure they reflect the  values and the principles to which we 
subscribe with other nations.

	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance who will know from press 
reports today that his present seatmate has said: ``Cash means 
clout. No cash, no clout''. He went on to point out that the 
majority of members of the finance committee agree it is 
important for Ottawa to maintain the cash transfer to make sure 
the federal government maintains its influence, meaning the 
ability to enforce legislation like the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance agree with his seatmate that the 
idea bears merit and that he will consider it in terms of changing 
the legislation presently before the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development 
-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly would like my 
colleague to answer the question and my colleague would like to 
answer it.
<P>
	We are delighted as a result of the reform of House of 
Commons committee rules that we have a very active, dynamic 
and incisive finance committee of the House.
<P>
<B>(1500 ) </B>
<P>
	As to the particular comments of the chairman of the 
committee, as the hon. member for Kamloops knows, we will be 
sitting down with the provinces, and quite clearly we do not 
want to do anything premature in terms of those discussions 
with the provinces. It is very important for us to hear from the 
provincial finance ministers on this issue.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday morning the justice committee heard moving 
testimony from Burlington resident Priscilla de Villiers on gun 
control. In no uncertain terms, Mrs. de Villiers stated: ``Let me 
tell you about inconvenience. The death of your children at the 
hands of a man wielding a gun is an inconvenience.''
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice if he feels the proposed gun 
registry contained in Bill C-68 will inconvenience Canadian 
gun owners.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is telling that 
the question of the day did not come from the other side of the 
House, because the witnesses yesterday were victims of 
violence with firearms and they were not in a position that could 
be exploited by the Reform.
<P>
	The very purpose of Bill C-68 is to address the kinds of 
tragedies the committee heard about yesterday. The point is 
perhaps best made by comparing on the one hand the 
inconvenience of filling out a form and mailing it in with $10 
over the next five years and on the other hand losing a member 
of your family.
<P>
	I am often asked for proof that registration of firearms will 
achieve something for Canada. For those who ask for proof, I 
suggest they speak to the parents, the mother who yesterday 
described the tragedy of losing a child, speak to the children 
whose mother is dead because she was shot in her home.
<P>
	This government with this bill stands with the Victims of 
Violence for Change. This government stands with the police 
chiefs and the police across this country. We shall not fail them.

understanding of the rules under the standing orders is that is not 
a proper question for question period. I would ask you to rule on 
this issue, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is correct in stating that we 
cannot ask questions in the House that directly relate to a 
committee. In my interpretation of the question, it would seem 
to me that at the time I heard it, it seemed to be general enough.

financial and emotional interdependence are necessary to ensure 
the equal treatment of gays, lesbians, and bisexuals under the

children learn how to live as responsible global citizens. We 
know we consume too much of the world's resources and we 
want to learn how to change.
<P>
	In the second one, the petitioners say: We believe in

discussions on Canadian foreign policy and global issues. We 
believe that global education is an investment to counter the 
social, economic, and environmental deficit facing the 
developing and developed world.

non-governmental agencies are the best delivery system for 
global education and for overseas development assistance. We 
commend the work of the Kawartha World Issues Centre based 
in Peterborough and four surrounding counties as effectively 
linking global issues to local action for justice across many 
sectors of the community.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> When we present petitions it is not necessary to 
be either for or against a petition. We have been doing that on all 
sides as of late. I ask you to simply present the petitions.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions to present. The first petition concerns the 
provisions of Bill C-68.
<P>
	The petitioners wish to express their opposition to the 
universal registration of long guns, restrictions and controls on 
the purchase of ammunition and the undue use of regulation by 
order in council.
<P>
	They therefore call on Parliament to refrain from passing Bill 
C-68 as it presently stands.

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition is very thick. It is from virtually every resident 
of the Arborfield, Zenon Park area and represents those who use 
the Arborfield subdivision of the Canadian National Railway 
which now serves an excellent grain producing district as well as 
a large alfalfa dehydrating plant employing some 40 people. 
Without the line the future of the plant and the village of 
Arborfield is in doubt.
<P>
	They ask, therefore, that the Parliament of Canada support 
Canada's rural way of life by rejecting the policy proposals now 
before it which lift the prohibition orders on branch lines and 
instead develop agriculture and rural development policies for 
Canada in which rural citizens are considered to be necessary 
humans with spiritual, social and economic needs; not to treat 
them just as statistics.

60 residents of Kapuskasing and area on the gun registration 
legislation.
<P>
	The petitioners are asking Parliament to deal more with crime

	I am also presenting a fifth petition signed by some 50

<P>
	<B>Mr. Gary Pillitteri (Niagara Falls, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I present the following petition 
dealing with sexual orientation.
<P>
	The petitioners from my constituency believe the term sexual 
orientation in Bill C-41 is ambiguous and therefore would 
broaden implications indicating societal approval of same sex 
relationships.
<P>
	They humbly request that section 718.2 of Bill C-41, the 
sentencing bill, be rescinded. This petition contains 113 
signatures.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Julian Reed (Halton-Peel, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
two petitions, the first containing 40 signatures.
<P>
	The petitioners pray and request that Parliament not amend 
the human rights code and the Canadian Human Rights Act or 
the charter of rights and freedoms in any way which would tend 
to indicate societal approval of same sex relationships or of 
homosexuality, including amending the human rights code to 
include in the prohibited grounds of discrimination the

that Parliament support laws that will severely punish all violent 
criminals who use weapons in the commission of a crime, 
support new Criminal Code firearms control provisions which 
recognize and protect the right of law-abiding citizens to own 
and use recreational firearms, and support legislation that will 
repeal and modify existing gun control laws which have not 
improved public safety or have proven not be cost effective or 
have proven to be overly complex so as to be ineffective and/or 
unenforceable.

excess of 60,000.
<P>
	The petitioners are calling on government to keep dangerous 
sex offenders and pedophiles locked up for life, to eliminate 
statutory release, to impose stiffer sentences for violent 
offenders, have violent criminals serve their full sentence and 
have time added for bad behaviour, and on and on.

<P>
	The petitioners would like to draw to the attention of the 
House that managing the family home and caring for preschool

recognized for its value to our society. They also state the 
Income Tax Act discriminates against families that make the 
choice to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill or the aged.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House do now adjourn for the purpose of an emergency debate on 
a specific and important matter requiring urgent consideration.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Both the council for the James Bay Cree and the Yukon 
Indians have agreements with the federal government which are 
appendages to the Constitution of Canada. Both groups claim 
their constitutional rights demand consultation with the federal 
government prior to the enactment of federal law touching on 
hunting, trapping or food gathering.
<P>
	The testimony of both groups before the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs claims unequivocally that no 
consultation took place in the prescribed manner regarding Bill 
C-68 and therefore their constitutional rights have been violated 
by the federal government.
<P>
	I believe the allegations of the violation of the constitutional 
rights of the aboriginal people are so pressing that the public 
interest will suffer if this issue is not given immediate attention. 
The foremost responsibility of members of Parliament is to 
uphold the Constitution of our country and that can only be done 
in the House.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANDAIRYCOMMISSIONACT">CANADIAN DAIRY COMMISSION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from May 16 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-86, an act to amend the Canadian Dairy Commission 
Act, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday when debate resumed I was the first 
speaker following a rather bad movie unfolding in the House 
called ``milk wars'' between the Liberals and the Bloc 
Quebecois over what would happen to the dairy industry should 
Quebec separate. It was rather amusing at times.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports the tariff levels agreed to under 
GATT. However, we should become proactive in this area and 
address future concerns.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	I am concerned about the health of the dairy industry down the 
road. The trend toward more open and competitive global 
markets is happening whether we like it or not. Failure to adapt 
will undoubtedly result in the destruction of an industry that has 
provided Canadians with a quality product for many years. 
Dairy farmers must move to a more efficient means of producing 
milk.
<P>
	I would like to address a few aspects of Bill C-86. I have 
already mentioned that the Canadian government had no choice 
but to make alterations to the supply management commodities. 
As with many of these programs that were initially developed by 
the Liberals, they, the creators of the system, are reluctant to 
change them or drop them entirely. Sentimental feelings are 
driving the government's agenda.
<P>
	All we have to do is look at the GATT negotiations and the 
Liberals' position, who at that time were not the government, 
with regard to the GATT negotiations and article XI. They said 
that article XI was non-negotiable. They told people in the dairy 
industry to support them and they would defend article XI and it 
would be in the new GATT agreement.
<P>
	A few days after the Liberals took office, history shows us 
that in fact article XI had to be negotiated away. We had no 
support in the international community for article XI. 
Tariffication was put in place to replace that article.
<P>
	I might add the Reform Party anticipated this event. We said 
in our election platform that we believe the structure of national 
supply management agencies need not change at all as long as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12731"> 12731 </A></B>
<P>
these agencies continue to have the support of their producers. 
They should continue in any manner in which they feel best 
serves their interests. Tariffs will be reduced as other countries 
reduce their support. This will allow Canadian producers to 
remain competitive and will ensure that these sectors are able to 
adapt to the new market driven environment.
<P>
	The point that we raised was that tariffs should initially be set 
at levels sufficiently high to protect the domestic market and 
industry. We said that supply managed producers should have 
access to our comprehensive income stabilization program. We 
went on to say that import control regulations as a defence 
against foreign dumping should be rationalized and 
strengthened.
<P>
	We said that licensing and arbitration regulations as an 
improved safeguard against business which might engage in 
unfair practices should be strengthened. We also said that 
competition and anti-combines legislation intended to place 
limits on the power of buying groups should be strengthened and 
vigorously enforced. We concluded by saying that the impact to 
the sectors during the tariff reduction period should be carefully 
monitored.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that this approach will not only 
ensure the continued viability of supply managed sectors, but 
will build a bridge to a new era of opportunity and expansion.
<P>
	Bill C-86 fails to address the problems it has set out to 
correct. While the intent of the bill is to help the Canadian dairy 
industry to comply with the GATT regulations, it is almost 
certain that industry will be open to other trade sanctions, 
especially from the United States.
<P>
	The pooling market system which replaces the existing 
system of levies has long been a bone of contention with the 
United States. We have seen the response of the U.S. over the 
last five years to the effect of the Canadian Wheat Board. While 
the Canadian Wheat Board has been functioning in the manner it 
should and we have been winning the trade disputes, 
nevertheless the pooling is an irritant. If we are looking at 
pooling in the dairy industry we need to be very careful that we 
do not structure it in such a way as to become a trade irritant with 
the Americans, or at least not a trade irritant that we would lose a 
scrap over.
<P>
	The Reform Party is concerned that this government has not 
been honest and open with those farmers that are within the 
supply managed areas. I believe this government has not reacted 
to the global trend toward a more open and a more competitive 
market. As we know, Canadian dairy farmers are capable of 
competing in these competitive markets.
<P>
	More and more, Canadian farmers are going to have to 
compete in a global marketplace. As we see trading blocs 
forming, currently NAFTA is expanding with the inclusion of 
Mexico and negotiations with Chile and other Latin American 
countries, we realize that there will be more and more 
observation of our own trading practices here in Canada. We 
will have to be very careful as to how we design our marketing 
and our trade deals so that we do not jeopardize industries which 
at the current time are very sustainable and are functioning very 
well.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	The Liberal messages to the industry have been misleading in 
the past and we are concerned that they may be misleading in the 
future. We will be scrutinizing the bill very carefully to ensure 
that we are not sending the wrong signals to the dairy industry 
with respect to what it can expect in the future from agreements 
such as the NAFTA and the GATT.
<P>
	There have been some good questions brought forward in the 
House as to whether the NAFTA supersedes the GATT or the 
GATT supersedes the NAFTA. Those are important questions 
and we need more clarification from the government that in fact 
the legislation which it is proposing will not be challenged under 
the NAFTA and we will not lose the challenge.
<P>
	The question I ask of the government is whether Canadian 
dairy farmers will be given the tools and the time to adapt to a 
new market driven economy. We need not look any further than 
the current fiasco with the WGTA and the Crow buyout. Imagine 
a government which would discontinue the Crow benefit and 
replace it with a one time payout and then talks about a 
transition period and a transition program which would take 
place one year following the conclusion of the Crow benefit. 
That is not very good planning in my mind and I am getting the 
same message and the same signal from my constituents and 
other Canadians who are affected by the elimination of the 
WGTA, the Crow buyout and this transition program.
<P>
	It would seem to me that it would be much more logical to 
have a transition program spelled out before implementing 
legislation to end the Crow benefit and introduce a buyout to 
producers. We wonder about the logic of a government which 
would eliminate something and then a year later introduce an 
unspecified program to help the industry make the transition 
from transportation subsidies to an unsubsidized system.
<P>
	We have the same concerns about the dairy industry. We are 
concerned that the government is not looking at the long term. It 
is not considering carefully the outcome of its policies with 
respect to the dairy industry. It is not looking at the need to 
access new markets. It is not thinking long term; it is continuing 
to look only at the short term situation.
<P>
	Another important issue which needs to be addressed is 
whether supply managed industries should have access to 
income stabilization, in particular, a whole farm income 
stabilization plan. Many spokespersons in the dairy industry and 
other supply managed industries are suggesting they would not 
like to be a part of any income stabilization plan or a whole farm 
program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12732"> 12732 </A></B>
<P>
	I think part of the reason they are suggesting that is because 
the Liberals have made guarantees to them about the current 
supply managed system which perhaps are not supportable in 
logic. In fact, perhaps if the industry was given the true picture 
of what awaits it in the future it might be more interested in 
looking at belonging to some kind of income stabilization plan, 
something along the lines of NISA.
<P>
	Again I would communicate to the House that the Reform 
Party envisioned the need for that to happen. We suggested that 
an income stabilization plan should be a shared 
federal-producer program having universal application, which 
means all sectors. It would include the supply managed sectors. 
This would be made available at the whole farm level. If a farm 
produced many commodities all those commodities would be 
recognized by the plan. Supply managed sectors would have 
access to the program upon the introduction of tariffication.
<P>
	Of course, that was written before the tariffication was 
introduced. We were correct in anticipating that. I believe we 
were correct in anticipating that there will be a need for the 
supply managed industries to have access to a NISA type income 
stabilization program, given the market trends and the 
formation of a global economy in which eventually supply 
managed industries will have to participate and be in a 
competitive position.
<P>
	I would like to conclude my speech by asking the government 
to be more honest and more open with the Canadian dairy 
farmers. The government promised that it would be very open 
and honest with the public. It is in its red book. We sense that 
those pages are being torn out of the red book and it concerns us 
very much. It should concern dairy producers across Canada as 
well.
<P>
	Before the Liberals were elected it was very easy for them to 
say they would be open and honest, but they seem to be having 
some difficulty now fulfilling some of those red book promises. 
We are concerned that one of the casualties may be supply 
managed industries, in particular the dairy industry if the true 
situation of international negotiations and of course the 
jurisdiction of the NAFTA versus the GATT are not correctly 
and very clearly communicated to the industry. The Reform 
Party would like to see that honesty and openness with regard to 
this situation.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	Hopefully, the House will get away from the milk wars I spoke 
about in my remarks yesterday. I think we should quit talking 
about marriage and divorce and start talking about birth and 
death. Let us let the old system die and let us see a new Canada 
formulated in which we all get along well and where we do not 
have milk wars and turf wars over just about every other issue in 
Canada. To be competitive in the global economy we certainly 
cannot be scrapping within the borders of this great country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to provide a little background on the dairy industry in 
Canada. In the 1960s, there was no supply management in the 
dairy industry. Farmers were producing as much milk as they 
wanted.
<P>
	In the summer, when they were out to pasture, dairy cows 
produced three or even four times as much milk. The milk was 
put into containers commonly called milk cans. To keep the milk 
fresh, these cans were placed in the spring or the river nearest to 
the barn. At 9, 9.30 or 10 a.m., depending on the transporter's 
route, the cans were picked up on tripods along the road.
<P>
	The truth be known, freshness left something to be desired. 
Processing plants were drowning in milk in the summer, but 
come winter, farmers were having a more difficult time; in order 
to produce the milk, they had to buy meal, ingredients, inputs. It 
was not really worthwhile to produce milk in the winter. So they 
produced the maximum in the summer and stopped producing in 
the winter.
<P>
	That is what was happening on our farms during the 1960s and 
early 1970s. In 1970, 1971 and 1972, milk producers got 
together with government officials and set up standards, 
agreements. They said that there is no use producing too much 
milk if we are not able to use it and if we cannot sell it outside 
the country.
<P>
	They came up with supply management, that some people are 
decrying so strongly here in the House. Supply management 
requires a farmer to now produce 12 months a year, on a monthly 
basis. Our dairy farmer cannot keep the cream and give the whey 
to others. He has to produce milk in summer, fall, winter and 
spring. Therefore he must manage his herd in such a way that 
cows will calve all year long. He can non longer take advantage 
of geographical or climatic factors.
<P>
	In that regard, I would ask my Reform colleague to explain the 
second point that his colleague and friend so brilliantly 
explained yesterday in this House. The agriculture critic and 
member for Vegreville outlined the four points his party's dairy 
policy. I would like to have the second point explained further 
this afternoon.
<P>
	I quote: ``Second, Reformers acknowledge that the 
agriculture industry, including supply managed sectors, is 
moving toward a more competitive market driven system''. 
Where can there be any competition if a farmer is told that he has 
to produce 1,000 litres of milk for the local dairy, while one of 
his neighbours has to produce 1,100 litres, and the other has to 
produce 900?
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	Where can there be competition when, for milk of the same 
quality, one farmer is paid 47 cents a litre and another 46 cents, 
because he is a member of the Liberal Party, the Reform Party or 
the Bloc Quebecois? How can producers compete with one 
another under such circumstances, if they have to produce milk 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12733"> 12733 </A></B>
<P>
of the same  quality? I would like my Reform colleague to 
explain his view on competition.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for Frontenac for his question.
<P>
	He began by talking about what farming used to be like back 
in the 1960s. While I was not a grown man at that time, I 
remember what farming was like. I remember my parents 
shipping cream back in those days, not quite the way the hon. 
member described it, but it did bring back some memories 
hearing his comments.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Frontenac is aware, agriculture has 
changed substantially in the last 35 years. The industry and the 
producers are always far ahead of government. It is not 
government regulation or legislation that causes progress in 
industry, including the agriculture industry.
<P>
	Whether it be a supply managed industry, a free market 
industry or the growing of wheat under the Canadian Wheat 
Board, which is in neither of the aforementioned categories, we 
have seen dramatic changes in the industry over the last 35 years 
as world and domestic conditions have demanded better 
operating practices from farmers no matter what the commodity 
is that they produce.
<P>
	The member talked about the need for a consistent supply of 
milk over a 12-month period by producers. I understand what he 
is saying. He seemed to be indicating that my colleague from 
Vegreville was suggesting something that would be in conflict 
with that requirement. I was not in the House to hear what my 
colleague said yesterday on this issue, but he related to me that 
he talked about a need for a more competitive environment.
<P>
	The hon. member for Frontenac indicated that would pit 
producer against producer. Nothing could be farther from the 
truth. We are talking about the need to be competitive as a 
Canadian industry. We are looking at the industry versus the 
needs of the consumers and what consumers expect of the 
industry. We are also looking at what will be required both 
internationally and interprovincially with regard to the dairy 
industry.
<P>
	For the most part international agreements have already been 
signed. We know that Bill C-88 will be before the House very 
soon. It deals with internal trade in Canada. There are some real 
problems with internal trade, particularly in the dairy industry. 
Some things have to be dealt with. Part of that was the cause of 
the bickering between the Bloc Quebecois and the Liberals 
yesterday.
<P>
	I am sure what my colleague was suggesting and what I would 
reiterate is that the industry needs to be competitive. However it 
needs to be competitive as a whole industry, not producer 
against producer. In this way we can compete in the new climate 
under GATT and NAFTA and break down the barriers to internal 
trade  within Canada so that our agriculture industries and other 
industries flourish under that scenario.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to debate Bill C-86, an act to amend the Canadian 
Dairy Commission Act, especially as I was invited to do so by 
the member for Frontenac.
<P>
	As the member of Parliament for Matapédia-Matane, a rural 
riding, I have several reasons to be greatly interested in 
everything that concerns farmers. My interest in agriculture is 
not motivated by political or partisan reasons.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	My region owes its existence primarily to this industry. 
Nearly all the villages and towns in my riding were founded by 
settlers, who were farmers, of course.
<P>
	I like to remind people that, at the turn of the century, over 80 
per cent of inhabitants of Matapédia-Matane eked out a 
miserable existence in the country. They worked from dawn to 
dusk, but they were happy. I do not want to wax nostalgic, but I 
am one of those who do not deny their past, being very proud of 
their origins. Without agriculture, the riding of 
Matapédia-Matane would probably have never been 
developed. These farmers are responsible for building what we 
have here and the best of what we have.
<P>
	The result of their efforts is that the Lower St. Lawrence now 
boasts over 400,000 hectares of farmland and 2,600 agricultural 
businesses with sales in the order of $190 million a year. As I 
was saying, my contribution to the debate on Bill C-86 is 
motivated by several reasons.
<P>
	The first reason is probably that the farmers in my region, like 
those elsewhere in Quebec and Canada, have become real 
entrepreneurs and built real businesses over the years. They 
have built small, medium-sized and even large businesses, with 
all the risks involved. While subsistence farmers at the 
beginning of the century did not lead very risky lives, the same 
cannot be said of today's farmers who face fiercely competitive 
international markets. It is difficult to live beside a giant 
neighbour such as the United States of America with its 
formidable economic power and its climate, which is much 
more suitable than ours, especially in the Gaspé region. Last 
week, I went snowmobiling, because there are still two feet of 
snow in the sugar bush, so there were not many farmers out in 
the fields.
<P>
	Some farmers now administer thousands of dollars, and many 
jobs depend on their economic health and the continued 
development of their businesses. Bill C-86 should secure the 
future of milk producers for a while. This means that many 
farmers in my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12734"> 12734 </A></B>
<P>
riding will enjoy a better future and may even ensure their 
succession, something which is particularly difficult in my 
region.
<P>
	Without the farmers, our small communities will not survive. 
They were built thanks to the solidarity and the strong will of 
ordinary people who, over the years, have become great men and 
women, the builders of our country. Bill C-86 is proof that 
Quebecers always show solidarity, including with their 
neighbours, when necessary and when they do not feel pressured 
by the big federal machine, which often blindly imposes its will.
<P>
	If each region could plan its own development without having 
to meet countless standards, we would obviously have a more 
prosperous country which would surely work a lot better. If the 
federal government did not impose its standards and, instead, let 
the provinces decide freely and independently among 
themselves, the country that you call Canada would undoubtedly 
work a lot better.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	In any case, when Quebec becomes sovereign, it will show 
solidarity with its neighbours. As I said earlier, virtually all the 
small villages in my region and my riding were built around 
agriculture, and they continue to depend on that industry for 
their livelihood. Should agriculture disappear, a very large 
number of them would be abandoned overnight. It would be 
unfortunate to see a country, which our ancestors worked so hard 
to build, slowly disintegrate because people, who have given so 
much, have had to leave their regions.
<P>
	I am also pleased to discuss Bill C-86 because my region is 
one of Quebec's major dairy production centres. It took almost 
50 years of efforts to get to the enviable position that we, 
Quebecers, now hold in that market. Moreover, we invested 
large sums of money over the years to diversify, to produce more 
finished goods, and to fight effectively against outside 
competition. We are used to defending ourselves, and Bill C-68 
once again confirms our leadership, our vision and our courage.
<P>
	Moreover, Bill C-86 contradicts the federalist big names who 
wrongly assert that the rest of Canada will reject any agreement 
with Quebec, if it were to become sovereign tomorrow. On the 
contrary, an economic union is crucial for both parties, and 
everybody knows it.
<P>
	Bill C-86 embodies this principle. Six provinces have signed 
an agreement, and others will undoubtedly join in when they 
realize that it is in their own interest.
<P>
	In my area, dairy production alone generates 75 per cent of 
farm income and the dairy sector accounts for over 50 per cent of 
the farm businesses. The other main sectors are cattle, sheep and 
pork. That tells us a lot about the importance of the dairy sector.
<P>
	Looking at employment, that sector provides over 7,500 
permanent jobs, and thousands more seasonal jobs. Forty-eight 
per cent of the workers are under 40, which is truly remarkable.
<P>
	In spite of this, figures for the Matapedia Valley show a 22 per 
cent drop in farm acreage between 1981 and 1991. Over the 
same period, the number of farms fell from 420 to 285, a 32 per 
cent drop.
<P>
	While many factors can explain these drops, the main one also 
applies to other sectors. Raw materials from the regions go to 
major cities for processing, and the finished goods are then sold 
back to regions. Bill C-86 sets up a national pooling system of 
market returns that will help the sale of milk products abroad. 
That goal is praiseworthy, because it will enable us to counter 
the constant threat of foreign competition.
<P>
	GATT and NAFTA do not give us much choice. I think we 
should also consider the same approach in other areas, 
particularly research and development in agriculture, without 
any federal involvement. We could research and develop new 
farm products that could be processed in the regions. 
Specialized small regional businesses could revitalize rural 
areas.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	I congratulate the proponents of the agreement that is 
incorporated in Bill C-86 and more particularly Claude Rivard, 
the president of the federation of dairy producers, and a resident 
of my region of Matapedia Valley. I urge them to go even further 
and consider the future of agriculture in regions, including 
mine, because strong regions make for a strong country and a 
strong Quebec. Our survival and prosperity depend on a strong 
and diversified agricultural industry at the regional level. 
Thanks to specialized producers evenly and fairly distributed 
throughout the country, we will be able to successfully compete 
on world markets.
<P>
	There is no point trying to grow oranges in northern Quebec, 
but we sure can try to produce something else. There is no point 
trying to produce milk on a large scale on farms that are not 
suited to this type of production, but we sure can try our hand at 
something else. What I am trying to show through these 
examples is that the agreement underlying Bill C-86 is 
excellent, and that we should continue in this way. In Quebec, 
pooling of our resources is where our great strength lies.
<P>
	If farming is doing so well in Quebec, it is because we gave 
ourselves the means to succeed. Our farmers are independent, 
but have set up huge co-ops, pools and marketing boards which 
serve them well. Canada should follow suit and have 
independent provinces which still feel solidarity with each 
other. Unfortunately, the dinosaurs of centralist federalism have 
no options to put forward.
<P>
	We, in Quebec, will make the right choice, just like Quebec 
farmers have done recently. A sovereign Quebec will stand 
behind its Canadian neighbours. I want to tell you that, in my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12735"> 12735 </A></B>
<P>
rural riding, the people are very proud of  this agreement, and I 
am particularly proud that one of my constituents, a resident of 
Matapédia, is behind this initiative.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions and comments. I will 
recognize a member of another party, the hon. member for 
Durham.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am convinced 
that I was on my feet before the hon. member, and I thought that 
the custom here was to recognize the first member to rise.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member is absolutely right, 
but as he may already know, it makes for a much more 
interesting debate if the Chair gives a member of another party 
the opportunity to ask questions or make comments.
<P>
	So, I recognize the hon. member for Durham.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to congratulate the member for Matapédia-Matane for his 
dissertation on this bill.
<P>
	As I listened to the member's speech I was taken aback by 
how he used a federal agreement to argue the case of an 
independent Quebec. Actually, as I read this piece of legislation 
it occurred to me that this is one of the powerful things of a 
federal state like Canada, which can actually come to national 
agreements in the best interests of all the people of Canada, 
including the farmers of Quebec.
<P>
	The signatories in this agreement are not other independent 
countries. They are not states of the United States. In fact they 
are people who have agreed to make this arrangement within a 
federal state. Indeed, if my memory serves me correctly the 
whole concept of pooling and marketing board systems was 
created by the federal government in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	Most of the farmers in Canada recognize the importance of 
the federal government in the area of marketing and in 
establishing national marketing standards. My riding is also a 
very important area of milk production, contributing 2 per cent 
of the total milk production for the province of Ontario. I can tell 
the hon. member that if things were different, if things were as 
he would like them to be, the people in my riding would do the 
economic thing and start producing more milk to service our 
own domestic market, excluding the people of Quebec.
<P>
	Forty per cent of the industrial milk quota has been allocated 
to the province of Quebec. I want to assure the member that the 
people in his riding are very much taking advantage of the 
federalist system. I would like to bring that to the member's 
attention.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that we are 
interdependent and that Ontario has a production level of 40 per 
cent. It is a fact that one province can reach agreements with 
other provinces, but that does not necessarily mean that these 
agreements will be overseen by the federal government.
<P>
	Many agreements have been reached with Ontario, on a 
department to department basis, and both provinces have 
benefited from then. There were also agreements with New 
Brunswick. That is how I see the situation. The day we are 
sovereign, we will be able to negotiate our agreements without 
having to ask for permission from the head office, the federal 
government.
<P>
	We noted that six provinces came to an agreement, and we 
hope that the other provinces will understand, because it is in 
their interest to operate with the other provinces. Under such 
circumstances, they will be ready to move on their own 
initiative, at their own speed. That is how I see things. This is 
how the federation should have been operating for a long time, 
but this is not the way things turned out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
start by congratulating my colleague for his remarks. I think it 
was very appropriate for him to talk about the contribution of the 
people who built his region, Quebec, and several other regions 
of Canada. The builders of both our nations, Quebec and 
Canada, are mostly farmers.
<P>
	Agricultural development gave birth to small villages, some 
of which later became larger villages and then grew into towns, 
small and large. In this context, this historical review seemed 
important as part of my colleague's speech. He also used a rather 
harsh word to describe the federal government when he talked 
about the federal monster.
<P>
	I want to ask him a question about that. What bothers farmers 
and the majority of people in both our nations, Quebec and 
Canada, the most is to see the federal government interfering in 
areas that are not under its jurisdiction. Whether in health, job 
training, environment or agriculture, the federal government 
has a tendency to become an administrative monster which 
sticks its nose everywhere and does nothing really to favour 
regional economic development.
<P>
	Quebec would like to have a different kind of relationship 
with this federal monster. As my colleague mentioned, it would 
rather have direct agreements with the provinces. Quebec has a 
lot in common with Ontario. It may have less in common with 
the western provinces, but it does have strong ties with the 
United States. So this new kind of state that Quebec would like 
to become would allow it to negotiate directly with any province 
that would be willing to make a deal.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12736"> 12736 </A></B>
<P>
	Milk is a good example of the economic life of various 
regions of the country. Of course, Quebec has a higher 
percentage of milk production quotas, with close to 50 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	However, if we consider the Alberta beef production for 
example, we can see that Quebec buys nearly 75 per cent of the 
total production. In that sense, Quebec is a good friend of 
Alberta since it is a consumer of some of its products. The same 
thing happens when Quebec makes a financial contribution to 
the federal state and this federal state distributes the money. 
When the federal gives this money to western grain producers so 
that they can produce wheat and sell it on the international 
market, Quebec is giving back quite a lot to that region of 
Canada.
<P>
	The Quebec population represents 23 to 24 per cent of the 
Canadian population. If we were to receive 23 to 24 per cent of 
the federal budget for agriculture, we would be getting $800 
million more each year. So maybe our quotas are in fact more 
generous, but as far as financial fallouts are concerned, and I am 
talking here about direct annual statutory programs, we are 
losing $800 million a year. This figure does not even include 
special programs like those announced in the last budget, the 
$1.5 billion for western diversification for example. However, 
as announced, Quebec will also suffer cuts of 15 per cent this 
year and 15 per cent next year, but I heard nothing about a 
financial compensation for our region.
<P>
	All the special subsidies awarded to western Canada over the 
last seven or eight years amount to more than six billion dollars. 
Quebec contributed one fourth of that sum through its taxes. We 
have thus been extremely generous towards Canadian products 
and it would be only fair that, when the time comes to share in 
another form of economic activity like milk production, we get a 
larger share. By the way, when the system for western wheat was 
put in place, sales to China or eastern countries were subsidized 
by the federal government. This type of production was a lot 
more profitable than milk production. Farmers in that part of the 
country were not interested in producing milk.
<P>
	In other words, if you were a farmer, dairy farming was a job 
which paid less and was therefore less attractive. We agreed to 
do it, to develop our industry and improve its efficiency. Now 
that it is doing well, we are told: ``Maybe you got too much''. I 
was surprised by some of the chauvinistic interventions I heard 
in this debate, yesterday and again today, especially when my 
colleague from Frontenac was giving us market examples, 
examples of competition , and also examples from the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Speaking of the Reform Party, and I will conclude on that, I 
would ask my colleague whether he agrees with what I just said, 
since he talked about Mr. Claude Rivard, the president of the 
Fédération des producteurs de lait who said, and rightly so, 
quoting a respected American  editorialist, that the system we 
presently have is quite exceptional and that the United States 
would do well to implement one like it instead of trying to 
destroy it.
<P>
	I fail to understand the attitude of certain Reform members, 
when they say: ``Abolish it, let free competition take care of it. 
Let us do it the American way''. The most eminent analysts, 
however, would tell you that the result of the current American 
system is that they are investing 34 cents on the dollar instead of 
49 cents as we do in product development in the dairy industry.
<P>
	Therefore, that would be far from free competition, that 
would be abandoning Canada and Quebec to the American 
market. Regarding this, Mr. Rivard put it nicely when he quoted 
American economists and he is delighted with the agreement 
reached between six provinces a short while back at a meeting 
with 190 delegates. He is delighted that they voted unanimously 
in favour of the agreement. Bill C-86 is a step in the right 
direction as far as the Bloc Quebecois is concerned. It is also, I 
think, what Quebec and Canadian dairy producers have always 
wanted. They have a very fair system.
<P>
	It is acceptable to producers, and very inexpensive for the 
federal government when compared with other interventionist 
systems, such as the Crow rate, subsidies for western farm 
production or the eastern fishery. Yes, it is relatively cheap 
compared to other economic policies.
<P>
	So, when something is not broken, why fix it? Hence, I 
congratulate my hon. colleague on his representation and I 
would be interested in hearing his remarks regarding my 
comments which could only expound on his speech moments 
ago.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague has described the 
situation very well. Over the last 50 years, all of Canada's 
agriculture ministers, or almost all, have managed to leave our 
farmers increasingly worse off. My colleague gave a brief 
description of the situation in Quebec's towns and villages in the 
1960s. There were dairies everywhere. Each community 
processed its own milk, cream and butter. They were all 
self-sufficient, and there was some assistance from the federal 
government. Then, the government pulled out almost 
completely and left people to fend for themselves.
<P>
	I am very pleased to see that the provinces today are trying to 
go back to the system of 20 or 30 years ago.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before giving the floor to the member 
for Québec-Est, it is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to 
inform the House that the questions to be raised tonight at the 
time of adjournment is the following: the hon. member for Saint 
John-Infrastructure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12737"> 12737 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I too am very pleased to speak to Bill C-86, at the invitation of 
my colleague from Frontenac, not only  because he has asked me 
to take part in this debate, but also because agriculture is a topic 
dear to my heart, although in my riding of Québec-Est there are 
no farms as such, just a few retired farmers.
<P>
	It is of interest to me because I recognize the great importance 
of agriculture to the economic health of a country, and in Quebec 
we must do everything we can to maintain and strengthen the 
agricultural economy, and especially the all-important dairy 
sector. And in addition, because Bill C-86 is a good bill.
<P>
	Finally, the Liberal government has tabled a good bill, 
something we do not often see. It is worth mentioning because 
the very great majority of bills it has tabled to date have been, if 
not terrible, certainly mediocre and second rate. Take the 
budget, for instance, which was probably one of the worst 
proposals ever tabled in this House, a budget in which 
everything was done to protect the rich in this country and make 
the poor poorer. One more example of their lack of vision and 
understanding. Take the Lobbyists Registration Act, another 
rotten piece of legislation. In fact, there are several bills that 
have been really disappointing, at a time when the public 
expected so much of this government. They have been very 
disappointing indeed.
<P>
	However, Bill C-86 before the House today is a good bill, I 
must admit. And maybe it is a good bill because, basically, it 
was not so much the government as the farmers themselves that 
initiated this legislation. They were the ones to start the ball 
rolling. The farmers convinced the government to table this bill. 
They did everything they could to ensure that this proposal to 
pool resources and dairy production became a reality. I may add 
that Quebec farmers and dairy producers were largely 
instrumental in getting these proposals off the ground. They 
were actively involved in these plans for pooling dairy 
production. This is important. We are aware of that.
<P>
	As was mentioned by other members, there was a problem 
with dairy production in Canada. Formerly, $3 per hectolitre 
was collected to subsidize exports of dairy products, mainly 
butter and powdered milk, which represented about $160 
million.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The money was used to support the sales and distribution of 
these dairy products. Because of the new GATT and NAFTA 
agreements, Canada can no longer collect this money, because 
according to GATT and NAFTA, for various reasons this is 
perceived as money used to support unfair competition.
<P>
	Canada is eliminating this $3 levy per hectolitre, as a result 
milk prices will go down. Moreover, milk production in the six 
eastern provinces, except Newfoundland, namely New 
Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Quebec, 
Ontario, and Manitoba, which account for roughly 80 to 85 per 
cent of milk production in Canada, will be pooled and placed 
under  the authority of one commission, with one price and one 
milk.
<P>
	In the past, there was a difference between fluid milk or 
drinking milk and milk used in processing to make dairy 
products such as cottage cheese, butter, and powdered milk. 
From now on, there will be only one class of milk, one system 
and one price. All the quotas will be pooled, which means that 
all the provinces which currently have quotas will be able to 
retain them. Quebec, which accounts for 48 per cent of the total 
milk production, will keep the same production quotas, and so 
will Ontario and the other provinces.
<P>
	This new commission, which hopefully will be able to get 
along with the provinces and operate as efficiently as possible, 
will have increased powers enabling it to deal with the export of 
milk based products. It would also be responsible for pricing and 
selling quotas, for instance. Provinces will be allowed to trade 
quotas.
<P>
	However, we must admit that the main advantage of this new 
formula is that dairy production risks will be spread among 
dairy producers in eastern Canada, and that it will allow them to 
share the costs of managing the system. No doubt this will 
reduce the administration costs of the system, and we hope it 
does.
<P>
	I will make the point, and it is a point that must be made: dairy 
production is very important to Quebec. In fact, the entire 
agri-food system is very important. For example, in 1993, 
Quebec exported over $1.5 billion worth of natural foodstuffs 
and, in 1994, it increased these exports by almost 5 per cent over 
the same period in the preceding year.
<P>
	In 1989, for example, dairy products in Quebec represented 
35 per cent of the province's total agricultural revenues and 38 
per cent of Canada's dairy revenues.
<P>
	The dairy industry in Quebec is beyond a doubt one of the 
largest industries and therefore it must be preserved and 
protected at all cost.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-86 will result in the economic integration of this whole 
sector, with milk production being consolidated under a new 
Canadian Dairy Commission. This is one way of protecting the 
common interests of all the provinces. Dairy producers are 
united in protecting themselves and this vital industry.
<P>
	It must be said that the supply management system, 
particularly in the dairy sector, came under a lot of criticism in 
the past. The members of the Reform Party said it would be 
better to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12738"> 12738 </A></B>
<P>
eliminate the supply management system, because they prefer 
free competition.
<P>
	My colleague for Richelieu pointed out that it was not a good 
idea to eliminate the supply management system. On the 
contrary, if we compare our system with the American one, we 
see that we are well off with our own. My colleague for 
Richelieu drew attention to an article by Claude Rivard, 
president of the Fédération des producteurs de lait, in which Mr. 
Rivard quotes two editorials in <I>Hoard's Dairymen</I>, which is 
apparently the Bible of American farmers.
<P>
	The two editorials in this ``Bible'' noted that dairy producers 
had lost production value, in that an increasingly large part of 
the market had been taken over by wholesalers, food chains and 
supermarkets, to the detriment of farm producers. In other 
words, dairy producers in the United States have lost money. 
They have become poorer, they have suffered the highs and the 
lows of an insufficiently controlled market.
<P>
	The editorial in <I>Hoard's Dairymen</I> recommended that the 
United States develop a system like Canada's, that is, a system 
in which supply can be adjusted to suit demand. It pointed out 
that the supply management system in Canada is highly 
efficient. We know it is.
<P>
	We know that dairy production is volatile because production 
can be easily increased. Without a system to adjust production to 
supply, prices would vary significantly. Therefore the supply 
management system is a good one. It is better than the one in the 
United States and warrants keeping.
<P>
	Bill C-86 does just that: it makes dairy producers feel safer, 
more secure about this system being maintained, now that they 
have pooled their resources. This strengthens this branch of the 
industry and gives some indication of what lies ahead for them. 
This bill clearly shows that, contrary to the fears raised by 
certain individuals about quotas going down in value, the supply 
management system disappearing or this entire sector declining 
in the coming years, the system will be maintained, and I might 
add, even after Quebec has become sovereign.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	We must conclude from this bill that, even after Quebec has 
become sovereign, the supply management system will almost 
certainly be maintained. That is normal since, as we know, this 
bill was developed in response to international agreements such 
as NAFTA and GATT. It is an attempt to adjust to these 
agreements, which will be maintained after Quebec has become 
sovereign.
<P>
	We know that Quebec as well as Canada will accept the 
requirements of both NAFTA and GATT, according to which 
there should be no unfair competition and no new tariff barriers 
or other barriers like those currently encountered.
<P>
	Again, this is very reassuring to dairy producers since all 
dairy producers, from Nova Scotia to Manitoba, are now 
together in the same system. It will certainly be to their 
advantage to stick together, not only because this is an excellent 
system, a system that will maintain reasonable levels of 
production and income for them, but also because it keeps 
American producers at bay.
<P>
	If this system were to disappear tomorrow or be rejected all of 
a sudden, then we would obviously have to compete with the 
Americans, and our dairy producers might have a hard time 
staying in business, in spite of the fact that they may offer higher 
quality products than the Americans.
<P>
	This threat from the U.S. would be quite worrisome for 
producers, be they in Manitoba, Quebec or Nova Scotia, if they 
did not stick together, if they did not join in this pooling system. 
We can even predict that if Manitoba or Ontario decided to opt 
out of the pooling system after Quebec achieves sovereignty, 
this would create problems not only for that province and for 
Quebec but also for all the other provinces. The whole system 
could collapse, when it is beneficial to all dairy farmers in all six 
provinces.
<P>
	It would therefore be illogical, even irrational, and certainly 
economically harmful to bring down the system being set up 
under Bill C-86. This system is beneficial to all dairy farmers 
and will be maintained after Quebec achieves sovereignty.
<P>
	Quebec must achieve sovereignty, and it is in the farmers' 
interests to acknowledge that this will be good for the country as 
a whole because Quebec will want to repatriate the powers it 
needs in other sectors. However, dairy farmers in Quebec will be 
allowed to maintain this pooling system, which is beneficial to 
them and to their counterparts in other provinces. Upon 
achieving sovereignty, Quebec will be able to uphold the 
agreements in this sector and those that will be negotiated in 
other sectors.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	In fact, some economists published a report yesterday that 
explained that because of GATT and NAFTA, similar 
economically sound administrative agreements in other sectors 
will be maintained and will continue to exist.
<P>
	Once again, we have people saying that the end is near, that 
new borders will arise, that there will be customs check points 
between Quebec and Ontario. This is all purely hypothetical and 
just a lot of scaremongering. We know that even Europe has 
simple administrative systems that would work in Canada, 
between Quebec and Canada, and would not prevent free 
circulation of goods and services or alter generally beneficial 
agreements that exist now, like the pooling system to be 
implemented by Bill C-86.
<P>
	All this will continue. There is no reason to believe it would 
not, and the same applies to other sectors. There is every 
indication that this is what will happen. In fact,  farmers know 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12739"> 12739 </A></B>
<P>
that the federal system here in Ottawa constitutes the greatest 
single threat to the agricultural sector. We have said this so often 
it has become a-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A truism.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> -a truism that Quebec has been treated 
unfairly by the federal government. This has been going on for 
years. If Quebec really received its fair share, it would have had 
as much as $800 million annually. Quebec got a raw deal under 
the federal system. In fact, one of the threats to the dairy system, 
for instance, is BST.
<P>
	BST is a major threat, and this is very disturbing. The fact that 
they want to introduce BST in Canada is very disturbing indeed. 
I think it is totally unacceptable, and all dairy producers should 
be up in arms, and consumers as well. Introducing BST in milk, 
in this pure product, is almost sacrilege.
<P>
	This is all very disturbing. I think Quebec is well advised to 
get out of the federal system because the system is falling apart 
and heavily in debt. Canada has been warned twice during the 
past three years. The International Monetary Fund warned 
Canada it would have to turn its economy around because it was 
teetering on the brink. It seems our public finances are out of 
control. It is like a ship sinking in the middle of the ocean, and 
people who think the federal system is here to stay should 
remember the <I>Titanic</I>.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the hon. member for Québec-Est. He often 
performs eloquently on agricultural issues. However he speaks 
of a fairy world in which we can have our cake and eat it too.
<P>
	The member talked about the fear of the American market 
system and protecting his own people, the farmers of Quebec, 
from the American marketing system. The uniqueness of that is 
that America is a nation state. We are not talking about Canada 
being a group of 10 nation states; we are talking about Canada 
being a federalist state. Perhaps the member has not studied 
economic history, but sovereign states basically take care of 
their own people first. The concept is the welfare of the people 
who live within that country.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The GATT negotiation is a way of playing baseball. We are to 
play a game and these are the rules. Each team is trying to win. 
Each team is trying to be effective. It is an illusion to have a 
pooling system, keep all the good things and have a sovereign 
state. To argue that we are going to keep the good and do away 
with the bad is not how it works in reality. It has not worked in 
any country. Sovereign nations will take care of their own 
people first.
<P>
	Farmers in Quebec are the highest per capita income earners 
of all farmers in Canada. How could the member argue that they 
have been taken advantage of or that they are at a great 
disadvantage in the federal system when they are the best off 
economically of all farmers in the country?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is obvious that Quebec 
farmers are disadvantaged. It has been written all over federal 
budgets for years. We had proof of that again recently. We are 
reducing subsidies to milk producers in Quebec by 30 per cent. 
That affects Quebec. It certainly affects Ontario as well. 
However it is a known fact that Quebec has never got its share of 
federal dollars in terms of agriculture. It has received much less 
than its share. There is no doubt about it.
<P>
	If agriculture in Quebec is strong and well developed it is 
because we have good farmers. It is not at all due to the federal 
government. We would have had a stronger agriculture sector if 
the federal government had acted fairly with Quebec farmers.
<P>
	It is not a fairy world to speak about the GATT and free trade. 
It is obvious that the GATT and free trade with the United States 
have rules. They set ways that commercial interests can trade 
functions. We know as well that the understanding and trade 
relations which exist now, today, tomorrow and every day before 
Quebec sovereignty will continue afterward because that is one 
of the principles of the GATT. Economic relationships will not 
disappear overnight.
<P>
	My hon. colleague is the one who is dreaming when he thinks 
that the GATT has no weight. It is quite the contrary. The 
negotiations have weight. The structure that will be put in place 
by Bill C-86 will be respected by all other trade bodies, whether 
it be the GATT or anything else.
<P>
	I am not dreaming at all. We are not speaking of any kind of 
fairy world when we say the agreements that were taken or will 
be taken now will continue after Quebec sovereignty. It is 
entirely logical and entirely reasonable. Farmers today are 
undertaking the agreements in a very economic, reasonable and 
logical way. There is nothing emotional involved. It is in their 
best interest and it will be in their best interest after sovereignty.
<P>
	The milk producers of Manitoba and the milk producers of 
Ontario are not interested in United States milk producers 
competing with Canada or Quebec. The same reasoning is 
applicable elsewhere, like in Quebec and in every other 
province. They are not interested in having U.S. competitors 
coming into Canada. Besides, free trade does not allow it at the 
moment. GATT does not allow it either. It will not allow it after 
sovereignty. These agreements go beyond Quebec sovereignty. 
These are international agreements.
<P>

<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	The minute Quebec becomes sovereign, it will belong to 
GATT. There is no reason to even deny that Quebec will belong 
to GATT. We are living in a civilized world here. We are living in 
a civilized world where people respect each other and respect 
agreements that are signed in a reasonable way. Some people are 
less civilized than others, certainly. Some people also see 
problems where there are no. problems. They create fear but 
there are no foundations to those fears.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Resuming debate. With apologies for 
not recognizing him earlier, the hon. member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no 
apology is necessary. The mistake was at our end but 
nevertheless it is a pleasure to rise to address Bill C-86.
<P>
	Talking specifically to the bill, this is an act to amend the 
Canadian Dairy Commission Act. The purpose of the bill is to 
amend the act to provide for the replacement of the existing 
system of levies with a system of pooling market returns from 
different classes of milk. The idea of this bill is to bring that levy 
system into alignment with Canada's international trade 
agreements.
<P>
	I am the first one to admit that I do not know a tremendous 
amount about milk production. I am certainly a milk consumer. I 
go to the 7-Eleven and buy milk. I put it on my cereal and am 
happy to drink it, but I have only milked a cow once in my life. 
Apparently it is all in the wrists, but I had very little luck with 
that.
<P>
	I will speak a little on the idea of trade. I will also talk a little 
from my perspective as somebody who comes from a rural 
constituency about the obvious need to be sensitive to the farm 
community and the agricultural community while at the same 
time recognizing the realities out there.
<P>
	Certainly the reality today in this country and around the 
world is that we are moving more and more toward free trade. 
My hon. friend from Québec-Est has just spoken at length about 
how Quebec is a sovereign country, and if it should ever become 
a sovereign country, heaven forbid, how it would somehow turn 
the tide against free trade or be a hold out to free trade. It would 
protect itself from free trade as though free trade were like a 
cafeteria where you could pick and choose the agreements you 
wanted to make.
<P>
	Of course, that is unrealistic. It took around 100 countries to 
get a GATT agreement. I remind my hon. friend from 
Québec-Est and my friends in the Bloc that coming up in the 
year 2000, which is not very far away now, we are going to see 
another round of negotiations where undoubtedly tariffs will 
continue to fall. More and more pressure will be put on Canada 
and countries like ours that have supply management systems. 
We are eventually going to have to open up.
<P>
	I also point out to my hon. friend that under the NAFTA 
agreement and certainly under any new NAFTA agreements that 
would come as a result of allowing countries like Chile and other 
Latin American countries in, we are going to have to see things 
open up.
<P>
	Although I am somewhat sympathetic and I have heard from 
my friends about how supply management has served Quebec 
well in the past, particularly individual farmers, I can 
completely understand how important agriculture is to a 
province and to a country. It does not only produce agricultural 
commodities but it also produces a lifestyle. It produces income 
and people with fine character. That is very important and I 
believe in that.
<P>
	We are doing people a disservice if we are not straight with 
them, if we do not tell them what the reality is. The reality is free 
trade is coming our way and the best thing we can do now is to 
begin to make adjustments so that we can survive in that free 
trade environment.
<P>
<B>(1650 ) </B>
<P>
	Yesterday I watched on television as members of the Bloc and 
members of the government debated back and forth about 
whether or not Quebec was going to stay in Canada, what it 
would be like if it was outside of Canada and so on.
<P>
	People must remember that there is a third option. We do not 
have to settle for status quo federalism, which not only the 
people in Quebec are upset about, but also the people in the west. 
The people in my constituency of Medicine Hat are very upset 
with it.
<P>
	We do not have to settle for sovereignty. In fact, I understand 
my Bloc friends are moving away from sovereignty. Pretty soon, 
who knows, maybe they will be committed federalists the way 
they are moving around here.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They voted for the pension.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> They did vote for the MP pension. That is 
notable. They are quite happy to take those Canadian dollars 
when it comes to pension plans.
<P>
	There is a third option. It is important for dairy farmers in 
Quebec and all over the country to note that. Because only when 
we consider the third option can we make the argument that 
Canadian dairy farmers can still have a viable industry down the 
road. They need not fear the American juggernaut because there 
are ways to make dairy farmers in Canada competitive so they 
can not only survive, but can thrive in the free market 
environment.
<P>
	Let me talk for a moment about that third option. Canadians 
have been telling us that one of the biggest issues of concern to 
them is the debt and the deficit. The government has taken some 
baby steps to deal with that but those steps will not be adequate. 
The reason that should be a concern to dairy farmers and 
anybody who is in business is that with every day that goes by, 
we go another $90 million to $100 million in the hole. Eventual-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12741"> 12741 </A></B>
<P>
ly we have to pay interest on that. Of course  taxes have to go up 
to keep paying the interest on the debt and deficit. Every second 
that goes by we go in the hole another $1,036. It is $90 million to 
$100 million a day. Now our total debt is $551 billion and 
climbing.
<P>
	One thing that must happen in order to make dairy farmers 
around the country competitive is we have to balance the budget. 
We have asked the government over and over again to the point 
where some people have become weary of it, but it is an 
important issue. We have asked the government to tell us when it 
will balance the budget. It has refused to do that. By refusing to 
do that it sends a very negative message which also hurts dairy 
farmers and anybody who is in business. The government sends 
a message to the markets that it is not prepared to deal with the 
problem seriously. Thus we have high interest rates which again 
penalize particularly people in the agriculture industry.
<P>
	Before Canadian agriculture can be competitive with farmers 
around the world, we have to get those interest rates down. Right 
now there is an approximate 3 per cent differential with the 
United States. That is a huge competitive advantage for the 
United States. We have to beat that down.
<P>
	If we can get a hold on the deficit and the debt we will slay two 
dragons. We will slay the dragon of high interest rates and the 
dragon of high taxes, which make it very difficult to do business 
in the country and compete internationally.
<P>
	That is the option Reform is offering. It is one that the federal 
government certainly has not talked about. Of course, our Bloc 
friends would just as soon be out of the country so they have not 
really offered any constructive ideas for dealing with the debt 
and the deficit.
<P>
	While we are on the subject, Reform has also talked about the 
need to pass language and cultural issues down to the provinces. 
That would solve a lot of concerns people in Quebec have about 
confederation and federalism as it is today. We are sensitive to 
the fact they wish to preserve their language and culture. Reform 
agrees with that. We believe there can be a way of 
accommodating the desire of provinces to have control over 
language and culture in a large country such as Canada where 
there are many different interests.
<P>
	There are many other things we could talk about and many 
other arguments we could make for our vision of federalism. I 
hope those two address specifically some of the concerns that 
Quebec dairy farmers would have about competing more in a 
free trade environment.
<P>
	One thing that is going to be happening in the near future and 
which the government has talked about is the need to expand the 
NAFTA.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	The talk is that Chile will become involved very quickly in 
NAFTA. When that happens there are many people who suspect 
that the Americans will argue for more of an opening up of some 
of the protection we now provide for supply management. If that 
happens, if government is committed to expanding the NAFTA 
agreement as it says it is, there must be some accommodation to 
some of our trading partners to open these things up. Frankly, I 
would be surprised if the government denied that it was going to 
have to open things up a little bit more.
<P>
	Setting that aside for a moment, we have already talked a bit 
about the GATT agreement which will be renegotiated in a few 
years time and undoubtedly tariffs will be coming down more. 
Given that reality, I say to my Bloc friends across the way that 
they are doing the dairy farmers in their own province a great 
disservice by telling them, leading them on and making them 
think that there is some way we can preserve the status quo. Well 
there is no way.
<P>
	The best example of that, which my friend from 
Kindersley-Lloydminster pointed to earlier on, is what 
happened when the government made changes to the WGTA. 
People out west are saying: ``Yes, WGTA is coming to an end. 
We do not have a problem with that, but it would be nice if we 
could have had a little notice. It would have been nice if we 
could have made some of the changes that we needed to make to 
the transportation system so that we could compete in that free 
market environment''.
<P>
	On the one hand, we are moving away from the free market 
environment by dumping the WGTA, which is fine, but on the 
other hand, the transportation system is still not responsive to a 
free market environment. Unfortunately, in the next year or so at 
least and probably three years, farmers in the west are going to 
be caught in that situation. That is unfair and really reflects poor 
planning on behalf of the government. It hurts people. I believe 
many farmers in the west may have to go out of business because 
of that very poor planning on behalf of the government.
<P>
	Let us not repeat that mistake now by permitting dairy 
farmers across the country to think that somehow we can hold on 
to the status quo. The fact is that free trade is coming.
<P>
	As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, I do not 
know a lot about the production of milk but I do know a little bit 
about the consumption of it. I want to address some of the 
comments the member for Québec-Est made with respect to 
how this benefits dairy farmers.
<P>
	I remind my hon. friend that there has to be a balance here. 
Consumers need to be considered when we talk about these 
things. When my friend talks about how dairy farmers in the 
United States are suffering and this that and the other thing, he 
should know that consumers  are benefiting by the fact that there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12742"> 12742 </A></B>
<P>
is that competition. If anyone doubts that, they need only cross 
the border and look at the difference in the price of cheese, 
butter or milk compared to Canadian prices.
<P>
	I do not think the difference in those prices has to be the 
difference in profit margin between Canada and the U.S. If we 
could get our act together by getting our own input costs down, I 
think our own dairy people can be extremely productive and 
profitable. However, the key is for us to deal with that debt and 
deficit.
<P>
	When consumers have more money in their pockets by virtue 
of lower prices for things like milk, butter and cheese, they can 
also buy more of them. However, when they are very expensive 
because supply management builds in what I think we would 
regard as some inefficiencies, then people are a little bit more 
squeezed when it comes to buying groceries and they just cannot 
buy the same quantities they would be able to buy otherwise. 
That is something I would like my friend from Québec-Est to 
consider.
<P>
	I talked a little bit about the debt and the deficit and the need 
to offer a third option. One of the things that came up yesterday 
in debate between the Liberals and the Bloc was the whole idea 
of the status quo federalism versus separation.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the things happening lately with the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Parti Quebecois is they have been sending out signs that 
they are moving more toward the idea of sovereignty association 
and who knows what now. There has been a lot of talk about their 
having all kinds of internal problems and about some people 
being perhaps more committed to federalism than they would 
like us to believe.
<P>
	We would like to offer a chance to our friends in the Bloc 
Quebecois to take the extra step, come a little closer and 
consider Reform's vision of a decentralized Canada in which 
provinces will have their rights respected under the 
Constitution, in which we absolutely and completely support 
their rights to make some of the decisions that affect their 
well-being but on the other hand still allow them to remain part 
of one country and have more control of some of the things 
important to them in terms of international trade by virtue of the 
fact that they are part of one big country. They are not tiny 
countries among 150 in the world. They are part of Canada. 
Canada carries tremendous weight by virtue of its reputation and 
its size in terms of its economy.
<P>
	We encourage our friends to consider this when they are 
talking about international trade. Obviously when we have more 
trade in the world because of a larger economy we will be able to 
make better agreements. We encourage our friends in the Bloc to 
think about that as well.
<P>
	Any time the government brings forward legislation which 
brings rules and regulations in line with international 
agreements it is a step in the right direction. There are still some 
provinces concerned about the bill. We respect that.
<P>
	I encourage the government and members of the Bloc 
Quebecois to continue to move toward agreements that 
recognize the reality that we must have free trade. It is where 
everyone is heading.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
with interest to the hon. member.
<P>
	He talked about competition. He envied the American 
agricultural system and its milk producers. In Canada milk 
producers are better compensated than their American 
counterparts.
<P>
	Even so, the top 10 per cent of dairy producers only receive 
about 5 per cent return on their invested capital. Clearly from a 
business operation Canadian farmers are far from being 
wealthy. The hon. member is speaking about emulating a system 
that will make Canadian farmers far poorer than that.
<P>
	It is interesting that we have had both the Bloc and Reform 
members on their feet today speaking about the same system. 
They are talking about decentralizing, weakening the federal 
system.
<P>
	The NAFTA and the GATT have already weakened the federal 
government's ability to exercise economic policy within our 
borders. By decentralizing even further and allocating more 
powers to the provinces there is a point at which there would be 
nothing left. That is what both of these parties basically want to 
do. I am very happy to belong to the governing party which 
understands the need for national standards and national policy.
<P>
	We are debating a pooling agreement which draws to our 
attention the importance of a federal system with provinces and 
the federal government setting national standards, in this case 
for the pooling of milk.
<P>
<B>(1705 ) </B>
<P>
	It has the possibility of being downloaded to the provinces by 
certain authorities. At the same time it is establishing national 
standards. I believe some of my colleagues in the Reform Party 
would do the reverse. They would have each province make its 
own agricultural policy as it affected them.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to address whether they are in 
favour of a supply managed system Canada or an American free 
market system with lower incomes to farmers than in the 
Canadian system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has asked the 
wrong question. He asked if we are in favour of supply 
management as if that is a long term option. The hon. member 
should be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12743"> 12743 </A></B>
<P>
completely up front with his own constituents, the people of his 
province and the people of Quebec. He must know that although 
the government fought against NAFTA it has signed on to it. It 
said it did  not really believe in the whole thing but it has signed 
on to it. He must know supply management as it exists today is 
not a long term option.
<P>
	We are moving toward free trade so there is no point in pining 
in some sentimental way for the way things used to be 20 years 
ago. Tariffs are dropping every year. Ultimately we will see a 
situation, since the government signed the agreement, in which 
dairy producers will have to compete more on a premarket basis.
<P>
	Let us not complain about the way things are and how they 
used to be. Instead, let us get ourselves ready. The best way to do 
that is to get rid of the taxes. The hon. member talked about the 
American system. The one thing I admire about the United 
States is it has been able to hold its taxes down which gives it a 
tremendous trade advantage.
<P>
	We will be in the hole $32 billion this year. By the end of the 
government's term it will be over $100 billion. The Liberals are 
adding to it when they reap huge rewards through their MP 
pensions, but that is another debate.
<P>
	The point is we have to get a handle on the debt and deficit so 
we can get the taxes down so dairy producers and all business 
people will be competitive. Let us not be sentimental about the 
past. The past is past. Let the dead bury the dead; let us get on 
with the future and start making the changes we have to make in 
order to be competitive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see that the Liberals are anxiously waiting 
for my comments. I hope I will not disappoint them.
<P>
	I am very pleased to take part in this debate for two specific 
reasons. First, there is the importance of agriculture for the 
economy of my riding and my region of Estrie, the Eastern 
Townships. However, I also want to discuss certain arguments 
raised during this debate on Bill C-86, particularly this idea 
that, according to our federalist colleagues, once Quebec 
becomes sovereign, it would be impossible to preserve any form 
of agreement between Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	First, I want to point out that the Eastern Toownships, where I 
come from, and particularly the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, which I represent here, 
produce 2.6 million hectolitres of milk every year. This 
translates into net annual revenues of over $130 million for 
producers.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Dairy producers in the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead alone provide 1.2 million 
hectolitres of milk per year, which amounts to more than $60 
million in net revenues. Roughly 50 per cent of the milk 
produced in the Eastern Townships comes from the riding of 
Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead. Although I did not make an in 
depth study of the location of producers in my riding, I would 
say that three quarters of the production comes from the 
Coaticook region, which is known, not only locally, but 
throughout Quebec and even Canada, as the top milk producing 
region.
<P>
	Each year, the beautiful city of Coaticook holds its dairy 
festival. This event is an opportunity to fully recognize the 
importance of that industry in my region and in my riding. It is 
also an opportunity for our fellow citizens to celebrate, to meet, 
and basically to enjoy the fruits of their labour. This is one of the 
reasons why I really wanted to take part in this debate.
<P>
	I said a moment ago that I wanted to focus more on the 
relations between states, or to put it another way, between 
economic partners in the Canadian economic union, rather than 
on the actual substance of Bill C-86. My colleague from 
Frontenac, the Bloc Quebecois agriculture critic, has brilliantly, 
as always, explained why the Bloc Quebecois supported this 
bill.
<P>
	He is very familiar with the subject, with all aspects of the 
bill, and was able to substantiate his arguments, unlike the 
Liberal members opposite, of course, and our colleagues in the 
Reform Party, who would like to see a system of free enterprise, 
with no constraints whatsoever, a sort of no holds barred 
capitalism really, such as we had a number of years ago, and 
such as can still be found in some parts of the United States.
<P>
	Often our Liberal and Reform colleagues, and the member for 
Kingston and the Islands is a good example, use the word 
``separation'' when speaking about the sovereignty of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is what it is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> The 
Liberal party, the Liberal government, which is using our taxes 
to conduct all sorts of opinion polls, saw that using the word 
``separation'' worked to their advantage, because it struck fear 
into the hearts of Quebecers, and could lead to a ``no'' in the 
referendum.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	When people look more closely at what sovereignists are 
saying, when they take the time to really listen to what they have 
to say, they see right away that the sovereignist message is one 
of openness, of self-confidence.
<P>
	To put it briefly, what sovereignists want is for us to be able to 
look after our own affairs in Quebec, to be able to make our own 
decisions about the kind of society we wish to build, the kind of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12744"> 12744 </A></B>
<P>
society we wish to live in, and  to be able to determine, on the 
basis of our needs, our interests and our values, what we want to 
share with our neighbours and with which of our neighbours we 
want to do business. That is what Quebec sovereignty would 
mean.
<P>
	Let me give you a few examples. During Canada's 1988 
election campaign on free trade, one of the strongest proponents 
of the free trade agreement with the U.S. was Bernard Landry, 
who is now Quebec's Deputy Premier.
<P>
	I would say that he spoke up in just about every forum. He was 
then a staunch ally of the Conservative Party, arguing that it was 
necessary, not only preferable but essential, for the economy of 
Quebec and Canada as a whole to expand our markets and sell 
more products to the Americans, the U.S. being our closest 
neighbour.
<P>
	This was acknowledged by then Prime Minister Mulroney, 
who, on several occasions, used the example given by Bernard 
Landry to say what a decisive role it played in that election 
campaign. Well, Mr. Landry is a convinced and convincing 
sovereignist, an active politician who, for more than 30 
years-without adding years to his real age-, has been 
defending this theory with brilliance and eloquence.
<P>
	A few days ago, at a fundraiser for the Parti Quebecois in 
Montreal, the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Parizeau, told business 
people, and I quote: ``We may be a small country in terms of 
population, but we are successful, fulfilled and wealthier''. Mr. 
Parizeau did not give any examples, but he could have 
mentioned Norway, Sweden, Finland and Switzerland, small 
countries whose populations are roughly the same as Quebec's. 
Mr. Parizeau went on to say, ``We may have a small population 
and still be a prosperous, wealthy society, on one basic 
condition: that we have access to large markets without ever 
giving up our identity''.
<P>
	That is what was said by the Premier of Quebec, Mr. Parizeau, 
whom our Liberal friends call a separatist. In fact, Mr. Parizeau 
said this: ``What I personally want for my people, my nation, is 
for us to decide to take our collective future into our own hands 
and decide what we want to share with others''. Like all 
sovereignists, he acknowledged the need to have as open a 
market as possible.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	In that sense, Quebec sets a fine example with this Bill C-86 
before us, since it was based on the Quebec model that the 
agreement was entered into by all the provinces, and I repeat the 
provinces, because all the federal government has to do is pass 
legislation in the House of Commons recognizing this de facto 
situation. It is a good thing that the federal government is not 
involved; it would only make matters worse.
<P>
	So, based on the Quebec model, it is possible to enter into 
agreements with our Canadian, American and international 
partners, as it is recognized that this kind of  decision must arise 
from mutual interests and have something in it for everyone 
involved.
<P>
	I want to stress that Bill C-86 is an excellent example. Six 
provinces have already approved the agreement, while three 
others still have reservations. We are letting them think it over. 
That is what co-operation is about. That is what I call openness. 
Why impose one's views on everyone else? Give people a 
chance to change their mind. We have to be open to the world. 
That is what Quebec sovereignty means.
<P>
	In the minutes remaining, I would like to address government 
intervention and its negative impact on the economy in general, 
and the agricultural industry in particular, seeing that the debate 
is on agriculture.
<P>
	I shall refer to an article published in <I>La terre de chez nous</I>, 
which, I should point out to our colleagues opposite, is not the 
Bloc's official newspaper. It really belongs to the agricultural 
community and provides farmers with information on what is 
happening in their region and elsewhere in the industry.
<P>
	In the latest edition of <I>La terre de chez nous</I>, for the week of 
May 11 to 17, 1995, editor in chief Claude Lafleur quoted an 
example of inconsistent and harmful interference on the part of 
the federal government based on the implementation of the 
finance minister's budget that we have been debating in this 
House these the past few months. What example is that? I urge 
my Liberal colleagues to pay close attention to what Mr. Lafleur 
said, as it contradicts what their little red book says.
<P>
	What did Mr. Lafleur say? The president of <I>La terre de chez 
nous</I> told the agricultural industry that it should expect the worst 
from the finance minister's budget, adding that it was a real 
Pandora's box, that new harmful effects were discovered every 
day, and that it would probably never end, unless, of course, 
Quebec decided to assume full authority.
<P>
	Mr. Lafleur also had this to say: ``Indeed, this is not the last of 
the bad news coming from the Martin budget. For example, the 
federal government just announced that it was withdrawing 
from the agricultural employment services program''. That 
comment was made in reference to the red book. The Liberals 
were elected under false pretenses in 1993, when they 
campaigned with their red book and insisted on the importance 
of creating jobs.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	But what are they doing now that they are in office? They axe 
agricultural employment services, a successful program which 
has been in place for over 20 years. During the last year, the 
minister-whom I once called the minister of human resources 
impoverishment, but whose title really is Minister of Human 
Resources Development-asked the UPA to reach an agreement 
with his department to ensure the maintenance of these agricul-
<P>

<B><A NAME="12745"> 12745 </A></B>
<P>
tural employment services, which provide farmers with a 
qualified manpower when they need it.
<P>
	Only a few months ago, the minister said: ``We have an 
agreement with the UPA in Quebec to keep these services 
going''. Then in the Martin budget, the government decides to 
axe this program. It will be cut by 20 per cent in 1995-96, 40 per 
cent in 1996-97 and dropped altogether in 1997-98. This 
example does not come from the Bloc Quebecois or the 
separatist Minister of Agriculture in Quebec but from the editor 
in chief of <I>La Terre de chez nous</I>, Claude Lafleur, whose 
integrity is well known and whose objective approach to the 
issues can certainly not be faulted by our Liberal friends.
<P>
	That is a very real example of the Liberal government's 
negative impact on agriculture. I will conclude, Mr. Speaker, 
since you are signalling I have only two minutes left. I would 
like to ask for more time, but I know it is no use trying since I 
would not get unanimous consent. So I will simply ask them to 
come back next time, and maybe some day they will understand.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to comment on what was said by 
the hon. member for Medicine Hat who expressed so well and so 
consistently the Reform Party's position on trade between 
regions and between countries. Reform Party members want to 
see a return to a genuinely free market without government 
constraints. The hon. member for Medicine Hat said that, if we 
want a more open market, which is what sovereignists want as 
well, as I said earlier, we cannot have a supply management 
system.
<P>
	I simply want to say the hon. member is mistaken. Supply 
management is a way to deal with domestic problems. Its role is 
not to regulate international trade or trade between regions. So 
we can have a supply management system, and still open our 
borders to international trade.

	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take immediate 
steps to initiate a royal commission of inquiry into the Air-India disaster of 
June 23, 1985 which claimed the lives of 329 people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, June 23, 1995 will be the 10th 
anniversary of what is and was the worst mass murder ever in 
Canadian history. Three hundred and twenty-nine people lost 
their lives on board Air-India flight 182 while over the coast of 
Ireland.
<P>
	The flight originated in Vancouver. Of the deceased, 280 were 
Canadians, 80 of whom were children. In the 10 years since the 
tragedy, a royal commission of inquiry has not been held. There 
has been no parliamentary inquiry whatsoever into this terrorist 
act.
<P>
	I remind hon. members there was an inquiry in Ireland. There 
was another inquiry in India. Notwithstanding that over 280 
people on board were Canadians, the Mulroney administration 
refused to initiate a royal commission of inquiry.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12747"> 12747 </A></B>
<P>
	It is essential an inquiry take place in order for the people of 
Canada, the people of the world, to understand exactly what 
transpired both before and after the tragedy on June 23, 1985.
<P>
	There is evidence to suggest the Government of Canada in the 
months before June 1985 was warned there could be or would be 
a serious act of terrorism by Sikh extremists in Canada.
<P>
	June 1985 marked the first anniversary of the storming of the 
Sikh holy temple at Amritsar. The Indian government stormed 
the most holy place in June of that year and a number of people 
were killed. As a result Sikh extremists worldwide were 
suspected of planning retaliatory measures to seek revenge.
<P>
	The government of India, aware that the first anniversary was 
coming up, gave a specific warning to the Government of 
Canada and in particular to the foreign affairs department, at 
that time headed by Joe Clark, that there could be an act of 
terrorism.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the advanced warnings, there was absolutely 
no enhanced security for this flight. The X-ray machinery that 
would examine the luggage boarded on to the ill-fated flight 
broke down and instead of the bells and whistles going off the 
luggage was simply loaded on to the plane and scanned with a 
hand scanner.
<P>
	In view of the warnings given to the Government of Canada, 
the luggage should have been more thoroughly searched by hand 
or they should have waited until proper machinery was in place.
<P>
<B>(1805 ) </B>
<P>
	During the weeks preceding the disaster the Prime Minister of 
India was scheduled to visit the United States. The American 
authorities were able to uncover a plot to assassinate Rajiv 
Ghandi at the time. It was determined there was a link between 
those alleged to have conspired to assassinate the Indian Prime 
Minister and a Sikh extremist group in British Columbia.
<P>
	The security intelligence service, our secret service, was 
monitoring the activity of Sikh extremists in Canada, 
particularly in British Columbia. Not only was it trailing a prime 
suspect in the Air-India and the Narita bombing acts of 
terrorism, it also tapped their telephone lines.
<P>
	In the weeks preceding the Air-India disaster CSIS agents 
actually saw the two prime suspects detonate a bomb in the 
woods outside of Duncan, British Columbia. Notwithstanding 
this information and in spite of the fact that they were actually 
listening in on telephone conversations, they discontinued the 
surveillance on these two individuals. Why did they do that? 
They assumed these people were constructing bombs to be used 
in acts of terrorism outside of Canada. Why did they not take 
action on the wiretap evidence they had? The evidence obtained 
was in the Punjabi language. There was no Punjabi speaking 
CSIS agent to translate this information. The information 
received as a result of these  interceptions could very well have 
led the police to foil this act of terrorism.
<P>
	In my view the Government of Canada of the day was grossly 
negligent. Is it any wonder the government was subsequently 
party to a settlement with the families of the victims? It 
contributed an estimated $20 million to a compensation fund for 
the families of the murder victims, and that was also a big secret. 
If there was no negligence on the part of the Government of 
Canada, why did it contribute to the compensation fund?
<P>
	There are many very disturbing unanswered questions in this 
tragedy. To put this tragic act of terrorism into perspective, this 
was and continues to be today the most hideous act of aviation 
terrorism ever. The Pan Am Lockerbie terrorist act took a 
significant number of lives but nowhere near the number in the 
Air-India disaster. It was the worst mass murder in Canadian 
history.
<P>
	That is the backdrop and when we look at the involvement of 
the various government agencies we have to ask whether the 
response of the Government of Canada was adequate in the 
circumstances.
<P>
	Following the act of terrorism in June 1985, the security 
intelligence service erased two-thirds of the tapes it had 
gathered in the months leading up to the tragedy and in the 
several years that followed. It says it was done inadvertently, 
that there were no regulations in place to maintain that evidence, 
that there was nothing on those tapes to assist in the criminal 
investigation. A transcript was never taken of those tapes.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	If one is dealing with the worst mass murder in Canadian 
history, why would one not preserve every last piece of evidence 
the authorities were able to uncover or to gather in the 
investigation?
<P>
	There is no doubt in my mind there was a cover-up. The 
Mulroney administration refused to initiate an inquiry because 
it was trying to cover up the actions of agencies of the 
Government of Canada for which it was responsible. The Prime 
Minister, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of 
Transport and the solicitor general of the day were all ultimately 
responsible for the gross negligence on the part of individuals 
within that administration.
<P>
	The erasing of the tapes is further evidence they were trying to 
destroy evidence that could prove the security intelligence 
service and the RCMP were grossly negligent. Not only did they 
erase tapes, but false affidavits were sworn. Members of CSIS 
broke the law by swearing false affidavits in order to convince a 
judge to issue warrants to wire tap the telephone conversations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12748"> 12748 </A></B>
<P>
of numerous individuals subsequent to the disaster. The security 
intelligence service started to panic. The RCMP started to panic 
realizing what it had done or what it had failed to do. Then it 
deliberately misled the court into issuing warrants.
<P>
	Those people have not been held accountable. There has never 
been an inquiry to look into the actions of the agencies of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	Throughout the last 10 years the government and the previous 
administration have continually maintained criminal 
investigation is ongoing. That is the excuse the RCMP has put 
forward over the years. It is a lame excuse. According to press 
reports today the criminal investigation is virtually 
non-existent.
<P>
	There are two people working part time on the worst mass 
murder in Canadian history. If the Royal Canadian Mounted 
Police does not have the evidence in order to secure a conviction 
after 10 years, surely at some point it has to say the investigation 
is concluded and it cannot move any further.
<P>
	As I indicated, I believe there are reasons. The RCMP or 
certain individuals within the RCMP and the security 
intelligence service do not want a royal commission of inquiry.
<P>
	There is also an international element to this tragedy, not only 
because it was an Air-India plane blown up, not only because of 
the involvement of Sikh extremists, but also because there is 
evidence suspects involved in the bombing of Air-India were 
trained in the United States in Alabama. The operator of the 
soldier of fortune training school in Alabama, Frank Camper, 
has indicated Sikh extremists were trained at his mercenary 
training school.
<P>
	One would think that if the RCMP was doing its work it would 
personally interview Mr. Camper and others who might have 
evidence in the United States. The FBI refused to allow the 
RCMP to investigate or question Mr. Camper or others in the 
United States. Why would the Government of the United States 
and the FBI refuse to co-operate with Canadian authorities with 
respect to this matter?
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The theory put forward, with evidence, by a number of people 
in Canada and abroad is that the American government, the 
Pakistani government and the Indian government knew that Sikh 
extremists were being trained; that the Pakistani government 
facilitates the training of Sikh extremists abroad; that the 
American government needed the co-operation of President Zia 
of the Pakistani government at the time to ensure that Pakistan 
could continue to be used as a conduit, as a route, for arms for 
the Afghan rebels fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan.
<P>
	There is evidence to suggest that there was pressure by 
foreign governments, in particular the American government, 
the Indian government and the Pakistani government, on the 
Canadian government not to hold a royal commission of inquiry 
because of the international implications of what happened.
<P>
	Notwithstanding the alleged involvement of other 
governments or the connection with other governments and 
other foreign nationals, this government has an obligation to the 
families of the victims to ensure that those responsible are 
brought to justice. If there is insufficient evidence to bring those 
people to justice then the answers to all the disturbing questions 
must be answered. The only way to do that is through a royal 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
	I believe that the government has a strong suspicion and in 
fact knows who was responsible for the Air-India disaster that 
killed 329 people. It lacks the evidence to secure a conviction. 
There is not the will to initiate a royal commission of inquiry. 
The reason I say the government is aware of who is responsible 
is because there has been a conviction in the case of the Narita 
bombing.
<P>
	If you recall, Mr. Speaker, 52 minutes before the Air-India 
flight was blown out of the skies over Ireland, a bomb went off at 
the Narita airport in Tokyo. The CP flight originated in Canada. 
It landed in Tokyo. The baggage handlers were removing the 
luggage from the CP flight to an Air-India flight that was about 
to leave for Bombay when a bomb exploded and two baggage 
handlers were killed.
<P>
	As a result of the meticulous investigation on the part of 
Japanese authorities, an individual by the name of Inderjit Singh 
Reyat was convicted and is now incarcerated in Canada for that 
crime. Mr. Reyat and Talwinder Singh Parmar were arrested in 
the Air-India disaster but were released after a preliminary 
inquiry in British Columbia.
<P>
	There was a connection. There is no doubt that those 
responsible for the Narita bombing were also responsible for the 
Air-India act of terrorism, the Air-India mass murder. Yet we 
are unable to secure a conviction.
<P>
	I have asked previous solicitors general about this. The 
Government of Canada has never offered a reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of those 
responsible for the Air-India disaster. That act of terrorism was 
not the act of a single person. It was a conspiracy and several 
people were involved.
<P>
	Why has the government refused over the years to offer a 
reward, whether it is $1 million or $2 million or $5 million? If 
the Government of Canada is able to pay the family of Clifford 
Olson $100,000 to locate the bodies of his victims, surely it can 
offer a substantial reward to close the final chapter on this ugly 
episode in Canadian history. However, for some reason a reward 
has not been offered.

<P>
	In conclusion, there is no doubt in my mind that the Mulroney 
administration was party to a cover-up. As well, there is no 
doubt in my mind that the present administration will do the 
right thing and call a royal commission of inquiry before the 
10th anniversary on June 23. The reason I say that is because the 
Prime Minister, two years ago, while leader of the opposition, 
wrote in a letter:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We will continue to press the government to create a royal commission to 
look into the Air-India disaster.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have every reason to believe that the Prime Minister will 
honour his word and a royal commission of inquiry will be 
appointed. However, I would still like to see the House take a 
stand on the issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before I recognize the hon. member 
for Bellechasse, I would like to indicate that this is a very 
important issue to a number of members here tonight. I wonder 
whether members would agree to share their time.
<P>
	Would that be agreeable?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
my colleague from Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, I 
listened to the hon. member for York South-Weston present his 
motion M-293 regarding the Air India tragedy of June 23, 1985, 
with great interest.
<P>
	To demonstrate just how lightly the government of the time 
took this tragedy, in which 329 travellers, 280 of which were 
Canadians, most of them of Indian origin, I would mention that 
the Mulroney government's first gesture was to send its 
condolences to the Republic of India. That is indicative of how 
the case was handled. It also helps to understand how the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service carried out its 
investigation or, more exactly, did not carry out the 
investigation.
<P>
	It is clear, and the hon. member for York South-Weston 
mentioned this during his representation, that the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service's approach to the investigation is 
questionable. The attitude of the RCMP, which apparently put a 
lid on its own investigation and only assigned staff to the effort 
part-time, is as questionable as that of CSIS.
<P>
	Given the scope of this tragedy, 329 deaths as was mentioned 
earlier-the biggest mass slaughter in the air ever to have been 
executed at that time-it is obvious that we should go back and 
take a better look at this case.
<P>
	Is the royal commission of inquiry requested by the hon. 
member for York South-Weston the ideal solution? Maybe not. 
Obviously, ten years after the fact, we will not be able to 
interview the victims of the tragedy. Obviously, parallel 
investigations were carried out by organizations in other 
countries. It may be wise to pool all of the knowledge collected. 
Nevertheless, the  very serious allegations made about CSIS, 
while not meriting a royal commission of inquiry, certainly 
should be looked into by the sub-committee on national 
security.
<P>
	It would appear that this sub-committee, which is comprised 
of parliamentarians and would cost taxpayers nothing, contrary 
to a royal commission of inquiry, is the appropriate body to 
study the way the Canadian Security Intelligence Service 
handled this and other cases, where its work has left to be 
desired. I think it is high time we cleaned up the Canadian 
Security Intelligence Service.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	That is why, given all of the investigations that have already 
been done, since it is highly improbable that the exact causes of 
the tragedy will ever be found and since almost all avenues of 
inquiry have already been exhausted, I am of the opinion that 
creating a royal commission of inquiry would be a waste of 
money. However, I am in favour of a parliamentary review of the 
way in which the Canadian Security Intelligence Service carried 
out its investigation into the matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend the member for 
York South-Weston for bringing this motion to the floor of the 
House.
<P>
	The timing is most appropriate. In just over one month's time 
it will be the 10th anniversary of the bombing of Air-India flight 
182. It is with full confidence that I use the word bombing and 
not accident or incident or any other marginal term. What 
happened to Air-India flight 182 was an act of terrorism, an act 
of cold blooded murder and an act of cowardice.
<P>
	Unfortunately no one has been brought to trial in this case yet. 
If my hon. colleague is accurate and others are involved, it is 
only a matter of proof that they have not been brought to court, I 
would like to stress, yet.
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston seems to be of the 
opinion that charges will never be laid in this case so let us move 
on to a royal commission. If this was the case, I would have no 
problem in providing my unconditional support to the call for a 
royal commission.
<P>
	However, I believe that the member for York South-Weston 
may be a little premature in his assumption that charges will 
never be laid. On April 4, when Commissioner Murray of the 
RCMP appeared before the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Legal Affairs, I asked him if he was opposed to a judicial inquiry 
into the Air-India bombing. His response was:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We are not at all opposed to having a judicial inquiry. Our only concern was to 
undertake the judicial inquiry while the investigation was still active-The </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12750"> 12750 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>investigation is still active-I have made a commitment to the Solicitor General 
that when we reach a point where we feel that we are at an impasse, I will at that 
time come forward and indicate so. But we have not reached that point. The 
investigation is still optimistically being pursued.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I accept the word of the commissioner. I hope that this 
commissioner will make an intense effort in the near future to 
advance the investigation or to accept that the investigation is 
over and the time has come to move on. But until that time the 
question is, will a royal commission affect any subsequent 
criminal proceedings?
<P>
	Again the member for York South-Weston is impeccable in 
his timing. Less than two weeks ago the Supreme Court of 
Canada handed down its decision on the holding of a public 
inquiry into the Westray coal mine disaster at the same time that 
criminal proceedings are under way.
<P>
	The decision in that case was that the court should be most 
hesitant to interfere with interests of holding a public inquiry. 
However, the court limited its decision specifically to the 
Westray case and would not speculate on other cases.
<P>
	For example, the supreme court pointed out that the Westray 
criminal case was being tried in front of a judge alone. As well, 
the court believed that the commissioner of any public inquiry 
would not compel the accused to testify at the inquiry until the 
criminal case was concluded. Thus some significant 
considerations have to be resolved before a royal commission 
into the Air-India bombing is conducted.
<P>
	Do we want to sacrifice any subsequent criminal charges for 
the sake of holding a royal commission today? I think not. This 
is where a royal commission would create a great many 
problems.
<P>
	In the Westray decision the supreme court recognized the 
protection of the charter to any potentially accused. They could 
be compelled to testify in front of the royal commission but their 
testimony could not be used at the trial. That is a given.
<P>
	What would cause even greater problems in pursuing criminal 
charges against those responsible for bombing Air-India is the 
difficulty created by the derivative evidence.
<P>
<B>(1830 ) </B>
<P>
	This means that if any new information comes out at the royal 
commission, at a subsequent criminal proceeding the defence 
could claim that the crown was only able to proceed with 
charges with the evidence that was a result of compulsory 
incriminating testimony and therefore the evidence would not 
be admissible.
<P>
	In addition, in the Westray case the court ruled that the 
testimony of the accused must not be published and the report of 
the inquiry must remain confidential to ensure that any accused 
received a fair opportunity at trial.
<P>
	The whole point of a royal commission should be to bring the 
truth about Air-India to light, and this could not be done if the 
evidence could not be published. Our first priority must be to 
bring those responsible for the Air-India bombing to trial.
<P>
	I know that my colleague for York South-Weston is 
concerned about the way both the RCMP and CSIS have handled 
the investigation of this terrorist act. And there should be a 
cause for concern. I have no doubt that when the evidence of 
how these two agencies handled their investigation comes to 
light, it will be apparent that mistakes were made.
<P>
	Who will ultimately be held accountable for these mistakes? 
Most of the senior management who were in place at CSIS and 
the RCMP have retired. There is concern that the whole truth 
may never come out. But when it comes to choosing between 
pointing fingers at those responsible for some of the mistakes at 
CSIS and the RCMP or bringing the individuals who are 
responsible for the worst mass murder in Canadian history to 
justice, I am afraid there is no comparison. Bringing to trial 
those responsible for the bombing has to take priority.
<P>
	To get back to the motion before us today, if there is any way a 
royal commission could be held without jeopardizing the 
crown's ability to bring those murderers to trial, I would fully 
support such a call. Let us put the speculation to rest and give 
everyone involved in the case the opportunity to give their 
testimony. I am sure that many investigators at both CSIS and 
the RCMP would love to have the opportunity to provide their 
versions of the event.
<P>
	Let us give the families of the victims an opportunity to 
finally hear what happened to their loved ones. Let us give the 
Canadian public the truth about what happened with the 
bombing of Air India. We should be told what the Canadian 
government was doing in regard to this issue prior to the 
bombing. Could it have been prevented? We should be told 
about the subsequent investigation. Did a turf war between the 
RCMP and CSIS impede a proper investigation?
<P>
	The member for York South-Weston is absolutely correct: 
all this information must be made public and a royal 
commission or a judicial inquiry should occur. The only 
question is the timing.
<P>
	The first and foremost concern on this issue must be that those 
individuals involved in the cowardly bombing of Air-India must 
be brought to justice. If a royal commission will not interfere or 
jeopardize a criminal trial, then we should proceed immediately. 
However, if it is likely that this royal commission would provide 
these mass murderers with a technicality to escape conviction, I 
am afraid the commission should wait.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12751"> 12751 </A></B>
<P>
	While it is important that we ensure that the bombing of 
Air-India flight 182 is never forgotten, we owe it to the victims 
and their families that those responsible are brought to justice.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Sarnia-Lambton is going to share his 10-minute slot with one 
of his colleagues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the agreement was that I would share remainder time.
<P>
	I am pleased to rise today to discuss private member's Motion 
No. 293. Ten years after, we cannot adequately acknowledge the 
suffering of those left behind, but we can look to the changes in 
our air travel safety that have occurred as a result of this very 
tragic event.
<P>
	Immediately following the disaster, the interdepartmental 
committee on security and intelligence was instructed to study 
and report on airport and airline security in Canada. The 
recommendations stemming from this report have been 
implemented, resulting in significant improvements to aviation 
security in Canada.
<P>
	New air carrier and airport security regulations have been 
introduced, which establish high minimum standards. These 
regulations are under constant review and adjustment to respond 
to the changing situation.
<P>
	Monitoring and inspection of airport and air carrier security 
measures have been greatly increased. Also, more stringent 
security controls on passengers, carry-on baggage, checked 
baggage, cargo and mail have been introduced on international 
flights. Air carriers are prohibited from carrying the baggage of 
persons not on board the aircraft.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	The range of enforcement mechanisms has also been 
strengthened with the introduction in 1989 of the designated 
provisions regulations, which is an administrative monetary 
penalty scheme. These regulations were amended in 1993, 
increasing the number of punishable aviation security 
regulatory offences and the size of maximum penalties that can 
be levied.
<P>
	Additional X-ray detection equipment and explosive vapour 
detectors have been put into service. A training program for 
security screening personnel and their trainers has been 
developed and implemented by Transport Canada. Courses are 
regularly scheduled. Internal security training programs for 
Transport Canada security inspectors and other aviation security 
specialists are also in place.
<P>
	In addition, new measures have been implemented that 
require air carriers operating in Canada to carry out a program of 
initial and annual recurrent crew member aviation security 
training. All persons employed at major airports who have 
access to restricted areas must undergo a security assessment to 
ensure they do not pose a threat to the security of civil aviation.
<P>
	In 1994 new security standards were legislated for airport 
restricted area pass systems, which improved the ability of the 
government and airport operators to ensure that people in 
restricted areas of Canada's airports have a need and a right to be 
there.
<P>
	Transport Canada has been actively pursuing stronger 
security provisions and bilateral air transport agreements with 
other countries to ensure that implementation of Canada's high 
aviation security standards is a mandatory condition for foreign 
air carrier operations in our country.
<P>
	I would like to point out that in addition to these 
enhancements Canada has in place a three-level alert and 
response system to ensure appropriate security measures are 
taken in response to specific threats. I understand this system 
was fully updated in 1992 and is under constant review and fine 
tuning to ensure it responds effectively to changing 
circumstances.
<P>
	In conclusion, the Air-India disaster has been the subject of 
exhaustive examination by the Canadian Security Intelligence 
Service, the Security Intelligence Review Committee, Transport 
Canada, the Solicitor General of Canada, and the police 
investigation is ongoing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today in support of the 
motion by the hon. member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	The hon. member is correct: it is high time for a royal 
commission of inquiry into the Air-India disaster. For too long 
the Sikh community has lived under a great shadow of suspicion 
created by the media reports that someone from the Canadian 
Sikh community may have been responsible for the deaths of 
329 people.
<P>
	Responsibility for the crash has been attributed to a number of 
groups. Accusations have been made that U.S. intelligence 
agencies withheld vital information from RCMP investigators. 
There are real questions about how much the RCMP and the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service knew.
<P>
	The only clear fact is that on June 23, 1985, Air India flight 
182 exploded over the Atlantic Ocean near Cork, Ireland. All 
329 people aboard the plane lost their lives, including 280 
Canadians. Most were of East Indian origin; some were Sikh 
families.
<P>
	This was the worst mass murder in Canadian history. Yet 10 
years later no one has been prosecuted in Canada for bombing 
the plane. Ten years later, the families are still waiting for 
answers. Ten years later, the Canadian Sikh community is still 
waiting to find out who was really responsible. We still have far 
too many questions and not enough answers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12752"> 12752 </A></B>
<P>
	Regardless of who placed the bomb, regardless of their 
motives, it is imperative they be brought to justice. I ask the 
Canadian government to initiate a royal commission of inquiry 
into the disaster as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for North Vancouver 
has very kindly offered to give up his normal rotation in the 
party line. Therefore the hon. member for Brampton has the 
floor.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Colleen Beaumier (Brampton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for 
most Canadians Friday, June 23, 1995 will be a day like any 
other. Parents will get up, have breakfast with their children, 
take them off to school and go off to work just as they would any 
other day.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	However, for the families and friends of those Canadians who 
lost their lives aboard Air-India flight 182 exactly 10 years ago 
to the day, June 23 will be a day filled with remembrance and 
sorrow. It will be a day to reflect on the memories of loved ones 
lost in the blink of an eye, of entire families and children who 
never had a chance to grow up, children who never had the 
chance to experience the many joys and expressions of life.
<P>
	There is nothing we can do to bring them back, but we must 
honour their memory and we must do all we can to ease the 
suffering of their families and friends. That is why we must 
properly investigate this terrible tragedy. That is why it is 
imperative that we conduct a royal commission into the most 
horrific mass murder in this nation's history. This is a 
commitment members of the Liberal caucus made while in 
opposition, and it is a commitment we must honour now that we 
are in power.
<P>
	While in opposition, members of the Liberal caucus watched 
in horror as the then Prime Minister of Canada, upon learning of 
the tragedy, contacted the Prime Minister of India to offer his 
condolences on the issue. In doing so, the Prime Minister sent 
the message that this terrible tragedy was being mourned 
primarily by the citizens of India. This was the wrong message 
to send. These were Canadians.
<P>
	That inquiries have been undertaken by foreign governments 
on this matter in the absence of an inquiry by the Government of 
Canada is cause for embarrassment to all members of this 
House.
<P>
	Previous governments repeatedly turned down requests for a 
royal commission on the grounds that the matter was still under 
investigation and that it might prejudice the ongoing RCMP 
investigation. I believe that this rationale can no longer be 
invoked in good conscience.
<P>
	A story in this morning's <I>Globe and Mail</I> states that the 
10-year old RCMP investigation is winding down and that only 
two or three officers are working on this case on a part time 
basis. The cost of this investigation to date is in the order of $20 
million. Ten years and $20 million later, we have still not solved 
this horrible crime.
<P>
	There is another reason that came to mind as I was listening to 
my hon. colleague speak. We have heard about extremists from 
different groups of people being blamed, suspicions passed on to 
these groups. I have heard from many sources that this group of 
people did it. When I hear today the Sikh population being 
mentioned, it brings a great deal of pain to me. This only 
increases the misunderstanding of a community. To cast 
aspersions upon this group of people is an absolute sin. We must 
have a royal commission to remove this scar that has formed on 
this nation's history by failing to respond to the cries for 
answers from the families and friends of those who perished 
aboard Air-India flight 182.
<P>
	We can begin by voting in favour of this motion today. Given 
the importance of this issue for all Canadians, I move that this 
motion be declared votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent that this 
matter be declared a votable one?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The nay having been given, the 
member still has the floor. She might wish to continue. If not, we 
will now go to the hon. member for North Vancouver and then 
we will close with the honourable parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
just take a few minutes as well.
<P>
	In looking at this whole situation of the Air-India crash, I 
know that it has been dragging on now for 10 years, as other 
members have said. It is really getting to the point where we 
have to start asking questions about whether it has gone on long 
enough and how long do we allow the police investigation to 
keep going and winding down.
<P>
	My colleague from Reform has pointed out some of the 
technical difficulties that are involved in starting a royal 
commission when there is still an RCMP investigation under 
way. That is an important consideration. However, we are 10 
years downstream and many of the people who were involved in 
the RCMP are already retired. We have a situation where one of 
the major suspects is already dead, killed in a gun battle with 
Indian police in India.
<P>
<B>(1845 ) </B>
<P>
	According to a newspaper article in the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> on 
April 14, 1994 another suspect, Mr. Manjit Singh, also known as 
Lal Singh, is in prison in India. We have two there. A third 
person who may have been a suspect was arrested the same day 
for the bombing which killed baggage handlers at Narita airport.
<P>
	The evidence is fast disappearing. In the meantime we have 
spent about $20 million, yet we still have all the families of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12753"> 12753 </A></B>
<P>
victims who lost their loved ones in this crash wondering what 
really happened and whether there was a cover-up.
<P>
	My colleague who proposed the motion asked what happened. 
Was there a cover-up? What is the truth behind the crash of the 
Air-India flight? On balance, weighing the questions, weighing 
the technicalities, weighing the length of time it has taken and 
weighing the amount of money spent so far, I would have to 
support the member in his motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should take immediate 
steps to initiate a royal commission of inquiry into the Air-India disaster of 
June 23, 1985 which claimed the lives of 329 people.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Parliamentary Secretary 
to Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
let me congratulate the hon. member for bringing forward this 
long delayed motion. June 23 will mark the 10th yearly 
observance of the largest mass murder in Canadian history and 
the most tragic incident in the history of aviation, the bombing 
of Air-India flight 182.
<P>
	On June 23, 1985, without warning, 329 innocent passengers 
were blown out of the sky. They were all killed instantly. There 
were no survivors. On flight 182, 295 passengers were Canadian 
and 82 of the passengers were children.
<P>
	For the past 10 years the victims' families have suffered 
tremendous grief and endured great pain in virtual silence. They 
have waited patiently for the killers of their loved ones to be 
brought to justice and they have looked for answers. To date they 
have had none.
<P>
	Air-India's explosion was not an accident; it was a planned 
and deliberate cold blooded act of violence that took the lives of 
329 innocent passengers. It was an act of terrorism.
<P>
	One decade is an eternity. For the surviving family members 
the past 10 years have been filled with hollow birthdays, empty 
anniversaries and missed graduations.
<P>
	As a compassionate and caring society, as a country that has 
been built on the tenets of justice, fairness and equality, and as a 
country that believes in the due process of law, we cannot 
continue to ask these families to wait any longer. As Canadian 
citizens they deserve justice. For the sake of the victims and 
their families justice must be served.
<P>
	There are two tragedies for these families. First, there is the 
horrific loss of innocent life. In some cases whole families were 
lost. In some cases one family member remains while the rest of 
the family was on the plane. I remember watching a vivid scene 
where a father wept out loud when he had lost his wife and his 
two children. As someone who has three children, I can imagine 
the nightmare that he will have to go through for the rest of his 
life. We need to give that person and all the other people some 
answers. It was a horrific loss of life. Second, 10 years after the 
bombing and $20 million later the murderers are still at large.
<P>
	While in opposition we called for a royal commission. We 
promised the families of Air-India victims that justice would be 
served. We committed ourselves to finding the perpetrators of 
this brutal crime.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	Today, nearly 10 years since the bombing, no charges have 
been laid. During the first two years there were up to 75 officers 
on the investigation. Today only one officer is dedicated to 
investigating this savage crime on a part time basis.
<P>
	I want to re-emphasize that we do not know. People have not 
been brought to justice. I know some members have said perhaps 
it was one group or person. In Canada we are innocent until 
proven guilty. We need to bring the guilty to justice because we 
do not know. There are books written on the subject because 
there are so many questions and people do not know. That is one 
of the reasons we need a royal commission.
<P>
	After reading the Security Intelligence Review Committee's 
report I have many concerns about the existing investigation 
into the Air-India disaster. CSIS has admitted that prior to the 
bombing of Air-India it did not regard the threat of violence 
stemming from extremist groups to be very serious. Few 
resources were allotted to the investigation.
<P>
	Translators were not found. There is lots of evidence that 
CSIS simply bungled up and we need to know why. We need to 
know what the reasons were. At the time of the bombing CSIS 
was in its infancy. Its role and areas of jurisdiction were still 
being defined.
<P>
	While there was a healthy spirit of co-operation between the 
two investigating parties differences emerged between the 
RCMP and CSIS after the bombing of flight 182 in terms of their 
responsibilities, jurisdiction and methods of evidence collection 
and retention.
<P>
	I quote from the SIRC report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One former senior officer told us that while the role was well understood by 
senior personnel, he was concerned that some CSIS investigators would 
conduct their inquiries as though they were criminal investigators and would 
compete with the RCMP to solve this case-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Once again I quote from the report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We saw no early instructions from CSIS headquarters that attempted to 
clarify the CSIS mandate vis-à-vis the RCMP criminal investigation or which 
set out CSIS policy regarding the sharing of information and intelligence with 
the RCMP. We consider this to be an unfortunate oversight on the part of 
senior management.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We need to know what took place between CSIS and the 
RCMP. We need to have better information, and the royal 
inquiry will give us that information. We need to know why 159 
of the 210 audio tapes with recordings of wiretapped conversa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="12754"> 12754 </A></B>
<P>
tions were erased. Many of these tapes were never heard. 
Translations were delayed or were not completed and significant 
backlogs of unprocessed tapes were commonplace. These issues 
were raised by SIRC in its report.
<P>
	In accordance with established policies CSIS had already 
erased three-quarters of the 200 or so audio tapes of the 
principal targets, conversations before the disaster, so these 
were not available to the RCMP for its requested examination.
<P>
	Given the number of inaccuracies, errors and oversights, 
given the absence of clear direction and a clear delineation of 
roles and the chain of command, it is difficult to see how CSIS 
could have done justice to the investigation.
<P>
	The government has stated that the results of the investigation 
into the bombing of flight 182 are inconclusive. If they are 
inconclusive we need to know why. This is a Canadian tragedy. I 
do not think in any other situation government would not react. 
Any other government would have reacted. We have seen that in 
other governments. Why have we not reacted? We need to 
respond and have a royal commission to look into the matter.
<P>
	Given this conclusion I believe it is in the best interest of 
justice to launch a royal commission of inquiry. There is 
precedence for such an inquiry. I refer my colleagues to past 
catastrophes, namely the <I>Ocean Ranger</I> tragedy and the Hinton 
rail disaster.
<P>
	The issue is justice, justice for the 329 innocent victims of 
this aviation disaster, justice that has not yet been served. On 
April 13, 1994 former RCMP Commissioner Norm Inkster 
stated to the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs: 
``It was my hope that before I retired from the RCMP I could 
appear before this committee and say the Air-India case was 
solved. Tragically, this is not yet the case''.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	We cannot bring back the innocent Canadians who lost their 
lives. We cannot make their families whole again. We cannot 
bring back their smiles or laughter but we can bring those left 
behind some peace of mind. We can bring the criminals who 
have inflicted this ceaseless pain to justice.
<P>
	I believe we are on the right track. It is clear from the level of 
active co-operation between the RCMP and CSIS that a real 
desire to solve this crime does exist. It is also evident from the 
continuing investigation that this tragedy has not been forgotten 
and that the Liberal government intends to keep its word. Our 
new solicitor general has stated the appointment of a royal 
commission is under active consideration.
<P>
	In light of the SIRC report, the continued anguish of the 
victims' families and the ever growing price tag on this 
inconclusive investigation, I strongly recommend we launch a 
royal commission of inquiry.
<P>
	Once again, given the importance of this issue for all 
Canadians, I move the motion be declared votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. parliamentary secretary 
would be aware that he needs unanimous consent to make the 
matter votable.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, it was the parliamentary 
secretary to the solicitor general who denied that the matter be 
allowed to proceed. I wish he would have the courage to stand up 
and defend his position.
<P>
	Notwithstanding, I ask the Chair to seek unanimous consent 
that the subject matter of this motion be referred to a 
parliamentary committee. I ask the parliamentary secretary to 
consider that.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The House has heard the terms of the 
mover of the motion. Is there unanimous consent that the subject 
matter of the motion be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to support the motion before the House presented by my 
hon. colleague. It is on behalf of the 329 people who were killed, 
on behalf of the 280 Canadians, and on behalf of their families 
tragically and instantaneously hit that I would like to see justice 
done.
<P>
	We need a royal commission because if a train full of 
Canadians on Canadian territory were blown up we would find 
immediate justice. These Canadians cannot be brought back. We 
must find justice for them because they are silent.
<P>
	The Liberal Party is known for being a compassionate party. 
Its members believe in justice and feel they have to ask for 
justice on behalf of the many communities of Canada, especially 
for the Sikh communities.
<P>
	Vancouver East has a lot of immigrants; 45 per cent is made 
up of new immigrants. Some belong to the Sikh community. 
When I was elected I made a promise to fight on their behalf. 
Some of these communities do not have much of a voice and it is 
entirely up to us, to the government, to the members of the 
House to speak on their behalf. We were put here to do that.
<P>
	In this tragic instance when no justice seems to have been 
served, when we value ourselves as those who speak about 
justice and human rights, we have to intercede on behalf of those 
who cannot speak.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="12755"> 12755 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to see a royal commission struck to look into this 
accident. It took too long. We cannot let this go again. I would 
also like to move that this motion be votable.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Once again a motion has been made 
that the matter be a votable one. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I will give the hon. member for York 
South-Weston one minute if he wants to close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunziata:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the closing of the debate, I 
want to remind the House that several members have stood up, 
all of them Liberal members of Parliament, asking that this 
motion be votable.
<P>
	I would like you, Mr. Speaker, to consider a point of privilege. 
This is private members' business. On several occasions there 
was one member, the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor 
general, who withheld his consent to having this matter voted 
upon. He has not spoken today and I do not know why he has not. 
Perhaps he does not have any worthwhile submissions to make 
today.
<P>
	However, I would suggest that as the parliamentary secretary 
to the solicitor general, he does not have the right to interfere in 
private members' business. If his withholding of unanimous 
consent is as an individual member, then that is one thing, but if 
he is interfering on the part of the Government of Canada, I 
would submit that is improper. The Prime Minister and the 
government has committed itself to the integrity of the private 
members' business. If private members' business is in fact to 
remain private, allowing free votes on behalf of private 
members, then the parliamentary secretary to the solicitor 
general should keep his nose out of private members' business.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired. Is there 
unanimous consent to let the parliamentary secretary reply as a 
point of order?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It was a point of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It does not matter whether it is 
privilege or a point of order, the time has expired and there is not 
unanimous consent to go over the time. Therefore, the time 
provided for the consideration of Private Members' Business 
has now expired. Pursuant Standing Order 96, the order is 
dropped from the Order Paper.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INFRASTRUCTURE">INFRASTRUCTURE</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
the opportunity to pursue a question I asked the Minister of 
Transport in this House last week about the port of Belledune in 
New Brunswick.
<P>
	I asked the minister to explain to this House how he justified 
giving a $5.8 million grant to the port of Belledune after saying 
that he was ``not prepared to put a cent into Belledune as far as a 
grant or anything like that is concerned, any more than I would 
put into the port of Saint John or anywhere else''.
<P>
	The minister gave an answer but it was not to my question. I 
was pleased to hear him say that he would consider forgiving the 
loan to the port of Saint John, but not surprisingly he 
flip-flopped on that promise once the cameras were off.
<P>
	It is not just troubling that the minister continually goes back 
on his word but that he gave the port of Belledune almost $6 
million when we have yet to see a plan on how the port intends to 
pay back its $20 million loan it has received.
<P>
	Furthermore, the minister has failed to explain why the 
government is spending over $25 million on new berthage and 
cargo sheds in a town bordering the minister's home riding when 
there is excess capacity at the port of Saint John and the port of 
Dalhousie which is only 32 kilometres away. As the minister has 
stated, once the port of Belledune and the expansion takes place, 
the port of Dalhousie is out of business.
<P>
	The House will understand my questioning the minister's 
motivations for this grant to Belledune in light of some of the 
decisions made by this government.
<P>
	Just recently there have been hearings on the privatization of 
the pilotage authority of our harbour pilots. I ask again, is this 
because the port of Belledune does not need the harbour pilots 
and the port of Saint John does?
<P>
	For example, in February we learned of a decision by public 
works to borrow $12 million to build a new office complex in the 
riding of the Indian affairs minister, even though the office 
building vacancy rate is 18.2 per cent in Sault Ste. Marie and 
despite the fact that a less expensive option of buying and 
retrofitting existing office space could save $5 to $6.5 million 
for the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	Now the minister of public works and the Nova Scotia 
transportation minister have inexplicably diverted $26 million 
of the federal strategic highway improvement program, known 
<P>

<B><A NAME="12756"> 12756 </A></B>
<P>
as SHIP, funds designated for Nova  Scotia highway 104, death 
valley, toward the fleur-de-lis tourist trail in their ridings.
<P>
	The SHIP agreement states that projects undertaken are to be 
part of the national highway system. The fleur-de-lis does not 
meet this criterion and everyone knows it. Death valley is an 
example, just as Belledune is an example, of blatant, 
unapologetic, pork barrelling with no thought to fiscal 
responsibility.
<P>
	The Saint John Port Corporation told the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Transport on March 16, 1995 that 
``there is an overcapacity in Canadian ports with too much 
underutilization of infrastructure and the federal government as 
the shareholder of the port is competing against itself''.
<P>
	Once again I ask the Minister of Transport to explain why he 
is pouring millions of dollars into expanding the port of 
Belledune when existing ports in New Brunswick are 
underutilized.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is unfortunate but as usual this 
member has it all wrong and misrepresents the facts.
<P>
	The proposed marine terminal at Belledune represents an 
unprecedented partnership between federal, provincial and 
various municipal governments. All three levels of government 
working in concert will be putting funds into this project.
<P>
	If the member were concerned about the future of marine 
transportation in Atlantic Canada, she would be supporting this 
unique collaboration. It is interesting to note the following 
comments from Paul Doiron, general manager of Logistec 
Stevedoring that operates the Rodney terminal. He said he did 
not expect that development of the terminal of Belledune on the 
north shore would offer threatening competition to Logistec.
<P>
	He then said that Forterm operates the largest forest products 
terminal on the eastern seaboard and is in the top eight or nine 
forest products terminals in the world. That will not change. 
``We will be able to compete just as we have for over 16 years,'' 
he said.
<P>
	It is sad to note that the member wants to deny the people in 
this region the right to seek a loan from the federal government 
when she had no trouble supporting a request that the federal 
government write off a loan for the port of Saint John.
<P>
	I would be interested to discover whether the hon. member 
opposite during her reign as mayor ever gave the port of Saint 
John money toward its operations. Perhaps if she had, the port 
would not be in this fix today.
<P>
	It seems that I have to remind the former mayor that members 
should be reminded that Belledune and Saint John are in the 
same province and that the entire province will benefit from the 
increased economic activity.
<P>
	The mayors and people of the municipalities surrounding 
Belledune are putting their money up front to support their 
region and the entire marine industry. They should be 
applauded, not hindered, and this member should be supporting 
New Brunswick, not voting against it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed adopted.
<P>
	Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 7.08 p.m.)
