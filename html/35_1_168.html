in place of Mr. Stephen Harper, member for the electoral district

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETSECRECY-SPEAKER'SRULING">BUDGET SECRECY-SPEAKER'S RULING</A></H4>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, I would now like to rule on a 
question of privilege raised on Friday, March 3, 1995 by the hon. 
member for Sherbrooke, notice of which was given the previous 
day just after Question Period. I would like to thank the hon. 
member for raising this matter, as well as the chief government 
whip and the hon. members for Berthier-Montcalm, 
Kindersley-Lloydminster, and Kingston and the Islands for 
their contributions to the discussion. I would also like to thank 
the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington for her intervention 
on this matter on March 13, 1995.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In his question of privilege, the hon. member for Sherbrooke 
alleged that there had been a leak of the budget prior to its 
presentation by the Minister of Finance on February 27, 1995. 
To support his claim, the member drew the attention of the 
House to the March 2, 1995, edition of the <I>Hill Times</I>, and more 
specifically, to a comment made by the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington found therein. In response to the question 
``Is there too much secrecy surrounding the budget?'' the hon. 
member for Guelph-Wellington is quoted as having said: ``I 
don't think so. There were some MPs who were told beforehand 
if major cuts were coming to programs in their ridings. They 
asked for that in caucus so they could prepare to answer 
questions''.  The hon. member for Sherbrooke then argued that 
if certain members had ``privileged, secret information before 
budget day'' this would be to the detriment of other members 
and would hinder them in the performance of their duties. The 
hon. members for Berthier-Montcalm and 
Kindersley-Lloydminster echoed the member's sentiments 
and concerns about a certain group of members being privy to 
information not available to other members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The procedural issue before us is not a question of budget 
secrecy per se. Several members cited citation 31(5) of 
Beauchesne's Sixth Edition to support the contention that 
budget secrecy was and is a political convention and not a matter 
to be dealt with under the guise of parliamentary privilege. 
Indeed, several members emphasized that what was really at 
issue was the implication of prior knowledge of the contents of 
the budget by certain members, and I emphasize the word 
members, and not others. The questions we must therefore ask 
are, at first glance, does there appear to be a breach of the rights 
of certain members, and has something occurred which has 
impaired the ability of members to carry out their duties as 
members?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As I have said on numerous occasions, we have a tradition in 
the House which dictates that we accept the word of an hon. 
member as truth. Taking the quote of the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington as represented by the <I>Hill Times</I>, one 
might be inclined to agree that there was the appearance that 
certain members had been given confidential information not 
available to others. However, in light of the comments made by 
the hon. member for Guelph-Wellington on March 13, 1995, 
and the text of her memorandum from which the hon. whip read 
and later tabled, I accept that the hon. member for 
Guelph-Wellington was referring to the announcement made 
outside the House by the President of the Treasury Board on 
February 21 regarding measures for the downsizing of the 
federal public service and not to a prebudget disclosure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10574"> 10574 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Consequently, I cannot conclude that members of the House 
have in any way been hindered in carrying out their 
parliamentary duties. Hence, I do not find a prima facie case of 
breach of privilege.
<P>
	I thank all hon. members for their contributions.

	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Fundy-Royal, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the 
honour to present, in both official languages, the third and 
fourth reports of the Standing Committee on Industry, pursuant 
to the order of reference on Wednesday, June 15, 1994.
<P>
	Your committee has considered Bill C-43, an act to amend the 
Lobbyists Registration Act and to make related amendments to 
other acts. Your committee has agreed also to report it with 
amendments and to provide as well a substantive report which 
explains the amendments being reported and why other possible 
changes were not adopted.
<P>
	I would also like to point out that the third report, which 
provides explanations and supplementary recommendations, 
breaks new ground for committees reviewing bills. Your 
committee felt that such a report was necessary, given that Bill 
C-43 was referred before second reading, thus broadening 
considerably the scope of the review that was undertaken.
<P>
	The 13 amendments that have been set out in the fourth report 
would, in the view of your committee, significantly strengthen 
an already good bill.
<P>
	I would like to thank members of the committee for working 
together to meet the new responsibilities involved in 
considering a bill before second reading. The results I believe 
speak for themselves and deserve serious consideration by all 
sides of the House.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as the critic for the official opposition on the matter of 
lobbyists, I am pleased to rise very briefly today, following the 
tabling of the report of the majority, to inform Parliament that I 
have tabled, with the majority report, a dissenting opinion on 
this bill.
<P>
	With all we have heard regarding the management of the 
affairs of government, I feel the profession of influence peddlar, 
as it is called in the business, must be regulated. Legislation was 
needed to re-establish a relationship of trust between the 
government and the people.
<P>
	I thought that, with the campaign commitments the Liberals 
made in the last election, transparency would be the watchword 
within Parliament thanks to this bill. I also thought that the new 
parliamentary procedure, which was supposed to permit 
in-depth debates and improve the role of members of 
Parliament, would enable me to amend Bill C-43 in keeping 
with taxpayers' interests. I was fooled, like many others. The 
procedure failed to live up to promise as did the wording of Bill 
C-43, and this is why I submitted a dissenting opinion, which is 
appended to the report. I wanted to let people know of the two 
major failings of this bill.

Board. They request that Parliament continue to give the 
Canadian Wheat Board monopoly powers in marketing wheat 
and barley for export.
<P>
	The other petition goes beyond that and requests that the 
Canadian Wheat Board marketing monopoly powers include all 
grains and oilseeds.

<P>
	The petitioners state that the Saskatchewan government is on 
the verge of balancing its budget, allowing Saskatchewan 
taxpayers to see the light at the end of the high tax tunnel. 
Therefore, they ask and request Parliament to reduce 
government spending instead of increasing taxes.

Manitoba.
<P>
	The petitioners ask that Parliament support laws which will 
severely punish all violent criminals who use weapons in the 
commission of a crime. They support new Criminal Code 
firearms control provisions that recognize and protect the right 
of law-abiding citizens to own firearms. They support 
legislation which will repeal and modify existing gun control 
laws which have not improved public safety and have proven not 
to be cost effective and have proven to be overly complex as to 
be ineffective and/or unenforceable.

They pray that Parliament ensure that the present provisions of 
the Criminal Code of Canada prohibiting assisted suicide be 
enforced vigorously and that Parliament make no changes in the 
law which would sanction or allow the aiding or abetting of 
suicide, or active or passive euthanasia.

	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
petition from the constituents of Willowdale asks Parliament to 
amend the Divorce Act to include provisions similar to article 
611 of the Quebec civil code. It states that in no case may a 
father or mother without serious cause place obstacles between 
the child and grandparents. Failing agreement between the 
parties, the modalities of the relations are to be settled by the 
court. They request Parliament to further amend the Divorce Act 
to give a grandparent who is granted access to a child the right to 
make inquiries and to be given information as to the health, 
education and welfare of the child.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have the privilege to introduce three different petitions today.
<P>
	The first petition is regarding Bill C-41. People from my 
riding and around the province of B.C. have asked that 
Parliament not pass Bill C-41 and that section 718.2 as 
presently written not include the undefined phrase sexual 
orientation in that bill. I am happy to concur with that.

status to rise from $500 up to $1,000 for their equipment. I am 
happy to support that measure as well. It has been stuck at that 
same level for some years.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the last petition I have the privilege to present was signed by 
over 1,000 people from my constituency who are outraged over 
the murder of Melanie Carpenter, an event that occurred I am 
sad to say within my own constituency.
<P>
	This petition calls upon Parliament to permit the use of 
post-sentence detention orders and to pass Bill C-240 which 
would limit the freedoms of high risk offenders. If Parliament 
hears this petition, innocent people like Melanie Carpenter 
would still be alive and and dangerous ones like her murderer 
would remain behind bars.
<P>

here yesterday when the Speaker invited members not to say 
whether or not they agree or disagree with the petitions.

Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise today to present a petition that is 
part of a larger petition of almost 64,000 signatories. This 
petition contains approximately 18,000 signatures of citizens in 
and around Edmonton Southwest who are asking that the Young 
Offenders Act be changed and strengthened so that it would have 
the effect of deterring criminal behaviour by young people.
<P>
	There are many citizens across the country who feel that the 
Young Offenders Act does not do what it was intended to do. 
These 18,000 citizens of our country are requesting the 
Parliament of Canada to strengthen the Young Offenders Act.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege pursuant to Standing Order 36 to 
present a petition to the House of Commons. The petition 
contains 8,000 signatures collected by representatives of the 
Animal Defence League of Canada.
<P>
	The petitioners note that individuals convicted of wilfully 
causing pain and injury to an animal presently face maximum 
penalties of six months in jail to two years prohibition from 
owning an animal and/or a maximum find of $2,000.
<P>
	The petitioners note also that in practice they do not know of 
any maximum penalty ever having been issued no matter how 
atrocious the offence. The petitioners state that they find this 
abhorrent and unacceptable when animals are not appropriately 
dealt with by our laws.
<P>
	Therefore, the petitioners call upon the Government of 
Canada to enact harsher penalties for offences against animals 
and establish an education program for judges to help them 
understand society's abhorrence and condemnation of acts of 
cruelty to animals.

<P>
	The first petition pertains to Bill C-91, the drug patent 
legislation. The petitioners who have signed this petition are 
from my district of Regina-Lumsden in Saskatchewan as well 
as the cities and towns of Saskatoon, Borden, Hafford, Speers, 
Nipawin.
<P>
	These petitioners are unhappy with the 12 per cent annual 
increase in prescription drugs since this bill was passed. They 
are asking that Bill C-91, which has placed financial burdens on 
them and health care programs across this country, be repealed. 
They request the House of Commons to do same.

	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my second petition is signed by petitioners from the 
Saskatchewan communities of Kelliher, Silton, Watrous, 
Raymore, Punnichy, Ituna, Simpson, Foam Lake and other 
locations.
<P>
	Under section 745 of the Criminal Code of Canada, convicted 
murderers sentenced to life imprisonment without chance of 
parole for 25 years are able to apply for a review after 15 years. 
They are calling for the House of Commons to repeal section 
745 of the Criminal Code of Canada.

my third and final petition this morning deals with the Senate.
<P>
	The petitioners are from my constituency of 
Regina-Lumsden as well as from Pilot Butte, Saskatchewan. In 
view of the fact that the Senate costs approximately $60 million 
a year and in their view the purpose of the Senate is useless, they 
are asking the House of Commons to repeal sections 41 and 42 of 
the Constitution Act which would in effect abolish the Senate.

today to present a petition from my constituents containing 
2,700 names, which is also part of a larger petition prompted by 
the murder of Barb Denelesko.
<P>
	The petitioners state that Canadian citizens from coast to 
coast are calling for changes to the Young Offenders Act. They 
want an act serious enough to deter young people from 
committing crimes and tough enough to provide real justice. In 
its current format the Young Offenders Act is not meeting these 
objectives. The petitioners request that the Government of

	In my opinion, the motion is urgent, given the government's 
recent actions. The motion is as follows: ``That this House 
denounce the government for its insensitivity and its inaction 
regarding the adoption of concrete measures to promote the 
economic equality of women in federal areas of jurisdiction''.
<P>
	I would have preferred not to have to table such a motion before 
this House, but its goal is to make my colleagues and Canadians 
and Quebecers aware that Liberal decision-makers have failed to 
act on the fine words bandied about within these four walls.
<P>
	A year ago, I tabled my first motion on the issue, which stated 
that, firstly, it was important to recognize the principle of economic 
equality between women and men, and, secondly, that measures 
must be implemented to guarantee equity in employment, wages 
and living conditions for women. It was most unusual and 
remarkable, but government members supported the official 
opposition's motion.
<P>
	However, I must admit that they stopped at the first part of the 
motion and have never gone on to the second. How else can the 
current situation be explained with the same people in play? How 
else can we explain the decisions recently taken by this government 
which purports to be concerned with the economic inequality of 
women?
<P>
	How else can we explain the decision to go ahead with the cuts to 
grants for women's rights organizations which were announced by 
the previous government? All the while, the Minister of Finance 
tried to reassure us regarding this issue and, just before the last 
budget, stated that his government was fully aware of the issue, that 
the last budget proved it and that the government intended to prove 
it again in the next.
<P>
	I recall that the minister then mentioned the important role that 
organizations play in promoting women's rights and in improving 
their living conditions.
<P>
	How can we explain that, in two weeks, the government will cut 
funding to the initiative against domestic violence, which finances 
pilot projects, research, public awareness and education 
campaigns, etc.?
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	And yet, the Secretary of State declared last March 3: 
``Violence against women, sexual harassment, inequalities and 
inequities in employment opportunities, the wage imbalance 
and gender discrimination must all be addressed. I am pleased 
the government is continuing to push forward on all these 
fronts''.
<P>
	Everyone knows that unfortunately little progress can be 
made without money. How else can we explain the government's 
policy of tying financial compensation due a woman to her 
husband's income? Both these trends are obvious in the 
proposed unemployment insurance and old age pension reforms. 
And yet, the Minister of Human Resources Development stated 
last October: ``We are putting forward major proposals 
concerning the problem of family work and the manner in which 
part-time workers, the majority of whom are women, can be 
given a certain degree of protection with respect to 
unemployment insurance and other income security programs''.
<P>
	Since when is a woman's economic equality acquired through 
dependence on her husband? Women do not accept this 
approach, nor should they. What explanation is there for the 
complete absence of references to child care services in the last 
budget, when the same minister stated on that same date that in 
the green paper consideration was being given to major child 
care programs and a national strategy, requiring funding 
amounting to some 700 million dollars. Where are the budgets 
needed to create new day care spaces, where are the transfers 
Quebec is calling for in order to develop its own network? Why 
is there no interest in finally resolving the thorny issue of pay 
equity in the public service, when this issue has languished 
before the courts for several years now, depriving thousands of 
women of money that is rightfully theirs?
<P>
	And yet, the President of the Treasury Board said last June: 
``As an employer we are concerned about pay equity. We would 
like to resolve this problem as quickly as possible, in order to cut 
short the long drawn out legal proceeding instituted by the 
preceding government''. Noble words! How does this explain 
the offensive transfer carried out by the Minister of Finance onto 
the backs of the provinces, the inevitable result of which will be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10578"> 10578 </A></B>
<P>
either a reduction in health and education services and social 
assistance benefits, or a tax hike?
<P>
	Yet, on February 8, the Minister of Finance stated: ``We are 
fully aware of the need to deal fairly with women's needs''. 
Does the minister sincerely believe that fairness towards women 
lies in reducing their standard of living? And how does one 
explain the Secretary of State for the Status of Women's latest 
decision to abolish the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status 
of Women?
<P>
	The main role of this organization was to do research and 
disseminate information on problems affecting women. It also 
played the role of government watchdog by analyzing the 
economic impact of government actions and decisions on 
women. Yet, in the same speech in which she announced the 
abolition of this organization, the Secretary of State repeated the 
Prime Minister's comments: ``For its part, the Canadian 
government has taken up the challenge. Women's equality is not 
a matter of special rights or interests. It is a matter of social and 
economic justice. It is a matter of good government''.
<P>
	The abolition of CACSW is not an example of good 
government that will help women meet the challenge of 
economic equality; in fact, it is just the opposite. Women's 
economic status is not improving. They are the first victims of 
the massive cuts in the federal public service. Some 45,000 jobs 
will be lost; and women will be hit the hardest. They are still 
earning only 72 per cent as much as their male colleagues. In 
1920, they were making 50 per cent as much as their spouses. 
They still account for the majority of single parents, poor 
people, people living in inadequate housing, and victims of 
family violence. Women expect measures that will finally allow 
them to achieve the economic equality they are entitled to.
<P>
	On March 8, 1994, the Secretary of State said this: ``For the 
first time we have had a government sensitive to the different 
impact of programs and policies on women. It is a government 
willing to ensure that gender perspective is taken into 
consideration in all the proposed changes whether they are 
fiscal, social or juridical in nature''. In fact, the decisions and 
actions taken clearly show this government's insensitivity to the 
inequality still plaguing women in Canada and Quebec. It is also 
obvious that this government has no intention of taking the 
necessary corrective measures.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious that this government truly deserves the severe 
criticisms levelled against it today by members of the 
opposition on behalf of Canadians and Quebecers. There is an 
urgent need to act instead of merely indulging in rhetoric. Is 
``Towards Equality'' not the slogan adopted by the Canadian 
government to promote the world summit on women to be held 
in Beijing in September 1995? I think that this government is off 
on the wrong foot. It will go there to brag about what it has failed 
to do at home.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Questions or comments? No one? Did I 
hear correctly that you will share your time? Agreed.
<P>
	The hon. member for Saint-Hubert.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
know full well that, each time the issue of status of women is 
raised, we lose a large part of our audience. It is not that too 
much time is devoted to this subject in this House. It is just that 
many people do not want to hear what we have to say and, more 
than anything else, they refuse to take action.
<P>
	I will speak on the status of women anyway, and the status of 
women in the legal profession in particular. In Quebec, you can 
be a lawyer or a notary.
<P>
	I will focus on women lawyers because, unfortunately, a 
committee has yet to be appointed to look specifically into the 
experience of women notaries in their everyday practice. All our 
statistics on women lawyers were provided to us by the Quebec 
bar association.
<P>
	In the legal profession, women experience basically the same 
thing women experience in any area in which they work; by 
``work'', I mean work outside of the home, of course.
<P>
	If there has been such an influx of women on the labour 
market, outside of the home, we know this is due to a large 
extent to socioeconomic factors. It became necessary for women 
to help maintain the family income. This has been a determining 
factor.
<P>
	In 1951, women accounted for less than 25 per cent of the 
Canadian labour force, as compared to 58 per cent of adult 
women in 1991. By far the biggest increase in the labour force 
participation rate occurred among women with young children, 
the majority of whom have full time jobs.
<P>
	Women who, by necessity or by choice, head for a career in 
law face many difficulties inherent in this line of work. The 
dysfunctional relationships with male colleagues, the 
under-representation on the bench and the limited number of 
female teachers in our law faculties are but a few of the 
symptoms of a serious problem which persists in a world which 
claims to be eliminating injustice and unfairness.
<P>
	Women are now part of the labour force, but female jurists 
form a distinct group. In the public's eye, we are perceived as 
being privileged. Yet, to become a disciple of Themis, a woman 
must overcome many obstacles which are not related to her 
status as a jurist, but to her status as a woman.
<P>
	The Quebec Bar Association's committee on women lawyers, 
to which I alluded earlier, took a close look at the issues 
confronting female lawyers. Unfortunately, the chamber of 
notaries does not have a similar committee. A poll was 
conducted among women lawyers and the findings were 
released in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10579"> 10579 </A></B>
<P>
1992. Those findings are very instructive. They clearly show the 
obstacles which we must face not just as jurists, but also as 
women.
<P>
	In the five years previous to the poll, 71 per cent of female 
lawyers experienced problems in their vocational practice. It is 
important to point out that the situation of the majority of these 
women did not change over that period, whether we are talking 
about hiring policies, relations with male colleagues, judges and 
clients, parental obligations, working conditions in general, or 
career advancement. In short, there is no progress.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	Women lawyers practice a profession which was defined by 
men. Our laws and our precedents are set in a masculine mould. 
Lynn Smith, the dean of the law faculty at UBC, clearly exposed 
the problem in an article entitled ``A system that's changing''. 
Let me quote and eloquent excerpt: ``The roots of the current 
legal system were planted by men. Developed at a time when 
women could not vote, be elected, become lawyers or be 
members of a jury, the law sought to protect the interests 
deemed important by men, given the realities of their lives as 
men. When the law did take women into consideration, it was 
solely from a male standpoint''.
<P>
	The most glaring example of inequity comes from the 
judiciary. An overwhelming number of judges appointed by the 
federal government, that is, the provincial superior court judges 
and the Federal Court judges, are men. Overall, only 134 of the 
950 federal judges are women.
<P>
	By interpreting the law and exerting some moral influence, 
judges help to shape and develop the fundamental values upon 
which our society is based. Women have been chronically 
under-represented among judges. In other words, although they 
have had the right to practise law for 53 years now, the 
proportion of women on the bench still remains under 10 per 
cent of all Quebec judges in the Quebec Court of Appeal, the 
Superior Court, the Court of Quebec or the municipal courts.
<P>
	At the Quebec Superior Court, where judges are appointed by 
the federal justice minister, women represented 11.3 per cent of 
all judges, accounting for 20 of the 176 judges, as of March 1, 
1995.
<P>
	The situation elsewhere in the country is not much better. 
Madam Justice McLachlin and Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dubé 
are the only two women out of the nine judges appointed to the 
Supreme Court of Canada. They represent 22.2 per cent of these 
judges, while women account for 52 per cent of the Canadian 
population.
<P>
	As of March 1, 1995, women made up only 10.3 per cent of the 
judges appointed to the Federal Court and the Tax Court of 
Canada, accounting for 8 out of these 60 judges. I could go on 
and on with the deplorable data concerning the Canadian 
women's place in the judiciary, but it would feel like preaching 
in the wilderness.
<P>
	It is up to the Minister of Justice to appoint more women 
judges at the federal level. He is duty bound to review the 
questionable selection process where potential women 
candidates must have an impressive number of years of 
litigation practice, when we know that most women cannot 
consider that kind of practice because of their parental 
responsibilities. Such a criterion is not applied at the provincial 
level. It is hard to imagine how a mother could sit at a trial for 
three intensive weeks. Yet, it is acceptable for a father to be in 
the litigation practice and to devote all of his time to his work.
<P>
	Men's schedules do not change much when they become 
fathers and have young children. However, this is not the case 
for women, especially those with preschoolers. Whatever their 
profession, mothers of toddlers are the most likely to change 
their work schedules.
<P>
	For example, 95 per cent of career women, including women 
judges, work full-time, compared with 68 per cent of women 
who have preschool children and a similar job. Almost one third 
of women with preschool children and an irregular work 
schedule indicated that they had chosen such a schedule mainly 
to be able to take care of their children.
<P>
	The selection process used does not reveal how a candidate is 
chosen and should therefore be abolished. Openness is a 
necessity, not a luxury.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	If the process were more open, the Minister of Justice could 
no longer hide behind vague excuses like the lack of qualified 
candidates. If the requirements are the same for men and 
women, they automatically create inequities since, in general, 
women do not practise the profession in the same way that men 
do.
<P>
	Treating both sexes the same way is creating inequities. The 
low representation of women among judges is in no way a 
reflection of their availability since in Quebec they now 
represent almost a fifth of the Bar membership eligible for the 
bench, that is, people who have been practising law for at least 
ten years. Furthermore, with the increased numbers of women 
who have entered the legal profession since the early eighties we 
can expect that the number of women eligible for appointment 
will increase rapidly in the next few years.
<P>
	I ask the Minister of Justice: Will we see an increase in the 
number of women appointed to the bench proportionate to their 
representation among the most experienced members of the 
legal profession? Time will tell.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, our 
colleague from Saint-Hubert raises an issue that is both 
sensitive and real.
<P>
	Indeed, in Quebec like everywhere else in Canada, women are 
clearly under-represented in the judiciary. I have vivid 
memories of the 1984 election campaign where the leaders of 
the four federal parties were  proposing gender equality. The 
govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10580"> 10580 </A></B>
<P>
ments that have been in power since that time have done 
nothing, or almost nothing in this respect.
<P>
	My colleague from Saint-Hubert asked a question of the 
Minister of Justice who will obviously avoid giving an answer. I 
would like to ask my colleague from Saint-Hubert if, in her 
opinion, the federal government demonstrates the will to 
achieve, within a reasonable time frame, equity in appointments 
to the bench.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer is a simple no. 
Unfortunately, since the Liberal government came into office in 
1993, it has not demonstrated the will to appoint more women to 
the bench. We just have to look at the appointments that have 
been made.
<P>
	On this subject, I would like to add that it is often said that if 
women are under-represented in the system, it is because they 
do not want to be elected to the House of Commons, they do not 
want to attend the conventions, they do not want to take part in 
the nomination process.
<P>
	I would immediately say to that that the problem is not that 
women do not want to participate, but rather that they often do 
not want to be part of a system that was established by men for 
men. Women are not used to fighting with each other for a 
position. They are used to getting a position because of their 
skills.
<P>
	When they go to a convention or a nomination meeting and 
see everybody bickering on the floor, they are very 
uncomfortable. That is why there are not too many women in 
politics.
<P>
	I just wanted to add this observation to explain that it is often 
for that reason that, unfortunately, there are not more women in 
this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank opposition members for 
bringing forward this debate. I rise in the House today to express 
my deep pride in the government's record in promoting social 
justice and economic parity for the women of Canada.
<P>
	I am encouraged by the interest shown by the hon. member of 
the opposition in the issues of women's economic equality, for 
what could be more important to Canada than the welfare of 
more than half its population. I believe it is 52 per cent. It is only 
when women and families thrive that our country will be 
renewed.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	I welcome the invitation to demonstrate to my colleagues that 
the federal government can be counted on to keep its promises. 
We said we would and we are reshaping the country, making it 
economically strong, socially just and proud of the rich 
diversity of its people.
<P>
	Our plan for Canada outlined in ``Creating Opportunity'' is 
firmly anchored in the principle that governing is about people. 
The motion before the House raises an important question: What 
has the track record of the government been on issues that affect 
the economic status of women? The short answer is that the 
government has done a great deal. The government made 
commitments in the last election campaign and is living up to 
them.
<P>
	In the few minutes available to me today I want to discuss the 
actions we have taken in the important area of employment 
programs. I want to look briefly at the record in unemployment 
insurance and I want to talk about the child care issue. I will 
finish with some comments on the government's proposal for 
changes to the Employment Equity Act. The document is an 
empowering document not just for women but for the disabled, 
for aboriginals and for visible minorities.
<P>
	First let me establish the context. It has become a truism that 
the best social program is a job. That point has been made by 
people from both the right and left of the political spectrum. 
Therefore well over 400,000 people can say that they have taken 
part in the greatest social program of all since the government 
took office in October 1993. There is every evidence that the 
record will continue strongly and that these are predominantly 
good jobs and full time work. Women are claiming their full 
share of the growth.
<P>
	Let me give a personal view of what it is to be a woman and 
what it is to be a woman in an area that used to be exclusively 
male in the number of areas I have occupied in my career. I was 
in the civil service for many years before I entered politics. My 
experience was that I never had a problem working with men 
because those were the people to whom I had the most exposure 
in the levels I occupied in senior management. It gave me a great 
deal of opportunity to build human relationships that had a 
certain dynamic and express co-operation and a bit of a positive 
attitude about working with other people.
<P>
	However the real experience I have as a woman comes from 
the fact that the most influential people in my life have been 
women. My grandmother was a medicine woman. She was an 
orator. She was the anchor in my family. She was the leader in 
my family. There are many strong men in my family. The women 
in my family are very strong women. They see the opportunity 
for greatness in almost every opportunity that comes their way.
<P>
	Another most influential woman in my life has been my 
stepmother who adopted me when I was three months old. She 
took the opportunity to teach me good things. I cannot think of a 
thing women have gained that has just been given to them. I 
cannot see an empowerment process that women have not fought 
hard for. Women are truly the instrument of their own 
empowerment. We are 52 per cent of the population. If  women 
use that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10581"> 10581 </A></B>
<P>
instrument, if women use that power device sincerely, it will be 
the essence of how great our accomplishment can be.
<P>
	I have travelled around the world. I have seen other societies, 
other groups across different nations. It sort of sets a stage for 
what we have in Canada. In our party we have the whole idea of 
equality of opportunity and I really believe in it. It is interesting 
when we think about people like Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of a 
former president of the United States, who said: ``No one can 
make you feel inferior without your consent''. I feel that way 
about being a woman.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	I feel that women have certain natural talents. That does not 
make us better than men. It just makes us as good as we can be. It 
gives us the capacity for nurturing, the capacity for 
co-operation, the capacity for vision, and the capacity for 
sharing. We are not keeping the power to ourselves but we are 
sharing the power. The use of a power in a very positive way is a 
dynamic that women bring to politics, to business and to social 
development. It is a different style. It is not better. It does not 
create inequity. It creates the greatest opportunity for women.
<P>
	If we look back through history to when women in Canada 
received the right to vote, no one handed it to them. No one made 
us persons without the struggle of women. Women themselves 
went out and put up the fight to gain that right, to gain that 
recognition. We have fought some big battles. They are not 
battles between the sexes. They are battles for human dignity. 
They are battles of the individual fitting in society in a way that 
expresses true human rights and dignity: the right to work, the 
right to raise children in an environment that is safe and clean, 
and the right to raise our heads among others without feeling 
shame or disgrace even when there are problems. That is the 
kind of country we live in. That is the kind of democracy for 
which people fight and in fact in some countries for which 
people have died.
<P>
	I come from a family in which women play a very 
predominate role. The men play an equal role in their own area, 
but I am talking about women today. I am not saying it is just our 
day. In fact all the men here today can have the honour of being 
honorary women if they so desire.
<P>
	The whole issue of economic empowerment is a different 
dynamic. Many would say that business is a man's world. That is 
changing. We no longer have a single income society. We have a 
double income society. People are working, partnering and 
sharing. There are children to look after and there are 
competitive forces that impact on families, communities, 
regions and the country as a whole. Women are major 
contributors. Not only do women see the necessity of their 
positive participation. Men also see the positive contributions 
made by women. It is necessary. It is absolutely necessary.
<P>
	Women make up 52 per cent of the population. I was in 
Copenhagen. Empowerment to me is reaching out and having 
the human experience of realizing the differences, of building 
tolerance, of building acceptance and of approving of people's 
differences linguistically, culturally, socially and economically. 
We are all people.
<P>
	I was empowered by seeing other women. I had the 
opportunity to listen to female leaders and male leaders from 
around the world. On International Women's Day there was 
much mention that despite the fact women make up 52 per cent 
of the population they account for 70 per cent of the world's 
poor. If women account for 70 per cent of the world's poor, 
implicit in that is that children are involved. There are more 
women in female centred living circumstances or families than 
there are males.
<P>
	We realize the imperative of empowering women. For 
instance, the government in making its appointments to boards 
and commissions is constantly vigilant and balancing the 
number of women appointed to boards and commissions, as are 
other members of this caucus and other members of the House. 
There is a balance. It is definitely a commitment of the Prime 
Minister and the cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	There is still a greater opportunity for us to look at some of the 
most economically related boards, to look at the financial 
institutions and to be able to appoint women. There are women 
who are qualified, woman who have years of experience. I have 
met them, as have other members of the House. They are women 
with a lot of experience and equality of education, who have two 
or three degrees. They are women who are not bilingual, but 
multilingual.
<P>
	They are multi-faceted women who have a whole range of 
talents to bring forward to the process, not only empowering 
their families and themselves but their communities and this 
country. There is definitely a role for ensuring that women get to 
the top in partnership with men. It is not either/or. It is better 
when they work together.
<P>
	We also understand the right to be recognized as persons was 
not conferred on us by a special men's club that thought it was 
time to make women persons. That did not happen. Women took 
up the fight. Women won that right.
<P>
	It is a powerful feeling on Persons day every year watching 
the women being recognized, outstanding citizens in this 
country, who have contributed not only to themselves but to 
their communities and to their country and maybe to the world in 
a sense by setting an example.
<P>
	The right to vote was not conferred on women because 
someone decided. It was a hard fought battle. It was something 
women felt strongly about and they finally won the right to vote.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10582"> 10582 </A></B>
<P>
	Around the world democratic rights is one of the most 
powerful tools. Look at South Africa. It is a prime example. 
The right to vote, the right of assembly, the right to speak, the 
right of mobility are things women have to make work for 
themselves. That is the basis of a firm foundation on which to 
build economic empowerment. That makes it a powerful tool.
<P>
	At this time the government is aware economic growth by 
itself is not enough. Women still remain clustered in 
traditionally female occupations such as teaching, nursing, 
clerical or sales and service work.
<P>
	I was so pleased when I went to Montreal two months ago and 
met with a group of young girls in a classroom dedicated to 
teaching math and sciences to these young women. I want to see 
these young girls 20 years form now. I want to see them when 
they are in high school and university. I told one young girl her 
seat is waiting for her in the House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Look out world.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Look out world is right. Those young 
people are going to be a huge factor not in just the empowerment 
of their specific gender, but of this country. If we use that 52 per 
cent resource to its maximum, we can help to abate a lot of the 
social problems. We can help to abate a lot of the economic woes 
that befall our communities.
<P>
	In this country we are so good at building infrastructure. If we 
need a road, we build it. If we need a hospital, we build it. If we 
need banks, we build them. If we need airports, we build them. 
The one thing that is critical and has not happened over different 
levels of successive governments is building that firm human 
foundation, that firm human infrastructure that is spiritual, 
social, cultural and linguistic which will result in children 
staying in school and will not drop out.
<P>
	That is not always the result because we have a 
disempowerment somewhere along this infrastructure path we 
have taken. I am not saying that we should not have 
infrastructure. I am saying that if we have it, it should work for 
us. It should give us the results we need.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	We should be producing. We have skating rinks and curling 
rinks. We have these other kinds of institutions and 
infrastructure. They should be producing better athletes. They 
should be producing children who will be able to set their goals 
and reach them with their families and their instructors.
<P>
	Somehow we have to get back to the basics of making those 
things work for people, not just women, all people in this 
country. We need to say real empowerment is not the 
empowerment of one individual. Real empowerment is the 
empowerment of our families, of our children, of our 
communities and of our country.
<P>
	A country is not about one person. A country is about a 
collective, all the people who live here, all the people who come 
here from other parts of the world who believe we still have the 
best country in the world. I certainly believe that.
<P>
	I am not turning a blind eye and saying we do not have 
problems. We have problems, but at least we have the 
democratic right, the equality of opportunity to be able to deal 
with those problems, to make a better tomorrow for ourselves 
and for our children.
<P>
	If all the government did was rely on the market, as some in 
the House would prefer, we would see only a glacial change in 
the labour force situation of women. This government believes 
it can do better. It recognizes the continuing need to help women 
move into new growth areas. It recognizes its own programs and 
services can help to bring us closer to that goal. That is 
important in terms of the government's employment programs.
<P>
	Hon. members will be aware of many of the programs and 
services provided by Human Resources Development Canada. I 
am sure almost all of us have Employment Canada centres in our 
ridings. These offices have made real efforts to reach out to 
women, to make programs and services more accessible, to 
break down the stereotypes and the barriers to full participation 
by women.
<P>
	In the last full fiscal year, 1993-94, more than one-quarter of 
a million Canadian women, 262,392, participated in HRDC 
employment programs and services of all kinds. That figure was 
fully 28,555 more than in the previous year. This is so absolutely 
important.
<P>
	There is a lot of technical information I have here which I 
have not shared with the House. It takes co-operation. It takes 
true partnership. It takes true dignity and respect to really 
empower the individual and to empower a community, a family, 
a country. It can be done by respecting and recognizing the 
power and the real empowerment of women.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague 
opposite made some interesting comments. She mentioned 
points regarding the status of women that certainly raise some 
questions. I am criticizing my hon. colleague for her 
government's lack of concrete action.
<P>
	Both she and her colleagues on the government side point to 
certain situations, but they have yet to put forward any concrete 
measures, like a day care system; instead, we get budget cuts 
hitting community agencies and groups that provide assistance 
to women, and we get UI benefits based on family income. What 
does the government intend to do to help women?
<P>
	They point to certain things, and say that they are aware of the 
situation, of violence against women, but what have they done to 
the budget dealing with violence against women? In two weeks 
there will be no more money for that, and we know very well that 
the  government has not stated what it intends to do about it. As 
recently as yesterday, the secretary of state let it be known, on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10583"> 10583 </A></B>
<P>
the sly, without consulting women's groups, and in a crude 
fashion that the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of 
Women would be shut down. She said, among other things, that 
the council had been set up by a movement that was in its 
infancy.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	Should we conclude from those remarks that the women's 
movement has reached its full development? I do not think so. I 
think that progress has, indeed, been made, but the movement 
has not reached maturity.
<P>
	I would like to get specific indications from my colleague. I 
too can wax poetic about the status of women. I too had to fight 
to make my way and be elected to this House, and it was not 
easy. Structures are frequently barriers that are not easily 
overcome. I agree with my colleague opposite about that, but I 
would like to have specific facts.
<P>
	It is no secret that the Axworthy exercise was rather vague as 
far as the status of women is concerned. The same holds true in 
other sectors as well, like justice. I would like to hear what 
concrete action the government will take within a certain time 
frame and how much money it will spend. With the cuts recently 
announced, the CACSW will lose 30 per cent of its budget. 
Women's groups are being told that they are now on a solid 
footing. Such a statement is dangerous because it is not true. 
Some groups may be on a solid footing, but discrimination will 
occur.
<P>
	How will the minister responsible for the status of women 
decide which group is to get grants? How will that decision be 
made? There is a vacuum here and we are left wondering 
whether there is a real will to help women. In 1995, more than 
ever before, women will need help because, when we go through 
a severe economic crisis, violence escalates and women are 
more than ever in need of help.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree that they are 
confused. On the one hand in dealing with the opposition we find 
that every time we raise an issue, no matter what it is, women, 
employment or child care, we are told it is in the purview of 
provincial jurisdiction, that we have to confer with our 
provincial counterparts.
<P>
	The hon. member is suggesting that I make suggestions about 
specific projects, specific initiatives even though she knows full 
well we have not had the opportunity to discuss such issues as 
child care with the provinces, which Quebec feels very strongly 
about.
<P>
	There is not a vacuum. The government has undertaken a 
number of initiatives. Program review and evaluation is one of 
them. Under that guise we have also looked at women's 
programs. Change is not a bad thing. What is wrong with change 
in the name of effectiveness and efficiency? That is what the 
country wants.  Canadians are telling us it is not how much we 
have, it is what we do with it. They are also telling us change is 
not such a bad thing. To make change in the name of efficiency 
and effectiveness is a good thing for this country as a whole, not 
just women.
<P>
	It is true we are consolidating the women's programs but it is 
all in the name of removing duplication, eliminating a number 
of unnecessary allocations. We need to do that to make it more 
cost effective and to deliver services to the individual rather 
than build administrative bureaucracies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon: </B>Mr. Speaker, it is true that we are asking for 
money, we are asking for transfers to provinces so that Quebec 
can finally get the amount of money that it needs to create its 
own programs. That certainly does not mean that we want the 
federal government to create the programs. We should not play 
on words either.
<P>
	I will quote my colleague, the secretary of state, who was 
saying just yesterday that she had two good news. These two 
good news are bad news for the provinces. First of all, there are 
no tax increases. What does that mean? It means that the 
provinces will have to increase taxes in order to fill that gap and 
to pay for programs which will be created in the different 
provinces.
<P>
	Second, tax loopholes have been eliminated; the budget 
makes our tax system more equitable. Which tax loopholes? The 
ones for big business, for family trusts or the ones for the middle 
class and the poorest people? That is the question that I am 
asking my colleague.
<P>
1115
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no way I would 
expect this hon. member and the opposition to come forward and 
endorse and kiss the budget that we presented. I do not believe 
that.
<P>
	However, she suggests that in the budget we put forward the 
provinces have no responsibility. I dare say not. The province 
she is from is preparing a budget that will have an impact. She is 
fearful that it will not all be good.
<P>
	These are tough times and we have taken the directions we 
believe are necessary in order to get our house in order. We are 
doing what we feel we do best and we are leaving to others what 
we feel they can do better. That is the way in which we are 
conducting our business.
<P>
	There are different levels of taxation. I cannot speak to all of 
them but clearly there is a responsibility. We have made our 
move and the next step is up to the provinces.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to put a question to the minister about 
another aspect of her speech. She says Canada is the best country 
in the world to live in and anyone can enjoy it. As far as I am 
concerned, I see things differently. Overall, it is true that Canada 
is well positioned among western countries, but there are groups 
in our society which are less fortunate than others and the 
government should try to improve their situation.
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to the aboriginal people. 
Given the statistics on suicide, alcoholism and various other 
social problems, I wonder if the best way to help aboriginal 
women would not be to thoroughly examine the relationship 
between the natives and the federal government and to review, 
or discard altogether, the Indian Act, in order to put an end to the 
shameful way Canada has been treating native peoples over the 
last century.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Blondin-Andrew:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am really quite 
pleasantly surprised to hear the member opposite speaking 
about the rights of aboriginal people.
<P>
	It is no secret that I have been very outspoken on the rights of 
aboriginal people. I am also quite pleased, as was the rest of the 
country and the House, that the only department that is 
experiencing growth, even though it is not enough to meet the 
increase in demand and need, is the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development.
<P>
	I am also quite pleased, on behalf of the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development, to note that there is a major 
devolution and dismantling process under way. Something is 
definitely happening. As an example, an agreement was signed 
in Manitoba. That is just one area but there are other sources of 
self-empowerment.
<P>
	The government has a whole section on self-government. 
There have been major comprehensive land claim deals signed 
with the Yukon, a number in the Northwest Territories and also 
in the province of Quebec. Those are the real empowering 
sources on which the government has taken an initiative. It is not 
just this government but other governments as well.
<P>
	We are not turning away from the people who are the most 
vulnerable, at risk and disadvantaged. We are there for those 
people.
<P>
	We understand that we can do business in a much more 
effective and efficient way. The Canadian public agrees and is 
ready for that. In a sense, we are catching up with public 
thinking on this. I am sure the hon. member will recognize that 
in doing so we will not turn our back on the people who really 
need our help.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I wish to congratulate the hon. member for Québec for 
having introduced this most important motion in the House this 
morning. I expecially like the part of the motion which refers to: 
``-inaction regarding the adoption of concrete measures to 
promote the economic equality of women in federal areas of 
jurisdiction.''
<P>
	Would the Secretary of State for Training and Youth be 
prepared to make a commitment before the House this morning 
that she will take steps at the highest levels of her party to ensure 
that women will not be affected more than men by the 45 000 job 
downsizing over the next three years?
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	She said earlier that women accounted for 52 per cent of the 
Canadian population. Will the ratio be higher than 52 per cent 
when those 45 000 civil servants lose their jobs? Will there be 
many more women than men among those people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the President of the Treasury 
Board is the minister who has that responsibility. I feel he has an 
eye and an ear to all of the dynamics of balancing on gender the 
concerns of the people who will be reduced from the work force 
there. He is considering all the dynamics. I would not even try to 
improve on the excellent job the minister has done.
<P>
	I am sure he has a special concern about the view that 
government has toward the role of women in everything we do. 
Of course I have support for women in all areas, not just this 
area, as my colleagues do, some of whom are male.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to rise to speak to this issue today. I wish to preface 
my remarks by saying that although I will not be in complete 
agreement with my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I believe 
it is important for all of us in the House to have the opportunity 
to debate.
<P>
	It is through debate and discussion that ideas evolve to make 
for a more effective environment, especially when we are 
looking at this whole area of the ongoing evolution and 
devolution, shall we say, of those issues that are particularly 
important to women as they become more a part of society.
<P>
	I would like to compliment the minister for youth and training 
for the philosophical eloquence with which she addressed this 
issue. My approach is going to be somewhat different because 
we were asked to assess the impact of the Liberal budget on the 
whole of society and that, of course, includes women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10585"> 10585 </A></B>
<P>
	The rhetoric that has been used to promote the evaluation of 
issues pertaining to women has been in my view for far too long 
framed in the term women's issues. This narrowly defined focus 
ignores the economic reality and the impact that is felt, not just 
by women but also by men, our families and Canadian society 
in general.
<P>
	The Liberal budget is a good example of this cross-cutting 
effect, across lines of race, religion, gender, even age. Today I 
will address three areas on which the budget has a negative 
impact as these are related to women. I chose to be very specific. 
I am glad that I did because it does provide a challenge to 
government, not necessarily in a negative way, but perhaps to 
challenge its thinking and approach to many of these issues.
<P>
	The first element I want to focus on is women and their 
autonomy. I will use the example of a national day care program, 
highlighting another broken Liberal promise, as well providing 
a dialogue for discussion from the Reform perspective. It is an 
opportunity to which I have long looked forward.
<P>
	The second area for discussion evolves around opportunities 
for women in Canada and the hollow ring of support provided in 
the Liberal budget. The focus for this aspect of my discussion is 
on the department of the status of women. We know that 
common sense speaks against the notion of social engineering. 
There is no strength in a tradition that keeps the issues of women 
from being addressed in a manner deserving of swift action.
<P>
	Last, this address will look at creative productivity, meaning 
jobs, jobs, jobs. Does that not have a familiar ring? The Liberals 
ran on this strong platform plank but have abandoned it in search 
of a savvy transparent advantage: the need to be liked by an 
electorate becoming increasingly frustrated by political 
posturing that does nothing more than foster dependency 
through the status quo. We will talk about women in business in 
that section.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Given the economic situation in Canada, the government 
simply cannot afford expenditures in the area of social 
programs. Yet the government and the previous one made 
extravagant promises to Canadians for a national day care 
system. For financial reasons, the Conservative government 
broke its promise in 1992-93 and the Liberal government has 
promised national day care if the economy grows.
<P>
	The reality is that it is easy for government to continue to 
make a promise it cannot keep and has no intention of keeping. 
The Reform Party prefers not to make promises on policies for 
which it cannot realistically expect to deliver.
<P>
	As a matter of social policy, the Reform Party believes that 
the sole responsibility for the care of children lies with parents 
and that the federal government should not interfere with that 
responsibility through economic  incentives that promote one 
form of child care over another nor promote subsidized day care 
facilities.
<P>
	By advocating universal day care, the Liberal and former Tory 
governments are both saying that the responsibility for the care 
of our children lies with the state and not with the parents. 
Reform will only support a system that keeps the state out of the 
homes of Canadians and maintains the freedom and 
responsibility of parents to care for children while providing 
some form of assistance to only those parents and children truly 
in need.
<P>
	The federal government should concern itself exclusively 
with matters that fall within its jurisdiction such as fiscal and 
monetary matters. High taxes, unemployment and rising interest 
rates are by far the major reasons why Canadians have no choice 
but to work while balancing homes and child care 
responsibilities. If the government would balance its budget, 
thereby giving Canadians the leverage to balance their own, not 
only would options open up for Canadian parents but the number 
of single mothers and children living in poverty would decrease.
<P>
	Financial problems are a major contributor to family 
breakdown and divorce. By alleviating some of these financial 
hardships, the government will indirectly strengthen the family. 
That is this country's richest resource and economic foundation.
<P>
	The debt and deficit situation no longer provides any leverage 
to the federal government in terms of lost revenues or further 
expenditures. The government's hands have become tied as far 
as new programs or financial incentives are concerned to allow 
the choice for parents to stay home or go to work.
<P>
	The Reform Party believes that there are various avenues to 
pursue in anticipation of long term tax relief for Canadians. We 
continue our work in these areas as demonstrated by the 
Reform's taxpayers' budget thereby increasing disposable 
household income and allowing for choice when it comes to 
caring for children.
<P>
	From a taxation perspective, we recommend that the 
government discontinue the child care expense deduction to 
level out the playing field between stay at home and working 
parents. It should pursue tax avenues that are not unfairly 
balanced in favour of one lifestyle or family composition over 
another.
<P>
	However, before it does so, it must determine whether federal 
responsibilities extend to providing child care to Canadian 
children because current expenditures including the following: 
the child tax benefit, the child care expense deduction, 
equivalent to married tax deduction, GST credit, CPP survivor 
benefits, UI maternity and parental benefits, social assistance 
and transfer payments to provinces under CAP. These 
effectively put it in the day care business and directly into the 
homes of Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10586"> 10586 </A></B>
<P>
	This jurisdiction is one for which it currently has no control. 
The provinces and territories are primarily responsible for the 
issue of child care. As provinces enact their own child care 
legislation and establish the accompanying regulations 
regarding the number of attendants per child, physical 
requirements of child care settings and training levels, all 
important criteria, dwindling transfer payments to the 
provinces become an even greater issue. How can this 
government justify downloading more responsibility to already 
cash strapped provinces?
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	What I have explained here would introduce a level playing 
field for both work and stay at home parents and would have far 
reaching positive economic implications. The potential for 
single income families could mean a drastic decrease in 
unemployment. For each person vacating the workforce a job 
opens up for the unemployed. The parent who chooses to be at 
home would have the opportunity and time to volunteer at 
schools, hospitals or local community centres, relieving some of 
the financial pressures currently facing these organizations 
which rely on government funding. It becomes a circle for 
success.
<P>
	We are advocating in favour of the family and those measures 
which will help Canadian families remain the social and 
economic building blocks of this country. These are the issues 
which affect and concern all of us, women and men. The issues 
of child care and the choice to work or stay at home 
predominately affect women.
<P>
	The Liberal budget demonstrates a lack of understanding and 
commitment to this fundamental reality. Reform's vision of 
social policy overall includes the decentralization of spending 
authority to the levels of government closest to the people, an 
improved framework of co-operative national standards, the 
empowerment of families and individuals, and a reinvigorated 
charitable sector.
<P>
	It is my belief that complete equality has come to reflect the 
core values of what I call the new feminism. I see any attempt 
for change in this regard caught up in the social engineering 
process as sustained and subsidized by Status of Women 
Canada.
<P>
	The Liberal budget did nothing to move us away from a 
tradition that perpetuates an old style of issues management, 
review, consult, discuss, a never ending circle of policy 
development going nowhere. Women want action on these 
issues which are so important to them.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance tabled his budget he announced 
he was transferring to Status of Women a women's program 
from Human Resources Development. When he undertook this 
move he transferred $11.3 million to Status of Women, $8.6 
million of it for straight grants to special interest groups, and 
$2.7 million for the administration and distribution of those 
grants. That amounts to an administrative overdose of  close to 
30 per cent. No business can afford to operate like this. No 
family country can afford to operate like this. No household can 
afford to operate like this. How can our government?
<P>
	The move was followed this week by another announcement 
from the Secretary of State for the Status of Women. As of April 
1, 1995 the National Advisory Council on the Status of Women 
will be disbanded. Yet there was no mention in the budget of an 
amalgamation of the NACSW with Status of Women Canada.
<P>
	The secretary of state allowed the estimates for the advisory 
council on the status of women to be commissioned, estimates 
which were published and released. They were of no value, for 
not one month later the announcement was made that the 
advisory council on the status of women would cease to exist. 
The secretary of state permitted an expenditure of tens of 
thousands of dollars in consulting fees to produce part III of the 
estimates when she knew all the information contained therein 
would not be used. It would not be needed. What kind of 
leadership is this?
<P>
	Not only do we have a department failing to disclose, we have 
wasted taxpayers money in order to further an unknown agenda 
at this point with respect to the budget. It is this kind of politics 
which has caused Canadians to find politicians less than 
forthright.
<P>
	On the issue of this department change, it is a tentative step in 
the right direction in terms of reducing the size of government. I 
acknowledge that. However, in terms of cost reduction it really 
is tokenism. A saving of $1 million cast against an exploding 
debt is cold comfort to Canadians waiting for an improved fiscal 
climate.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We need a dismantling of Status of Women altogether. I say 
this for two reasons. It would remove the stigma of special 
interest groups from women who are seeking to make positive 
change socially, economically and politically. Canadians would 
view this with favour as we strive to reach true equality without 
subsidized funding supporting these groups. It is a divisive 
practice creating us versus them.
<P>
	We would see government moving away from the cycle of 
reviewing, consulting and discussing with no action. The issues 
important to women would be more readily addressed and 
quickly if it were moved into the various departments for which 
there would be authority for action. Violence against women 
could be dealt with by the Department of Justice. The whole 
issue of breast cancer and research would move to the 
Department of Health. The finance department could have the 
opportu-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10587"> 10587 </A></B>
<P>
nity to address realistically the whole issue of poverty within 
single parent families which are usually led by the mother.
<P>
	Last year in her budget speech the secretary of state was very 
proud to announce that the government recognizes there are 
inequities in our tax system and income system detrimental to 
woman. She suggested there would be a review-another 
review-to address things such as support payments for women. 
She suggested the government would improve this situation.
<P>
	Here we are a year later and absolutely nothing has been done 
in this area. When a bill was presented by my colleague from 
Calgary Centre to redress this inequity the Liberal government 
refused to support it.
<P>
	One questions the partisanship of the House when sound 
fiscal proposals are introduced. What is the government's 
position regarding the interest of women, if only to score 
political points?
<P>
	Through effective and non-government subsidized efforts 
litigation and the simple exercise of expression through votes 
women do wield a lot of clout. When government officials, 
politicians, lawyers and judges get on side this will facilitate a 
powerful dynamic for change. In any quest for solutions the best 
models are partnerships of public and private resources. 
Resources mean more than money. Governments cannot act 
alone. They have neither the know how nor the money.
<P>
	What I speak of has been a long time coming. Our daughters, 
my daughters and my grandchildren, granddaughters I hope, 
will view the years prior to the 1970s as the dark ages. Male 
domestic violence went unchecked. Divorced women were 
denied a share of family property. Pregnant women were 
discriminated against in the job market. Rape could be easily 
laughed out of court by smart lawyers. Women were expected to 
declare they would love, honour and obey when they took their 
marriage vows. In fact 27 years ago I said ``obey'' and thought 
nothing of it, but how times have changed.
<P>
	The world was perceived from a male prism, from the use of 
language to the raised issues that have altered the course of 
those issues most important to women. Cases on equal 
employment opportunities, spousal support, fair pensions and 
equal pay, as well as sexual assault, sexual harassment, rape, 
pregnancy discrimination and violence against women have 
been benchmarks for women in the last decade. Remarkable 
efforts from remarkable men and women have resulted now in a 
very different world view.
<P>
	The best models for change are built on the partnerships found 
in the public and private sectors. This is even more apparent as 
we move to discuss women in business. Governments provide 
the environment in which business will thrive. Governments are 
there to cope with infrastructure development while the private 
sector seeks to thrive in a competitive and free market.
<P>
	This leads to my discussion of women in business. Women are 
starting businesses at three times the rate of men. Of these, 75 
per cent start their businesses during the peak child bearing 
years, placing additional responsibility on the family structure. 
These, women like most small business people, work long 
hours, from 50 to 70 hours a week, and earn on average less than 
$30,000 a year.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	I would like to throw out a challenge to those government 
institutions that become obstructionists to the phenomenon of 
women entrepreneurs. Women who create employment as small 
business owners are not a passing fad, but have become a basic 
trend.
<P>
	However, there is still discrimination by financial institutions 
against women who own and operate businesses. This 
discrimination was detailed in a study released last week by the 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business and takes the 
form of higher interest rates and a higher refusal rate for 
financing requests for women than for men. This discrimination 
was identified despite the fact that the characteristics used for 
the study were the same, irrespective of gender.
<P>
	The characteristics were the age of the business, the sector of 
activity, the number of employees, the sales performance, the 
number of credit managers, provincial and financial 
institutions. Externally it would appear that women are 
participating on a level playing field.
<P>
	What possible conclusion could be drawn when women 
business owners operating with the same parameters as male 
business owners are either refused their financing requests or 
are forced to pay a premium rate to compete on this so-called 
level playing field? The cost of financing is therefore unequal 
for men and women who own and operate businesses. This is the 
kind of equality that needs to be challenged and changed 
because it is not equality at all.
<P>
	The report concluded by making eight recommendations. I 
find it shocking that the recommendations suggest financial 
institutions should change their approach toward women 
business owners, that financial institutions should investigate 
ways of better understanding the particular situation of small 
and medium size businesses, especially women owners.
<P>
	These kinds of recommendations do nothing to encourage 
responsible business decisions to be made by our financial 
institutions based on competency and merit. Instead, although 
identifying that women business owners are treated unfairly by 
our institutions, it concludes the fault is that of the women rather 
than gender bias.
<P>
	The finance minister stated in his budget speech: ``There is so 
much more that we would like to be able to do for the millions of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10588"> 10588 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians who care little about the world of dividends and 
derivatives and simply worry about making ends meet''.
<P>
	It is time for this government to worry about making ends 
meet. A crippling debt and continual deficit stifling the growth 
of the nation will not lead us to prosperity. Removal of barriers 
through proper allocation of tax dollars enabling less social 
dependency and a more self-confident and trained workforce, 
empowerment if you will, will ensure that prosperous future for 
all of us, men and women.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Oakville-Milton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will take a moment to compliment the mover of the motion, the 
member for Quebec.
<P>
	In her motion she expresses the feelings a lot of us have, that 
we would all like to do more at this time to enhance our 
civilization, the civility of our country, and we would like to 
encourage those women's groups which have over time spoken 
out so eloquently and which have demanded more equity in their 
lives as Canadian citizens.
<P>
	From that perspective I am in agreement. At the same time, as 
the government responsible for the fiscal balance of this 
country, we have had to cut back and it is not just on the backs of 
women, although that is the focus of today's discussion.
<P>
	It is rather pretty well in every facet of our society, whether it 
is a businessman who used to get a grant or a women's group that 
used to get a grant. It is possible that neither may get a grant 
now. That does not mean we should leave our ideals behind. The 
member's motion helps us to keep those ideals in the forefront 
as we struggle through this period.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	As for the last speaker, the member for Calgary Southeast, I 
find it somewhat difficult to follow her logic. She described the 
1970s as the dark ages for women. She used some good 
examples to describe the days when women were less equal than 
they are today. At the same time she seemed to agree with the 
closing down of the council on the status of women and, if I am 
correct, she suggested that we should close Status of Women 
Canada.
<P>
	Does the member feel there has been some progress over the 
last number of years in the way in which women can participate 
in our society today in civilian life, in the military and in 
Parliament? How does she think we got here in 1995? Was it not 
the work of volunteer women's groups, government funded 
women's groups, and governments of the past that put budgets 
together for Status of Women Canada to pursue the issues 
outlined by women as needing to be improved to improve 
women's lives?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
hon. member for her question. There is no denying that women 
have moved a very long way. If it had not been for the efforts of 
the feminists, if we are to use that term here, there would not be 
the level of awareness of many of the issues I cited in my text. If 
they had not spoken out change would not have occurred.
<P>
	We have entered a different era. In my text I was trying to 
move us beyond the status quo. It is a challenge to government 
in terms of what I said to find ways to look at equality on the 
basis of just that with no conditions attached.
<P>
	We will have to come to terms with the economic reality that 
the government has very few dollars to spend and start to rely 
more on volunteer groups as she suggested and those avenues I 
mentioned in my text to pursue and continue the evolutionary 
change.
<P>
	I talked about effective and non-government subsidized 
efforts. I talked about litigation. I talked about the simple 
exercise of expression through our right to vote, putting people 
in the House of Commons. Hopefully that means women and 
men who will continue to press for change and pursue the 
opportunities we can without having to rely heavily on 
governments to fund initiatives. The issue of the dismantling of 
status of women is an attempt to move us beyond that point.
<P>
	The government's budget was a startling shift to a different 
spectrum on the continuum of left to right. The ideology of 
social liberalism seems to have changed. They too have 
embraced more of an economic pragmatic approach to how we 
deal with issues. I am trying to seek different ways of 
encouraging women as well as men to find alternatives rather 
than the status quo approach of going to government for money 
to undertake another policy review or to produce another report 
with little action.
<P>
	I appreciate the member's questions and look forward to 
further discussion with her at some other time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was very interesting to listen to the hon. member and her 
approach to the government's budget.
<P>
	Independence is very important to women and to all 
Canadians. The budget is taking a first step toward encouraging 
more independence. Child care is an important aspect of that. It 
is not just a lifestyle, as the hon. member has indicated, but a 
need to allow single women especially to get back into the 
workforce, which gives them and their families dignity. They 
can then act as role models for their children and contribute in a 
very meaningful way to Canadian society. Their children will 
have the independence to do the things they want to do.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	One aspect of the budget of the Minister of Finance concerned 
small business. We should take into account the statistics the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10589"> 10589 </A></B>
<P>
hon. member has stated regarding the increase of women 
entrepreneurs in the system. That  should be commended 
because it will spur the country to become self-sufficient and 
reduce the overall debt. We should take into account the one way 
in which small business people can get money to improve and 
enhance their business opportunities is through the source of 
capital from banks.
<P>
	As the minister stated, through the budget the banks have to 
be encouraged to sit down with government to find ways to lend 
more money to small businesses. Considering that small 
businesses run by women are becoming more and more a factor, 
it is in the right direction to give them the tools they need to help 
our economy get stronger.
<P>
	We should take into account the benchmark to which the 
minister was alluding. We should take into account that some 
banks are lending small businesses less than one-third of all 
their corporate loans. One recommendation I put forward was 
that the government should encourage banks to lend to small 
businesses at least one-third of the amount lent to all corporate 
donors. Then we would find an increase in loans to small 
businesses from $33 billion to $49 billion, or a 50 per cent 
increase. That would encourage many small businesses to 
expand and give women more tools to do much better.
<P>
	Would the hon. member agree that would be a good step by the 
Minister of Finance?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
member for his question.
<P>
	I would ask the member perhaps at another time to explain 
exactly what he means by government encouragement. I do not 
have a clear understanding of what he means by encouragement. 
However I would support government working with the banks to 
encourage a plan for action such as the hon. member suggested.
<P>
	I talked about the whole matter of financial institutions 
lending to women. I was taken aback by the report undertaken by 
the Federal Business Development Bank regarding the gender 
bias that appears to be apparent with respect to women and how 
women have access to money to foster and create businesses that 
will thrive. That is the point I would like to make here. It was 
concern for gender bias. Women do not appear to be treated 
fairly by financial institutions, given the nature of the report I 
cited in my text.
<P>
	From the Reform Party perspective we encourage and 
recommend competition in banking provided to entrepreneurs 
such as service to customers and delivery of quality products. 
We also recommend an independent ombudsman to adjudicate 
problems such as the ones I have mentioned. That is a form of 
problem resolution without having to go to government for 
further money to resolve the problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think it is interesting to see there is some 
agreement on the relevance of the motion presented by the hon. 
member for Québec. I am not saying that members will agree on 
every single word or that the government or the other opposition 
party will be in complete agreement, but there seems to be a 
common concern about the way women will be treated in the 
future, considering the changes that are taking place.
<P>
	I will read the motion again:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for its insensitivity and its inaction 
regarding the adoption of concrete measures to promote the economic equality of 
women in federal areas of jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	I think the operative words in this motion are ``the adoption of 
concrete measures'', because policies on the status of women 
have been discussed for many years. However, I think 
governments should be judged on what they have actually done 
in this respect.
<P>
	Perhaps I may take an example from every day life. Take, for 
instance, Marie-Hélène, a young student who intends to go to 
university next September. How does she see her future as a 
woman? What kind of future can she expect?
<P>
	Well, as a result of social programs reform, she can expect to 
be in debt to a far greater extent during the next few years. If she 
decides to go for a university degree, she will end up with twice 
or three times the debt she would have if she were completing 
her schooling now. Which means that a young woman who wants 
a career and considers what her future will be is going to say: 
Well, maybe it is not such a good idea to go all out to develop my 
potential because of the increased debt load I can expect.
<P>
	It is very surprising that she should think so under a Liberal 
government that, in the sixties and seventies, tried to do some 
interesting things to promote equal opportunity. Today, the 
government makes it very difficult for people to take advantage 
of such opportunities by telling them that when they go to 
university, they will have to carry a much heavier debt load. As a 
result, only wealthy families will be able to send their children 
to university, and we are thus reverting to a model we had 25 or 
30 years ago, which no one wanted and where equal opportunity 
for education did not really exist.
<P>
	So that is an example of a lack of concrete measures from this 
government, a negative action that will turn the clock back 20 or 
30 years and give many women cause for concern.
<P>
	Let us get back to our student. She has finished her education 
and would like to start a business. She decides that she wants to 
get into new technologies. Unfortunately, she is not covered by 
unemployment insurance because she has never worked a 
sufficient  number of weeks to be eligible, and she cannot apply 
for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10590"> 10590 </A></B>
<P>
welfare if her spouse has a job. In other words, she is not eligible 
for any government program.
<P>
	I took this particular example because women are more likely 
to find themselves in this kind of situation. As a result of what I 
would call systemic measures that are counterproductive, a 
situation has been created where women who want to start a 
business will be less likely than men to have access to various 
types of assistance. This is unfortunate, because the government 
could have included a number of measures in the current budget 
to deal with this, but it did not.
<P>
	I will continue with my example of a young woman looking at 
her future, making plans and trying to decide how she will go 
about it.
<P>
	When she read the red book of the Liberal Party, during the 
electoral campaign, she might have felt that, whenever she 
decided to enter a new career, she would be able to take 
advantage of adequate day care services for her children, 
allowing her enough time to pursue a career while ensuring that 
her children receive a proper education and adequate support 
during their formative years. Now I am not saying that men do 
not have any responsibilities regarding the education of their 
children, clearly we have the same responsibilities as women, 
but the truth is that in the real world we very often ask women to 
be what we call superwomen, that is to say women able to juggle 
family, professional and social lives, and more often that not, 
without much help.
<P>
	The government could have taken a number of concrete 
measures, since the Liberal Party had promised during the 
election campaign that if the gross domestic product was to 
increase by 3 per cent it would create 60,000 new spaces in day 
care centers. Recently, we have seen an increase in the gross 
domestic product, but no increase in the number of day care 
spaces which would benefit women, except for native people. 
Thus the commitment which has been made regularly to Quebec 
and Canada has now been rejected.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The previous Conservative government did not live up to this 
commitment. The Liberals, who were elected on the promise to 
bring about changes, in this area as well as others, are following 
in their predecessors' footsteps. We can see why there is still a 
great deal of dissatisfaction and why the lack of concrete 
measures on the part of the government can be denounced.
<P>
	As a result, a young female student graduating with a heavier 
debt load and the knowledge that adequate day care services will 
not be available sees no hope of improvement in her situation. 
When she learns, at the same time, that the bodies acting as 
watchdogs for the status of women are going to be axed, she has 
every right to wonder what is in store for her. This young woman 
is full of vitality, very enterprising, and wants to go places.
<P>
	I will now give you the example of another woman also full of 
vitality, but maybe not as lucky. For the sake of this exercice, let 
us call her Helen. Helen, a single parent with two children, stays 
at home. Housing consumes 40, 50, 60 per cent of her income. 
When she is told that the government is committed to reducing 
poverty, the first thing she expects is to spend a more reasonable 
proportion of her income on housing, somewhere around 25 to 
30 per cent.
<P>
	But nowadays, people often spend 50 to 60 per cent of their 
income on housing. This means that, with a welfare cheque, 
when you spend between 50 and 60 per cent of it on rent, you 
have to be a miracle worker in order to feed two children 
properly and, in the end, prevent them from becoming trapped 
themselves in the vicious circle of being poor children. Could 
the Liberal government not have set aside additional money for 
direct assistance to public housing, following the tour by the 
Standing Committee on Human Resources Development on the 
reform of social programs?
<P>
	Oh, no. On the contrary. A press release by the minister 
responsible for the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation 
on February 28, 1995 made a very simple announcement-no 
fanfare. Nowhere else was this casual approach taken, except 
with the Advisory Council on the Status of Women, yesterday. 
Its demise was announced quite simply, without any fuss, during 
debate. The effect of this approach is just as hidden as in a press 
release. The press release in question announced a cut in the 
overall public housing budget of $270 million over three years. 
What does this say to Helen, the woman I was just talking about, 
who has a housing unit to pay for and must perform miracles just 
to survive? What does she understand when she is told the public 
housing budget is going to be cut by $270 million? So much for 
the light at the end of the tunnel.
<P>
	This is a criticism that may be made of the present 
government. It fails to take solid measures designed not so much 
as acts of charity but rather to put people in a position to be able 
to get out of their present situations. The same example applies 
with respect to the government's continual attempt to use the 
American model in assisting poor families. The current 
approach of the government is to say what the Americans have 
done, basically. The government says it will help poor families, 
but with the money it currently gives the middle class.
<P>
	Do you know what the effect of this is? More and more middle 
class families will become poor families. Then the government 
can crow over the fact that it sends them a cheque as a poor 
family. However, the approach in the past in Canada, and the one 
that worked, was to fight poverty by allowing the people just 
above the poverty line to continue to hope that their situation 
will improve and by giving poor families the means to improve 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10591"> 10591 </A></B>
<P>
their situation as well. But it will not come about by running in 
the opposite direction, by helping those in greatest need in order 
to bolster the government's image,  while withdrawing 
assistance from those in the middle class and driving them into 
the ranks of the poor.
<P>
	I think that we have here another example of the present 
government's failure to act that must not be allowed to go 
unchallenged. To accompany all these examples I am going to 
read you an extract from a speech given by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development before the World Summit on 
Social Development, just to show you what little connection 
there is between the speech and reality.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development said: ``Our 
programs must increasingly be backed up by concrete measures 
to get people back to work, rather than focussing uniquely on 
income support''. What are there in the way of measures to 
allow female entrepreneurs to assume their roles in the market 
place? There is nothing which corresponds to what was said in 
Copenhagen.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	Second, he also says that affordable day care must be 
available so that heads of single parent families, especially 
women, can work outside the home. How can a minister give 
such a speech in Copenhagen, and on the other hand be a 
minister in a government that has tabled the budget we have just 
seen? I think that this proves that the motion by the member for 
Québec is very relevant and we hope that the government will 
devote the necessary attention to correcting these major 
shortcomings in the present budget.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
very relevant comments. I appreciate his way of making 
concrete proposals to the government regarding economic and 
wage equality, as well as other issues.
<P>
	The purpose of the motion is to have the government speak up, 
not about intentions, but about concrete actions which it might 
take to improve the situation of women. The secretary of state 
made a comment to the effect that the Canadian Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women was established because 
women had a lot of claims.
<P>
	She argued that the situation of women has since improved 
within the government. Women have, indeed, made progress, in 
education, business, university and in other sectors. But these 
women are part of an elite group and not all women had the same 
opportunities in terms of access to such traditionally male 
occupations.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member could again show, in concrete 
terms, how the government often takes credit for measures 
geared to an elite group, while forgetting poor people, women, 
single mothers and the young who are faced with shrinking job 
opportunities. What concrete action could the government take?
<P>
	The government says it wants to stimulate businesses run by 
women, but again we are talking about an elite. This is fine, but a 
large percentage of women are left to fend for themselves and 
the government does not seem to have any concrete plan to help 
them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in my short experience as a member of Parliament, 
one of the things that struck me most is how women's groups, in 
my own riding and other regions, manage to do so much with so 
little. On very limited budgets, they find innovative ways to help 
women and their families, and they get concrete results despite 
their limited resources.
<P>
	I suggest that we start by listening to these organizations and 
by giving them the resources to do their jobs without being in a 
constant state of crisis. There should be a three-year or 
five-year plan that would make it possible for organizations, 
that represent women and help to develop women's goals, to 
continue their work.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	In the course of the hearings held by the human resources 
development committee, we heard testimony from dozens of 
women across Canada who talked about their experiences and 
who wanted to provide a better future for their daughters who 
today are 5, 10 or 15 years old. They want to ensure that 15 or 20 
years from now, special programs will no longer be necessary, 
because every woman will have a chance to develop her 
potential and equal opportunity will have become a way of life 
in our society.
<P>
	The most important thing is to have confidence in women.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
naturally in favour of the motion tabled by the hon. member for 
Québec, which asks:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for its insensitivity and its inaction 
regarding the adoption of concrete measures to promote the economic equality 
of women in federal areas of jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I therefore denounce the government's insensitivity to the 
situation of women. I would like to take this opportunity to 
address one aspect, old age pensions, and to show that the 
present government, despite all the action it has taken in this 
area, is not preventing an increasing number of older women 
from falling below the poverty line. The 1995 budget is 
definitely sounding the knell of the universality of social 
programs, including public old age security plans.
<P>
	By way of example, the ceiling on pension benefits based on 
the previous year's income puts an end to universality. Even 
though few seniors have incomes over $53,000 a year, seniors 
far from being rich often may earn higher family incomes in one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10592"> 10592 </A></B>
<P>
year by liquidating assets they have accumulated over the years, 
withdrawing RRSPs or transferring the latter.
<P>
	This provision of the budget will affect them directly the 
following year by reducing their pension benefits. It is a known 
fact that the old age security programs to which seniors have 
contributed have virtually stopped being universal since 1989.
<P>
	I have a hard time understanding why the Liberal government 
keeps going after this sector of the population, who, we must not 
forget, built this country. They are the government's preferred 
target, the one is bent on destroying by imposing unacceptable 
measures year after year, budget after budget, on these, society's 
most disadvantaged.
<P>
	People then wonder why Quebecers want to throw off this 
federalism and become sovereign. The various old age security 
programs and the guaranteed income supplement are the 
principal sources of income of people over 65 years of age. 
These people, especially women, are much poorer than the 
population as a whole.
<P>
	Is there anyone in this House who does not know that seniors 
are more disadvantaged because they are on pension and have 
lower incomes if they have not worked outside the home. This is 
the case of our mothers.
<P>
	Their work at home was not paid nor used to calculate their 
retirement pension. Their only income therefore in the years to 
come will be the Canada pension cheque. And for how many 
years to come?
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	It is an injustice and the government amplifies it by declaring 
that old age security pensions will be based on family income in 
the future. This measure will force a great number of seniors, 
most of them women, to hand back their pensions.
<P>
	According to Quebec's minister for the status of women, this 
measure would set women back 50 years. During that time, they 
have succeeded in being recognized by society as individuals, 
but now, because of budget cuts, they will see themselves forced 
to be viewed in relation to their spouses and to family income, 
once they retire.
<P>
	We can justifiably wonder in what direction the federal 
government is headed when it comes to women's rights. My 
colleague from the government of Quebec is right when she adds 
that the principle of family income completely transforms the 
retirement income security program, replacing what was an 
insurance program by a social assistance program for needy 
families.
<P>
	Canada made very clear public commitments in favour of 
gender equality and also took statutory measures to reach this 
objective. I refer to a Canadian document on violence against 
women. Section E.61 of its action plan states that Canada is 
committed to analyzing all of the proposed amendments to the 
tax system in order to expose all of the discriminatory or 
negative effects that they will have on women. This principle 
has now been shelved.
<P>
	Section E.66 of the same document states that Canada is 
committed to raising and ensuring full indexation of the 
threshold at which old age security benefits start being clawed 
back. Once again, this commitment has not been met.
<P>
	Canada's commitment is very clear in this document: We are 
supposed to take all of the necessary measures, in particular 
legislative measures, to amend or abolish acts, regulations, 
customs and practices which discriminate against women. Is 
this what the government delivers in its budget? No. It has 
thrown all of its principles out the window.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance offhandedly casts aside studies 
which have cost taxpayers a great deal of money and ignores 
basic principles in the name of deficit reduction. On the 
contrary, instead of going forward and giving seniors, in 
particular women, the means to attain these standards, the 
budget places these standards further out of their reach.
<P>
	Let us be serious. I understand very well that everything has a 
price and that there is a cost associated with this initiative. 
However, why not hit banks, tax havens and family trusts and 
leave seniors in peace. They have sweat blood and tears to build 
this country which, today, is rejecting them. Is this federalism?
<P>
	Have seniors not already given enough by working all of their 
lives and paying their taxes? Who else do you think filled the 
government's coffers?
<P>
	In conclusion, I would like to remind you that Quebec's 
sovereignty does not jeopardize senior's incomes. The threat to 
old age pensions comes from the federal government. That is the 
price to be paid for maintaining the status quo, the price to be 
paid for voting no in the upcoming referendum.
<P>
	In a sovereign Quebec, a matter like the one mentioned at the 
beginning of this speech, namely the government's insensitivity 
to the situation of women, will not even be an issue. Equity will 
be the order of the day.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite amazed to 
see this motion by the opposition. I would have wished for a 
preamble which could have read as follows: ``That this House 
commend the government for all the measures it has taken to 
date to create opportunities for women''.
<P>
	My hon. colleague is forgetting that, in our 1994 budget, we 
reiterated our commitment at the federal level to provide $100 
million to the emergency repair program. We also reinstated the 
court challenges program which provides funding for cases 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10593"> 10593 </A></B>
<P>
relating to the provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms that guarantee equality rights.
<P>
	I want to stress that these programs have expanded 
jurisprudence relating to positive economic action for women. 
Also, our government announced the establishment of the 
Canadian Race Relations Foundation, another major initiative 
on behalf of women facing discrimination both on the grounds 
of sex and race.
<P>
	I could cite at least 15 to 18 different initiatives this 
government has taken to date to create opportunities for 
Canadian women. Therefore, I am surprised to hear the 
opposition parties attack the government like this. I would like 
to tell my hon. colleagues that one year after taking office, we 
have accomplished a lot for women, when compared to the 
record of the previous government over ten years. I wonder why 
my hon. colleague does not rise to commend the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, I have trouble commending this 
government when the status of women just keeps deteriorating. 
Women, whether young, middle aged or seniors, see their 
standard of living going down continually.
<P>
	Take the freeze on student loans for young people who want to 
further their education, for example. The point was made earlier 
that, by the time they get out of school, university graduates will 
be in debt over their heads. That is what Canada has to offer. It 
was also clearly demonstrated, with figures to back this up, that 
no new day care spaces will be opened to allow women to 
re-enter the labour force.
<P>
	Again, that is what this government has to offer. Furthermore, 
there is no indication anywhere that something will be done 
about social housing. Cuts, cuts, cuts. I say this is a disgrace. In 
the red book, which in my view has turned black, there is 
nothing, absolutely nothing, in terms of positive measures 
concerning the status of women.
<P>
	Of course, one can argue that the government does have a 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women. But what does she 
have left besides her title since the advisory council has been 
abolished? What can she do? With no budget, she cannot go very 
far now. So, let us eliminate this title, which does more to pay lip 
service to the government's intentions than to further the cause 
of women.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this motion today. Although I have to 
profess at the very beginning that I do not agree with the motion 
that has been put forward, I am pleased the member for Quebec 
has put it forward so that some of the positive moves this 
government has taken since it was first elected can come to 
light.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	It is important that individuals and particularly 
parliamentarians are periodically forced to think about issues 
such as equality, be it between gender, or people of  different 
races or colour, immigrants versus second and third generation 
Canadians or our aboriginal people.
<P>
	We come to this place to debate the issues of the day. It is 
important for us to understand that unfortunately our society is 
not one that can claim with any purity to practise equality in 
nearly any aspect of life as Canadians. It is unfortunate that as a 
tolerant society there is still a tremendous amount of 
intolerance. It is unfortunate that as a progressive society there 
is still a tremendous amount of bigotry, a tremendous amount of 
isolationism and a tremendous amount of hate toward those who 
are different from us, whoever us is in any particular case.
<P>
	It is important that we try to put this debate into some context. 
The Government of Canada, my party, has campaigned for many 
years on platform of equality. The record and sincerity of the 
statements of a party or political institution, of a parliament or a 
government, should be judged by its actions.
<P>
	The actions we have taken over the last 18 months have been 
fairly significant. That is not to say they are the only actions that 
need to be taken. It is quite the contrary. When we are dealing 
with things like inequality, bigotry and racism we must be 
eternally vigilant. It has a habit of creeping up and when we take 
one step forward, unless we are very, very vigilant somebody 
will push us two or three steps backward.
<P>
	I suspect this motion came about as a result of some of the 
budgetary measures. I suspect that some people are concerned, 
perhaps for good reason, about some of the changes that have 
taken place because of the fiscal realities of rising deficits and 
debts and the requirement to try to get our economy moving 
again.
<P>
	I suspect that the member for Quebec was concerned that the 
National Advisory Council on the Status of Women is going to 
be wound up. I too was concerned when this first became a 
subject of public debate and consternation.
<P>
	I note the government has taken the women's program which 
used to be with human resources development and has folded it 
in with Status of Women Canada. This is a very significant move 
by the Government of Canada for two reasons.
<P>
	In the past when governments thought we had money, when it 
was thought we had more borrowing authority than we should 
have had, many times dollars were given to special interest 
groups. They would be given the money and told to go and 
represent women in society. That was a terrible thing if we think 
about it. What was the real intent behind that? Was it to try to say 
that women's issues were not worthy of perpetual vigilance by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10594"> 10594 </A></B>
<P>
parliamentarians? Did it mean they were to be pushed down to 
become the purview of a ``special interest group''?
<P>
	I have always had trouble with the way governments have 
funded special interest groups. Government funds me as a 
member of Parliament to represent the interests of my 
constituents. Repeatedly over the years it has become an 
accepted practice that parliamentarians can hide behind the fact 
that there are other groups to do this. We use taxpayers' money 
to front and support interests we are supposed to be raising and 
protecting in our duties as members of Parliament, as members 
of legislatures and as members of city councils right across 
Canada.
<P>
	I do note this government has a good record with respect to the 
initiatives it has taken to promote equality, not just within areas 
of the federal purview. Governments must lead by example.
<P>
	In my view this government has taken one of the most 
articulate, forceful and believable individuals in this Parliament 
and made her the Secretary of State for the Status of Women. 
Any independent observer would be hard pressed to find an 
individual in the last two Parliaments who has so consistently, 
forcefully and sincerely put forward the concerns of women and 
made it imperative that those concerns be dealt with by 
governments. It was not a fluke of cabinet roulette when it was 
decided that the member for Mount Royal would be the 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women.
<P>
<B>(1230 ) </B>
<P>
	Most women, most activists and most feminists in Canada, 
male and female, would agree that the choice of the member for 
Mount Royal as the Secretary of State for the Status of Women 
was clearly an indication of the seriousness with which the new 
government viewed these affairs.
<P>
	However there have been other things such as Bill C-64, the 
Employment Equity Act. We came in and strengthened that act. 
It was one of the acts I have been extremely critical of in the 
past. I am withholding my praise to see how the recent 
amendments will play out in actual fact. It is fine to have a piece 
of legislation, but unless there is overwhelming and compelling 
reasons for the reporting mechanisms to be adhered to and some 
enforcement powers behind it we find it can be hollow words on 
very shallow paper. At least it is a step in the right direction.
<P>
	The 1995 budget measures had some provisions to try to 
increase access to capital for small and medium size businesses. 
As everybody knows about 40 per cent of new entrepreneurs are 
women. Anybody who has been involved with public life, 
particularly as a member of Parliament, would know that women 
are doubly disadvantaged if they go to a bank or a financial 
institution looking for a loan. They are usually disadvantaged 
because it will be a small business proposal and the banks do not 
seem terribly keen on lending money for small business. They 
should be chastised and at times condemned for that. There is 
also sexism at play.  Sometimes it is systemic, not overt. Women 
do not seem to be able to access capital in the same way as men.
<P>
	More needs to be done. During the pre-election period we 
talked about establishing special programs for women 
entrepreneurs. The committee on industry has looked at it. I 
would encourage members of the committee, with all of the 
work they have on their desks, to recognize that women are 
doubly disadvantaged as entrepreneurs. That is one promise 
made in the red book during the campaign that must be fast 
tracked. We must find ways to set up women's entrepreneurial 
institutes and make sure there is real access to working capital 
for women entrepreneurs.
<P>
	Anybody who has followed the social policy review, if in 
favour of it or opposed to it, will know that one of the main 
components was to try to address women and children in poverty 
and whether or not the current vehicles, the social programs, are 
addressing the real tragedy out there of women and children 
living in poverty.
<P>
	The proposals put forward in the green book clearly addressed 
those issues. The proposals were meant to cause debate among 
the Canadian public about whether or not we had the 
wherewithal, the courage and the foresight to change social 
policy programs to ensure that some people who are missed, 
mostly single parent families headed by females, are no longer 
doomed to a life of hell and poverty for both themselves and 
their children. I hope some of the good measures in the green 
book will come to fruition and we will be able to address the real 
tragedy of women living in poverty and well over a million 
children living in poverty in Canada.
<P>
	The red book commitment on the Canada Race Relations 
Foundation was fulfilled. Some individuals in the House believe 
with the fullness of their hearts that it was a waste of money to 
establish the Race Relations Foundation. All they have to do is 
go into any minority community in Canada, any black or 
immigrant community, to find out that the sting of racism still 
exists in Canada and that unfortunately its sting is no less 
painful today than it was years ago.
<P>
	The Race Relations Foundation established by the 
government is aimed not just at minorities in Canada but at the 
triple disadvantaged in Canada who in many cases are women. 
Black women and native women are some of the most 
discriminated individuals in Canadian society. The Canadian 
Race Relations Foundation is a tangible example of the 
government's commitment to focusing government effort and 
attention to solving the real problems.
<P>
	There are other matters that I will mention quickly. One is the 
task force on prostitution. I cannot think of a more violent and 
abhorrent crime against women than prostitution. The 
government, through the Minister of Justice, has indicated that 
we are prepared to take tough and decisive action to stop this 
heinous crime against society, against women, against our 
daughters and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10595"> 10595 </A></B>
<P>
against  our grand-daughters. We are serious about it. Tough 
action will be taken either by the minister or people like me 
putting private members' bills forward in the House.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	On the firearms legislation, 50 per cent of women who are 
killed are killed in domestic disputes by firearms that are kept in 
the home. We have taken tough and decisive measures.
<P>
	In conclusion, the debate should not be only about money. It 
should be about attitude. When I look around this place and I see 
the quality of members of Parliament, and the quality of female 
members of Parliament, I know we have come a long way but we 
have yet a long way to go.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I see 
that my colleague opposite has also come up with many findings 
on the status of women. However, the measures he has described 
are mostly social in nature. They are very worthwhile measures 
but today's motion deals with the economic measures intended 
to promote women's equality.
<P>
	In this regard, I would like to ask the hon. member opposite 
what he thinks of the proposed labour code reform. I know that 
in 1993, Bloc members proposed an amendment to harmonize 
with Quebec's occupational health and safety commission the 
benefits paid to pregnant women withdrawn from work for 
precautionary reasons. I know that an internal document is 
circulating, which totally ignores the motion proposed by Bloc 
members, even though it was supported by their Liberal 
colleagues.
<P>
	Today is a day of action, a day on which we are asking the 
government to take concrete measures favouring women. In this 
matter, we see that there are two classes of female workers. 
Federal public servants who become pregnant and must be 
withdrawn from work for precautionary reasons earn less than 
their Quebec counterparts-I think they receive 60 per cent of 
their salary compared with 95 per cent in Quebec.
<P>
	Why are they not taking this into account in the proposed 
reform of precautionary withdrawal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, the simple answer is that I do 
not know why more attention was not given to that measure. I 
have to be quite honest. I am not entirely up to date on the 
Quebec legislation about which the member spoke.
<P>
	However I listened intently and I can tell the hon. member for 
Québec that I applaud her efforts to bring issues before the 
Parliament of Canada, the proper venue for such issues to be 
discussed.
<P>
	As a member who is here for his second term, let me say that 
unfortunately far too often good proposals from opposition 
members are almost treated with dismissal by others in this 
place. When we are dealing with issues of fairness and equality, 
particularly issues that affect over 50 per cent of our population, 
partisanship has to be removed. When good proposals are put 
forward the government should look at them.
<P>
	I look forward to getting more information on the matter. 
However, if it is a progressive measure which seeks to equalize 
the role of women not just in Quebec but across Canada, it would 
be the type of measure I would support regardless of the official 
position taken by my party.
<P>
	The hon. member for Québec talked about the fact that the 
debate was on economic equality. The reality is that social 
equality and economic equality are intertwined. We cannot deny 
one and expect the other to be a consequence. Clearly we have to 
move in tandem to take measures, both in legislation and by 
example as a federal government and as legislators, to ensure 
that society moves toward not just perceived but real equality 
socially as well as economically. To deny one is to ensure that 
the consequences of the second will be that there will not be the 
equality that is necessary.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Québec has only 
30 seconds left if she wishes to ask another question or make a 
comment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member 
opposite that economic reality is linked to social reality. But I 
would point out that they have cut the budgets of community 
organizations which operate in different areas and put forward 
social programs designed to help the most disadvantaged in our 
society.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I agree with the hon. member. What I would like is a concrete 
fiscal measure that will also support these community 
organizations' social initiatives.
<P>
	For the information of the hon. member opposite, an internal 
document on the proposed reform of precautionary withdrawal 
is now circulating, which does not mention the motion adopted 
by the Liberals.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
her comment. I will certainly look at that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10596"> 10596 </A></B>
<P>
	The reality is that the best equality is a job, as the member 
for Western Arctic said. Unfortunately women in our economy 
do not participate to the fullness of their potential. It is only 
when we break down those barriers that we will have true 
equality.
<P>
	I look forward to working with the member for Québec. I 
applaud her for her tenacity in raising these issues on the floor of 
the House. I am sure there are others, such as the member for 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore who has worked tirelessly on behalf of 
minority women and women in society, who would be prepared 
to work with her to ensure that these things come about.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise with considerable 
confidence to speak in rebuttal to the hon. member's motion.
<P>
	I am proud to be a member of a government and party with a 
heritage of unprecedented sensitivity and action on real and 
practical measures to promote the economic equality of women. 
I will deal with the question of our history and the economic 
reality of women.
<P>
	The strength and vitality of the women's movement in Canada 
today can be traced back to the moment of clarity and power 
experienced 25 years ago. The occasion was the 1970 landmark 
report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women.
<P>
	At that moment women in Canada realized that equality of 
opportunity had become achievable. It was not just a Liberal 
government establishing the royal commission against all odds 
in 1967. It was also the will of women to make it happen. It was 
the alacrity with which the Liberal government of 1970 moved 
to respond to the commission's recommendations that inspired 
women to redouble their efforts to advance their status.
<P>
	I think the member will agree with me that a Liberal 
government appointed Canada's first minister responsible for 
the status of women and the work that took place in 1971. A 
Liberal government established the office of the co-ordinator of 
the status of women in 1971 which has now become Status of 
Women Canada, the federal government's lead agency for 
government policy co-ordination related to women's equality. 
A Liberal government created the women's program in 1973 to 
provide financial and technical assistance to women's 
organizations and other voluntary groups working to promote 
the equality of women. The member knows the rich heritage and 
history of Liberals and their commitment to women's issues.
<P>
	With the support of the Liberal government today women 
have succeeded in making the workplace more family friendly. 
Women are obtaining the support they need to balance work and 
family responsibilities for young children, for aging parents or 
for both.
<P>
	Today with the support of the Liberal government women 
have also put issues like sexual harassment, pay equity, et 
cetera, on the workplace agenda. With the support of the Liberal 
government women are  convincing other areas in society that 
these kinds of employment issues are not just women's issues. 
They are societal issues and they belong to all of us, men and 
women.
<P>
	With the support of the Liberal government record numbers of 
women have started their own companies. In Canada today 
women operate 39 per cent of small businesses. According to the 
most recent survey undertaken by the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business women entrepreneurs are doing very 
well.
<P>
	Small and medium sized businesses are the major engine 
driving our economy, creating 85 per cent of all new jobs in 
Canada. According to my math, that makes women the major 
players in job creation in Canada today.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	What is particularly encouraging is the increasingly dominant 
role younger women are playing in the creation of new 
businesses. As <I>Le Devoir</I> noted last week, 51.4 per cent of 
Canadian business proprietors under age 25 are women. 
According to 1991 figures complied by the CFIB, this compares 
to a 1981 figure of 30.6 per cent.
<P>
	This is a good record and one that speaks highly of the 
government's support of the economic equality of women. This 
is the substance of the motion. All indications are that the 
growing prominence of women in small business will prove to 
be a major factor in our country's future growth.
<P>
	I am pleased to note that the small business sector was the 
focus of several important commitments made in the budget of 
February 27. The finance minister declared the government is 
determined to remove barriers to the success of small business. 
We are equally determined to provide practical assistance to 
help Canada's small business survive and grow. It is essential 
that small businesses have access to the financing they need in 
order to continue being our number one creator of jobs.
<P>
	To add to this the government will be working with the banks 
over the coming months to hammer out meaningful benchmarks 
for small business financing. One of the things we will be 
looking for is hard data on the success rate of women owned 
businesses so that banks can come to see that opening their doors 
and their pockets to women makes good business sense.
<P>
	The budget also announced that we are substantially reducing 
government subsidies to business. In today's economy these 
subsidies are simply not cost effective in terms of job creation, 
productivity or growth. Nobody knows that case more strongly 
than business itself.
<P>
	The government has decided to concentrate on the key 
engines of economic growth, as I mentioned, looking at the 
areas of science and technology and trade development. In fact, 
the government is working to create a policy environment that 
will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10597"> 10597 </A></B>
<P>
encourage and reward the innovation and flexibility needed to 
pursue the opportunities of the new global marketplace.
<P>
	The potential is clearly there. The government recognizes that 
the women of our country have the imagination and 
determination to fully participate in the growing world 
economy.
<P>
	It is important for the member who is speaking so eloquently 
on the gaps in the meeting of our specific and individual needs to 
note that the government and the members on this side of the 
House recognize the way in which we need to work and the 
progress we need to make in order to meet all of the 
requirements in the provision of the quality of life for women 
and their families.
<P>
	In terms of the economic question and the motion on the floor, 
this motion needs to be rebutted. The Liberal government is 
fully aware of the commitments we need to make to the 
economic situation of women.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am in agreement with my hon. 
colleague when she says that issues surrounding the status of 
women in 1995 are also societal issues. I agree with her. 
However, are there not still many women burdened with the 
responsibility of picking up their children at day care, and then 
going home to do another shift?
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if she is going to be able to get 
her colleagues to take action on day care facilities, because 
50,000 spaces a year were promised and we are short 35,000 
spaces in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Will the transfer to the provinces take place? We have reached 
3 per cent of GDP. It is time the Liberal government delivered on 
this promise, which was one of the promises in its red book.
<P>
	I would like to know if we can count on our colleague with 
respect to this issue, which is a particularly thorny one for 
women. Without day care facilities, women will not be able to 
enter the labour market if the government waits too long. There 
are 2 million day care spaces Canada wide, with a shortage of 
35,000 in Quebec.
<P>
	What we in Quebec want to see is not the enforcement of 
national standards by the federal government, but the 
implementation of transfers to the provinces so that the 
government of Quebec can better respond to a great demand 
from the women of Quebec.
<P>
	Furthermore, during the consultations on the future of 
Quebec, several women's groups asked for this assistance so 
that women can break into the labour market.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member across 
the way that in order for women to fully participate in the 
economic life of the country, it is important that we begin to 
address issues such as women as child givers, women as care 
givers and women who participate in the care of elders in a 
specific way.
<P>
	It is also important to note that we have made some 
commitments. We made a commitment to increase the number 
of child spaces when we reach a certain percentage of the GDP. 
That promise is still on the books. We have not reversed our 
position on our commitment to child care or the commitments 
we made to ensuring employment equity and the whole series of 
issues and commitments we made to women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member, who is also the Prime Minister's 
parliamentary secretary, is probably familiar with numerous 
issues, particularly those which concern the status of women. A 
document is currently circulating regarding the Labour Code 
reform.
<P>
	I remember that when the last such reform took place, in May 
of 1992 if I am not mistaken, I proposed an amendment so that 
the same conditions would apply under both the federal and 
provincial labour codes, regarding precautionary withdrawal of 
work for pregnant women. The Quebec Labour Code provides 
that women get paid 95 per cent of their salaries, compared to 60 
per cent under the federal code.
<P>
	That was a housekeeping amendment which, of course, 
reflected the notion of flexible federalism, and the Liberals, 
then in opposition, supported that proposal. Consequently, my 
question to the hon. member is: Now that the Liberals are in 
office, why is that amendment not included in the proposed 
Labour Code reform which the government will table in the next 
few weeks?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Augustine:</B> Mr. Speaker, we need the collaboration and 
co-operation of the members across the way to do a whole series 
of things. Just as the member is asking for our co-operation in 
this respect, there are certain ways in which we also should be 
asking for his collaboration as we move forward.
<P>
	The issue of the status of women is not just a Quebec issue. It 
is not just an issue outside Quebec. It is an issue for all women. 
Therefore we each need to be concerned about the status of 
women in Canada, to speak about the status of women in Canada 
and to work for the laws, regulations, policies, equity issues that 
would bring about the quality of life for all women.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
share my speaking time with the hon. member for Laurentides.
<P>
	It is always an honour and a privilege to rise in this House, and 
members should always remember that when they do, they 
represent those who elected them.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10598"> 10598 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Today, I am doing exactly that, and I am thinking more 
specifically of the 52 per cent of the residents of Shefford who 
are women.
<P>
	The federal budget for 1995 tabled by the Minister of Finance 
totally ignored the social contract between the government and 
the majority of taxpayers in Quebec and Canada. The budget 
brought down by the hon. member for Lasalle-Émard ignores 
the economic and social realities facing the middle class and the 
less well-off groups in our society.
<P>
	This budget denies women the right to a fairer and more 
equitable society. In fact, the budget is just a smoke screen to 
hide the real problems.
<P>
	Left out of the budget altogether are measures to ensure that 
women get equal pay for equal work and a better standard of 
living. Last year, the Liberals voted in favour of measures that 
would be fairer and more equitable. Today, those promises have 
evaporated.
<P>
	In fact, in the key sectors of health care, social assistance and 
post-secondary education, the Liberal government actually 
decided to make the worst, not the best but the worst of a bad 
situation. The first to suffer as a result of cuts in transfer 
payments to the provinces will be women and children.
<P>
	The federal government has offloaded its financial problems 
on the provinces and on, Quebec, without considering the 
impact these cuts will have on women.
<P>
	In addition, Ottawa has decided to launch a second attack on 
women who are senior citizens by calculating the amount of 
their old age security cheque according to the income of their 
spouses. This reduction comes in addition to the reduction in the 
age tax credit announced last year.
<P>
	I deplore the fact that the federal government has offloaded its 
problems on the provinces instead of eliminating overlap and 
dismantling tax shelters that deprive the government of 
hundreds of millions of dollars annually.
<P>
	The government's priorities are not in the right place and lack 
vision. You would think Ottawa was managed by a bunch of 
brokers looking for a good deal and speculating on the short 
term market with other people's money.
<P>
	I do not mean to criticize the profession as such, but this is not 
what we need here in Ottawa. Those who govern us should be 
responsible people who are prepared to listen to the majority of 
taxpayers who are sick and tired of being squeezed.
<P>
	Take, for instance, the Canada Assistance Plan, also known as 
CAP. Despite the provisions in the assistance plan regarding 
subsidized day care services, the shortage of adequate and 
affordable services remains a significant problem for a very 
large number of families with one or more children.
<P>
	The lack of day care spaces is a fundamental concern for low 
and middle income parents.
<P>
	This is a deep social concern, a concern which was expressed 
in the red book, this famous red book of the Liberal Party, which 
we might have thought would lead to some action plan.
<P>
	We can read on page 38 of the red book, and I quote: 
``Canadians with young families need a support system that 
enables parents to participate fully in an economic life for the 
country- Recent research by the National Council of Welfare 
indicates that the single best predictor of whether a family has 
adequate economic resources is whether it has two wage 
earners. A growing majority of Canadian families need two 
wage earners to achieve a reasonable standard of living. The 
availability of good quality child care at an affordable cost 
makes the difference between a family living at the edge of 
poverty and a family living with a moderate standard of living''.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	This is straight out of the red book. A good child care system, 
affordable for all, is an economic advantage. It allows poor 
parents to re-enter the work force instead of having to continue 
to rely on social assistance and food banks. It also creates jobs, 
especially for women, since on average one job is created for 
every five children in day care.
<P>
	Therefore, the Liberal principle of a service allowing access 
to financial independence remains a promise, it has been 
shelved, like all the nice sounding election promises which will 
be conveniently forgotten before the next election campaign.
<P>
	According to the Liberal red book, in each year following a 
year of 3 per cent economic growth, a Liberal government will 
create 50,000 new child care spaces. We have reached this rate 
of economic growth this year. Since child care which is funded 
by governments is funded 50/50 by the federal and provincial 
governments, what will become of the spaces promised by the 
Liberals, if the government cuts transfer payments to Quebec by 
$350 million?
<P>
	What will become of the 40 per cent of the costs of new child 
care spaces to be assumed by the federal government, which is 
evaluated at $120 million in 1995-96, $240 million in 1996-97, 
and $360 million in 1997-98, amounting to $720 million over 
three years? These figures come from the red book. It has been a 
long time since the red book, the Liberal bible, has been 
mentioned. What happened to all the nice Liberal promises?
<P>
	Let us now talk about social housing. As a whole, the 1995-96 
budget puts an end to any new initiative in this area. Since close 
to 17 per cent of Quebec families and 16 per cent of Canadian 
tenants spend more than 50 per cent of their income on rent, it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10599"> 10599 </A></B>
<P>
easy to understand why social housing needs are so huge and 
why offloading will have enormous long term consequences. 
Women, who  represent an important clientele, or 57 per cent of 
social housing, will be the hardest hit by these cuts.
<P>
	The 1995-96 budget also means that the 40,000 people on the 
co-op housing waiting list of the CMHC-The Canada 
Mortgage and Housing Corporation-will have to wait months, 
even years, before a unit is available. There is no longer any 
hope of building new ones.
<P>
	CMHC will close 20 branches across Canada. In Quebec, the 
Longueuil office will close while in Sept-Îles, Rimouski, 
Val-d'Or and Trois-Rivières, only one person will remain on 
duty, working at home. Successive decommitments by Ottawa 
clearly demonstrate the limitations of administrative 
agreements between Quebec and Ottawa in cases of unilateral 
withdrawal.
<P>
	Today, Quebec is caught off guard by the extent of Ottawa's 
financial pull out in the social housing sector, because it counted 
on the federal government as the major source of funds in the 
agreement. Unable to compensate for this unilateral withdrawal, 
Quebec must review its plans and cancel the construction of new 
low rent housing units that had been promised to municipalities.
<P>
	Because of the community help readily available there and the 
low cost of housing, the co-op formula was an interesting option 
for single parent families, which are headed mainly by women.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	Community help such as child care is a very influential factor 
and explains why a much greater number of single parents living 
in co-operatives are in the workforce. If we do not respond-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Unfortunately, the member's time is 
up. If there is unanimous consent, the member may continue. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I will be 
careful in my closing remarks.
<P>
	Access to affordable, quality housing is recognized as a 
pre-requisite to the fulfilment of other needs, such as education, 
health, labour force productivity and social security.
<P>
	In this period of budgetary restraint, Quebec and Canadian 
society are giving priority to the housing needs of less fortunate 
Quebecers and Canadians. These are the people who interest us, 
the less fortunate. Social housing has a particular role to play in 
meeting these needs. The federal government must continue to 
give top priority to funding social housing. By maintaining this 
program as a priority today, we will avoid higher costs in other 
areas down the road.
<P>
	The government has no right to sacrifice so many families, so 
many women and so many years of hard work in an attempt to 
maintain harmony in a society that prides itself on being just and 
fair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, how can we ever 
please our Bloc Quebecois colleagues? One day, they want 
certain federal responsibilities to be delegated to the provinces 
and, the next thing you know, they say these responsibilities 
should remain with the federal government.
<P>
	Housing is obviously an area of provincial responsibility. But 
if my hon. colleague is suggesting that the federal government 
should assume more responsibilities than the provinces, I am 
prepared to join him in making representations because I agree 
with him that the federal government often does a better job than 
the provinces in certain areas.
<P>
	The hon. member mentioned day care. I want to point out to 
him that, last spring, the federal government announced the 
establishment of a task force on the tax treatment of child 
support. As my hon. colleague knows, this task force was 
presided by the secretary of State responsible for women's 
issues. The task force held public hearings and travelled across 
the country to seek the opinion of the provincial and territorial 
governments.
<P>
	I am sure that, if my hon. colleague gives this government just 
a little more time, he will see that we can put in place legislation 
that will meet this need. Just bear with us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, I will say to 
my colleague that our top priority in coming to Ottawa was to 
defend Quebecers' interests. That is what we are doing. Second, 
we hope to set up our own country. Unfortunately, the hon. 
member did not understand this.
<P>
	In response to his question, I remember last year's debate on 
child poverty. However, it must be understood that if there are 
poor children, it is because there are also poor parents. Children 
are not living in poverty by themselves. The poorest members of 
our society are women, and that is what I am saying today.
<P>
	They are often single parents with sole responsibility for 
raising their children. As you know, poor children cannot do 
well in school. If they do not have what they need at home, they 
cannot succeed and hope to find a way out. It is important to 
keep this in mind.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, when the Liberals were on this 
side of the House, they delivered some great speeches. Now that 
they have crossed the floor-normally, a party, once elected to 
govern, has a tendency to sit pat-they have not been sitting pat, 
they have been lying down on the job. What they should do first 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10600"> 10600 </A></B>
<P>
is look at their social policy. As we remember, under Trudeau, 
they spoke of a just society, an extraordinary  society. I think 
that today's Liberals put all that aside and are now worse than 
the Tories.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, once 
again, it is with great pride that I rise during an opposition day 
totally dedicated to the situation of women, and more 
specifically their economic equality.
<P>
	For the second consecutive year, the Bloc Quebecois, through 
the hon. member for Québec, tables a motion dealing 
exclusively with the situation of women. Special days like this 
one are essential, since they provide us with an opportunity to 
take a look at our place in society and, hopefully, further our 
cause.
<P>
	Today's motion reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for its insensitivity and its inaction 
regarding the adoption of concrete measures to promote the economic equality of 
women in federal areas of jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	First, I want to denounce a recent decision made by the 
Liberals which clearly shows the relevancy of our motion. I am 
referring to the merging, as of April 1st, of three women 
organizations. Indeed, the Secretary of State for the Status of 
Women announced that she will lump together the Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women, the womens' 
programs of the Department of Human Resources Development, 
as well as Status of Women Canada.
<P>
	That announcement made by a woman is very disappointing. 
It clearly shows a lack of seriousness and respect for women. 
The secretary of state should be ashamed and go into hiding for 
making that decision.
<P>
	By grouping these services under Status of Women Canada, 
the Liberal government abolishes the Canadian Advisory 
Council on the Status of Women. This is yet another centralizing 
measure of the Liberals, who do not know any better.
<P>
	By merging the CACSW, the government is depriving women 
of an independent organization which conducted research and 
promoted education for women, not for the government. The 
independence of the council was essential to allow it to fulfill its 
mandate. The council could exert pressure on the government. It 
could point a finger and denounce the government's inaction 
regarding the situation of women.
<P>
	As of April 1st, this so-called Liberal government will have 
total control over that organization. Women will be gagged.
<P>
	April 1 will be a sad day for women. I trust that Liberal 
women will stand up in turn to denounce this decision. 
Solidarity among women is much more crucial than solidarity at 
a political party level.
<P>
	I will not say more about this anti-women decision.
<P>
	As for unemployment, according to the February 1995 
statistics, 642,000 women were unemployed in Canada, or 9.5 
per cent. In Quebec, the rate was up to 11.6 per cent, or 187,000 
women. There were also 280,082 women on welfare in Quebec.
<P>
	What is the federal government doing to lower the 
unemployment rate among women? Nothing. It sits tight and 
puts its trust in the economic recovery. It has adopted a laissez 
faire strategy.
<P>
	Where are the jobs that Liberals kept promising? Where are 
all the training and upgrading programs for women? Where are 
the services promoting women's presence in the labour market? 
None of these promises have been kept. The only measure touted 
by Liberals as contributing significantly to job creation is the 
infrastructure program which was to create 45,000 temporary 
jobs over a three year period.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The Liberals bragged about this so-called beneficial 
program. They said it would help men and women get back to 
work.
<P>
	The results have been rather disappointing. Seasonal 
temporary jobs. This program only provided short-term jobs to 
people already in the labour force and did nothing to create new 
jobs for the unemployed.
<P>
	This program completely ignored women on unemployment. 
Indeed, women's groups had asked the minister concerned to 
establish certain rules that would allow women to have access to 
some of these mostly non-traditional jobs.
<P>
	To my knowledge, the minister did not grant what seemed to 
be a legitimate request.
<P>
	Despite all the promises made by the Liberals, we still have 
women on unemployment, women who work for a while on 
some project or program, then go back on unemployment and 
end up on welfare. These women are caught in this vicious circle 
and will never be able to get out of this difficult situation for 
good.
<P>
	The federal government is not helping women, worse, I really 
think it is harming them. The federal employment, training, 
upgrading and unemployment programs are not up-to-date, 
they are not flexible nor creative. The programs, services and 
conditions have been the same for years now, even though the 
labour market is constantly changing.
<P>
	The results of this rigid system are terribly disappointing. 
Women cannot meet the needs of the labour market rapidly and 
effectively.
<P>
	I would like to give you a very concrete example which 
demonstrates how inefficient the federal system is. A few 
months ago, I met in my riding office a woman who is a single 
parent living on a meagre $170 a week unemployment insurance 
benefit.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10601"> 10601 </A></B>
<P>
	To get out of this difficult situation, she wanted to attend 
classes in bureautics offered by her regional school board. This 
much vaunted program, which offered interesting work 
prospects, lasted 18 months. The federal government does not 
pay for 18-month courses. In fact, it only recognizes programs 
where students graduate after 12 months.
<P>
	As a result, this woman continued to receive her meagre 
benefits till the end.
<P>
	Once her benefits had expired, she enroled in a program 
entitled ``Introduction to non-traditional trades''. Thirteen 
women registered for this 14-week training course leading to a 
job. According to the information I have gathered so far-since 
this program is on now-this program clearly does not work.
<P>
	Non-traditional trades are not that common and job 
opportunities in these areas are practically non-existent in a 
tourist area like mine.
<P>
	Then, why is the federal government offering this program? 
Why does it spend money in vain? Could it not carry out some 
studies to see if the labour market in my region is accessible to 
these women and if job opportunities are really there? If not, 
what good does it do to direct these women towards this training 
program?
<P>
	Unfortunately, it seems this program is simply offered for the 
fun of it.
<P>
	And these women can see after a few weeks that they are 
involved in something that leads nowhere. And yet, they were 
ready to invest their efforts and energies in this program to see 
the light at the end of the tunnel, that is, to find a job.
<P>
	Instead, they are offered a strangely structured program 
where they are told about self-esteem and about the need to take 
their future in their own hands, to go for it. They are almost 
handed a mirror and told: ``Look, you are the only one to blame 
if you do not work. So, do something about it!''
<P>
	These women do not want that kind of therapy. They want 
something concrete, something real. They want to learn 
something that will help them find a job.
<P>
	As I see there is only one minute left, I will conclude rather 
quickly.
<P>
	Women are worth as much as men. Our society, our lifestyles 
and our values were such that women were not appreciated for 
their true worth. It is now time to correct this, and fast.
<P>
	In light of some of its actions, it is clear that the Liberal 
government is not ready to take big steps in that direction. In 
spite of all the promises that were made to women in several 
areas, the federal government is very hard on women. The 
announced reform in the unemployment insurance program and 
old age pension does not augur well.
<P>
	Thus, I encourage all the women in Quebec to say no to an 
increasingly threatening federal system.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member opposite has made some remarks that I find very 
curious coming from her.
<P>
	Firstly, she talks about solidarity and she belongs to a party 
that does not promote solidarity among all Canadians, including 
women. Secondly, with regard to solidarity, we have, on this 
side of the House, all the women who represent the government 
who have proven that they are in favour of solidarity. For 
example, on March 8 of last year, we opened a debate to all 
women on both sides of the House.
<P>
	Now, I would like to ask a question of the hon. member. She 
gave the example of a woman who had come to her office 
complaining that she did not have access to government 
programs. Does the member not know that our budget provides 
for transfers to the provinces so that they can assume 
responsibility for these programs? They will be the ones who 
will be delivering these programs. That is what the member's 
party asked for and that is what we are doing. We both know that 
when women achieve economic equality, they will have equality 
in all areas. My question to the hon. member is this: Does she 
agree with me with regard to transfers?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, the government says that it will 
transfer more powers to the provinces so that we can have our 
own programs tailored to our particular needs, but it should also 
consider giving us the money that we need to deliver these 
programs.
<P>
	The federal government is getting ready to transfer to the 
provinces powers or, rather, responsibilities that we cannot 
afford to exercise. I think it is a very serious problem that we 
will have to face in the coming years. Imagine! At least Quebec 
has a good structure, but in some other provinces, particularly 
the smaller ones, it will be a big problem.
<P>
	Secondly, when the hon. member talks about solidarity and 
says that the government cannot count on the Bloc Quebecois, I 
will remind her that, last year, we introduced a bill on 
unemployment insurance for women. I do not know if the 
member remembers that, but we asked women in this House to 
show some solidarity with regard to this bill so that women who 
work with their husbands would not be penalized under the 
unemployment insurance program. The member's party voted 
against our bill that would have been beneficial to women. We 
called for solidarity among women. I will tell you one thing: as 
long as this solidarity among women does not exist, regardless 
of their political affiliation-and it certainly does not exist in 
this House at this moment-women will never get anywhere. 
Yet, we account for 52 per cent of the population. The hon. 
member has nothing to teach me and I think it is time she got her 
act together. When she sees a bill like the one we have 
introduced in this House, she should think twice before voting 
against it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10602"> 10602 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am working for solidarity 
among all Canadians and, on this side of the House, we have 
shown that we encourage women to run for elections and get 
elected. Look at the number of women in the two opposition 
parties.
<P>
	But I have a question to ask. We talk about solidarity with 
regard to legislation. The government recently introduced Bill 
C-64, an Act respecting employment equity. We asked for the 
support of the members opposite. I believe that this bill will give 
women new opportunities to achieve economic equality. Why 
did the other parties refuse us their support?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that the hon. member is 
wrong. I could show her a bill that was exclusively for women. 
The bill she referred to is not legislation for women, it is very 
wide in scope. We will not support a bill just because the hon. 
member says to.
<P>
	The bill we talked about dealt exclusively with protecting and 
helping women. So, when she talks about solidarity, I am sorry, 
but I beg to differ. She also mentioned her political party, where 
there is a fair number of women, a party that encouraged women. 
I can say that in the Bloc Québécois, we as women had to fight 
on the same terms as men and I am very proud of having been 
elected here, not because I was chosen by my leader, but because 
I fought and won in a nomination convention, like everybody 
else.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roger Simmons (Burin-St. George's, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank my friend the hon. 
member for Québec for raising an issue that is both important 
and relevant. Her motion reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House denounce the government for its insensitivity and its inaction 
regarding the adoption of concrete measures to promote the economic equality 
in federal areas of jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
That assessment does not seem accurate to me.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion gives us an opportunity, I say to my friend from 
Frontenac, to discuss an important issue but the wording of the 
motion is a bit dishonest. To put it more bluntly, it is just not 
true. During the next few minutes let us examine the record, 
because it is not true. I am very proud to be here because I take 
real pride in the government's record in promoting social justice 
and economic parity for the women of this country.
<P>
	I am encouraged that the member would put forward the 
motion on the issue of women's economic equality because what 
could be more important to Canada than the well-being of more 
than half its population? It is only when women and our families 
thrive that our country will be truly renewed.
<P>
	The motion before us raises an important question. What has 
been the track record of this government on issues that affect the 
economic status of women? The short answer is that this 
government has done a great deal in a relatively short time. The 
government made commitments in the election campaign and 
the government is living up to those commitments. Before we 
get on to specific ways in which the government has honoured 
its commitment, let us look at the context for all of this.
<P>
	It has become a truism that the best social program is a job. 
That point has been made by people from both the right and the 
left of the political spectrum. Well over 400,000 people can say 
they have taken part in the greatest social program of all since 
this government took office in October 1993. There is evidence 
that record will continue strongly. These are predominantly 
good, full time jobs. Women are claiming their full share of this 
growth. At the same time, the government is aware that 
economic growth by itself is not enough.
<P>
	Women still remain clustered in traditionally female 
occupations such as teaching and nursing, clerical, sales and 
service work. If all the government did was to rely on the market 
as some in this House would prefer to do, we would see only a 
glacial, painfully slow change in the labour situation as it relates 
to women.
<P>
	This government can do better. We must do better to 
recognize as the government does the continuing need to help 
women move into new growth areas. It recognizes that its own 
programs and services can help bring us closer to that goal.
<P>
	The federal side has a number of innovative projects aimed 
specifically at addressing the needs of women. Since it is the 
hon. member for the riding of Quebec whose motion we are 
discussing, let me talk briefly about a couple of projects for 
women that are under way in her own province of Quebec.
<P>
	Since last October, Rimouski has been home to an 
entrepreneurial training project. Women of all ages with 
business creation projects have been receiving the skills they 
need to create successful small businesses. The project has 
focused on the needs of women without sources of income.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	What is equally important is the team that has pulled this 
project together. The local Canada employment centre, the 
CEGEP de Rimouski and the group Ficelles, whose purpose is to 
ensure women's access to work, have all co-operated to make 
this dream a reality. It is consistent with our interest in 
encouraging self-employment as the way toward economic 
self-sufficiency.
<P>
	In Montreal there have been a couple of projects. In one, 
women who are on unemployment have been receiving modern 
technological training and support to help them move back into 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10603"> 10603 </A></B>
<P>
the workforce and into more  highly skilled jobs. In the other, 
recent female immigrants have been trained as fibreglass mill 
operators.
<P>
	These are examples in one province. There are many more in 
that province and there are many more all across the country. 
Our new programs for youth share this commitment to the needs 
of women. Youth Service Canada has been a real success story. 
In the lead site projects, the ones that tested the concepts beyond 
Youth Service Canada, 54 per cent of the participants are 
female.
<P>
	Some projects were focused on issues of particular interest to 
women. For example, the Regina family service bureau ran a 
project that helped 10 young single mothers.
<P>
	Employment programs and services are only one element of 
our work for women. Unemployment insurance is a program that 
continues to play an important role as we move toward a more 
active labour market policy. There are some elements of UI such 
as maternity and parental benefits that respond to the labour 
market reality faced by female workers.
<P>
	To my friend from Yorkton-Melville and my friend from 
Edmonton Southwest, despite their professed beliefs it is 
important we have programs that help women respond to the 
labour market reality, programs such as maternity and parental 
benefits.
<P>
	We do not have to go far back in time to find how this program 
has been adapted to the needs of women. We need only go back 
one year to 1994. The government decided to scale back UI 
benefits. However, in doing so it took into account the situation 
of people on low incomes. Almost 60 per cent of single parent 
families with children under 18 live on low incomes. Far too 
many are single mothers struggling to make ends meet.
<P>
	It is that situation that caused the government to create the 
special 60 per cent dependency benefit rate for people who are 
supporting dependents on the basis of low income. This year 
people who earn an average $408 a week or less and who's 
spouses get the child tax benefit or who support a dependent are 
eligible for this additional UI support. That provision makes a 
real difference for a single mother. Since the implementation of 
the dependency benefit rate over 192,000 claimants have 
qualified. The great majority, 148,000, were women.
<P>
	The government recognizes the labour market needs of 
women extend well beyond the traditional programs and 
services, no matter how sensitive these services and programs. 
The National Association of Women and the Law stated in its 
appearance before the Standing Committee on Human resources 
Development a year ago: ``We recognize the growing 
importance of women in the labour force, but fail to recognize 
that women have children and women are primarily responsible 
for their care''.
<P>
	Child care is important. It was a concern of ours during the 
1993 campaign. It is a need that we are addressing on three 
separate fronts.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	The government is moving ahead on its First Nations and Inuit 
child care initiative. The goal is to increase the level of services 
in those communities. There is so much more. A second front is 
a research and development component to give us more 
information in this critical area of child care.
<P>
	I have pages of programs the government is working on. We 
are not there yet. We are working at it and I believe when we get 
there the women of this country and therefore this country as a 
whole will be the better and the richer for it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
distinguished colleague from Burin-St. George's is an 
outstanding parliamentarian, and he regularly demonstrates his 
skills when he takes the floor.
<P>
	The thing I disapprove of is that his party and, to a certain 
extent, the hon. member for Burin-St. George's himself, talk 
out of both sides of their mouth. I would like to give an example, 
that of the Canada Labour Code reform and precautionary 
withdrawal from work.
<P>
	I do not need to remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the family unit 
is the most valuable asset of any country. In May 1994, the Bloc 
Quebecois tabled a motion supported by the governing party, the 
Liberal Party of Canada, in order to raise the compensation for 
pregnant women to the 95 per cent level provided by the Quebec 
CSST. Right now, it stands at 60 per cent.
<P>
	A discussion paper on the Canada Labour Code reform is 
being circulated at this time, and the Liberal Party of Canada did 
not include that motion, which it supported in May 1994, to give 
substantial assistance to pregnant women who must ask for 
precautionary withdrawal from work in order to carry their 
pregnancy to term and protect their unborn baby.
<P>
	Like the rest of us, the hon. member for Burin-St. George's 
is certainly aware of the importance of the family unit, that is a 
wife, husband and children-the complet unit. The children will 
be the work force of tomorrow and will pay for our pensions. 
That natural asset of our country is now declining.
<P>
	We moved a motion that the hon. member's party supported, 
but what we see and hear in the House today is just a lack of 
courage, and double talk, Mr. Speaker. Unfortunately, the hon. 
member for Burin-St. George's is the one who will have to 
clarify his party's position. I hope he will set the record straight, 
because this is an important motion on the equality of women.

	<B>Mr. Simmons:</B> Mr. Speaker, my French is so rusty these days 
that I will do the wise thing and talk to him in a language that I 
know a bit about. I will make a promise to him that I will get 
back to my long neglected French.
<P>
	I thank him for his kind comments about my speech. I share 
very much his views on the importance of the family unit. I 
thought he articulated it very eloquently a moment ago and I 
salute him for that.
<P>
	As to the motion he was talking about, I plead ignorance. I do 
not remember the details of it and I will not pretend that I do. He 
put his finger, and rightly so, on one of the many areas in which 
this government needs to move.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	I have always been appalled that remuneration has been on the 
basis of sex; that females have been getting lower wages for 
performing the same services. There are thousands of examples 
of that. I have been appalled that people are paid differently 
because they live in one region versus another. Two wrongs do 
not make a right. These disparities have to be corrected.
<P>
	We are on the matter of women's issues today. I do not like the 
term. They are all our issues, but I know what is meant by the 
term.
<P>
	The member flagged an issue that I pursue and will continue 
to pursue. The matter of the disparity of wages is untenable and 
we have to move to correct it as soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jane Stewart (Brant, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, while I do not 
appreciate or accept the tenor of the motion presented for debate 
by the hon. member for Quebec, I recognize and thank her for 
giving us the opportunity to talk about such an important aspect 
as the quality of the connection that Canadian women have to the 
social and economic infrastructure of Canadian society.
<P>
	It is a critical topic. As one of the 50 some women elected to 
the House it is incumbent on me to do whatever I can to 
encourage our governments and our legislature to understand 
where that connection is and make it better.
<P>
	In her motion the hon. member focuses specifically on the 
economic connection, the economic side of the connection that 
we as women have to Canadian society. We have to speak about 
both the economic and social support that we as women need if 
we are to participate fully and completely in Canadian society 
and offer a bettering of the society through skills, abilities and 
qualities we bring as women.
<P>
	In understanding the connection between social and economic 
development I turn to September of last year when I had the 
opportunity as a member of the parliamentary delegation to the 
United Nations conference on population and development to 
understand quite fully the impact development has on 
population.
<P>
	We did a lot of very good work at the conferences that were 
the preliminary to those debates in Cairo to encourage an 
understanding of the impact development has on population 
management, more specifically to understand that when we talk 
about development we do and must talk about both social and 
economic development.
<P>
	We played a very significant role in helping the world 
understand that it is the strong connections that women must 
have to both the social and economic supports that exist in a 
society that will in turn improve the development and the 
productivity of a nation and then in turn enhance and help 
manage population control.
<P>
	We were essentially talking about development in developing 
nations. As I worked with and talked to colleagues from around 
the world I realized this debate is still going on in all developed 
nations. Canada is at a different level because of the hard and 
dedicated work of many Canadian women. When we think of the 
women who work so hard to get us recognized as persons not so 
very long ago, they helped move us to the position we are in now.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	I think of some of my friends. Doris Anderson worked outside 
the government sector with non-governmental organizations 
and as a publisher of a well-known women's magazine. I think 
of the work she has done. I think of Lucie Pépin, a friend and 
colleague, a former member of Parliament who has worked so 
hard on behalf of women's issues. All these women have 
brought us, as a developed nation, to a point that is different 
from those of the developing nations.
<P>
	The conversations we had in Cairo focused on the need for 
women to commit, with development on the social side, to very 
basic things when it comes to health: access to tetanus, polio and 
tuberculosis cures and shots, access to clean water. Basic health 
measures are what they need.
<P>
	When we were talking about education we were talking about 
access to primary school education. When we were talking about 
access to economic support we were talking about the basic 
notion that it was okay for women to work outside the confines 
of the defined home as we know it.
<P>
	For us in the developed nation of Canada, we are talking about 
things of a different sort at a different level. It is not so much 
basic health issues but issues of research for women and the 
impact of breast cancer and the impact of heart disease.
<P>
	When we are talking about education we are encouraging our 
young women to complete high school and post-secondary 
education. When we are thinking about other social aspects such 
as safety and comfort, not only in our streets but in our own 
homes, we are having to understand family violence and to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10605"> 10605 </A></B>
<P>
accept that it is not in any way, shape or form something that we 
want to be part of our society.
<P>
	When we think specifically about our connections with the 
economic levers we are talking about women having access to 
financial supports. The government is looking at these things 
and working on them all. For the Bloc Quebecois to say that we 
are not is really a falsehood.
<P>
	When we go back and think about safety and the need for 
women to have confidence they are supported in our society, we 
look at the measures the Minister of Justice has undertaken. Just 
recently he tabled a bill that will no longer allow drunkenness to 
be a defence, particularly in cases of rape. We will see tabled 
soon I am sure, considering the importance of support payments 
to single parents, most often women, some changes in that 
regard and those will be tabled in the near future.
<P>
	Today, as we debate Bill C-41 in committee, I will be tabling 
an amendment to the bill that will ask, under the section where 
we are discussing restitution, that the courts turn their head to 
the loss of income and support that can occur in cases of family 
violence. It should recognize that restitution should be paid to 
women who have to leave their homes as a result of family 
violence and perhaps incur costs related to transportation, 
alternate forms of housing and day care, drug and dental 
requirements. I hope that members of the Bloc on the committee 
will support me on that amendment.
<P>
	These are things the government is doing to make sure that 
Canadian women are connected and supported on the social 
side.
<P>
	I know the Minister of Health is working very hard and 
diligently and has implemented a fresh start program for 
aboriginal communities which is very important.
<P>
	When we think about education, by and large a provincial 
jurisdiction, as individual members of Parliament, women in 
particular, we have a strong role to play in making sure that our 
young women do and are encouraged to carry on to high school, 
college and university and to set their sights as far ahead of 
themselves as they possibly can so they do not get stuck in 
female ghettos, in typically female occupations.
<P>
	One of the most important parts of my job is to meet with 
young people in my community, in the public schools and high 
schools, and talk to them about what a woman can be in our 
country.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	Very recently I attended the Daughters of Invention, where 
grade seven girls came together and spent a couple of days 
talking about science and research. As we were discussing role 
models and women, I asked them: ``Back in 1867 when 
Confederation was discussed, do you think your grandmothers 
would have voted for Canada or against Confederation?'' They 
put their hands up, some yes and some no. I said: ``Do you know 
what girls? Your grandmothers could not vote back then. They 
were not even considered persons''. There was an embarrassing 
ah-ha. They did not realize that.
<P>
	It was at that point I realized that my job as a member of 
Parliament is to make sure that optimism, I suppose to a certain 
extent that naivete, cannot continue, that they know that as 
females there are restrictions on them but that they can 
participate fully and equitably in our society.
<P>
	When it comes to the economic side, there are many things we 
have to do. I can only say how strongly I support the 
employment equity legislation that encourages Canadian 
businesses to recognize the importance of having a broad mix of 
people in their organizations. We are not talking about quotas. 
We are talking about recognizing people for the skills and 
abilities they have and that they bring to an environment. It is 
legislation we are improving and that I strongly support.
<P>
	With that, I see that my time has gone. There are so many 
things we can talk about. Again I thank the hon. member for 
giving us the opportunity to debate and share our ideas in this 
regard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask my hon. colleague, who probably 
knows, whether there is a different treatment for pregnant 
women in a situation of precautionary withdrawal of work.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois had proposed an amendment at the time 
of the last Labour Code revision in 1992 to authorize the federal 
government to make administrative agreements with any 
province that had a system providing better conditions than 
those provided for for women in the Canada Labour Code, in 
cases of precautionary withdrawal of work.
<P>
	The Liberal Party, then in the opposition, had supported the 
amendment put forward by the Bloc. Now, we are about to revise 
the Labour Code. There is a paper from the Department of 
Labour circulating, but there is no provision in that paper for 
administrative agreements between the federal government and 
any province. That is what the amendment was all about; we 
were not referring to Quebec but to any province whatsoever, 
and those administrative agreements were along the lines of 
flexible federalism, I would imagine.
<P>
	I would like to know if the hon. member will undertake to ask 
her government to include in the legislation provisions dealing 
with precautionary withdrawal of pregnant women in order to 
enable the federal government to make administrative 
agreements with any province that has better conditions than 
those provided for in the Canada Labour Code, since at least in 
the case of Quebec they are not as good as those provided for in 
the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="10606"> 10606 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec Labour Code. Is she agreeable to such a request and will 
she approach her government's labour minister about that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not completely 
familiar with the amendment to which the hon. member is 
referring. I will apprise myself of it.
<P>
	I would agree and say that we have not come to the point 
where the salaries paid to women in the workplace are equal to 
those to men. That is something we are always conscious of, 
working toward and committed to.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a question for my colleague. I saw her applaud the 
announcement made yesterday by the Secretary of State for the 
Status of Women regarding the elimination of the Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member how civil servants can ensure 
the transparency which, I think, the Council now provides. How 
can she guarantee that civil servants will implement without any 
bias the different policies which will be put forward? How, in 
fact, can the department act as both judge and jury? I would like 
her to explain this because it seemed to delight her yesterday.
<P>
<B>(1355 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know a number of the 
women who for many years have participated on the Advisory 
Council for the Status of Women and say that we have 
appreciated the work they have done over the last number of 
years.
<P>
	I believe that the announcement made by the minister was a 
good one. It essentially brings together disparate sectors that 
have been focusing on improving the status of women in the 
country in a consolidated effort. In a consolidated way we will 
be able to make significant progress in effort and on behalf of 
women with her announcement.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am happy to speak today to the motion introduced by my hon. 
colleague from Quebec. I commend her for introducing into the 
House a good discussion on the whole issue of equality. It is an 
issue that has a lot of interest in the country, one that a lot of 
people are concerned about.
<P>
	One of the lessons of history is that personal struggle and 
achievement go hand in hand. In fact, I know that is true for 
many of us here. Sometimes the Canadian public feels that 
members of the House do not know what personal struggle is 
about. I know from speaking to many of my colleagues, and 
from personal experience, that we do have personal histories of 
struggle and achievement.
<P>
	It is important for many of us to realize that these issues are 
not just something to be debated in the House, but they are issues 
which all of humankind have struggled with for many years.
<P>
	I would like to outline to my colleagues some of my personal 
background in this area. I am the oldest of seven children. My 
parents were not well off, I think poor would probably be an 
accurate word. If I wanted money I always had to earn it. I have 
worked since I was very young in the summers and weekends to 
have the money I wanted.
<P>
	The day I left home when I was 18, my mother came home 
with my youngest brother and so the family kind of went on even 
though I was going on with my life. My parents were not able to 
help me with my education. I put myself through two university 
degrees. I was also widowed in my thirties. My husband died 
very suddenly, leaving me a single parent and sole support of the 
family.
<P>
	I became a professional person, a lawyer, before there was any 
affirmative action and before there were any nice government 
programs to help women achieve equality. Many people who I 
know are very proud and very happy to have been able to make 
the achievements in their life on their own merit.
<P>
	The subject of this debate today is how we can best achieve 
the kind of results we want from our life-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member, of course, will know that 
immediately following question period, we will return to debate 
and she will be given the floor.
<P>
	It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the House 
will now proceed to Statements by Members, pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
taxpayers in Quebec and Canada have lost confidence in the 
Canadian tax system. The underground economy is spreading. 
Tax accounts outstanding exceed $6 billion, and in the case of 
the GST, $1.3 billion.
<P>
	Furthermore, the tax system is full of holes. Wealthy 
taxpayers and large corporations can afford to pay tax experts 
for advice on how to take advantage of tax loopholes. For 
instance, they can take advantage of the fact that Canada has 
signed at least 16 tax treaties with countries considered to be tax 
havens. Every year, ten of thousands of profitable businesses 
pay no taxes at all. Meanwhile, the Minister of Finance is letting 
individuals pay 65 per cent of the tax increases in his last 
budget, while family trusts will have to wait until 1999.
<P>
	In spite of all this, the Minister of Finance still refuses to 
proceed with a complete overhaul of the tax system that would 
eliminate fiscal inequities.

	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in 1991 Mount Allison University in Sackville, 
New Brunswick was in a financial mess. It had a deficit of $2.5 
million and a debt of $10 million. Like the federal government it 
desperately needed to get its financial house in order. The 
current president of the university, Ian Newbould, was recently 
quoted in <I>Maclean's</I> magazine as saying: ``If we were a 
corporation we would have been in receivership''.
<P>
	In over three years that university has eliminated its debt and 
created a surplus of $13 million. Clearly the goal of the 
university president was not to achieve a smaller deficit. 
Instead, satisfaction would only come with no deficit and zero 
debt. The goal was achieved through responsible control.
<P>
	The finance minister stood in this House and expected praise 
for a deficit prediction of $25 billion. Some provinces, and 
universities such as Mount Allison, have become the national 
standard of fiscal responsibility. The minister needs to take a 
hard look at how the real world manages its finances and reflect 
on how he failed to measure up to the Canadian standard.

	<B>Mrs. Marlene Cowling (Dauphin-Swan River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, farming is not a nine to five business. It involves early 
mornings, late nights and weekends, which most child care 
operations do not accommodate. As a result parents are forced to 
leave their children alone or take them along when they work 
with heavy machinery or livestock.
<P>
	For every six deaths resulting from farm accidents, one of 
those victims is a child. Fifteen per cent of those hospitalized as 
a result of farm accidents are children under 16 years of age.

it costs to train a regular soldier-no steps have been taken to 
stop this wasteful spending.
<P>
	In fact, the Canadian Reserve whose training is ineffective 
and inadequate, is the most expensive in the world after the one 
in Switzerland, which has no army. It will cost us a billion 
dollars again this year.

	Ironically, the government decided to quietly get rid of the

<P>
	Last Sunday, Quesnel RCMP arrested a 19-year old man who, 
according to witnesses, dragged an elderly woman into his hotel 
room, held a knife to her throat and brutally raped her. When the 
woman's husband entered the scene, the rapist chased him down

that justice would be served.

this rapist was allowed back into the community on a petty

	The Treasury Board document points out this additional

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUEBECSOVEREIGNTY">QUEBEC SOVEREIGNTY</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday at a forum in Toronto hosted by the C.D. Howe 
Institute and attended by the chairman of Quebec's No 
committee, Michel Bélanger, one of the Prime Minister's 
constitutional advisors, Stéphane Dion, said that the worse the 
economic situation gets, the more Quebecers will change their 
minds and reject sovereignty.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. How can the Prime 
Minister let one of his constitutional advisors, namely Stéphane 
Dion, say that the more it hurts, the less support there will be for 
sovereignty?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mr. Dion is not a constitutional advisor. Furthermore, 
as everyone knows, I do not spend a lot of time discussing the 
constitution these days. I am trying to address the economic 
problems in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	I got elected by telling people that I did not want to talk about 
the constitution. I certainly do not have a constitutional advisor; 
I do not want to talk about it. I read in the newspaper that he 
wants to give the Privy Council advice on other things. 
Personally, I hope that the question will be asked clearly and 
very soon so that we can stop talking about this and deal with the 
real problems affecting the population.
<P>
	I read this article that speculates on what I should do if the Yes 
side wins in Quebec. We do not even know when the referendum 
will be held or what the question will be. I am confident that they 
will lose, so I will not waste my time talking about this.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
surprising, to say the least, that the Prime Minister, who claims 
not to be interested in constitutional issues, allocated an 
additional $7 million or so to his own office so it could set up an 
operational unit to talk about the constitution during the Quebec 
referendum.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> As a preamble to my second question, I will 
simply remind him that Stéphane Dion is still under contract to 
his office until March 31. I hope that he at least knows what is 
going on in his own office.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister reconcile the comments made by 
his advisor, Stéphane Dion, with his own statement that he 
would respect Quebecers' democratic decision on their political 
future?

<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the people in my office do not talk about the 
constitution but about how to prevent separation. It is not the 
same thing. And, in order to prevent separation, all we are 
asking the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois is to finally 
make a decision and ask the population a clear question: Do you 
want to separate from Canada? And Quebecers will say No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the Prime Minister refuses to dissociate himself from Mr. 
Dion's comments, I must conclude that he endorses them.
<P>
	I ask the following: Since he refuses to publicly dissociate 
himself from Stéphane Dion's comments, are we to understand 
that the Prime Minister's referendum strategy has gone from 
scaring Quebecers into saying No in 1980 to hurting them into 
saying No in 1995?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on the contrary, what we are doing is telling Quebecers 
that, with a very good federal government, they will stay in 
Canada. That is why we tabled, for example, a budget that was 
very well received by Quebecers. We hope that the Quebec 
government will stop talking about separation and committees, 
deal with Quebecers' real problems such as economic problems 
and job creation, and bring down a budget which addresses 
Quebecers' real problems, as a government must do.

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	The official opposition questioned the heritage minister on 
several occasions to find out how much will actually be cut from 
the CBC's budget over the next three years. Only two weeks ago, 
the minister was still denying that any decisions had been made 
concerning the corporation's financing.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage reconcile his 
statement with what the Vice-President of Radio-Canada 
television, Michèle Fortin, said yesterday when she announced 
that 750 positions would have to be slashed in the CBC's French 
network to accommodate the cuts totalling $350 million over 
three years, imposed by the heritage minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I checked the information the hon. member 
is referring to. Radio-Canada, my source, confirmed that no 
cuts were announced. I assume this means no staff cuts or 
layoffs have been decided. It is only natural for Ms. Fortin to 
share her concerns with union reps when she meets with them, 
but no layoffs have been announced by Radio-Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my 
philosophy professor used to say when he got a flimsy answer 
like this to a sensible and pertinent question: ``Swine have no 
appreciation for pearls''.
<P>
	My second question-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My hon. colleagues, we have all had good 
professors in our school days, but I do not think they should be 
quoted so literally in this place. I would ask the hon. member to 
please withdraw his last sentence at least.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will gladly comply with your 
request and withdraw my statement.
<P>
	My second question is for the same minister. How can he 
explain the scope of the alleged cuts to the CBC's French 
network, when it is so successful that its viewing shares can be 
as much as three times larger than those of the English network? 
Is it the minister's new cultural policy to penalize those who 
succeed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I gather that our colleague did not like my 
answer. I am just stating the facts, as provided and confirmed by 
Radio-Canada, but he refuses to hear the truth. I too had good 
masters and good professors. My grandfather, who was born in 
Sainte-Flore, Quebec, used to say: ``When you let the ewe out of 
the barn, it comes and relieves itself on your doorstep''.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh!
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Now that we have heard quotes from

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last night in Saskatoon the Prime Minister made 
several inconsistent statements concerning the national health 
system.
<P>
	He said the government would maintain current medicare 
standards and yet federal funding would be tied to economic 
growth and would drop as a percentage of GDP.
<P>
	There is no way current standards can be maintained under 
this plan, especially since the OECD estimates that Canada's 
health care costs will double over the next 20 years.
<P>
	How does he explain this inconsistency and how will current 
standards be maintained given increased demand and reduced 
federal funding?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member had read the whole speech, I 
indicated growth in health expenditures has stopped in the last 
two years and there is already a start in reduction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10612"> 10612 </A></B>
<P>
	The policies we are developing with the provinces at this time 
are doing exactly what we had hoped, to stop the growth of 
expenditures. With the growth in the economy of 4.5 per cent 
last year and about 3 per cent this year, eventually we will 
reduce it from around 10 per cent to around 9 per cent, where 
we were before.
<P>
	That will be very competitive. It is a sign that we can have 
comprehensive and universal health care, meeting the five 
conditions of the Canada Health Act in a reasonable fashion. We 
will achieve our goal. We will keep medicare. We will not scrap 
medicare like the Reform Party suggests.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, wherever costs are lower it is because the standards 
are not being met right now. It is a sign of things to come.
<P>
	Experts tell us health care costs are rising by about 50 per cent 
and the economy is only growing by 4 per cent. The federal 
government is planning to reduce funding from 10 per cent of 
GDP to 8 per cent. That means less federal money for medicare, 
no matter how you look at it.
<P>
	I have seen the confusion created at the provincial level in 
Saskatchewan when governments said one thing and did 
another.
<P>
	Is the government planning to offload medicare funding on to 
the provinces by putting a cap on Canada social transfers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are planning to make sure that in working with the 
provinces we will control the cost of medicare so that we can 
keep universal free medicare for all Canadians.
<P>
	As indicated, the collaboration between the Government of 
Canada and the provinces has already seen the result that the 
public side of health care did not increase last year. It has started 
to decrease. If we all use the discipline needed we will go back to 
9 per cent of GDP and we will still have the best medicare.
<P>
	We will not be trapped in the private sector nets that exist in 
the United States, where it spends 15 per cent of its GDP. In 
Canada it is universal, free, costing around 10 per cent now.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we should ask a taxpayer whether it is free.
<P>
	The Prime Minister speaks in glowing terms about preserving 
our national health care standards. I will tell the Prime Minister 
what is really happening.
<P>
	In Manitoba there is a waiting period of 61.7 weeks, way over 
one year, for hip replacement surgery. The national standard is 
11.3 weeks. Where is the performance? How are we meeting our 
current commitments? What good are national standards if the 
provinces cannot deliver on them?
<P>
	Is the government prepared to bring the Canada Health Act in 
line with the 1990s and give the provinces real control over 
medicine delivery and health care financing?
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, unfortunately there are problems in some provinces. 
The performance is not the same everywhere. In our system 
medicare-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> It is administered by the 
provincial governments. If they had a better government in

	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The federal government decided on the sly to dissolve the 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women, an organization that 
has always been recognized for its independence of the 
government and its strong stands in advancing the cause of 
women.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify the government's decision 
to abolish the Advisory Council on the Status of Women by 
handing over its responsibilities to women's organizations that 
are already in difficulty?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, women's councils 
across the country were telling us that they were in a better 
position to do political analyses than people appointed by order 
in council.
<P>
	We hear the Parti Quebecois and the Bloc Quebecois say that 
the Advisory Council on the Status of Women, which was 
appointed by the government, is less objective than 
organizations such as FRAPPE or other organizations not 
working directly under an order in council. This is why we 
changed the system.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
not the opinion of women's groups in Quebec. At least not what I 
heard yesterday.
<P>
	My supplementary question is again for the Prime Minister. 
How can the government claim that the Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women was meeting needs that no longer exist, when 
women continue to be the heads of the poorest families in 
Canada, when they earn less than a man for equal work, when 
they are the primary victims of violence and when they are 
always in the most vulnerable jobs?

decided to do was to abolish the order in council positions that 
are traditionally characterized as patronage positions.
<P>
	As the hon. member will know, the Advisory Council on the 
Status of Women named people by order in council. There was a 
question put by women's groups across the country to which we 
responded. That question was: How can a person on the advisory 
council be at arm's length from the government when they are in 
fact appointed by the government?
<P>
	It is for that reason we have taken the research funds and the 
funds that were previously paid to finance the order in council 
appointments and have ploughed that money back into research, 
which will be made available to women's groups across the 
country so that they can set their priorities instead of having 
them set by order in council appointees.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Jeffries report identified critical leadership 
shortfalls in the Canadian forces. Nowhere is this more obvious 
than in the report's lament that soldiers are constantly asked to 
``do more, with less for less''.
<P>
	General Jeffries has been honest and courageous in saying 
what the minister seems ready to ignore: that he and his officials 
demand more but give less.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that it is the responsibility of 
good leadership, including himself, to allocate priorities and 
commitments according to resources, and that this 
responsibility has been neglected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence

question period yesterday I received a copy of the memorandum 
General Jeffries had sent out and I went through it rather 
meticulously. Most of the contents of that memorandum 
paralleled the recommendations and the commentary of the 
special joint committee on defence to which the hon. member 
was a signatory.
<P>
	On page 49 of the parliamentary report the committee said 
that morale was not a problem because of poor leadership. The 
hon. member now wants us to believe that the opinion he had 
with all the rest of the members some four months ago has 
somehow been changed.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that the committee of which he was a

fact, according to an article in today's <I>Le Devoir</I>, Quebec's 
council on the status of women does not necessarily agree with 
the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women on this 
issue.
<P>
	The Quebec council believes that amending the Criminal 
Code could inadvertently drive the practice even further 
underground and the federal government agrees. We are more in 
favour of trying to heighten  awareness in communities with a 
<P>

<P>
tradition of performing female circumcisions and genital 
mutilation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how can the Minister of Justice continue to delude himself that 
the Criminal Code, as it stands, suffices when a gynecologist, 
Claude Fortin, states that he had to perform surgery on nine 
Canadian women to treat genital mutilations and that no lawsuit 
was ever filed against those who committed these barbarous 
acts?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, fewer than two weeks 
ago in Toronto I met with the advisory council created by the 
Attorney General of Ontario on this subject.
<P>
	Twenty-five women from the communities most affected by 
the issue are preparing a report on the question with specific 
recommendations on the issue of criminalization. Their present 
view is that an amendment to the Criminal Code is not 
appropriate because it will drive the practice further 
underground and make it more difficult for us to punish it when 
it is found.
<P>
	I cannot emphasize strongly enough the commitment of the 
government to prosecute and punish this criminal misconduct 
when it is uncovered. However, I must say there are people very 
familiar with the issue who believe very strongly that it is not in 
the interest of that cause to make amendments to the Criminal 
Code as suggested.

with those weaknesses in what is otherwise a very strong

<P>
	As a result, we increased substantially the fairness of the tax 
system. We are restructuring government to make it smaller and 
smarter. We are putting the deficit on a permanent downward

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

look into the question of lobbying and so on. It made its report 
today with amendments. It will be given to another committee of 
the House to look at the code of conduct for members of

<P>
	This has to be decided by the members themselves, not by the

do. Members of Parliament are mature and competent enough to

to investigate when it is safe, when and who is going to 
investigate controversial issues like this one for which 
Canadians demand an answer?

that is vested with the House of Commons. We will be asking a

Leader of the Opposition rose on a question of privilege relating 
to an exchange that had occurred March 14 during question 
period between him and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment. Having heard from both parties, the Chair 
undertook to review the situation and the records of the original 
exchange and to return to the House. I am now ready to rule on 
the matter.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have carefully reviewed the comments from both hon. 
members. I thank them for their interventions. With regard to 
the basic differences of opinion that exist between them I must 
conclude this is a dispute as to facts or interpretation of facts. As 
such, it is a matter of debate and does not constitute a prima 
facie case of privilege.
<P>
	However, on careful review of the records of the original 
exchange, the Chair has found some troubling anomalies. As I 
see it, it is these anomalies to which the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition takes exception and it is here that the Chair must 
take action to grant him redress.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Let me review the sequence of events which leads me to this 
conclusion. The original exchange on March 14 took place in 
French. It was taped and transcribed; the transcription was 
edited; the edited transcript was, as usual, distributed to the 
intervenors for review. The Office of the Deputy Premier 
Minister reviewed the transcript as usual and submitted, as is its 
right, two suggested changes to the blues. However, in the view 
of the Chair, these suggested changes ought not to have been 
accepted nor printed as the official record for they constitute a 
substantive difference to the original spoken words of the hon. 
member. To further complicate matters, these changes appear in 
the French <I>Hansard</I> but are not reflected in the English version 
which is, instead, a literal translation of the original spoken 
word.

will faithfully reflect the original spoken words of the hon.

	I trust this remedial action will close this matter.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Resuming debate. The 
hon. member for Calgary North.
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member for Roberval to withdraw what 
he said.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
wish you would tell me what you want me to withdraw. I did not 
have the impression I made an intervention.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I can check the blues, 
but I also heard you here, when you used a word we are not in the 
habit of using in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, I was simply making a 
reference, strictly off mike, to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I can check the blues. If 
the words do not appear, I will apologize.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, I would appreciate it if you 
would check the blues.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, when you check the blues of the proceedings, 
perhaps I may suggest two points the Chair may wish to 
consider. First of all, when a parliamentarian says that another 
parliamentarian has, and I quote: ``the right to lie'', this reflects 
on the parliamentarians who, if this is true, did in fact lie, and of 
course we do not have the right to accuse a parliamentarian of 
doing so.
<P>
	However, this also challenges the decision made earlier by the 
Chair with respect to a difference of opinion that existed, 
because saying that another parliamentarian allegedly had the 
right to lie implies that he or she had been given that right by 
someone else. In this case, the person who ruled on the matter 
happens to be the Speaker of this House, so the hon. member 
opposite has in fact challenged the decision of the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The blues will be 
checked, and I will get back to you as soon as they are available. 
The hon. Opposition Whip, on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, since you are going to check the blues, perhaps you 
could check yesterday's blues as well, since the Deputy Prime 
Minister stated here in the House that she had not suggested any 
corrections in <I>Hansard</I>, and this did not appear in today's 
<I>Hansard</I>. I assume everyone heard her, since the Minister of 
Transport even applauded and expressed his support. Some 
things appear in the blues and some do not. This is appalling. 
Sometimes it is enough to give you the blues, Madam Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1510 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, this has to be one of the most interrupted speeches that 
I have ever had the pleasure of giving. This speech actually 
started over an hour ago and I had about two minutes to begin, so 
it is kind of hard to get a flow of thought when one is off again, 
on again. Perhaps I could start from the top and get through it 
this time without any interruptions.
<P>
	The lesson of history is one of personal struggle leading to 
achievement. This has been very true for many of us in the 
House. I know of a member opposite who came from another 
country, did not know any English, started out by waiting tables 
and now is a member of the House. There are many such stories. 
I shared a bit earlier the kind of struggles I have gone through.
<P>
	Many of us have become contributing members of society, 
business and professional people, helping others making a life 
for ourselves. Many of us have done this before, these kinds of 
affirmative action programs, these kinds of let us give people 
equality movements even started.
<P>
	Canadians are able and willing to make it on their own merits. 
We have a very high level of merit. There are many unsung 
heroes. We will not see them on public platforms. They will not 
be getting any awards but they have been decent, honest, hard 
working citizens caring for each other, above and beyond the 
call of duty to hold out a hand of help and encouragement to 
others. We need to start judging success on the standards by 
which many Canadians judge themselves. Many Canadians 
judge success on what they have been able to give as individuals, 
not what they have been able to get.
<P>
	Canadians have figured out what most of us figured out a long 
time ago, that life is not fair. There is a saying that if you would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10620"> 10620 </A></B>
<P>
only accept the fact that life is hard it would be so much easier 
for you. We continually have people who should know better 
standing up in the House and saying we have to make things 
easier for people. We have to make things fairer. Canadians 
know life is what we make it.
<P>
	We are talking today about the notion of equality. Equality is 
essentially fairness and impartiality. That is what the dictionary 
says. Government cannot make life fair. Parliament cannot 
create fairness any more than it can legislate goodness or 
compassion.
<P>
	Calvin Coolidge, a former president of the United States, 
said: ``The people cannot look to legislation generally for 
success. Industry, thrift and character are not conferred by act or 
resolve. Government cannot relieve from toil. It can provide no 
substitute for the rewards of service. It can of course care for the 
defective and recognize distinguished merit. The normal must 
care for themselves. Self-government means self-support''.
<P>
	Does this mean we should find unfairness and discrimination 
acceptable? Of course not, and we do not. It is not government 
that helps us to act fairly and impartially. This must come from 
an act of decision by ourselves as individuals.
<P>
	Government is really just us. Government is part of us. It is 
something we create as a society. It is a reflection especially in a 
democracy of what we want for ourselves. That is why we 
choose representatives from us to carry out our wishes. 
Somehow there is a feeling that government should create the 
kind of ethic that is not otherwise present.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	There are things we can and should do as individuals to act 
more fairly and more impartially. We should do those but it is 
not something that can be legislated.
<P>
	Canadians want to see people treated as individuals. We are 
significant in and of ourselves because we are us, so to speak. 
We do not have to gain significance because of how we relate in 
a group. We are significant as ourselves, not as something that is 
labelled, not because we are women or because we are vertically 
challenged or because we have more pigment in our skins than 
some other people. Those things are not relevant.
<P>
	What is relevant is what is in our hearts, what we are capable 
of, how we strive to achieve the things that are important to us. 
That is what is significant. We need to realize that is the sort of 
self-reliance and desire for excellence that should be promoted.
<P>
	There seems to be a feeling in this country that somehow 
somebody owes us something, that we are entitled to the things 
that for centuries we have struggled to achieve. Now they are 
owed to us and must be delivered to us. This is not practical. It is 
not common sense. It flies in the face of every experience in 
human history.
<P>
	Some of these notions have been tried in other countries. In 
the United States, this sort of movement to deliver so-called 
equality to different groups has not succeeded. The 
disadvantages have outweighed the very real good that was 
thought to be promoted by these kinds of programs. It is not that 
the intention behind these programs was not good; it was very 
good. We all want fairness. We all want people to achieve their 
full potential.
<P>
	I would submit this is not something that can be delivered to 
people. It is only something we can work for and earn. We can 
ensure that people have the best opportunities to succeed in 
those goals by treating them as individuals, by allowing them to 
have equality of opportunity but letting the result of that 
opportunity rest with the individual.
<P>
	Abraham Lincoln said that if you have what it takes, the world 
will take what you have. I believe that is true. We do not and 
should not be splitting the world into groups. We should be 
working together as valuable members of society, as individuals 
with full potential.
<P>
	It is important that each one of us make a commitment in our 
dealings with each other to be fair and impartial, both publicly 
and privately. It is something we need, but not as something 
legislated, not as something that is owed to us. It should be 
something we work and strive together to achieve. It cannot be 
legislated. It would destroy what we want to have in the spirit of 
individuals to act otherwise.
<P>
	I think we each applaud the notion of the hon. member's 
motion. We want to have equality of opportunity. Our charter of 
rights says we are equal before and under the laws of this 
country and that must be maintained. However, to give special 
preference and special assistance to people is to deny them the 
right to meet their goals on their own merit with their own 
achievements. We should not be moving in the direction of this 
motion.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I found the member's speech interesting. She was 
talking about individualism as if we stand alone and do not need 
anything else around us.
<P>
	What I hear her saying is that this country has never had and 
does not have today any sexism or racism that we need to worry 
about, that there is no stereotyping of the disabled and the 
physically challenged. She very well knows those very people 
came before us and told us that of them, something like 2 per 
cent or less have university educations. Two per cent or less 
have proper jobs because they do not and cannot access jobs 
because of stereotyping. This is just the physically challenged. I 
am not even talking about the racial situation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10621"> 10621 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member was talking about individualism and being 
able to stand alone, being able to make our decisions alone 
without any laws, rules, collective understandings or 
agreements of any sort. There was a time when that did exist. 
At that time there was also child labour and slavery in the world 
without any of these laws. I do not believe she is suggesting 
that we go back to those times.
<P>
	The hon. member is also forgetting that women had to fight. 
There is the Person's case. Why do we even celebrate Person's 
day now? Did we forget that we had to fight for the rights to be 
considered as people and persons? It was not that long ago and a 
lot of things are still happening.
<P>
	We saw in the paper just recently where women in business 
cannot get loans and have to pay higher interest. They stand 
alone but it does not seem to help. Being individuals does not 
seem to help.
<P>
	Yes, we have a charter. Why do we constantly have to go to the 
Supreme Court with charter challenges in order to get the rights 
under that charter? They do not automatically happen just 
because there is a charter. How did we get the rights under that 
charter? It was by fighting tooth and nail because they were not 
in the original draft of the charter.
<P>
	How does the member expect to stand alone, individually 
isolated and through osmosis each of us will do the right thing 
only because we want to and because it has never happened 
before?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, it is very important to 
understand that because we are each responsible for our own 
future and our own achievements does not mean we are in 
isolation. Nobody with common sense would even suggest that a 
society which is a corporate word would want to isolate anyone. 
I do not recall ever using such a word. Yet, this hon. member is 
so concerned about branding people and putting them into 
groups that the word isolation stands out in her mind if you even 
dare to oppose such a concept.
<P>
	We must help each other. That is the whole point of society. 
Everybody has read the poem ``No Man is an Island''. We know 
that to be true. What is really important to understand is that 
struggle is part of the human experience.
<P>
	Yes, the struggles she talked about were important. Those 
struggles are going on today and will continue, but the important 
thing is that we become responsible for what we make of 
ourselves. If we are delivering results to people and delivering 
the things they need, then where is the achievement and the 
merit? It is owed to us and it becomes ours by matter of right. We 
do not have to work for it.
<P>
	Discrimination cannot be redressed even though 
discrimination is a terrible thing. If I had been alive at the time 
when women could not vote, I would have been up there 
hollering and screaming as loudly, as articulately and as 
passionately as anyone else. Discrimination cannot  be 
redressed by more discrimination which is exactly what we are 
going to get if we are not careful.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
happen to be one of those people who believes we do not do 
enough research in Canada and probably throughout the world 
on people issues, the questions of poverty, racial discrimination, 
et cetera.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I am particularly concerned with the following. Is it the hon. 
member's opinion that we undertake enough research on people 
issues in Canada, obviously including issues that are directly 
related to women in society in general. I refer specifically to 
equal pay for work of equal value. Do we undertake enough 
research on other issues are particularly relevant to women, for 
example in the field of health? Do we undertake enough research 
in redressing some of the financial injustices women suffer in 
society?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, the point I am trying to 
make is that all members of society are equally important. Why 
are we singling out a particular group as needing special help? 
All of us need to be treated fairly and impartially in this society, 
not just some of us. There is no reason to suggest that some of us 
are more entitled to fairness and impartiality than others. That is 
just not sensible.
<P>
	We need to be concerned about each other. We need to help 
each other. Throughout the centuries the people of good ethics, 
solid citizens, the people who were respected were those who 
cared for the disadvantaged, the poor, the needy, those without a 
voice, those who were without anyone to fight for them. We 
must continue to do that.
<P>
	The only point I am making is that kind of caring cannot be 
legislated. It must be done on an individual basis. It must be 
done by working with people. It is not done by creating some 
scheme where results are guaranteed, but where opportunities 
are fought for, where people are valued and where their 
achievements and aspirations can be freely met. It is a far 
different thing from meeting those aspirations for them. It gives 
them the opportunity to meet them.
<P>
	We need to discuss the distinctions in this important area 
because it is a critical area. We have to care about each other and 
we do. What is the most caring thing, to give people gifts or to 
allow them the opportunity to get what they want in life through 
their own merits, their own struggles and their own efforts?
<P>
	An illustration is often given of a butterfly that struggles and 
struggles out of the chrysalis. A chick tries to struggle out of an 
egg. Both are long and exhausting processes. However if you 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10622"> 10622 </A></B>
<P>
tear open that chrysalis or that egg, the new creation that comes 
out of it is weak because it has not had to struggle.
<P>
	We need to be there for each other. We need to care about each 
other's struggles. We need to make sure there is fairness and 
impartiality. We cannot deliver things to people that they can 
best benefit from by achieving them themselves. That is a very 
important point in this debate. I hope that satisfies my hon. 
friend about what I mean in that regard.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
yesterday the Canadian Federation of Independent Business had 
a press release. It said that women in new businesses are refused 
small business loans 20 per cent more often than men in new 
businesses. It also said that women in business pay 1 per cent 
more above prime than men in business do. I would like the 
member to respond to how we as a society should deal with these 
kinds of inequities.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Madam Speaker, this is an important point. 
On the face of it, these kinds of statistics look like nothing more 
than discrimination.
<P>
	The question must be asked: Are the banks which are clearly 
in the business of making money simply refusing women loans 
because they do not like women? If that is the reason, then they 
should be hammered over the head. It is stupid.
<P>
	What difference does it make if you are a man or a woman in 
business? The point is, is there a good business reason as to why 
this decision is being made? If there is a good business reason, 
then as a business woman I am going to make sure that I meet the 
concerns of the bank and qualify for the loan I need. I am going 
to satisfy the bank that it would be very well advised to give me 
the needed money because I am a good risk. That is the kind of 
initiative we need.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the discussion today. I am 
delighted that the concerns pertaining to 52 per cent of society 
are being addressed in a thoughtful manner based on the 
political observations of people.
<P>
	Politics makes strange bed fellows, if I could put it that way. 
Each of us chooses the political party that best suits our interests 
and concerns. Perhaps the way we view society is reflected by 
the choice of where we sit in the House. We have been listening 
to a very interesting approach. Much of it reflects the values I 
consider important. Some of it is totally outrageous and some of 
it is strictly political partisanship of the weakest form of politics 
I could possibly think of.
<P>
	Notwithstanding, it is vital that we enter into this kind of 
discussion. I am very pleased to respond to the motion of the 
opposition member regarding federal action to achieve women's 
economic equality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague for her 
motion. She is asking this House to affirm a principle that is also 
dear to my heart, the economic equality between men and 
women. It is not easy to achieve, but it merits discussion, 
particularly after the speech by the hon. member for the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	Our government is firmly committed to helping women attain 
equality. There is no doubt that the equality of women, fairness 
and justice for all hinge on economic independence.
<P>
	We also know that economic equality is fundamental to the 
well-being of women and indicative of the status of women in 
our society. Being affluent and having a good job make it easier 
to stand up for your interests. If you are at the bottom of the 
scale, if you are a divorced women, if your parents have lived a 
life of confrontation accompanied by physical abuse, your life 
will not be quite the same. Equality will be lacking. I believe it is 
up to society, men and women together, to take an interest in 
these vital issues.
<P>
	In my view, women must be able to take part in the workplace, 
to receive equal pay for work of equal value, and to contribute 
equitably to our collective wealth. I must tell you that, as a 
mother who had sons, would I not have wanted the same 
treatment, the same equality of opportunity for my 
daughters-had I been blessed with some-as for my sons, and 
as for my daughters-in-law today? If they have the same 
education, the same ability and the same experience, why do 
they not deserve the same treatment? I have never understood 
why we cannot ensure that our sons and our daughters live their 
lives on an equal footing. This situation can change if women 
decide to have children, and this must be taken into 
consideration as well.
<P>
	I feel that it is very important to find a way of ensuring that the 
equitable contribution to our collective wealth benefits 
everyone, all members of our society, women as well as men.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to be part of a government that is determined to 
accelerate the advancement of economic opportunity for women 
not only in the marketplace but also in their daily lives if they 
choose to work in their homes. I am honoured to serve under a 
Prime Minister who is committed to exactly the same goal.
<P>
	The goal of the Liberal Party has not changed. Times have 
changed. What we saw as necessary many years ago has changed 
in the new reality of today's world, whether it is the technology 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10623"> 10623 </A></B>
<P>
that has changed, the organization of  society that has changed or 
the role and place of women in society that has changed.
<P>
	We can look at the House and at the number of women who 
have been able to win ``gagner leurs épaulettes au niveau 
politique, elles siègent ici''.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> On their own initiative.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Not on their own initiative, I say to my 
colleague across the floor. From a lot of work by women like me 
and plenty of others.
<P>
	The Liberal Party has brought into force a Human Rights Act, 
a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and a royal 
commission on economic equality, all structures of society that 
express our will to ensure equality for women and that give us 
the legislative mandate and the tools we need that were not in 
place when the Royal Commission on the Status of Women first 
held its hearings.
<P>
	I appeared before the Royal Commission on the Status 
Women. I appeared about child care. I appeared about latchkey 
children. I appeared on the role of the volunteer in society, the 
needs of the volunteer and the need for recognition for unpaid 
work. The women here today gained many opportunities right 
back to the Lavalee case and right through the history of the 
development of equality and opportunity for women.
<P>
	The women who think today that there is nothing we need to 
be concerned about, that violence against women is not a reality, 
that it is not something society should deal with, and that the 
Minister of Justice who has been doing a fine job addressing 
many of the issues should not be doing it, have missed the point 
that 52 per cent of the population require attention. All those 
issues in society need to be addressed.
<P>
	I thought it would be worthwhile to address some of the points 
raised in my absence this morning. I was attending other duties 
and could not get back to the House on time. I gathered from 
what colleagues in the Reform Party said concerning women's 
equality and the consolidation of the federal government's 
organizations for women that they accused the government of 
not taking enough action on equality. They referred to us as a 
special interest group. They talked about us as a particular 
bunch in society.
<P>
	Quite frankly this bunch in society, this gender called women, 
females, wives, mothers and grandmothers, happen to make up 
52 per cent of the population. They are not a special interest 
group. The gun lobby is a special interest group. The banking 
institutions are a special interest group. Certainly women are 
not a special interest group. They are an integral part of society. 
Their concerns need to be addressed through research, through 
public meetings, and through advancing their concerns on the 
floor of the House.
<P>
	Members of the House should make sure they consult their 
ridings to find out the concerns of women, their husbands and 
children. They might be more reflective of real society and stop 
worrying about the peculiarities of a just society from their 
perspective which seems to want to throw everybody in jail and 
throw away the key.
<P>
	They have called for the government to get out of child care, 
that women should stay at home and look after children. If all 
women in the workforce stayed at home over 20 per cent more of 
the population would be living under the poverty line.
<P>
	They do not recognize that women go to work not only 
because they like to and not only because they have confidence 
and want to but because they need to in order to keep their 
families above the poverty line. I do not expect the Reform Party 
to understand that.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	They also talked about the question of the lack of need for any 
special action. There is plenty of need for special action so that 
the women of the country will be ensured of special action.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would now like to talk about the project to merge these 
institutions, a project I have just tabled, and the action the 
government has undertaken with respect to the three groups 
serving the interests of women, because I think it a bit 
unfortunate that this was not well understood. Perhaps the 
opposition party, the Bloc, did not have an opportunity to 
carefully read the document I tabled and the time perhaps to read 
what I said in the House. In this regard, I would like to draw their 
attention to certain facts.
<P>
	Through in-depth research undertaken by this government to 
ensure that it gives careful attention to fiscal matters-and, with 
all sorts of new things in our society, and with the need to be 
careful with the deficit as well, we must manage our society very 
carefully-as part of my mandate with respect to the status of 
women, I looked at the three major institutions, government 
institutions. This has nothing to do with the private sector and 
the organizations in the private sector, which have their own sets 
of problems. That is another issue. It was not the issue I dealt 
with; I tried to ensure that they operated better and in a way that 
would see to their interests from the grass roots right up to 
Cabinet and from Cabinet back down with the information 
required.
<P>
	It was discovered that everything was in triplicate. We had 
three separate administrations and three levels of duplication, 
and I took those steps to streamline all these resources, to 
concentrate our efforts and to reinforce our capacity to achieve 
equality.
<P>
	By merging the three groups, we will eliminate confusion and 
facilitate access to government. This initiative will also provide 
a more direct link with women organizations at the local, 
regional and national levels as well as with non-governmental 
organizations and  universities. What is more important is that I 
get to keep the $700,000 so that-yes, the Bloc member is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10624"> 10624 </A></B>
<P>
surprised, but I want him to have peace of mind, I do not want 
him to worry-the money previously earmarked for the 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women will be reallocated to 
research conducted by Status of Women Canada and by women's 
groups, universities and other organizations.
<P>
	We are going to see what happens, and we are going to consult 
on the reallocation, but the money for independent research will 
be-and this is a commitment I made yesterday-given to arm's 
length institutions and the results will be published in the 
interest of women, for women, and will not be touched by the 
government.
<P>
	I needed that. Did you think I was going to take this money 
away from women's organizations? No, you started this for 
petty political purposes. I must say that this kind of system will 
be much more efficient. I also find strange that my opposition 
colleague would criticize the action of the federal government 
when the Province of Quebec recently restructured its own 
department on women's equality and she did not say a word. 
This demonstrates, on her part, a great interest in the status of 
women in Canada and I commend her for that.
<P>
	I should make it clear that by consolidating all women's 
programs into Status of Women Canada we are working in the 
best interests of all women.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	I know that some women are concerned that merging the 
advisory council with my department would essentially mean 
that the government could help itself to its funding. Far from it. I 
will not be a minister all my life. I have worked long enough not 
to want to pull the rug out from under women's feet, regardless 
of the government. I worked for ten years on the other side of 
this House and know how women can be misled and their 
interests forgotten. Such policies, they are smoke and mirrors; 
and they did not serve us well. This is not the type of policies 
this government wants to implement.
<P>
	This government relies on the public, on women's 
organizations, to monitor our work and to tell us what they think 
of our performance. I must say that since my appointment, I 
have travelled a lot, I have met lots of women all over Canada, 
more than a hundred or so organizations. I chaired the working 
group on child care. I listened. This government listens. In 
Cabinet, we talk about women's interests and we will continue 
to do so.
<P>
	We now have a very diversified, very competent network of 
people who are able to appear before us, whether it be on issues 
of violence or others. The Minister of Justice and I organized a 
round table on that subject. Forty groups participated. Some 70 
persons came. The government, not the advisory council, paid 
for these consultations.
<P>
	When the Minister of Human Resources Development held 
his consultations, a task force was set up. This cost money, but I 
insisted on it. No later that three hours after the presentation of 
the budget, I received a phone call requesting permission to hold 
consultations across Canada.
<P>
	As a result of this change, we will no longer have a large office 
in Ottawa, Montreal and Vancouver. The appointment of women 
by order in council has become a thing of the past. These offices 
will be closed, but in each region of Canada, in each city, there 
are women working closely with the people, who know who 
should get funded and who should not. They are able to organize 
gatherings, as they have been doing for me up to now, allowing 
me to meet people.
<P>
	I just met with the Quebec women's federation, RESO, 
Charlotte Thibeault's coalition. These women mentioned that 
they research the issues they bring forward, but that otherwise 
they are not involved in research; they complained a lot about 
the way research is being carried out. I said that, from now on, 
research will be done according to the needs identified by 
women's groups and academics, that the choice of who will do it 
will be theirs, and that results will be published.
<P>
	You do not like it? Too bad. I believe it is the way it should be 
done. We will consult women's groups as to the process. It may 
not be what you want, but I believe that it is the best way for 
women. Judging by the work women did in preparation for the 
Beijing meeting, I know that we are making progress. There are 
still a lot of problems, but we are making progress. Women on 
this committee held consultations with 2,500 women across 
Canada. They drafted answers and helped Status of Women to 
make improvements to the draft working paper.
<P>
	I believe that the links, the co-operation and the mutual 
respect we established in many ways are in the interest of 
everyone.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	In this way we are going to improve research and get more out 
of our consultations. We will be much more direct. We will use a 
``one-stop shopping'' concept, research will be conducted by 
outside sources, independently, and all aspects of the library, 
etc, will also be reviewed, as well as distribution, because we 
will begin using all kinds of new technology. Women are quite 
advanced in this area.
<P>
	I know that some people believe that we have stifled the voice 
of an important women's association and even silenced it. This 
is not true. This statement only confuses matters. The 
organization which was closed down was financed 100 per cent 
by the federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10625"> 10625 </A></B>
<P>
	The federal government will transfer close to $2 million for 
the status of women. I think this is a very good approach and 
I am very proud of what we just did because there comes a time 
when we have to turn over a new leaf. The 1970s were different 
from 1995. We had to closely examine what we were doing, and 
in doing so, we found a better way to handle women's issues.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, thank you and I still acknowledge the 
importance of the role of women. Our political party will 
persevere, in our interests and in the interests of women-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I regret that I must 
interrupt the hon. minister, but her time is up. We will now 
proceed to the question and comments period.
<P>
	The hon. member for St. Boniface has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have listened with interest to the minister's speech and I would 
like to ask her a question.
<P>
	Like her, I realize that the government is doing a number of 
things for the women of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, we have come forward with an agreement for 
equal pay for work of equal value. We have the gun control 
legislation that is being supported by women. We have the 
prenatal nutrition program. We have the court challenges 
program that has been reinstituted, centres of excellence on 
women's health and a number of others.
<P>
	There is simply a larger proportion of women who are poor, a 
larger proportion of women in society who are victims of 
violence and abuse, and a larger proportion of women who are 
single parents. Women still earn less than men.
<P>
	Despite various initiatives that have been undertaken by 
government and because of certain decisions that have been 
taken-my colleague has addressed one of them-are we 
assured that we will continue to make progress on these fronts?
<P>
	I tried to raise a question previously with respect to the 
importance of research on those fronts. I have a bias, I must 
admit. I think research on those issues is of critical importance 
to ensure that we continue to move forward because there are 
serious problems in society that affect women 
disproportionately.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question. I have visited Winnipeg and I have met with 
both English and French women's groups in the area as well as 
with multicultural groups. I can assure him I am more than ever 
convinced the research that needs to be done is proactive 
research as well as reactive research.
<P>
	In the proactive field of research today, which we did not have 
in 1972 with the advisory council's arrival on the scene, there 
are women chairs of study across the land. Within the 
universities there is capacity to look at many of the problems 
such as the problems of poverty, the problems of inequality in 
terms of education and training, the whole area of change in the 
percentages of men and women in various institutions, and the 
need for the diversity of Canadians to be better reflected in the 
House.
<P>
	A university study was done on the integration of women and 
visible minorities into the marketplace. When we see the 
disparity at least once it is put into concrete terms through 
research at the university level, or at SHRC for that matter, and 
we are in a position to be able to speak out and effect change on 
government policy.
<P>
	I listened to some of the remarks of members of the Reform 
Party which I do not share. They say that government cannot 
make life fairer.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	If we did not do research through the Canadian Federation for 
Independent Business, would we know that women who have an 
excellent record with respect to the creation of jobs in small and 
medium size businesses are far more effective and far more 
efficient or that over 40 per cent of the jobs are created by the 
small businesses in which women are the most successful after 
five years?
<P>
	That research was done by the private sector, the CFIB in this 
instance, not by a university. It indicated that despite their 
success 20 per cent more women were refused loans at our banks 
and institutions than men and that when women obtained loans, 
95 per cent of them had to pay higher rates with more difficult 
terms.
<P>
	That research was extremely pertinent. I am very glad the 
member asked the question. It is a solid answer to the Reform 
member on whether or not we need to be doing work on equality 
for women in the fields of employment and earnings. Yes, we 
need to reach economic equality. The question was very 
pertinent. It allows me to thank the member very much.
<P>
	There is room for research at all levels: through the private 
sector, through the public sector and through the universities 
with their great expertise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to put a question to the Secretary of State for the 
Status of Women. I understand the government's new policy, 
which led to yesterday afternoon's decision that that would be 
the best way to operate.
<P>
	I do not think that there is unanimity among women's groups 
or that it is as obvious as the minister would have us think. There 
is concern about the probable lack of transparency there would 
be in the department when public servants in this department are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10626"> 10626 </A></B>
<P>
called upon to  promote the department's policies. The role of 
the advisory council was precisely to criticize government 
inertia and to suggest possible solutions regarding the various 
policies of the government concerning the status of women.
<P>
	Take day care facilities, for example. We know that the 3 per 
cent of GDP has been reached and that 50,000 day care spaces 
have been promised. This does not come from the government. 
We hear about pay equity, while women are still earning 72 per 
cent of what men earn, and there are other decisions that the 
government is dragging its feet on. I think that enough has been 
said today about the various possible solutions that the 
government could adopt to bring about a considerable 
improvement in the economic situation of women.
<P>
	What concerns me is the lack of transparency that might result 
from this new direction. I am also concerned about the choice we 
would have to make.
<P>
	The minister said yesterday in her speech on the budget in the 
House that the various women's groups were very strong, very 
effective. I think that some of them are but that others are not so 
strong and do not have the Canadian Advisory Council's 
analysis capacity. Without this analysis capacity, how will they 
manage?
<P>
	Women living in the outlying regions will have to negotiate 
with the federal government, to travel, to defend their priorities. 
The minister may be very positive, but I do not know what the 
outcome will be in the long term. I do not think, however, that 
this way of looking at things will be an end in itself.
<P>
	She seemed to be saying that the women's movement was 
born of various concerns and that it was in its infancy when the 
council was created. I would say that, on the contrary, we have 
not yet reached maturity.
<P>
	In 1920, women were earning 50 per cent less than men; in 
1995, women are making only 72 per cent of what men make. We 
have clearly lost ground.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Given the economic situation, we know full well that women 
will be the hardest hit. This afternoon in the House, the Deputy 
Prime Minister replied to a question I asked on the dismantling 
of the advisory council-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but her time is up. The secretary of state, for a 
brief reply.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague. 
I am aware of her keen interest for women's issues. I know she 
speaks from the heart and I respect her for that. While I 
understand her interest for women's issues, I wish she would 
reply when Reform members make statements in this House, 
because it is quite frustrating to hear them sometimes.
<P>
	I must say that, indeed, the advisory council had a role to play, 
and it played it well. Perhaps it even took a mother-hen 
approach at times. As I see it, the council was the driving force 
behind many activities and initiatives. You cannot say that, over 
the years, the Fédération des femmes du Québec, the National 
Action Committee on the Status of Women-the similarity of 
certain names causes some confusion, I know- the National 
Council of Women and others-there are a dozen organizations 
out there that I could name, have not been able to make 
representations and have not done so. And, through independent 
research, we will make sure that they can decide for themselves 
what their priorities will be regarding all the women's groups; I 
will not interfere. I think it will be in their best interest.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate on the motion tabled by 
the hon. member for Québec, which deals with the economic 
equality of women. In spite of all the attention generated by the 
status of women in Canada, and by a number of legislative 
measures and policies designed to correct the inequalities of 
which they are victims, the situation of women remains very 
different from that of men, and there is still a lot to be done 
before they can enjoy the same benefits as their male 
counterparts.
<P>
	As the member for Drummond, I first want to express my 
friendship and my support to women in my riding, particularly 
those who work in organizations dedicated to improving the 
situation of women in our riding. As the opposition critic on 
health issues, this is also an opportunity to stress the urgency of 
establishing a health care system for women.
<P>
	The moneys allocated to research on women's health issues 
remain largely inadequate. There are insufficiencies in various 
sectors such as breast cancer research, gynaecology and 
obstetrics, chronic and degenerative diseases, mental health, 
violence, occupational diseases, specific needs of immigrant 
women of ethnic origin and native women, teenagers, elderly 
women, and so on.
<P>
	At the beginning of her mandate, 15 months ago, the Minister 
of Health told us how she was going to promote women's health. 
She explained the programs that her government was going to 
implement, so as to correct the inequalities which affect women 
in the health care system. The reality, however, is completely 
different.
<P>
	Since the Liberals took office, the funds allocated to health 
care keep diminishing. This government maintained the freeze 
on transfer payments to the provinces, thus creating a shortfall 
for provincial health care systems, including Quebec's. The 
government goes even farther in its last budget by cutting $70 
million in the health department's budget, which is a 3.8 per cent 
reduction. But nothing is done to correct the imbalance between 
men and women.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10627"> 10627 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me tell you about breast cancer. Canada has the world's 
highest rate of breast cancer.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	Finally, the incidence of this terrible disease has constantly 
increased since the 1960s. Each year, 15,000 new cases of breast 
cancer are diagnosed, and 5,000 women will die of it this year, 
that is, one every two hours.
<P>
	In Quebec alone, 1,500 women will die of this terrible 
disease. In Canada and in Quebec, a woman has one chance out 
of ten to develop breast cancer.
<P>
	A national study, which was published last Thursday, shows 
that 41 per cent of women in Canada and in Quebec consider 
breast cancer to be the main threat to their lives.
<P>
	I think it is about time that we decide to overcome this 
disease. To do this, we must have a breast screening strategy 
taking into account both genetics and environmental factors.
<P>
	This is exactly what emerged from the final report tabled last 
fall by the national forum on breast cancer in which the health 
minister took part. This report recommended that national 
practice directives be adopted immediately to enlighten doctors 
and promote research and job training. So far, nothing has been 
undertaken by the government in office.
<P>
	There is also cardiovascular diseases, which are the main 
cause of death among women. Indeed, 40 per cent of women will 
die of cardiac arrest or of cardiovascular complications. Despite 
these alarming figures, the last budget resulted in cuts to the 
Tobacco Demand Reduction Strategy.
<P>
	Resources allotted to this program will decrease from $185 
million to $81 million. At the very least, this represents a $104 
million reduction, even though the number of smokers continues 
to rise, especially among women. We know that smoking 
increases the risks of cardiovascular complications. However, 
members will remember that tobacco control once was the 
health minister's favourite theme.
<P>
	There were reports recently, and again today, in the media 
about the terrible problem relating to genital mutilation which is 
wreaking havoc in several countries around the world and is 
even practised here, in our society. The government is not 
addressing this crucial issue and we are wondering what it is 
waiting for.
<P>
	Quebec has already showed leadership by announcing that it 
will criminalize this action and sue everyone guilty of genital 
mutilation. The federal government refuses to clearly add 
genital mutilation in the Criminal Code, despite the repeated 
requests made by the official opposition and the government of 
Quebec and the fact that several European countries and states in 
the U.S. have already taken such measures.
<P>
	When can we expect a truly good health system for women? I 
still remember when birth control was not well known and was 
hard to get. I remember when women's diseases were considered 
a normal part of women's lives and their imaginary disorders. I 
remember when knives were used way too often. We only have 
to think about all the unnecessary hysterectomies that were 
performed.
<P>
	Of course you will tell me that times have changed, that 
today's policies stress the importance of addressing social and 
economic problems recognized as being directly related to 
health. But how are words translated into action? Far from 
improving, the status of women is even deteriorating.
<P>
	For years, women's health centres in Quebec have been 
repeating that the social and economic conditions of women, 
poverty, the double workload, violence and discrimination are 
all problems that a pill will not solve.
<P>
	The solution for women is to eliminate poverty because there 
is a direct link between poverty and health. Statistics have 
clearly shown that low income people are sick more often than 
others.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In this year of tolerance, the International Women's Day that 
we celebrated last week compels us to have greater respect for 
ourselves and for others. Women have demonstrated throughout 
history that they have this extraordinary capacity to obtain a 
consensus. Our modern societies, whose only values now seem 
to be those generated by the globalization of economic and 
cultural markets, need more than ever the involvement of 
women as mediators.
<P>
	In the name of profitability, our societies exclude more and 
more people and fuel the rise of several forms of 
fundamentalism. Because they are the very ones with the 
sensitivity and the ability to do it, women will have to assert 
themselves to lead a successful battle against poverty and 
radicalization.
<P>
	I will close my remarks by addressing the women of Quebec, 
to whom I want to deliver this message. In a few months, we will 
have a crucial decision to make, a decision that will have a 
lasting impact on our future. My wish would be to see the 
women of Quebec taking part actively in this historic moment 
because no country can be built without the voice, the will and 
the consent of women. And the new society that we see rising on 
the horizon must include the women of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
being very realistic about the role of women in the political life 
of a society. They say that when men go into education it is for 
themselves, whereas women do it for their family, in other 
words, society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10628"> 10628 </A></B>
<P>
	I am convinced that women, when they see what is happening 
in Quebec, will certainly get involved in order to maintain their 
quality of life at an appropriate level and ensure better 
opportunities for the future in case Quebec separates and 
becomes independent.
<P>
	We have travelled the same path. Women respect each other. 
Redefining borders will not help in any way. It will create a 
situation where poverty will be worse for women and their 
families.
<P>
	I would like to ask a question of my colleague. When she says 
that we must follow up on what is happening in Quebec because 
it just ruled that the mutilation of female genital organs is a 
crime, I wonder if she was absent from the House when the 
Minister of Justice and myself ruled that our federal legislation 
would also consider such mutilation to be a criminal act? If we 
are presented with a case involving such an act, it will be tried 
and judged according to Canadian laws since it is a criminal act.
<P>
	I am very happy to see that the Court of Quebec, or rather the 
Human Rights Commission, has ruled on that issue. I am also 
happy to see they agree with us on a point that has already been 
ruled on in the Canadian laws.
<P>
	There is no need for lengthy analysis to find out that such a 
practice goes against Canadian values, that it is unacceptable to 
mutilate female genital organs and that people have to abide by 
our rules and standards, period. Certainly, for all women, 
whether they live in Quebec or in Ontario, whether they are from 
Nova Scotia or Newfoundland or Vancouver, British Columbia, 
this act of mutilation is unacceptable.
<P>
	I am asking the hon. member a second question concerning 
the health issue. In order to eliminate poverty, we took some 
measures in favour of pregnant women. We also undertook some 
research on breast cancer, on heart diseases in women and on 
their prevention. Considering her great interest in that matter, I 
am convinced that, given her great interest for these matters, if 
she has other ideas to bring out at one time or another, she will 
assist the health committee of the House of Commons by 
making her comments, which will be greatly appreciated.
<P>
	Is she ready to bring us other suggestions on this?
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, regarding sexual organ 
mutilation, we note that it is not mentioned that this practice is 
criminal. Why does this practice still exist? As was noted earlier 
today, a physician had to perform surgery on young women. 
How is this still possible? He had to do nine operations. What 
can we do to stop that? The individuals who performed these 
barbarous acts on those young women are still running free. This 
practice is being performed in many places.
<P>
	When people arrive in Canada, they do not know it is illegal in 
our country. They should be told, and the fact should be public 
knowledge. Steps must be taken to prevent that practice. This is 
happening here in Canada. In 1995, it is unbelievable that we 
still hear about those practices. In Toronto, a physician told me 
that he gets calls regularly from women who ask him to perform 
these operations on the sexual organs of their children. The 
Criminal Code must either be strengthened or other measures 
must be enacted because this situation is really alarming.
<P>
	As far as-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member, but her time is up. The hon. member for Laval 
Centre has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, allotted days on a motion of the official 
opposition provide special moments in this House, because, by 
making it possible to ask government about the real issues, they 
force parliamentarians to consider certain unavoidable realities.
<P>
	The reality we are currently considering concerns more than 
half the population, since, today, we are assessing the 
government's action, or, rather, its inaction with respect to 
women.
<P>
	On March 8, 1994, International Women's Day, the Bloc 
Quebecois tabled the following motion in the House on an 
opposition day:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That this House urge the government to recognize the principle of economic 
equality between women and men and to implement measures, in areas of federal 
jurisdiction, to guarantee women equity in employment, wages and living 
conditions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What has become of this a year later? Women in Canada and 
Quebec agree: for this government, it is a long way from the cup 
to the lips. There was not a hint of the grand principle of equity 
in the budget tabled by the Minister of Finance. And yet women 
here need real action.
<P>
	It therefore makes sense for the opposition critic on the status 
of women to table a motion denouncing the federal government 
for its inaction in its areas of jurisdiction through its failure to 
adopt concrete measures to promote the equality of women.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois notes that the Liberal government has 
failed to keep the commitments it made with regard to 
promoting equality for women. One has only to look at the 
situation in various areas of social concern, including child care 
services, public housing and the struggle to prevent violence 
against women.
<P>
	The Liberal government's latest decision to abolish the 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women is a clear indication of 
the cabinet's concern about women.
<P>
	It appears that the government is no longer interested in 
hearing a voice independent of political power express the 
rightful claims of women. The council's credibility with various 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10629"> 10629 </A></B>
<P>
women's organizations was commonly  recognized. It is not 
easy to answer to one's conscience when the will to act is 
lacking.
<P>
	It would seem that the activities of this organization will be 
transferred to Status of Women Canada. What activities are we 
talking about, however, since $1 million in funding will be cut?
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	The equal opportunities for women program will also be 
transferred to Status of Women Canada, but with a budget 
reduced by five per cent. They say that, for the moment, this cut 
will not affect grants to volunteer organizations working on the 
status of women issue. What we really want to know is how long 
will this moment last.
<P>
	Of all of the issues regarding the status of women, violence 
against women is probably the most devastating, as much 
physically as it is psychologically and it also saps morale. 
Despite the efforts of groups working to stop violence against 
women, the incidence of violence has increased at an alarming 
rate. Can we fight so rampant a social ill with only sentiment and 
good intentions as weapons? No, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	The violence that often stems from economic inequality could 
be eliminated if the government would only assume a strong 
leadership role in society, put equality high on the list of 
priorities and channel the appropriate resources to the cause. 
Governments do not have the right to expose the pursuit of 
economic equality for women to the whims of the tax system and 
budgets. Such behaviour is tantamount to subsidizing economic 
inequality.
<P>
	More than ever, fighting violence against women must be a 
priority. Is it acceptable in 1995 that women and families still 
have to face violence day after day? In January 1994, Statistics 
Canada publicized the results of a vast survey in which 12,300 
women participated. It brought to bear some disquieting facts.
<P>
	It revealed that 51 per cent of all women have been victims of 
at least one act of physical or sexual violence. One in five were 
hurt and one in four were hurt so badly that they required 
medical attention. In 25 per cent of all cases, the husband or 
common-law spouse was the perpetrator. What is even more 
serious is that children witnessed the violence 4 times out of 10.
<P>
	These figures jive, by the way, with the statistical data 
contained in a 1991 report called ``The War Against Women''. 
The report found that between 63 and 83 per cent of the victims 
of physical abuse knew the men who abused them. One woman 
in ten is assaulted by her spouse and, on the average, victims are 
abused 30 times before they call the police.
<P>
	The Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women 
published its own figures, which have quite a story to tell about 
the treatment women receive. It found that one in four Canadian 
women were sexually exploited at one point of their lives. In 
half of the cases, these women were not even 17.
<P>
	Considering these disturbing facts, how can the government 
justify its decision to reduce subsidies to organizations against 
violence towards women when the need is more pressing?
<P>
	Women will not feel secure before there is true equality 
between men and women. How much injustice, inequity, 
inequality, and violence will the women of Canada and Quebec 
have to endure before the government commits itself to act in a 
concrete way and proceed with the necessary social and 
economic changes to achieve equality?
<P>
	The Liberal government with its current budgetary measures 
in the area of unemployment insurance, with its determination 
to cut transfer payments to the provinces in the areas of health, 
education and social services is working towards a pull-out of 
the central government in these matters.
<P>
	The so-called reform of social programs, postponed until 
1997, announced a dark future for young people, the 
unemployed, senior citizens and, of course, women.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, there is no doubt that women will be the first victims 
of the changes to eligibility criteria for unemployment 
insurance, in a large part because it will be based on family 
income. We can assume that women could be denied access to 
the plan because of the high salaries of their husbands. What 
about other payments, in particular old age security?
<P>
	The same logic seems to apply, since the budget of the 
Minister of Finance is starting to open a breach into old age 
security. ``If your family income exceeds a certain threshold, 
Madam, you will no longer get your monthly cheque.'' For many 
women, this cheque is tangible proof of a certain financial 
autonomy, very often the first they ever had. We cannot deny 
that some aspects of women's reality have been overlooked by 
decision-makers. But an oversight can be corrected, if only the 
will to be fair is strong enough for us to admit that we were 
wrong.
<P>
	The economic security and equality of women can only be 
achieved if women are economically independent. In turn, 
economic independence is tied to the creation of lasting full 
time and adequately paid jobs. However, in 1993, women 
accounted for 69 per cent of part time workers in Canada. This 
ratio is unacceptable. Job insecurity is replacing economic 
security and equality for women. This is second rate equity.
<P>
	Instead of jeopardizing the scant efforts made over the past 
decades to try to provide women in Canada and Quebec with 
economic equality, the government should recognize that only a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10630"> 10630 </A></B>
<P>
sharp directional change in  employment strategies will 
guarantee the women of this country the economic security 
necessary for individuals to find their balance, for families to be 
healthy, and for people to enjoy respect. This government has its 
work cut out, but it remains to be seen if it will have the courage 
to get down to business.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.): </B>Madam 
Speaker, I would like to add a few comments and make some 
observations. First, it is not the credibility of the Canadian 
Advisory Council on the Status of Women which is being 
questioned here, but the operating costs, the duplication costs. 
We are talking about a third of the budget being used for three 
full time employees, the president and two vice-presidents, and 
some thirty former part-time employees appointed by order in 
council. I must say that one third is too much. For the rest of the 
money that we will keep, that the Canadian Council will keep, 
we will make a review and consult women to determine how to 
put that money to good use. I believe this is a better way to 
ensure that many of the questions you raised on certain points, 
some important questions, will get at least a technical answer. 
That is another story.
<P>
	To conclude on your colleague's speech on health issues, my 
other mandate, that of multiculturalism, has showed me that we 
should deal with that shameful and hateful issue of genital 
organs mutilation through education and not only through a 
judicial and criminal approach. It is through education that we 
can reach multicultural groups and various ethnic communities 
and start an information process. We are making a film on that 
subject for doctors, nurses, families and centres, and I hope this 
will also help.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to bring to your attention the fact that it is 
not the Advisory Council which studied the issues and data on 
violence which you mentioned several times in your comments. 
That research was done by a group on violence appointed and 
paid by the government. It is also Statistics Canada which 
conducted a comprehensive research effort, known world-wide, 
and studied the treatment of women in the context of criminal 
law. These are the people who brought that to our attention.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	And it is I, as the minister for the Status of Women, who 
brought these data here, with my team. Do not create confusion 
for society at large. What was the role of the Advisory Council 
on the status of women? What is the role of the status of women, 
which I am in charge of? What are the roles of various groups in 
society at large?
<P>
	I think that some answers to these questions could clarify 
things a little bit, so that we will know that equality of women 
will finally be coming. We know that a strong economy and the 
participation of women are the key to their independence. That 
independence is very important. Do you not think that, in the 
future, if we  cannot be treated as equals, if we do not have the 
right to equal salaries, if we do not have the chance to be equal in 
society, we could be the victims of violence?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, I just want to 
direct a comment to the hon. secretary of state. She talks about 
very high administration costs, saying that some women were 
paid outrageous salaries. When will highly paid men see their 
positions cut, too?
<P>
	We are talking about education and communications. Since 
the hon. secretary of state maintains that the council's 
credibility was recognized, I wonder if the members of the 
Council on the Status of Women were consulted on the best way 
to review the overall handling of women's issues.
<P>
	Women are being short-changed, in terms of equality. In the 
1994 budget, there was the whole infrastructure program. I 
would like to know how many women got jobs in connection 
with the infrastructure program? And, if some of them did, it 
would still have been part time jobs.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for supporting my motion and for giving us 
an overview of the various areas in which the government is 
being criticized for its inaction. As far as day care centres are 
concerned, Quebec receives $35,000; and day care needs in 
Canada are said to amount to $2 million. As far as pay equity is 
concerned, women earn 72 per cent of what men earn.
<P>
	I thank my colleague, and I would like to ask her if she agrees 
with the hon. secretary of state's comments during this week's 
budget debate. She said that-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt. 
The time is up, but I will give you 30 seconds to answer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dalphond-Guiral:</B> Madam Speaker, I have a slight 
problem. She said that-Not having heard the end, I cannot 
answer. Since you wanted to give me the time to respond, please 
allow her to complete her sentence.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would like to give the 
hon. member for Québec a short explanation on what is 
happening, because I see that she was slightly annoyed. When a 
member of the opposition has the floor, I must also give the 
other parties the opportunity to respond. If none of them rises to 
ask a question, I can recognize one of your colleagues.
<P>
	Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to start by commending the hon. member 
for Québec for giving the elected members of this House an 
opportunity to debate a most important and relevant issue, in my 
opinion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10631"> 10631 </A></B>
<P>
	In my capacity as member of Parliament, I would like to draw 
attention to the fine job done by several organizations in my 
riding, non-governmental organizations of course, who work 
with women. I have already done so at a brunch to which I 
invited them on Friday to mark progress toward equality.
<P>
	In light of the theme for the next world conference on women 
for equality-there certainly was some discussion on the 
subject-I would like to congratulate them again, as I did on 
Monday.
<P>
	Last week, on International Women's Day, the Prime Minister 
summed up quite eloquently the role and contribution of 
Canadian women. I think it is important that all members of this 
House, both men and women, know what he said in essence.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	``Today, said the Prime Minister, more women work in a 
broader variety of areas in which they have more influence on 
the decision-making process than at any other time in our 
history. And we have every reason to be thrilled about this. As 
we approach full gender equality, we are strengthening our 
society and opening new horizons for all Canadians. In Canada, 
women are making progress toward economic equality. Relying 
on their own means and abilities, women help shape the future of 
this country.'' Not only that of one province, I might add. ``As 
for the Canadian government, it is meeting the challenge. 
Women's equality is not a matter of special interests or rights, 
but rather a matter of social and economic justice, a matter of 
good government''.
<P>
	This message is an inspiration to each and every one of us. It 
sets the role and contribution of Canadian women in the right 
perspective.
<P>
	It is undeniable that we have made progress, by dint of hard 
work and often courage. But this progress does not benefit only 
women. It benefits the whole of our society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is because women's issues are everyone's issues. They 
are societal issues. They touch every single citizen.
<P>
	We need to leave behind the cliché battle of the sexes where 
women's gains are interpreted as men's losses. We have to 
accept that when women advance toward equality everyone 
benefits. It is purely mathematical. When women, who make up 
52 per cent of the population, are able to make a full contribution 
to society, 100 per cent of the population benefits.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	What surprises me is the motion tabled this morning by the 
Bloc Quebecois member. The hon. member obviously does not 
realize that the best way to help women is first to be a good 
government.
<P>
	She should know that by creating 433,000 jobs in one year, the 
Canadian government makes a concrete contribution to 
women's economic equality. The member should also know that 
by putting our fiscal house in order, we protect our prosperity, 
our social programs and  our quality of life, something which 
equally benefits Canadian women and men.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion we are debating today talks about concrete action. 
Here are some examples of specific actions taken by this 
government. The job training and illiteracy programs provide 
women with some of the tools for greater economic 
independence. By combining these tools with job creation the 
government can help women access a full range of choices in 
their lives.
<P>
	Our initiatives for small business, including improved access 
to capital, will help women entrepreneurs and create a climate 
more conducive to the creation of jobs for both women and men.
<P>
	The Employment Equity Act improves the employment 
opportunities for women. Youth Service Canada, a new strategic 
measure, helps to put out of school and unemployed young 
people of both sexes back to work. The infrastructure program 
has funded projects such as the rehabilitation of a children's 
centre, the construction of community health centres, libraries, 
municipal day care centres and shelters. All of these are very 
concrete initiatives to help women achieve economic equality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To be a good government also means adjusting our structures 
to make them simpler and more efficient.
<P>
	This is why my colleague, the Secretary of State for the Status 
of Women, announced earlier this week the merging of three 
organizations dedicated to promoting women's equality.
<P>
	As part of its program review process, the government 
examined the role of Status of Women Canada, of the Equal 
Opportunities for Women Program at the Department of Human 
Resources Development, and of the Canadian Advisory Council 
on the Status of Women.
<P>
	It became clear that these three structures promote women's 
equality and, to various degrees, conduct research and work in 
close co-operation with women's groups.
<P>
	Consequently, the government concluded that the best way to 
improve efficiency was to consolidate its initiatives to promote 
women's equality under the structure of Status of Women 
Canada.
<P>
	This means that the Equal Opportunities for Women Program 
will be transferred to Status of Women Canada.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	As well, the research, communication and public information 
functions of the advisory council will become part of the routine 
operations of Status of Women Canada. This transfer will enable 
us to better manage the human and financial resources involved, 
eliminate duplication, and put an end to political appointments. 
These are all measures which the Bloc Quebecois keep asking us 
to take as a government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10632"> 10632 </A></B>
<P>
	This will help us create a ``one-stop shopping'' operation; 
to eliminate confusion and improve access to the government; 
to improve research, communications and public information 
services; to strengthen links with local, regional and national 
women's groups, NGOs and universities; to ensure that funding 
for independent research is available; and to allow the federal 
government to focus its efforts toward promoting equality for 
women. These are tangible actions, not only words. This is a 
series of dynamic and realistic initiatives, which, put together, 
help Canadian women to progress towards social and economic 
equality.
<P>
	Also, I want to mention that this government managed to take 
measures when it elected-or appointed, as the opposition 
would say-qualified women to positions in this House. I think 
significant progress was made when more women were elected 
to this House. This is one of many ways to ensure that women are 
on the road to economic and social equality.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Maria Minna (Beaches-Woodbine, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to congratulate my colleague for her well 
presented thoughts.
<P>
	The commitment of the government to women as well as my 
commitment and that of my colleague is quite evident. Given 
that we are talking about women's economic equality, would it 
help and enhance women's economic equality much faster in all 
parts of Canada, including Quebec, if we were to get past and get 
over as quickly as possible this issue of separation which is in 
effect holding back the whole country economically, not just 
women?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for her question. Definitely. I spent 15 years working with 
Quebec politics and I see no progress for women if we 
constantly talk about separation, if we constantly talk about 
dissolving the country.
<P>
	We have often said on this side of the House the worse way to 
advance the cause of women is by focusing on the issue of 
separation and not focusing on the issue at hand, assuring 
economic and social equality to women.
<P>
	It is very unusual that members on the other side of the House 
talk about solidarity among women and yet they cannot talk 
about solidarity of all Canadians. We have to start by being 
united and have a united front to attack some of the problems 
that face women and men.
<P>
	Women's issues are not simply women's issues. They are 
societal issues. We must work together in a united Canada to be 
able to ensure that women progress both socially and 
economically.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I was intrigued by earlier comments of members 
concerning the recent report of the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business. It seemed to suggest there was a gender 
bias of some description in lending.
<P>
	With some experience in the CFIB mode of surveying, I 
wonder if this is correct or if this is a reflection of the people 
who responded.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to put some interesting information on the record. 
It is from a Statistics Canada national survey on the financing of 
small business, dated November 1994. Statistics Canada found 
that 18 per cent of small businesses owned by men who had 
sought financing had been refused. For women the figure was 24 
per cent.
<P>
	StatsCan noticed that this difference may reflect an industry 
preference rather than sex discrimination by the lenders. An 
example that suggested this industry preference is the business 
and personal services industry which is the largest share of 
businesses owned by women. In fact, if there was a bias it had 
more to do with the kinds of business women determined they 
were going to try to open. It was not a gender bias.
<P>
	The other was the question of whether or not there was a bias 
based on interest rates. Research has shown there is not a gender 
bias. It is strictly based on the credit worthiness of the business.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Bakopanos:</B> Madam Speaker, I am very pleased about 
this question. At least we can stick to the facts about how far 
women have come in terms of economic equality.
<P>
	I want to bring to the attention of the member that Pierrette 
Leroux, who is the executive vice-president of the CFIB, said 
there is no doubt that women are penalized by banks and 
financial institutions. In fact, she called it financial sexism.
<P>
	As this government has said, unless we can take care of our 
financial house, no one will be able to benefit from the resources 
we have, including women. When we talk about interest rates, 
we have proven by the budget we put forward, and the whole 
economic community agrees with us, that Canada is on the right 
track. Once we continue with the initiatives we have set forth in 
the budget, then hopefully we will move even closer to 
economic equality for women and all Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to stand today to reaffirm the position of 
this government. We are here to ensure that all Canadians, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10633"> 10633 </A></B>
<P>
especially those who are most disfavoured, have equal access to 
the tools necessary for them to lead a prosperous life. That is one 
reason we are working so hard to get our house in order. 
However, we  are trying to do it in the most compassionate way 
possible.
<P>
	For women and all Canadians to lead an economically sound 
life they also need to be healthy. One thing follows another. We 
already know that more women than men who are poor tend to 
have a lower level of health. Women's health is a priority for this 
government. In the red book we promised to take action to 
improve women's health. This is a promise I am determined to 
fulfil. Canadian women deserve no less.
<P>
	Canadians take pride in our health care system which is 
considered by many to be the best in the world. If we scratch 
beneath the surface, it is obvious that not everyone shares 
equally in its benefits.
<P>
	Women are the primary caregivers to our families, our friends 
and our communities. Yet we overlook the factors that assure 
those same women their health.
<P>
	The traditional understanding of women's health has focused 
primarily on reproductive concerns. Clearly, we need to look at 
women's health not just in relationship to men. It is not enough 
to simply compare life expectancy or the absence of disease as 
indicators of health.
<P>
	We have to ask why women are often mistreated or 
overtreated by the medical system. We need to question why the 
distinctive effects of chronic diseases on women, especially in 
later life, have been overlooked. We have to ensure that diseases 
exclusive to women are no longer ignored by the scientific 
establishments.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Medical practitioners and decision makers are realizing more 
and more that women's health is part of the social and economic 
context of daily life.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It is increasingly understood that the determinants of our 
health-our individual and collective experiences as 
women-are particular to each of us.
<P>
	Women cannot be viewed as a homogeneous group. Our 
health is affected not only by gender but by various other factors 
such as age, race, social status, education and, yes, income.
<P>
	We have to deal with larger issues such as poverty, violence, 
racism and a host of other problems that are inextricably linked 
to the health and welfare of women. Good health and welfare 
certainly do not depend solely on health care.
<P>
	Women keep saying-and society as a whole is beginning to 
believe it-that health care must be based on an holistic 
approach that encompasses our emotional, spiritual, cultural 
and physical well-being.
<P>
	To improve the health of women, we have to eliminate the 
social and economic inequalities that hinder their personal 
growth.
<P>
	We do not want impersonal health care. We believe that we 
should have a community-based continuous health care system 
delivered by a wide range of auxiliary health workers and health 
professionals. Midwives and nurses, among others, can often 
offer women quality care tailored to their needs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are devoted to the principle of self-care respecting that 
individuals know their own self-interests. We also hold that 
individuals have responsible roles to play in their own 
well-being.
<P>
	Many of the dossiers I deal with are very difficult and demand 
some very difficult choices. One of the dossiers I have under me 
deals with breast cancer. It is a very difficult one and I must 
admit one that governments have not particularly taken to heart 
in the past. It is something I am working diligently at addressing 
to ensure that adequate dollars are put forward for research, not 
only in the treatment of breast cancer but also in the 
dissemination of information and research into the causes of 
breast cancer.
<P>
	The recommendations brought forward by the National 
Forum on Breast Cancer underscore the key roles women must 
play in deciding their own regimen of care and treatment and in 
determining the direction research should take into the causes of 
the disease and its prevention.
<P>
	Through collaborative efforts of Health Canada, 
non-governmental organizations and industry, it is estimated 
that approximately $45 million will be available for research 
over the next few years to address breast cancer. Is this enough? 
No, it is never enough. We are going to have to continue to work 
diligently to increase the focus and the attention that is paid to 
this very, very difficult disease, one which affects many women 
in this country and has for many years.
<P>
	We realize that initial prevention and avoidance of harm 
rather than health intervention is essential if we are to secure 
personal health and safety as well as economic equality. This is 
particularly true when we talk about substance abuse and sexual 
or physical violence. For this reason, harm reduction efforts of a 
gender specific nature have been critical components of many of 
our programs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The women and tobacco initiative, an integral part of our 
tobacco demand reduction strategy, is another specific program 
for women.
<P>
	Smoking is the first cause of premature death of Canadian 
women. More than 15,000 Canadian women die from the 
adverse health effects of tobacco.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10634"> 10634 </A></B>
<P>
	Thanks to programs specifically designed for women, 
awareness campaigns, and research, we are now able to help 
many women quit smoking for good.
<P>
	In the same vein, we have launched a program to reduce 
smoking and promote healthy lifestyles. That program is aimed 
at low income women, undereducated women, single mothers, 
young women and Native women.
<P>
	Any investment in those sectors can be productive during a 
lifetime, sometimes right from birth.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are convinced that health promotion and disease 
prevention are the best long term routes to good health. That is 
why we believe it is better to invest in the Canada prenatal 
nutrition program which assures healthier outcomes for both 
mothers and babies than in high tech heroics to save infants at 
risk.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	We also share concerns about the efficacy of medical devices 
as well as the ethics and social and health implications of new 
reproductive technologies. We worry they have the power to 
fundamentally alter the lives of our children and families 
because they open the door to genetic technologies.
<P>
	Expanding our vision of health; reducing our dependence on 
technology; doing what works, involving a broader array of 
health providers; self-responsibility; and a greater emphasis on 
promotion: These same topics match the key priorities 
identified as crucial to the renewal of Canada's health system 
and ultimately to our national well-being. They are particularly 
pertinent to women, but they are not just women's issues. They 
are society's concerns.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To solve many of those problems, positive response to change 
is required. I am convinced the health system reform offers the 
best chance of success. We should also remember in political 
discussions that we are here to serve the people, to serve 
Canadian men and women, and not only governments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to thank the minister for her remarkable speech. I 
have seldom had the opportunity to listen to such a long speech 
made by her and I want to congratulate her. Her speech is full of 
good intentions and I can tell she knows this issue thoroughly.
<P>
	I am not rising to blame anyone. Unfortunately, in spite of all 
the policy statements and the good intentions expressed on both 
sides of this House, on the government side, there seems to be a 
distortion between what they say and what they do.
<P>
	We have had many days like today where we discussed the 
status of women. I remember last December 6 was one of those. 
The women of the Liberal Party joined the Bloc Quebecois 
women to denounce the sometimes tragic situation of women.
<P>
	However, in our daily lives, in our bills, we seem to forget all 
the promises, all the good intentions and we just brush 
honourable thoughts under the carpet. For example, the Liberal 
members and ministers, and perhaps even the minister who just 
spoke whom I regard and respect highly, are not opposed to 
measures like the one implemented in last year's budget, which 
takes into account a husband's salary to determine if a woman 
will be entitled to unemployment insurance benefits.
<P>
	When we proposed other legislation, what did they do? Did 
they fight for child care? I know they are all good human beings 
and I respect them, but they are just not there when time comes 
to keep promises, turn words into deed and principles into 
actions. Unfortunately, they then often slip away.
<P>
	I said at the beginning of my comments that I did not want to 
criticize. On the contrary, I hope that, like the health minister, 
women in the Liberal Party will be able to put pressure on their 
male colleagues, who are the majority, so that they take some 
actions in favour of women.
<P>
	Do not be surprised if it is a man who is telling you this today. 
I have three beautiful daughters whom I love as much as my son, 
and I see that the future that we are preparing for them, the 
environment that they will have to work in, is not always to their 
advantage.
<P>
	I am not asking for special privileges for women. I am simply 
asking that they be treated the same way as men and, often, as 
some minorities. In Canada, our women are not treated as well 
as some minorities, and I feel that this is not right.
<P>
	I thank the minister for her fine speech. We can tell that she 
knows the subject and that her intentions are good. What I am 
asking her is, does she intend to promote her ideas within her 
own party?
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marleau:</B> Madam Speaker, I must say that it is absolutely 
necessary to keep working together, not only in this party, 
because here we really care about the status of women and the 
status of minority groups. As you know, many women are 
members of minority groups. My point is that we intend to do 
everything we can, despite an economic situation that is still 
pretty serious, to ensure that the dollars we have go directly to 
those who need them most. These are sometimes difficult 
decisions. We have groups that do good work, but the dollars we 
give them do not go directly to those who really need them.
<P>
	When I consider the spirit of co-operation we see today when 
we talk about the status of women, especially poor women, and 
when I consider that for years we have had constitutional 
debates to decide which level of government should do what, 
and all kinds of commissions, and all very expensive, I start 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10635"> 10635 </A></B>
<P>
thinking that if we had worked together and collected all those 
dollars that were spent over the years and if we had all decided 
that the best thing we could do for Canadians was to sit down and 
do something about their economic situation,  just imagine what 
we could have accomplished. We could have a national day care 
system. We would not have to fight about whether this is a 
provincial or a federal area of jurisdiction or priority. It would 
be wonderful if we could do that.
<P>
	However, the fact is that we have provincial governments that 
have certain responsibilities which they are not prepared to 
relinquish. That is mine. Hands off. Even if what you want to do 
is very good, do not interfere. This causes problems, delays and 
a lot of frustration, especially for this minister, who realizes that 
these are very difficult issues.
<P>
	When we consider what we could do if, first of all, we 
invested in our children, in children from infancy to 6 years of 
age, if we could intervene at that level, we would not have to 
build prisons, which we will have to do because we cannot 
afford the luxury of helping our children. We will do what we 
can. I would like to ask all those people who want the best for 
our children, for women and the future of our country, to get 
together and work on this and take the dollars we have to really 
do something good for Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
March 8, we celebrated International Women's Day with all our 
sisters and colleagues around the world. Let me tell you that our 
day is no exception to those important days that we celebrate 
over an eight-day period.
<P>
	I consider however that a single day is not enough to allow us 
to say that we have won the game. This day marks a time-out. It 
lets us have a moment's reflection before going on with the task 
at hand. On the last day of this octave, I am pleased to rise in this 
House to draw attention to the substantial and hard-fought gains 
made by women and set them in the perspective of future 
initiatives and representations, particularly with regard to 
Quebec women.
<P>
	I also take this opportunity to salute all of Laval's women's 
organizations devoted to the well-being of their fellow citizens.
<P>
	Let us never forget that the courage, determination and 
dedication that characterize earlier generations of women 
before cannot be overstated. These qualities have revolutionized 
the established order. In their quest for self-sufficiency, these 
women broke new ground so that their daughters could enjoy 
equal access to the right to vote, to higher education, the labour 
market, financial independence, political power and the 
corporate world.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	These past few years have also seen a number of firsts: first 
woman in space, first woman Prime Minister of Canada, first 
woman leader of a Republic, first women Supreme Court 
justice, first women member of l'Académie française, and the 
list goes on.
<P>
	In fact, the statement issued following the recent world 
summit on social development held in Copenhagen reiterated 
ten commitments, including that of promoting absolute respect 
for human dignity, ensuring fair and equal treatment of men and 
women, recognizing and reinforcing the participation and role 
of women in political, economic, social, cultural and everyday 
life as well as development.
<P>
	Where are we now? Today, women collectively ask 
themselves: Where are we now? What is the result of our 
efforts? What will be at stake the next time? We all know, from 
personal experience, that some progress was made. But let us 
not fool ourselves.
<P>
	In spite of these improvements, major inequalities continue to 
exist. In times of budget cuts and high unemployment, women 
and the poor may well end up paying the price. Some realities 
remain true: women still only earn 72 per cent of what men 
make, the majority of them are in low paying jobs without any 
security, daycare services are inadequate, elderly women are 
poorer than their male counterparts, and so on.
<P>
	What is the situation in Quebec? Many Bloc members 
travelled across various regions of the province in recent weeks, 
along with the regional commissions on Quebec's future. As you 
know, the hearings held by the 18 Quebec commissions were a 
true success. Over 50,000 Quebecers participated in these very 
productive discussions, as part of the largest public consultation 
exercise ever held in Quebec. People from every age group and 
background came and told us what they expect from a sovereign 
Quebec.
<P>
	Once again, Quebecers showed that they can listen to each 
other, understand each other and get along with each other. They 
came and told the Quebec government about their hope for a 
generous, united and responsible Quebec which will care about 
women, children, workers, seniors and young people. Many 
women's groups participated in the debate. I can tell you that 
their vision of Quebec's future is not that of the current federal 
government. Can the gap between the reality in Quebec and the 
way the federal government is perceiving it be that wide? The 
Secretary of State for the Status of Women and her Quebec 
colleagues in the Liberal Party of Canada have missed a first rate 
opportunity to get back in touch with Quebec's reality.
<P>
	In any case, since Liberal members were absent, I will try to 
convey to them what Quebecers told us. First of all, as I 
mentioned before, women groups told us, as they did during the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10636"> 10636 </A></B>
<P>
Bélanger-Campeau Commission hearings, that they want major 
changes. These women want the federal government to stop 
interfering in areas affecting  them, such as work conditions, 
family law, income security, day care and abortion.
<P>
	The involvement of two levels of government in these areas, 
they said, leads to administrative overlap, program and structure 
duplication, a lack of harmony between provincial and federal 
policies, hence a waste of public funds and the inability of the 
Quebec government to initiate a coherent policy on women's 
issues.
<P>
	Do you want examples, Madam Speaker? Maternity leaves 
are granted pursuant to the Act respecting Labour Standard 
while compensation for lost income is paid pursuant to the 
Unemployment Insurance Act, which makes it difficult for 
Quebec to implement a coherent policy concerning parental 
leaves.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	Let us deal with the preventive withdrawal of employees who 
are nursing or pregnant. In Quebec these women are covered by 
the Occupational Health and Safety Act, while federal 
employees and women employed by federally regulated 
businesses are covered by the Canada Labour Code. The level of 
compensation is not the same, which has the effect of creating 
two classes of female employees in Quebec.
<P>
	Furthermore, federal intervention in family matters 
illustrates the double jurisdiction that exists in matters of family 
law. The federal Parliament has jurisdiction over marriage and 
divorce; Quebec has the authority to legislate on the celebration 
of marriage, matrimonial property, adoption and separation.
<P>
	As the Council on the Status of Women said so succinctly, 
women, depending on whether they get married, separate or get 
a divorce may be provincially or federally regulated. 
Furthermore, this double jurisdiction prevents Quebec from 
creating a single family court.
<P>
	I could go on and on and talk about the overlap in income 
security, social services, day care and many other areas.
<P>
	There is a lack of consistency that has often been criticized 
and which women's groups brought up before the regional 
commissions on the future of Quebec.
<P>
	My colleagues have, throughout the day, reminded this House 
of the government's failure to adopt concrete measures to 
promote the economic equality of women. Bloc members also 
condemned the drastic cuts in the latest federal budget and made 
it clear that women may be severely affected. The government 
claims it cannot afford to take steps to promote equality and 
equity, but it is not doing a thing to stop the waste, duplication 
and inconsistencies generated by overlapping federal and 
provincial policies.
<P>
	The federal government has proven it is incapable of 
responding to the urgent needs and repeated requests of women 
in Quebec. As I pointed out earlier, Quebec is more progressive 
in a number of areas. All it needs is the tools to go even further 
and pursue an integrated development process.
<P>
	There is an English expression that says ``if you can't take the 
heat, get out of the kitchen''. Women want the federal 
government to take this to heart and let Quebec have sole 
authority over areas connected with the status of women.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I fully support the motion moved by the 
hon. member for Québec, and I urge the federal government to 
withdraw now from all areas under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for her remarks. I would like to 
follow her lead and take the debate in a slightly different 
direction. I ask her to remember that Quebec society of say 50 
years ago was quite a different society than it is now.
<P>
	It was a society that was very much oriented toward the 
church and the family. Indeed, during the second world war the 
francophone population of Quebec opted for the motto of the 
Vichy French, that the family and home were the important 
things rather than the traditional French motto of liberty and 
equality.
<P>
	After the second world war we moved into a period in which 
there was the great liberation of Quebec socially. There have 
been wonderful advances in Quebec in freeing up the 
contribution of Quebec's women to the economy and culture of 
the country-not only francophone but anglophone as well.
<P>
	Does the member not feel this change-it is a profound 
change that occurred in Quebec in the fifties and the 
sixties-owes much not just to the forces within Quebec society 
but also to Canada itself? I remind her that some very positive 
initiatives were coming from the federal government, 
particularly under Mr. Pearson and Mr. Louis St. Laurent which 
led to the kind of society that she wishes to see in Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for his question. Indeed, Quebec has changed a lot, 
particularly since the fifties and the sixties, in the context of 
what was called the ``quiet revolution''.
<P>
	The hon. member tells me that there was a profound change, 
and I was part of it; he also says that this profound change was 
due to forces within Canada that accompanied with the forces 
within Quebec. I would also like to ask a question to the hon. 
member. I would like to know what these forces are, because he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10637"> 10637 </A></B>
<P>
did not mention  them. Saying that there were forces of change is 
one thing, but we would like to know what they are.
<P>
	In Quebec, we know what our forces of change were and what 
contributed to these forces. We admit that there were also forces 
in Canada, but I would like to know what were the forces of 
change in Canada that might have had an effect on Quebec. 
Personally, I do not see them. That is what I am now asking the 
hon. member.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Madam Speaker, far be it for me to instruct the 
hon. member in the history of Quebec. There is no doubt that in 
the fifties and sixties there was a great reaching out by the 
federal government under Prime Ministers Louis St. Laurent 
and Pearson. The history of the federal government did tend to 
be a history of anglophones prior to the arrival of Mr. Louis St. 
Laurent and Mr. Pearson and then we had Mr. Trudeau and so on.
<P>
	We had an attempt, a very successful attempt, to involve 
Quebec in the life of the nation at large. Quebec has contributed 
enormously to Canada. I am surprised that my hon. colleague 
does not appreciate this.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Debien:</B> Madam Speaker, I will answer the hon. member 
by saying that we certainly did not take the same courses in the 
history of Canada and of Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to spend a few minutes this afternoon on 
this opposition motion. As I listened to the debate unfold this 
afternoon, with people speaking with heartfelt conviction from 
different political perspectives on the whole notion of women's 
issues, it was interesting to reflect on it based on our own 
personal experiences, our life experiences.
<P>
	I thought of my mother and grandmother. My grandmother 
was a war bride after the first world war. She came from a life of 
some luxury in Scotland and arrived on the prairies in Vulcan, 
Alberta to live in a sod hut. I thought of what she went through in 
her life as they were breaking the prairies. I thought of how her 
circumstances changed relative to the circumstances of my 
mother who often said perhaps her life would have been a little 
easier if she had been a man. I think that was because she did 
many things which were not normally within the purview of 
women. To be charitable, she would never rate all that highly on 
a scale of one to ten regarding her interest in washing floors, 
dishes, and that kind of thing.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	Interestingly she was the first women photographer ever in 
the newspaper guild in Canada. She edited and wrote a 
newspaper column for many years. I am very proud of her. She is 
in her mid-70s. She always wanted to write a book so she wrote 
a book. We are now getting it published.
<P>
	In her lifetime and in the lifetime of many of the women and 
men in the House, the role of women has changed dramatically 
in our society. It has changed dramatically as a result of the 
emancipation of both men and women. Perhaps the greatest 
change that has taken place, at least to my thinking, is the 
generational change between my parents' generation and my 
generation, and the relationship we have with our daughters.
<P>
	Most of us in this room who have daughters expect our 
children to be treated with absolute impartiality, regardless of 
their gender.
<P>
	My wife and I have a daughter who is an engineer. She is a 
very competent person. It used to drive her crazy every time a 
male opened a door for her because she could do it on her own, 
thank you very much. I said to her: ``Kate, there are times when 
you just have to be a little gracious. Perhaps whoever is opening 
the door for you is just being polite. It is not a statement meant in 
any way to put you down''.
<P>
	Perhaps one of the things that is missing in this great raging 
debate between men and women is that every once in a while we 
have to lighten up and not take ourselves so seriously.
<P>
	We evolve as a people and as a nation. It is an evolutionary 
change not revolutionary change. There are those who would say 
that evolutionary change has a way of being better than 
revolutionary change.
<P>
	I believe the debate was worthwhile and placed in good faith 
by the Bloc. It is worthy of mention that there are all kinds of 
inequities in life, not just inequities of women. They may feel 
for one reason or another that their potentials are not realized. It 
is not just people of different ethnic backgrounds who feel that 
maybe their potentials are not realized because of that 
background. These things are not right and it is a value system 
that we all share.
<P>
	We recognize that people should not be restrained from the 
opportunity of achievement because of any physical 
characteristic, whether they are women or because of their 
colour or because of their religion, or anything. It is the equality 
of opportunity that everyone feels is a right in a free society. 
Circumstance is earned. Provided we, as a society, ensure that 
everyone; women, men, young and old, have equality of 
opportunity, then we are on the right track.
<P>
	Our challenge is to ensure equality of opportunity, that the 
ladder between success and failure is climbed by the amount of 
effort put into whatever opportunity is afforded.
<P>
	I thank the House for the opportunity to put a few thoughts on 
the record. If anyone has any further comments, I would be 
delighted to entertain them.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10638"> 10638 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am anxious to 
comment on this debate because the whole question of women's 
inequality and what it means for violence against women forms 
very much a part of the work that I do as Minister of Justice 
on behalf of the government. I am happy that this issue has been 
put before the House today for discussion. I congratulate 
members of the Bloc for devoting this opposition day to such 
an important subject.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	By way of comment, may I make it clear to my colleagues that 
the government is keenly aware of the findings of study after 
study in recent years which have addressed the issue of violence 
against women, and which have concluded almost invariably 
that violence against women is connected directly to the 
economic inequality of women. As a logical consequence, we 
will never effectively address violence against women until we 
come to grips with the causes of the economic inequality and 
correct them. It is surely a matter of common sense.
<P>
	Most of the unpaid work done in our society is done by 
women, whether it is volunteer work or work in the home. There 
is a body of work done by Marilyn Waring, a New Zealand 
economist who has studied this phenomenon. She contends 
persuasively that until we find a way to collect census data to 
value the work done by women, we will never really have a true 
picture of their contribution to the economy of our society.
<P>
	We must also bear in mind that women have a 
disproportionate responsibility for home and family. Despite the 
social changes of recent decades, preponderantly it is the 
woman who must take responsibility for the children and for 
maintaining a stable home environment for the family. They do 
so at an enormous cost to their professional aspirations, to their 
economic and financial opportunities. It is a cost that is often 
unfair, invariably beyond compensation. In the case of family 
break-up often it is the cause of real financial hardship.
<P>
	When women do work too often they are consigned to the pink 
collar ghettos; clerical or secondary, supportive roles in the 
workforce that deny them the opportunities for fulfilment in the 
development and use of their full potential. We are told by those 
who keep statistics that 80 per cent of the clerical positions in 
the country are held by women. Even when they work in full 
time positions women earn 72 cents for every dollar earned by 
men in full time employment.
<P>
	This ties directly to violence. Women are constrained to stay 
in abusive relationships by economic necessity for themselves 
and their children. Because they are in a disadvantaged category 
in society they do not necessarily have access to means of help 
to get out of those relationships, with tragic consequences for 
themselves and for the children.
<P>
	This issue is of such significance and breadth that I cannot do 
justice to it in the few minutes allotted to me today. If there is 
anything I would record for the House before I sit down, it is the 
profound commitment of the government to do whatever it can 
in the mandate that the people have given us to address the 
issues we are discussing today.
<P>
	In some small way we must start a process of broadening 
people's understanding of the questions, of working toward 
their resolution, of turning around the attitudes of people against 
violence against women and the economic inequality of women 
so that together, with a better understanding of the issue and a 
common resolve to see it addressed, we can improve the 
situation for the young women of Canada who will tomorrow 
come into their own.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 5.30 p.m., it is 
my duty to inform the House that pursuant to Standing Order 
81(19) proceedings on the motion have expired.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to the consideration of Private 
Members' Business as listed on today's Order Paper.

	The House resumed from December 5, 1994 consideration of 
the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it gives me pleasure to address motion M-291 
introduced by my leader earlier this year.
<P>
	Today I would like to talk about education in the new 
economy. I would like to address not just the details of the 
income contingent loan repayment idea but how it fits into the 
bigger picture of training and learning in the new economy and 
what this means to younger Canadians.
<P>
	The Journal Policy Options said last November:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The observation that Canadian universities in 1993 are in a state of serious 
crisis is now commonplace. Nobody agrees more than administrations, faculty 
and students. A preoccupation with underfunding pervades every campus.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Yet the demand for university education is skyrocketing. In 
Saskatoon and Regina near my constituency it is becoming 
increasingly difficult not only to get into the universities but to 
get into the colleges that prepare students for university. 
Thousands of students are being turned away and this is a 
reflection of our changing economy.
<P>
	Natural resources have always been part of our country's 
greatest asset. Our economic and social progress was financed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10639"> 10639 </A></B>
<P>
with beaver pelts and fish, with logs and grain, with minerals, 
with oil and gas and with power generated by our rivers.
<P>
	Times change. We are increasingly turning our raw natural 
resources into manufactured goods, everything from cars and 
snowmobiles to fish sticks and frozen french fries. It is a valued 
added, information based economy today and those who would 
tap into this new economy must have the know how and the 
skills to compete with countries all over the world.
<P>
	Canada's old economy, labour intensive based on natural 
resources and basic manufacturing, is no longer able to pay for 
all the things we want as a country and is no longer providing the 
jobs we need.
<P>
	The situation is not unique to Canada. The countries of the 
developed world are experiencing the most important economic 
shift since the industrial revolution, the shift to a knowledge 
based economy in which the brain power of our citizens is our 
most valuable natural resource.
<P>
	Government can help to cultivate Canada's most important 
natural resource, to develop our country's intellectual 
infrastructure by helping young people get a quality education. 
Two direct ways to do this are to invest public funds in 
education, for example by distributing cash transfers through a 
voucher system, and the other by enabling Canadians to invest in 
their own education through an improved system of student 
loans.
<P>
	For the first time in 40 years and only after the Reform Party 
brought up the idea, the Liberals are looking at the income 
contingent loan repayments as a realistic way to help finance 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	Let us take a look at the proposals by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development. The Liberal social policy discussion 
paper points out that established program financing for 
education is currently frozen. This funding consists of $3.5 
billion in tax points on $2.6 billion in cash. The government says 
the value of tax points will increase as the economy grows and 
because of this the cash transfer will taper off to zero in about 10 
years if nothing is done. His discussion paper proposes an 
immediate elimination of the cash transfer and the 
implementation of a student loan system where repayment of the 
loans depends on income.
<P>
	In question period some time ago the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said the growth and value of tax points 
represents an increase in education funding, but that is clearly 
not the case. The reality is the cost of education will probably 
grow at least as much as the value of the tax points and possibly 
quite a bit more. All other things being equal, the elimination of 
the cash portion of federal transfers would represent a funding 
reduction of over 40 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The government has recently figured out that we have a debt 
problem. It is encouraging that the Liberals are finally coming 
around to the Reform's way of thinking on income contingent 
loan repayments. A lot of work needs to be done. The crushing 
debt burden on Canadians, in particular the burden to young 
Canadians, will force them into more difficulty in the future.
<P>
	What have we done for our young people lately? There is 
nothing more important to the future of our country than our 
young people. This is something politicians say every time they 
go to a campus or a high school, or otherwise make a political 
pitch for the youth vote. I say it, the Liberals say it and members 
of the Bloc say it. Talk is cheap.
<P>
	Let us consider for a moment what we have done for our 
young people lately. By creating the national debt we have 
robbed from the next generation, our young people, to pay for 
today's consumption. I have said this across the country as I 
have travelled on the social program reform review. We have 
loaded off a tremendous debt on to our young people.
<P>
	The government has spent tax dollars our grandchildren have 
not even earned yet. We have done something else. Through 
high debt and high taxes government has aided and abetted the 
decline of the Canadian job market. One result is that too many 
young people with degrees are flipping hamburgers or working 
as bartenders.
<P>
	The spendthrift ways of our government have also crowded 
out education funding, resulting in a decline in the quality of 
education and higher tuition fees. Recently the Minister of 
Human Resources Development proposed eliminating the cash 
transfers in support of education altogether. Just a few months 
ago we saw students protesting hikes in tuition fees on 
Parliament Hill. As I said, talk is cheap.
<P>
	We must realistically address the basic problems of the 
student loan system. Just as if unemployment insurance 
payments were reduced nationally, the welfare roles would 
swell. As post-secondary education funding to the provinces 
dwindled, tuitions rose and students turned more and more to 
student loans. More and more of them default when they cannot 
find jobs after university.
<P>
	By 1992 loan defaults reached unprecedented levels. Almost 
one-third of outstanding loans were in default. Only two-thirds 
of those who had reached the repayment stage had begun to pay. 
Since 1964 the value of defaulted student loans has reached 
nearly $1 billion. The true cost of the student loan system to the 
taxpayer is also unrepresented because the government charges 
only simple interest on defaulted loans.
<P>
	There is another problem with the present system which 
works hardship on students. Under the present system students 
must begin repaying student loans eight months after graduation 
whether they have a job or not, whether they have a high paying 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10640"> 10640 </A></B>
<P>
job or not. This leads to  an onerous burden on some students and 
eventual loan defaults with collection costs, loan write-offs and 
general increased costs to the taxpayer.
<P>
	Under the income contingent system students would begin 
repaying their student loan only after they had found a job with a 
minimum level of income. The federal government would 
collect the student loans back through the income tax system. 
This would mean that students would declare their social 
insurance number on their student loan forms.
<P>
	If students were allowed the flexibility of repaying their loans 
over a longer period of time through the income they earn in the 
future, tuition fees could rise to allow an education of 
continuing high quality. Students would be able to afford the 
tuition fees as they could repay over a longer period of time.
<P>
	An income contingent program would also allow fee 
structures in universities to be more flexible, introducing a 
greater element of supply and demand in the system. It would 
squeeze out the irrelevant and useless courses from our 
universities, which everyone agrees should be done. If students 
must pay something more like market value for an education 
they would choose courses more carefully and universities 
would begin to supply what was demanded by the market.
<P>
	I hope this will encourage parents and grandparents to save in 
an RRSP type fund for their children and grandchildren because 
of the onerous costs which will be involved.
<P>
<B>(1740) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Lincoln, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am very 
pleased to debate the hon. member's motion.
<P>
	I know the hon. member appreciates the value of a good 
education and wants to ensure all Canadian students are given 
every opportunity to fulfil their education potential. On that 
point I am sure all members of the House are in agreement.
<P>
	Education is a provincial responsibility. It always has been 
and always will be. Even though that is a given, the federal 
government recognizes its role in helping to make the 
post-secondary education system accessible to all Canadians 
wishing to participate in it.
<P>
	The government would be acting irresponsibly if it did not 
consider support for post-secondary education in the context of 
our fiscal framework.
<P>
	I remind the leader of the Reform Party that when the 
government began reviewing our social security system, we 
made it clear federal support to post-secondary education would 
have to be put to the best possible use because of limited 
resources.
<P>
	That is still the case. Nothing has changed in that regard. The 
budget proposes to bring together transfers for health, 
post-secondary education and social services into a single bloc 
transfer.
<P>
	This is a simple recognition of reality, not only the reality of 
fulfilling the mandate Canadians have given us to bring down 
our deficit but the reality that in the 1990s this will be a much 
more effective way for the provinces to administer federal funds 
that support social programs.
<P>
	The government also supports post-secondary education 
through the Canada student loans program. When the 
government passed the Canada Students Financial Assistance 
Act last June, it introduced significant reforms to the Canada 
student loans program.
<P>
	Intended to help students complete their post-secondary 
studies without undue hardship, the act provides for the 
repayment of student loans on an income contingent basis.
<P>
	My colleagues from the Reform Party actively supported this 
provision. As a result, I am confused why my hon. colleagues 
are proposing such an amendment at this time.
<P>
	Since the act was passed the government has consulted many 
parties on the concept of linking repayment of loans to income 
levels and that such a measure is still very much a possibility.
<P>
	In its report to the House, the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development said that during its nationwide hearings 
it received energetic and concerned input from many educators 
in colleges and universities.
<P>
	We can get a good handle on the desires of Canadians 
regarding federal support to post-secondary education by 
examining the committee's findings. The committee's report 
stated the fiscal situation of all governments precludes 
additional public spending on higher education in Canada.
<P>
	The committee pointed out that because the government is 
reviewing its support for post-secondary education at a time 
when educational institutions are under increasing pressures, 
fiscal and otherwise, it must ensure scarce resources are used as 
efficiently and effectively as possible.
<P>
	The committee noted that in debating federal contributions to 
PSE, it is essential to stress provincial jurisdictions over 
policies governing colleges and universities. It is important to 
help enhance the viability of colleges and universities while not 
interfering with provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The committee's report reflects the broad views of Canadians 
on our post-secondary education system. I believe it is 
reasonable to ascertain from its input that the direction in which 
the government is moving has widespread support.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10641"> 10641 </A></B>
<P>
	There is another aspect that I do not believe the hon. 
member's motion takes into consideration. Because of what I 
mentioned regarding the provincial jurisdiction over 
post-secondary education, the federal government, even if it 
had unlimited funds, has no authority to tell the provinces how 
they should spend current PSE dollars.
<P>
	There is no equivalent to the Canada Health Act in this area. I 
would therefore urge the hon. member to make his views on 
improving the post-secondary education system known to 
provincial education authorities.
<P>
	I assure him we would certainly welcome the support of the 
Reform Party and of all members in strengthening 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	Here is the new reality. Beginning in the 1996-97 fiscal year 
we will consolidate the current transfers under the established 
programs financing and the Canada assistance plan into a single 
block fund to be known as the Canada social transfer.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	In the first year the CST will be $26.9 billion. That is a drop of 
$2.5 billion. If we also consider the equalization payment, total 
major transfers will be only 4.4 per cent less than the current 
total. However cuts in all other areas of federal spending will be 
7.3 per cent compared to the current system. In other words the 
government is doing what Canadians have asked us to do. We are 
getting our own house in order.
<P>
	Equalization payments are not affected by the budget. Hence 
total cuts to those provinces with greater need will be less than 
the average cuts to all provinces. While councils that distribute 
research grants will be doing their share to help meet our deficit 
reduction targets, universities will still benefit from research 
grants totalling $900 million for research on medical issues, 
science and technology and the social sciences and humanities.
<P>
	The government appreciates that the hon. leader of the 
Reform Party has brought forward the issue for debate. I assure 
the hon. member that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will work in collaboration with the provinces to 
establish the shared principles and objectives for CST.
<P>
	Post-secondary education will not be shortchanged by us or 
the provinces. We all recognize, as does the hon. member, that 
colleges and universities play a vital role in training a highly 
skilled workforce.
<P>
	Therefore I would like to move an amendment to the motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Motion M-291 be amended by deleting all the words after the word 
``system''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I urge the House to support the proposed amendment that 
would endorse the continued investigation of the feasibility of 
the ICR concept in the broader context of helping students cope 
with the debts they incur by investing in their own future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to the motion put forward by the hon. member 
for Calgary Southwest to amend the Canada Student Financial 
Assistance Act to include an income contingent loan repayment 
system. I am aware that my colleague from the Liberal Party has 
just moved an amendment but I do not think this will affect my 
discussion of the main motion since the amendment is 
consistent with the spirit of the motion by the hon. member for 
Calgary Southwest.
<P>
	The hon. member favours an income contingent loan 
repayment system. We know that, under the current loan 
repayment system, loans are guaranteed by the government. A 
few months after graduation, the student starts repaying his or 
her loan according to a schedule set by the bank and at regular 
interest rates. In his first speech, the hon. member for Calgary 
Southwest pointed out that about 20 per cent of students had 
trouble repaying their debts under the current system.
<P>
	Our Reform colleague's proposal links the annual amount and 
repayment period of the loan to the student's annual income. It 
also provides for debt collection through income tax.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	At first glance, the proposal may seem attractive in the sense 
that it allows for some flexibility, which is a good thing for a 
person in debt. It is important that the system be flexible enough 
to allow for specific situations. Last week, the Quebec 
ombudsman noted, while referring to young people who have 
problems repaying their loans, that one of the main problems 
was that the banks currently do not have the required flexibility 
to take into account the situation of these young people, with the 
result that several of them have no choice but to declare 
bankruptcy. Obviously, some improvements could be made in 
that regard.
<P>
	Collecting debts by using the tax system is also interesting in 
the sense that very few people can avoid the tax man. This would 
ensure that the debts incurred by young people for their 
education would be repaid.
<P>
	However, when you think of it, that proposal is not as good as 
it may seem. It is seriously flawed in a number of ways. First, it 
is based on the principle that education is young people's 
responsibility. It is up to them to pay for their education, 
whether by holding a job or getting into debt. It becomes a case 
of every man for himself. It is the law of the jungle. Society 
admits to no responsibility toward anyone and leaves it up to 
each individual to fend for himself.
<P>
	This is not the principle which led to the establishment of the 
current loan and scholarship program in Canada. It was felt that 
education was a right and that society had to help young people 
enjoy that right. It was also felt that education was a social 
investment. Young people benefit from school training. Just 
take a look at the figures on job placement and unemployment; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10642"> 10642 </A></B>
<P>
they will confirm that.  As well, all the personal development 
and culture gained by young people will prove very useful 
throughout their lives. But providing an education to young 
people is also a social investment. The richest and most 
advanced societies from a socio-economic point of view are 
those where young people get the best education.
<P>
	The loan and scholarship program in Canada was based on 
these premises. The federal and provincial governments were 
guided by the following principle when they got involved in 
loans and scholarships: each young person has the right to an 
education and that education is a social investment. This is why, 
in Canada, we made sure to keep tuition fees rather low, 
compared to what they are in some other countries. It is a 
societal decision, a choice we made as a society because we 
believe that our young people should get an education for their 
own benefit and that of society as a whole.
<P>
	Therefore, I cannot support the motion before us because the 
hidden agenda seems to be to have students pay their own way. It 
is particularly striking in the part of the motion that my 
colleague from the Liberal Party wants to delete, the part that 
talks about reducing the cost to taxpayers and charging 
accumulated interest. Basically, the motion put forward by the 
hon. member for Calgary Southwest arises from a concern to 
save money for taxpayers and make sure that the government 
withdraw as much as possible from education financing.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	I think that there is a danger for students in there too and that 
is the danger of long-term indebtedness. Take for instance a 
student who has accumulated a debt of $15,000, $20,000 or 
$25,000 while in school. If this student has the misfortune to 
have trouble finding a job, if he has the misfortune to be poor, he 
is going to be in debt for a very long time. Perhaps 10 years, 
maybe 15 or even 20. He will not have much of a chance to get 
out of debt, especially if, as suggested by our colleague from the 
Reform Party, we charge him accumulated interest on his debt.
<P>
	I think that the danger for our young people is long term 
indebtedness. This is also an indirect way of forcing us to go 
along with the underlying spirit of minister Axworthy's reform, 
i.e. shift the financial burden of education on to the students by 
reducing government assistance in the form of scholarships and 
asking students to go into debt to get an education.
<P>
	I think that a proposal like this one could have a negative 
effect on motivation to pursue their education. My experience as 
a teacher tells me that positive reinforcement is important if we 
want our young people to be motivated to get higher education 
and I think that putting in place an adequate grants and loans 
scheme plays a major part in this. So, this is why I shall vote 
against the motion: because, in my opinion, it will 
institutionalize long term indebtedness for young people and it 
overlooks the need to maintain a scholarship system.
<P>
	This motion also disregards the need to provide our young 
people with incentives to graduate as soon as possible, so as to 
keep government expenditures to a minimum. It is a matter of 
completing one's education in good time. If it takes three years 
to get a degree, take three years but not four, as some are 
tempted to do because they have to work their way through 
school.
<P>
	To conclude, I think that what our young people need when 
they graduate is to find a good job they can live on and pay their 
school debts with, not to find themselves having to spend the 
next 10 to 15 years paying off debts.

	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I

minutes were allotted.
<P>
	Would it be in order for me to speak to the motion?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Right now I am dealing

going on with this amendment at this stage? Was it put to the

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Yes.

<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, let me begin by saying that as a government member I 
am somewhat perplexed by the motion put forward by the leader 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
	A clear look at the changes and amendments we made in the 
Canada Student Financial Assistance Act will show that we 
included the concept and notion of an income contingent loan 
repayment system. I would point out to members of the Reform 
Party that subsection 15.0 of the Canada Student Financial 
Assistance Act currently provides for the repayment of student 
loans by borrowers on an income contingent basis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="10643"> 10643 </A></B>
<P>
	Having said this, the government would like to take this 
opportunity to remind the House that thousands of students 
require financial assistance right now. A number of measures 
have been taken to help them in this regard.
<P>
	It is important to remind the House that with the passage of 
the new Canada Student Financial Assistance Act in June last 
year, the government introduced important reforms to the 
Canada student loans program intended to support 
post-secondary education within a responsible fiscal 
framework. A number of these reforms are being phased in 
during the 1994-95 school year. The remainder will come into 
effect once the new act has been proclaimed.
<P>
	I believe it is appropriate to remind the leader of the Reform 
Party and all hon. members about these measures which the 
government has taken to help students complete their education 
and become contributing members of Canadian society.
<P>
	The loans limits had been frozen for 10 years, but they have 
now been increased. The weekly loan limit for full time students 
has moved from $105 to $165, an increase of approximately 57 
per cent. The increase gives students up to $5,610 per school 
year, rather than $3,570. We also raised the ceilings on loans for 
part time students from $2,500 to $4,000. Part time students will 
no longer be required to repay the principal of their loans while 
they are studying. The changes give both young and mature 
students greater opportunities to fulfil their education.
<P>
	Through consultations with the provinces and student groups, 
special opportunities grants for students with disabilities are 
being phased in. The government has allocated approximately 
$5 million in 1994-95 for these grants which will also be 
available next year.
<P>
	The government is also working with the provinces to explore 
ways that would help ensure that students who must borrow the 
most are not burdened with debt loads above what they can 
repay. In so doing, the government wishes to provide an 
incentive for success.
<P>
	As well, low income borrowers may be eligible for interest 
relief up to 18 months following completion of their studies. 
This applies to workers who are not earning enough money to 
meet their monthly student loan payments. Such a provision is 
currently restricted to borrowers who are unemployed or 
temporarily disabled. We are working with the provinces to 
apply the Canada student loans program with greater 
consistency and fairness.
<P>
	Levels of assistance are being addressed according to the 
individual student's needs. Changes are easing the financial 
burden on low to middle income families whose children 
deserve every opportunity to complete their education. 
Specifically in this regard, the parental contribution table has 
been revised to ease the burden on families.
<P>
	Over the next five years, students will benefit from loans and 
grants in excess of $6 billion. That is an increase of $2.5 billion 
over the previous five years. This additional investment will 
give more than 1.45 million students access to post-secondary 
education during this same period which is an increase of 
approximately 200,000 students compared to the last five years.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	These new arrangements will reduce defaults and give 
students greater flexibility to repay and lower the costs for 
Canadian taxpayers. Lenders will now have more incentive to 
provide better services and offer income sensitive terms for 
repayment.
<P>
	A more equitable system must go hand in hand with measures 
to reduce and control defaults. To that end, the program's 
eligibility criteria is being revised to emphasize results. Simply 
put, we will link financial assistance more closely to the 
student's successful completion of his or her studies. This will 
help to ensure the students who require financial assistance 
receive it.
<P>
	Another aspect is we are collaborating with the provinces to 
develop consistent criteria for the educational institutions 
participating in the Canada student loans program. This too will 
ensure that aid is targeted wisely and costs are controlled.
<P>
	The government is also carrying out discussions with lenders 
on new financing arrangements. The goal is to set terms that are 
realistic so borrowers will be able to repay their student loans 
relative to their income. This will improve the situation with 
respect to loan defaults, thus saving Canadians hard earned tax 
dollars.
<P>
	One of the important things as members of Parliament is to 
relate the changes we make in this House to the community 
level, to the real lives and the real challenges that Canadians 
face. So that the people watching this debate have a clearer 
understanding of the type of impact it will have on their 
families, on the children and the students, I would like to give 
some brief illustrations of the type of positive changes we have 
introduced via the legislation cited earlier.
<P>
	Let us take for example the case of Danielle who is attending 
the Technical University of Nova Scotia in Halifax. Danielle 
comes from a family of four whose annual income is $44,000. 
Danielle's family cannot afford to contribute to her higher 
education but she has managed to work during the summer and 
save approximately $1,800.
<P>
	Her total assessed educational need is $7,400. Under the old 
method of assessing need, Danielle would qualify for only 
$2,600 in maximum aid. Under the new provision of the Canada 
student loans program, Danielle is now eligible for 60 per cent 
of her assessed need which is $4,440. That is an increase of 
$1,840. As for the remaining 40 per cent of assessed need, 
Danielle can apply to the province for additional assistance.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="10644"> 10644 </A></B>
<P>
	Or let us take the case of Greg, a student with a disability 
who is attending the University of Guelph. Greg comes from 
the city of Vaughan, Ontario where his family earns an annual 
income of $60,000. Greg's summer job enables him to put 
$2,700 toward his education and his parents are able to 
contribute $3,000. That gives him total financial resources of 
$5,700 and a total assessed need of $4,200.
<P>
	Under the old system, Greg would qualify for a meagre $500 
in aid, but under the new system at 60 per cent of assessed need 
he would qualify for a maximum of $2,520. However, Greg's 
disability means he is also eligible for a special opportunity 
grant of up to $3,000.
<P>
	These are positive changes that I am sure will improve the 
quality of life for many students throughout Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being 6.10 p.m. it is 
my duty to interrupt the proceedings and put all questions 
necessary to dispose of Motion M-291 now before the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
wonder if I might have the unanimous consent of the House to 
speak to the bill for just a few moments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The House has heard the 
request. Does the hon. member have unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The member has two 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Thank 
you very much, Madam Speaker, and colleagues in the House. I 
would like to address two items concerning this motion. I think 
it is of significant importance to get them on the books.
<P>
	The first item is on the amendment to the motion. While it 
appears fairly innocuous and since virtually everyone in the 
House is onside on this, it is rather unseemly that it be 
introduced so late. It does not bind the government anyway 
because it is just a motion.
<P>
	The other point I would like to raise concerns the income 
contingent loan repayment. Information today in the <I>Globe and 
Mail</I> says that Alberta, Ontario and New Brunswick have 
decided they are not able to participate as it is presently written. 
Therefore, whatever we do with the income contingent loan 
repayment, which is a very good idea, the important element we 
must bear in mind is to be flexible.
<P>
	As my colleagues know, we are going into a very difficult 
time financially. The future of our country depends on the 
ability of our young generation to be educated so they can use 
that education as a springboard for opportunity. Therefore, it is 
important that we look at the income contingent loan repayment 
in a very flexible, malleable manner if we have to change it. For 
instance interest may not be chargeable and that might be 
something we would look at.
<P>
	I ask hon. colleagues to consider this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Is the House ready for 
the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The first question is on 
the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those in favour of 
the amendment will please say yea?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.

have it.
