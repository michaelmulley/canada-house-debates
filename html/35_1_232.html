	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
1980 the Canadian Centre for Justice Statistics has reported more 
than 100,000 charges for impaired driving in Canada every year. In 
1993 alcohol accounted for one death or injury every five minutes.
<P>
	Drinking and driving is the largest single criminal cause of death 
and injury in Canada. It is not just car related. Seventy-three per 
cent of all victims killed in snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle 
crashes had been drinking. Seventy-seven per cent of boating 
accidents were alcohol related.
<P>
	Today I want to acknowledge the contribution made by Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving, MADD Canada, which has been actively 
working since 1981 to reduce deaths and injuries due to impaired 
driving and to help the victims and survivors of such tragic 
senselessness.
<P>
	In this regard I would like to mention Lynne and David Magee 
and Barbara Rintoul of Wingham, Ontario, whose sons were 
victims of an impaired driver. These people have taken their 
tragedy and in dedication of young lives so needlessly lost, 
channelled their energy into positive action by forming the 
Huron-Bruce chapter of MADD Canada.
<P>
	I would like to commend them for their strength at a time of 
such-

	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, even 
though there are no partisan signs on it, last night vandals spray 
painted the No slogan on my home. Unfortunately, it seems that I 
am not the only victim of this type of rather excessive argument 
from frenzied partisans. There is no question that acts like the one  
committed on my property are a direct result of the excessive and 
intolerant comments we have heard in the past few days from 
spokespersons for the federalist side.
<P>
	The comments by Garcia, Maciocia and others, who talk of 
treason and of crushing their opponents, have no place in a 
civilized and democratic debate. It is high time, before the 
referendum campaign turns sour, for Daniel Johnson to show 
courage by calling his spokespersons to order and clearly 
dissociating himself from their comments and provocative 
gestures. Since the Prime Minister allowed himself to say: ``They 
will get clobbered'', it is obvious that some of his supporters are 
taking him literally.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the country 
faces a deficit and a spiralling debt, a study by the University of 
Quebec in Montreal reveals that we are losing billions of dollars in

	As we are about to carry out a reform of social security, we 
should make fewer cuts to essential services and a few more cuts to 
tax loopholes of all kinds, including deferred taxes. It is high time 
to institute a minimum corporate tax. I hope that all levels of

has been said that the only things certain in life are death and taxes. 
True for most of us, but not for Canadians wealthy enough to hire 
lawyers to concoct a tax free non-residency under the Income Tax 
Act, aided and abetted by the way Canadian tax law mollycoddles 
such tax avoidance.
<P>
	By taking up residence in tax havens, wealthy tax refugees are 
not legally required to file tax returns or pay Canadian income tax 
on the wealth they have taken out of the country, and pay a much 
lower rate of tax on any remaining Canadian investment income. 
Meanwhile, they can and do spend a lot of time in Canada with 
family and friends and attending to business. After years of such 
behaviour, they can easily decide to take up residence again and 
benefit from things like medicare for which they have not paid.
<P>
	Canadian tax refugees, like Americans, should be obliged to 
continue to file tax returns and pay Canadian tax while residing 
abroad. We should say to tax avoiders: Hasta la vista baby, but pay

<P>
	As evidence of that, let us look at the findings of a poll 
conducted by Créatec and made public this week. Fifty per cent of

after the conclusion of an agreement with Canada. As for the

	The poll also shows, and this is nothing short of tragic, that 28

Quebec would remain a Canadian province.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADA-QUEBECECONOMICUNION">CANADA-QUEBEC ECONOMIC UNION</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in an apocalyptic speech delivered yesterday in Montreal, 
the Minister of Finance claimed that Canada could not guarantee its 
present economic union with Quebec would continue because the 
Americans would use it as an excuse to renegotiate NAFTA. He 
also contended that a sovereign Quebec would have to wait a very 
long time before becoming a member of the World Trade 
Organization, which recently replaced the GATT.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Will he acknowledge 
that the proposal a sovereign Quebec will make to Canada for a 
new economic and political partnership is entirely within the spirit 
of the World Trade Organization treaty and of NAFTA and would 
guarantee American business the same conditions of access to 
Canadian and Quebec markets they now enjoy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if there is to be an 
economic and political union between Canada and Quebec, that is, 
if Canada were to give a separate Quebec special favours it does 
not give other countries, the Americans and the Mexicans would 
insist on being at the negotiating table, just as Canada did when 
Mexico and the United States wanted bilateral negotiations. We 
said no, we had to be at the table.
<P>
	Here is what Canada would run the risk of losing if it were to 
accord Quebec this special agreement: its agricultural policy, its 
cultural exemption, the Canadian Wheat Board, the financial 
services sector, the rules of origin for the automobile industry and, 
even more importantly, the binational panels protecting us against 
American reprisals.
<P>
	As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday, Canada's exports 
to Quebec represent $33 billion; its exports to the United States, 
however, represent $165 billion, and Canada cannot risk losing 
this. It is not because it would not want to, but because it would 
have too much to lose.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think we can all see that the minister is in the same 
apocalyptic state as he was yesterday. The minister is grossly 
twisting the reality of freer trade between countries by wrongly 
ascribing to NAFTA the power to prevent greater integration 
between Quebec and Canada, as the partnership in fact proposes.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge that his gratuitous remarks are 
contradicted by established rules of international trade and by the 
prevailing custom whereby sovereign states can conclude more 
complex regional agreements in parallel with other agreements 
such as NAFTA? Will he not acknowledge that this doctrine has 
even been enshrined in paragraph 4 of article XXIV of the GATT?
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as in everything else, 
unfortunately, the separatist movement has been overtaken by 
events. The GATT has been replaced by the WTO, and in article 12 
of the WTO, on accession, there are no rights of succession and no 
principle of <I>status quo ante</I>.
<P>
	The problem is that Quebec would be like any other country 
seeking membership, because there is no precedent. And Quebec 
would be put in the position of having to make huge concessions, 
first to become a member of the WTO and particularly to become a 
member of NAFTA. This is very clear.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, paragraph 4 of article XXIV, which I just cited, was 
negotiated only last year and is currently in effect. This article 
provides, even in the case of a national treatment clause, for 
automatic exception when a parallel agreement is to be concluded 
between two countries, provided its intent is to free up trade. The 
whole point was to free up trade, not stop it. It is a bit odd to hear a 
government, which vehemently opposed free trade and us in order 
to prevent its passing, now citing it.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance also intimated that the Americans could 
oppose a partnership agreement between Quebec and Canada the 
day after a yes vote. Will he not admit that the Americans, as 
reasonable and experienced individuals, will rather want to avoid 
any upset in the existing economic flow between Quebec and 
Canada, particularly because they will continue to enjoy the same 
conditions of trade and access to the Quebec and Canadian markets 
as they do now? Does he not see that any steps the Americans take 
will only be to calm the nervous and the emotional who want to 
refuse to negotiate and who prefer to see everything in terms of 
gloom and doom?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, rather than asking 
inflammatory questions and making speeches of this sort, he 
should put his cards on the table. We are talking here about the 
future of Quebecers. It is his duty, as one of the leaders of the 
separatist movement, to tell Quebecers the truth about the real 
consequences of independence.
<P>
	If you-yes, Mr. Speaker, I am looking at you and I would much 
rather look at you-if you want to identify the things the 
Americans will attack today, and this is no figment of the 
imagination, they will attack agricultural policy; the dairy industry 
in Quebec; the cultural exemption Quebec enjoys today with regard 
to films, television, broadcasting, books and magazines; textiles; 
preferential access to American markets; the purchasing policies of 
the Government of Quebec and Hydro-Quebec; the binational 
panels. There is a whole list.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, in his speech yesterday in Montreal, the Minister of 
Finance asserted that a sovereign Quebec would have difficulty 
joining the World Trade Organization or WTO, which recently 
replaced GATT. The Minister of Finance stated that Quebec would 
have to stand in line behind the 32 countries that have applied to 
become members of the WTO.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance admit that, under the WTO 
accession clause, Quebec's admission will be all the faster and 
easier because Quebec already meets membership requirements?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>That is the problem, Mr. Speaker. I 
have just read a list of Quebec practices that will not be accepted by 
other WTO members. That is exactly my point.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	These practices will be challenged by the U.S., the European 
Community and other countries. That is why the cost of joining the 
WTO and NAFTA will be so high.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> It is 
obvious, Mr. Speaker, that the Minister of Finance does not know 
what he is talking about.
<P>
	My question to him is this: How can the Minister of Finance 
claim that Quebec will have to take a number to join the WTO, 
when he knows-and I hope he knows it-that the reason these 32 
countries are waiting for admission is because they do not have a 
market economy; that Quebec already meets WTO requirements; 
that Quebec is not too small, and that we are not incompetents 
either since Quebec is the Americans' eighth largest trading 
partner? Does he at least know this, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, Saudi Arabia and 
Taiwan have market economies and they are on the waiting list. 
Yesterday, Mr. Landry said that only countries from Eastern Europe 
were on the waiting list.
<P>
	Let me tell you something: Taiwan is in Asia, and Saudi Arabia 
is in Arabia. I know full well that separatists need lessons in 
economics, but we now see that they also need geography lessons.

Speaker, hundreds of Canadians have gathered on the lawns of 
Parliament Hill today and it is not over a concern with respect to 
the Quebec referendum or trade treaties that has brought them 
together.
<P>
	It is a more fundamental concern about the safety of their 
children and their loved ones. These are ordinary folks and their 
demand is very simple. They want the government to do more to 
protect the lives and property of Canadians from criminals. They 
want the rights of victims to be placed above the rights of 
criminals.
<P>
	What does the justice minister propose not to say but to do for 
Melanie Carpenter's father and all of the victims of violence who 
feel that in Canada the state, the law, the government, the parole 
board and the justice system have failed them in a tragic and 
fundamental way?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was my high privilege to address 
that rally on the lawn of Parliament Hill an hour or two ago. It was 
my honour to meet yesterday morning with Steve Carpenter, the 
father of Melanie, and with Maurice Rose whose son was murdered 
in Montreal.
<P>
	As I told those gathered on Parliament Hill today, since I have 
been Minister of Justice I have made it a point to meet with victims 
and the families of victims of crime, not because it is easy-it is 
often terribly difficult-but because I believe that through the 
tragedy they have suffered they have something to offer. They have 
a perspective to offer on criminal justice reform which has helped 
me in my work.
<P>
	When I spoke to that group today I recounted some of the things 
the government has done over the last 15 months. We have 
introduced more meaningful reform to the criminal justice system 
than any federal government in memory.
<P>
	The leader of the third party and his colleagues want to know 
what has been done. Let me remind the leader of the third party

strengthening the criminal justice sentencing process, and ruling 
out self-induced intoxication.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the minister had done all these wonderful things for the 
victims of violence there would not be hundreds of people on the 
lawns of Parliament today.
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	Victims of violence listen politely to these recitations from the 
minister of all the things he is supposedly doing, but their greater 
concern is with the things the government is not doing: the failure 
to repeal section 745 of the code; the failure to create a registry of 
sexual offenders by September, as the solicitor general promised; 
the refusal to include real victim compensation in Bill C-45; and 
the absence of a victims rights package in anything the minister has 
presented to the House.
<P>
	Besides the cosmetic changes the minister has referred to, what 
more does he plan to do to change the justice system so that 
Canada's streets are safer from violent criminals, sex offenders and 
murderers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my list was not of things we are 
talking about. My list was of measures that have already been 
achieved.
<P>
	Instead of just speaking about a list of victims rights, which is 
something the third party is fond of doing, instead of just 
proclaiming a bill of rights for victims which is politically 
attractive, we prefer to enact those rights as we have done.
<P>
	If the leader of the third party does not know, let me tell him that 
what has been done has been to amend the Criminal Code to 
provide for victim impact statements wherever they are prepared; 
to allow for the return of stolen property; to protect the identity of 
victims and witnesses of sexual offences and extortion; to levy 
victims fine surcharges; to amend the code to permit the courts to 
order restitution to victims; and to amend the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act to recognize the role of victims in relation 
to federal corrections. This is the list of action taken in the name of 
victims.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister refers to enacting rights. There is a growing 
conflict in the country between the rights of victims of crime and 
potential victims of crime and the rights of persons accused or 
convicted of crimes. In more and more cases the scales of justice 
are tipped on the side of violent criminals, sex offenders and 
murderers. This cannot be allowed to continue. When rights clash it 
is the rights of the victims that ought to prevail over the rights of 
the criminals.
<P>
	My question to the minister is on rights since he raised the 
subject. When the rights of victims conflict with the rights of 
persons accused or convicted of crimes, what is he doing to ensure 
that it is the rights of the victims that prevail in Canadian law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first and most fundamental 
right of any victim is the same as the first and most fundamental 
right of any Canadian, to a fair, responsive and strong system of 
criminal justice. Since our first day in office that has been our 
focus.
<P>
	Before concluding, I am constrained to observe that for a party 
so consumed with the rights of victims it is passing strange that it 
turns a deaf ear when the victims rights groups, including CAVEAT 
and its principal, Priscilla de Villiers, speak passionately and call 
for the Reform Party to support our proposals on gun control.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the federal 
debt is close to $600 billion. The Quebec government has made it 
clear that a sovereign Quebec would take its share of the 
responsibility for the federal debt. Yesterday in his speech, the 
finance minister, who excluded any negotiations with a sovereign 
Quebec, remained strangely silent on the division of the federal 
debt.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Would the finance minister agree that the federal government's 
enormous debt will make it incumbent on the government, in its 
own interest and in view of its responsibilities, to start negotiations 
with Quebec the day after the referendum, starting with the 
division of the debt?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the day after the 
referendum we will all continue to build Canada together, because 
it is quite clear the No side will win.
<P>
	Am I to understand that the hon. member is repeating the 
unfortunate statement made by Mr. Campeau three or four months 
ago and this morning by Mrs. Dionne-Marsolais, that an 
independent Quebec will not accept its fair share of the federal 
debt? Is that what the hon. member is saying?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
exactly what I am not saying. I just explained to the minister, and I 
will repeat my explanation, to make sure he understands, unless he 
has no answer and that is why. I will explain.
<P>
	The Quebec government has very clearly announced its intention 
to assume its responsibility in connection  with the tremendous 
federal debt. Yesterday the minister avoided any questions on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14924"> 14924 </A></B>
<P>
subject by saying he would not negotiate with Quebec in any area 
whatsoever. He did not broach the subject of the debt.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance admit that, faced with pressures 
from the financial community, he has no choice but to negotiate 
with Quebec after a win for the Yes side, because Canada is 
incapable-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleagues, during Question Period I 
allow as much time as I can for the questions that are put, but we go 
somewhat beyond the limit, even ask questions that are 
hypothetical-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> The minister's speech is hypothetical.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We get either hypothetical speeches or 
hypothetical questions.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Ha, ha.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask hon. members when they start rise to

administration. Now if the finance minister wishes to answer this 
question, he may.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I will answer, since 
they have so much trouble asking questions.
<P>
	If the hon. member wishes to ask hypothetical questions, we can 
do that too. If the debt of a separate Quebec were to triple or worse, 
how high would the resulting interest rates be for us Quebecers? 
How much would our income tax go up? What kind of cuts would 
we see in social services? They would be draconian.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canadian agenda has more to it than the referendum. Law and order 
are still on the decline in the country.
<P>
	Not only do we have violent offenders roaming our 
neighbourhoods and streets, there are areas where policing has 
almost ceased to exist. Ipperwash is one example. Sexual assaults, 
firearms discharged at persons, arson, break and enter go 
uninvestigated. In fact Ipperwash-

with his voice. Perhaps I can help him by asking him to put the 
question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Mr. Speaker, the list of victims is growing in 
Ipperwash. When will the solicitor general take action to ensure 
that the law is applied equally to everyone, which includes militant 
natives?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the approach of the federal government is that the law applies 
equally to everyone.
<P>
	We should praise the professionalism and expertise of the RCMP 
when, working as the provincial police on behalf of the attorney 
general of British Columbia, it diffused without violence and loss 
of life the Gustafsen Lake situation, with the people involved being 
brought before the courts and facing criminal charges.
<P>
	When it comes to the Ipperwash situation, that involves the 
application of the Criminal Code by police of local jurisdiction 
who, I am sure the hon. member should know, are the Ontario 
Provincial Police.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should tell that to the people who live there. They have 
lost faith in the police, especially with the do-nothing Liberal 
government that refuses to act.
<P>
	People are now arming themselves for protection because they 
have been abandoned by the federal government and fear for their 
lives. The minister is neglecting his responsibility to Canadians 
because he is catering to special interest groups.
<P>
	Why is the solicitor general allowing a group of organized armed 
thugs to bully the federal government, the police and the people of 
Ipperwash?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the federal government is not allowing any such conduct. It is 
certainly ready, at the request of the solicitor general of Ontario, 
Mr. Runciman, to provide support along the lines of the standing 
arrangements we have.
<P>
	In the meantime this is strictly a matter for the Ontario 
Provincial Police. If the member does not think his Conservative

<P>
	Yesterday, the Minister of Finance indicated that chances of an

non-existent. He went so far as to say that, even if he wanted to, it 
would not be possible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14925"> 14925 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is quite down to earth. Will the Minister of Finance 
come back to his senses and admit that Quebec is the second 
largest market in Canada, with 400,000 Canadian jobs depending 
on trade with Quebec, and that Ontario alone enjoys a net surplus 
of $4 billion per year in its trade with Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, all the more reason 
for Quebec to remain in Canada. What I said yesterday was very 
clear. I did not say that there would be no trade between Quebec 
and Canada. What I said is that there would be no economic union 
between Quebec and Canada as described in the referendum 
question. And the reason for this is very obvious: while $33 billion 
in goods are sold to Quebec by the rest of Canada, $165 billion in 
exports go to the U.S., and Canada can never put this at risk.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the 
light of what I said and what the minister himself just said, will the 
minister finally admit that an economic union is not only desirable 
but inevitable in the interests of both partners, Canada and Quebec, 
especially since he knows full well that the U.S. stands to benefit 
from this continued union because they will have access to the 
Canadian and Quebec markets under the very same terms they now 
enjoy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. members are 
having a hard time understanding. At present, Canada is part of 
NAFTA. This agreement was signed and ratified. So, cultural 
exemptions, the agricultural policy, binational panels, all those 
things are already in place and Canada will continue to enjoy them.
<P>
	The only problem would be if Canada wanted or agreed to 
negotiate an economic union. All this would then be at risk.
<P>
<B>(1445)</B>
<P>
	The difference between Quebec and Canada is that, if Quebec 
wishes to join NAFTA, this will mean no more agricultural policy, 
no more cultural exemptions, no more binational panels and no 
more procurement policy.
<P>
	At present, Quebec is part of NAFTA and things are working 
well. If Quebec separates and then wants to join NAFTA, it will be 
undermining the basis of the Quebec economy. That is what I call 
putting your cards on the table.

assassination the hon. member introduced into her question, I 
certainly welcome it. It gives me the opportunity to clarify a 
misleading story that appeared.
<P>
	The best way to do that is to cite the response made by the 
regional director general of HRD in Winnipeg, who pointed out 
that this project had at stake close to 1,400 jobs potentially lost to 
the city, involved all three levels of government, municipal, 
provincial, and federal, involved hundreds of representatives from 
the private sector, virtually all the major businesses in Winnipeg, 
plus tens of thousands of residents of the city, all of whom were 
interested in trying to preserve the jobs and the economic 
development. The program was simply designed to ensure that the 
proper diligence and feasibility was done to make sure that was a 
good public investment to make.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, under the 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, as amended by the 
House last year, the Minister of the Environment is charged with 
the duty of creating a participant funding program.
<P>
	Can the minister tell us what she has done so that Canadians with 
a serious interest in an environmental assessment can have access 
to funding in order to participate?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to follow up on the 
previous Minister of the Environment, now the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition, who stated in the House on April 5, 1990: ``The federal 
government has very clear jurisdiction in the area of environmental 
impact assessment''.
<P>
	This jurisdiction is not challenged and it cannot be challenged. 
We have gone even further in the government. We have entrenched 
in law the principle of participant funding. In the last fiscal year 
there was about $860,000 available for the public to participate in 
the environmental assessment process enshrined by the previous 
Minister of the Environment.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister of Indian affairs has an opportunity to ease 
anxiety among those who believe the Indian land claims process is 
too slow, too complex and too uncertain.
<P>
	Has the minister of Indian affairs considered the 1994-95 report 
of the Indian claims commission and will he respond positively to 
its first recommendation, the  establishment of a new independent 
land claims policy and process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have the highest respect for 
the work of the Indian claims commission. Part of our red book 
commitment is to make the system more efficient and more just.
<P>
	The problem I have, which the member knows, is whether it 
should be a justice system with binding judgments or a mediation 
system similar to what it is now, going through the convoluted 
process of having first to be turned down by the Indian claims 
commission.
<P>
	That has not been settled by the chiefs. When I have some 
direction from the chiefs we could certainly move ahead on the 
desires of the Indian claims commission.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

behaviour on my part and which imputed motive, neither of which 
is acceptable under the rules of the House.
<P>
	There can be many differences of opinion in the House and we 
can certainly have questions about one's actions in terms of 
whether they are right or wrong in a political sense.
<P>
	I have been a member of the House in public life for 24 years and 
I never at any time had my behaviour imputed the way the hon. 
member suggests. I ask her to withdraw and apologize because 
nothing wrong was done, as she imputed, and it really requires her 
to clear the record.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Before I go to the House leader of the Reform 
Party, because another hon. member has been mentioned in the 
House I wonder if the hon. member for Calgary Southeast would 
like to intervene before the House leader of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
all due respect to the Minister of Human Resources Development, I 
am putting questions to the House similar to those asked of the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage regarding the same kinds of 
improprieties. The perception needs to be clarified. Therefore I will 
not withdraw and I will not apologize.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> On the same point of privilege, the hon. 
government whip and then I will go to the House leader of the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I turn to section 409(7) of Beauchesne's in relation to 
casting aspersions on persons within the House in addition to the 
fact that some of the allegations made by the hon. member alleged 
criminal activity on the part of another person regarding the 
relationship between that person and a minister of the House. The 
combination of those two things leads me to believe the language 
in question was unparliamentary and must be withdrawn.
<P>
	I urge Mr. Speaker to request that any such expressions, 
including the language used in the question referred to, be 
withdrawn forthwith.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in speaking 
to this matter of privilege I bring your attention to the question, the 
operative part of my hon. colleague's presentation to the House.
<P>
	It was very clear in the question that the member for Calgary 
Southeast asked a deliberate question of whether there was a 
relationship between two actions. That was not inferred nor did it 
reflect on the minister. Before making a final decision on this, Mr. 
Speaker, I ask that you take this into consideration.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I put on the record of the House what the whip for the government 
was referring to in section 409 of Beauchesne's, which reads in 
part:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In 1975, the Speaker expressed some general principles in order to clarify the 
regulations and restrict the negative qualifications which traditionally have 
guided the question period.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subsection 7:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A question must adhere to the proprieties of the House in terms of inferences, 
imputing motives or casting aspersions upon persons within the House or out of 
it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast did exactly what is not 
supposed to be done according to these guidelines put on the record 
by one of your distinguished  predecessors, Mr. Speaker. The hon. 
member cannot get away with an improper statement by putting it 
in an interrogatory fashion, and therefore she should withdraw.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, during question period, as you have 
seen in the last little while, we tend to be using stronger and 
stronger words in putting questions but also in giving answers.
<P>
	Here is what we have, I believe. We have an hon. member who, 
when she stood in her place, was cautioned about the language she 
was using in her question. I permitted the question to stand with 
that caution and the hon. minister answered the first question.
<P>
	In my view, the second question was clearly out of order and I 
ruled it as such by moving ahead and not letting the minister 
answer.
<P>
	Now this is being raised as a point of privilege. One member has 
asked another member to withdraw the statement. The other 
member has replied that she does not feel this particular statement 
was imputing motives.
<P>
	As the Speaker, it would seem to me that the more we permit 
ourselves to go down this road and not frame the questions in such 
a way that they can be related to the administrative responsibilities 
of individuals, we are getting ourselves into a quagmire.
<P>
	I wish there were an easy way out of this. I do not believe and I 
ruled that this is not a question of privilege. However, in the name 
of civility and in the name of good conduct in this House, may I 
appeal to the member for Calgary Southeast to reconsider. 
Although I do not believe there was any intention but even if the 
words carried the impugning of motives, I wonder if the hon. 
member might reconsider and withdraw the statements as they 
were made.
<P>
	The hon. member for Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I ask a 
question of you for clarification?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Withdraw.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I have clearly ruled that there is not a point of 
privilege. That is my decision. However, again I appeal to the hon. 
member, although this question may or may not be allowed, I of 
course heard what the member said. Once again, in order that this 
House might carry out its responsibilities in a civilized manner on 
all sides, I would urge and ask the hon. member if she would 
consider withdrawing her statements or any impugning of motive. 
Would the hon. member consider that?

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order under sections 485 and 486 of Beauchesne's with 
regard to unparliamentary language and also language that reflects 
on members in this assembly.
<P>
	I heard very clearly comments of the member for Willowdale 
that called the member for Calgary Southeast a slimeball not only 
once but twice and I think even a third time across the floor of the 
House.
<P>
	There was a lot of concern in this House by the hon. member for 
Burlington concerning reflections on whether a person is a male or 
female. This type of comment to a male would have one type of 
inference but to a female, it certainly has another kind of inference 
which I will not accept. I ask that it be withdrawn and that that 
member be dealt with.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I must say that your Speaker did not hear these 
words and I do not know if they are in <I>Hansard</I>. We can have a 
look.
<P>
	Because an hon. member was named in this House and was 
named directly I would ask the hon. member for Willowdale if he 
has something to add to this point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am guilty 
and I withdraw. I ask your advice as to what other word might 
express better my utter repugnance for this type of question in our 
House of Commons.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> May I ask the hon. member for Willowdale this. I 
did not hear all of the end of it and I do not really want to hear it. 
Would the hon. member please just stand and withdraw? He said he 
was guilty. Would he withdraw the statement, just the statement.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Absolutely, Mr. Speaker. Thank you.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada,  Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in light of the ruling you just made with regard to the words of the 
hon. member for Willowdale, I would like to draw your attention to 
citation 484 of Beauchesne's which reads in part as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) In the House of Commons a Member will not be permitted by the Speaker 
to indulge in any reflections of the House itself as a political institution; or to 
impute to any Member or Members unworthy motives for their actions in a 
particular case-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, in light of this citation and in light of the ruling you 
just made with regard to the language used by the hon. member for 
Willowdale, I respectfully raise as a point of order a request that 
you apply the same principle to the question asked by the hon. 
member for Calgary Southeast which in effect involves an 
unworthy aspersion on a member of this House.
<P>
	If it is fair for the hon. member to be requested to withdraw and 
for the hon. member to comply, as he did with the request to 
withdraw the word he used, and I am referring to the hon. member 
for Willowdale, I respectfully submit it is equally fair for a request 
to be made and for the hon. member for Calgary Southeast in the 
same spirit of conciliation and goodwill to withdraw her remarks.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I had asked earlier, with all respect to the hon. 
leader of the government and the House, that it was an unfortunate 
situation that occurred in the House.
<P>
	I have made a ruling on it and I will stay by the ruling. Your 
Speaker tries as much as possible in the course of question period 
to hear from all sides. Although I have ruled, I permitted the House 
leader to go on.
<P>
	If in some way the House could draw itself away from the type of 
strong language that we have been using I think the House would 
be better served on all sides.
<P>
	For now I would like to close this matter of the member for 
Calgary Southeast.
<P>
	I have another point of order, the hon. whip of the Reform Party.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="STANDINGCOMMITTEEONPROCEDUREANDHOUSEAFFAIRS">STANDING COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE AND HOUSE AFFAIRS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
you may be relieved to know this is a point of order on a different 
subject. You may not be too relieved.
<P>
	The point of order is under Beauchesne's citation 317(2) which 
calls for an interpretation of the rules of procedures to be decided 
on by the Speaker.
<P>
	The rule in question is Beauchesne's citation 765(3) which 
specifies that membership in committees is in the same proportion 
to membership of political parties in this House. Under this the 
Bloc Quebecois and Reform should each have three members on 
the public affairs committee.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14931"> 14931 </A></B>
<P>
	I hasten to add that I am not seeking the Speaker's intercession 
on a matter rising in committee which would be contrary to 
Beauchesne's citation 168(7). What I am seeking is for the 
Speaker to uphold the rules of this House, specifically 
Beauchesne's citation 765(3). If others are allowed to ignore the 
rules or put an erroneous interpretation on them, which is the case 
here, then it makes a mockery of Beauchesne's and a mockery of 
this House.
<P>
	I tried without success to get the two other whips and the 
committee on procedure and House affairs to act on Beauchesne's 
citation 765(3). The stand taken by both is that the chair of the 
public accounts committee constitutes a separate committee 
position. Therefore the Bloc Quebecois should have four positions 
including the chair as opposed to the Reform's three.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	We contend that this is an erroneous assumption as Beauchesne's 
781 calls only for the chair to go to the opposition, not the official 
opposition. We would also cite Standing Order 106(2) which is 
silent on who fills the chair.
<P>
	Since I have been unable to redress this grievance in committee 
or with the whips, I ask for the Speaker to uphold the rules of the 
House, specifically Beauchesne's 765(3), perhaps by using 
Beauchesne's 764 to communicate with the committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, at the beginning of my colleague's remarks he referred to 
citation 317 of Beauchesne's to plead for the Speaker's 
intervention in the case. I should remind the Speaker that the 
reference to citation 317 was perhaps selective and should remind 
the Speaker of what it says. Citation 317(2) states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A question of order concerns the interpretation to be put upon the rules of 
procedure and is a matter for the Speaker or, in a committee, for the Chairman to 
determine.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, a reading of the complete citation tells the 
Speaker that this is an issue to be raised at the committee and not in 
the House.
<P>
	In reference to the issue at hand, the membership of the 
committees in question, the issue was brought to the attention of 
the Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs with the 
hon. member pleading the case that there should be an additional 
member of his particular political party on the Standing Committee 
on Public Accounts.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in its 
wisdom decided that it had been customary and agreed at the 
beginning of this Parliament that the party which holds the 
chairmanship of the particular committee loses a member able to 
participate in the debate because the chairman customarily, as the 
Speaker knows more than anyone else in the House, does not 
participate too frequently in the debates. That was agreed  to at the 
beginning of this Parliament, at the beginning of the previous 
Parliament and the one before it.
<P>
	In each one of those prior Parliaments and in the present one the 
official opposition, which traditionally chairs the public accounts 
committee, has an additional member to compensate for the fact 
that it loses one member in the debate.
<P>
	Finally the argument was made by myself at the procedure and 
House affairs committee that if we add another member from 
another party to the public accounts committee, we disturb the 
whole balance within the committee. We then have to add two 
Liberal members to the committee to achieve the balance we must 
start off with under the rule invoked by the hon. member in 
question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will not quote Beauchesne because one can use different 
citations to make different points. One thing is for sure, when we 
conducted negotiations at the start of this Parliament two years ago 
and two whips ago for the Reform Party, which is now on its third 
whip-the government whip was not there at the time but you 
were-the three whips of the day, including myself, submitted 
various proposals on the right to speak, on question period, on 
members' statements and on committee membership. At that time, 
the Bloc Quebecois even offered five vice-chairmanships to the 
third party, which refused them because they were not to their 
liking.
<P>
	They have now changed their minds. Fine by me but there were 
nonetheless recorded divisions in each committee. Under British 
parliamentary tradition, a specific role is reserved for the official 
opposition. We are aware of that. I would point out to the hon. 
member from the third party that the Quebec legislature, one of the 
oldest in the world, was operating as early as 1791. It is one of the 
oldest parliaments in the world, also under British parliamentary 
rules.
<P>
	We understood that we were the second party because we had the 
second highest number of members in this House.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	If the hon. member for Beaver River could stop talking, I could 
conclude my remarks.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, that is what we understood at the time. Had we been 
the third party, we would have settled the matter very quickly by 
following the practices of the previous Parliament. I think this goes 
without saying. It was often said at the beginning that the Bloc 
Quebecois was here to hinder proceedings. On the contrary, it is the 
third party, the Reform Party, that hinders the proceedings of this 
House with points of order, by calling into question the way 
committees operate. I thought that everything was clear. That party 
is the third party. If the  situation ever changes, things will be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14932"> 14932 </A></B>
<P>
different. It may become the fourth party but until then it is still the 
third party.
<P>
	In the meantime, let us apply existing rules and debate the real 
issues-because there are important problems in both Canada and 
Quebec-instead of fighting on matters that were rejected by that 
party two years and two whips ago.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to clarify something in this debate since I was the whip for the 
Reform Party at the time mentioned by the whip for the Bloc.
<P>
	I had understood that negotiations and exploration of issues 
between whips were confidential. Now we have the whip for the 
Bloc accusing and misrepresenting what those negotiations 
actually did. I object to that. That is not the kind of behaviour one 
would expect from someone of goodwill.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as you are aware because you were part of the 
discussions, the talk about chairmanships and vice-chairmanships 
of committees hinged around our contention that the Bloc was 
getting a disproportionate share of air time on question period. In 
order to quiet down those objections the Bloc made this offer of the 
vice-chairmanships of some of the minor committees.
<P>
	In our view the air time on question period and the proportion of 
questions asked should not be mixed up with vice-chairmanships of 
committees. That was our objection at the time. It remains our 
objection. It certainly should not be used to suggest that we are not 
interested in vice-chairmanships of committees. We just do not 
think those kinds of tradeoffs are appropriate.
<P>
	We have a situation in the House where there are two opposition 
parties, one of which is wanting to break up the country and one of 
which wants to get on with the national agenda. We think there 
should be fairness and parity at the very least in this situation, and 
that is what we are asking for in this point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We are getting into a rather long debate. Permit 
me to make these comments.
<P>
	The membership, as we all know, is struck by the House affairs 
committee pursuant to Standing Order 104(1) and it becomes a 
decision of the House. Citation 781 of Beauchesne's is a reference 
to a custom or a practice which has developed over time. It is the 
House that ultimately decides and that order should stand until the 
House decides otherwise.
<P>
	Members are asking the Speaker to make a decision which 
would virtually override the decision made by the House. I do not 
believe that the Speaker is empowered to do that. The Speaker is a 
servant of the House.
<P>
	Therefore, with all due respect, I believe that this should be left 
to the House affairs committee because it  has been empowered to 
appoint the membership pursuant to Standing Order 104(1). That is 
where I would like the particular matter to be solved.
<P>
<B>(1540 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just want to know, on a point of order, 
if the barbeque is still on tonight.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The response is yes, and you are going to have 
roasted Speaker.

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-45, an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act, the Criminal Code, the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and 
Reformatories Act, and the Transfer of Offenders Act, be read the 
third time and passed.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to move third reading of Bill 
C-45. This is a bill to update our corrections and parole system.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When I last spoke on this bill to open second reading debate, I 
noted that it was part of a strategic framework of initiatives that 
work together in order to carry out our red book agenda and 
demonstrated our commitment to safe homes and safe streets for all 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14934"> 14934 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This is a goal this government takes very seriously. Over the past 
year this government has been working hard and has consistently 
delivered on this commitment.
<P>
	We have brought forward amendments to the Young Offenders 
Act to respond to a number of concerns about it. Through Bill C-41 
we have reformed the sentencing process by placing a new focus on 
better addressing public safety, ensuring more consistency in 
sentencing, and being more responsive to the needs of victims.
<P>
	We have also made a lot of headway on preparing and presenting 
legislation on gun control, on a new witness protection program, 
and on DNA analysis. Also, legislation is being prepared within the 
government to take steps to deal with high risk violent offenders, 
which I will discuss further in my remarks.
<P>
	There is a widespread desire to ensure that we have an effective 
federal corrections and parole system. This makes it all the more 
important for us to look closely at problems that are identified and 
seek concrete and meaningful solutions to these problems.
<P>
	There may be some violent offenders who are unlikely to ever be 
able to lead law-abiding lives in the community. However, simply 
locking up more and more of the other kinds of offenders for longer 
periods of time will not achieve the long term safety of our 
communities that we all care about. Surely the United States 
experience proves this every day.
<P>
	Where a sentence of imprisonment is considered necessary by 
the court, we must be mindful that the vast majority of offenders 
are given definite sentences with fixed terms. Therefore, they will 
eventually be released into the community. A conditional release of 
most offenders at a point in their sentence that is consistent with 
public safety, along with support and surveillance in the 
community during the balance of the sentence and programming 
while incarcerated, would appear to provide the best chance for the 
offender to be a stable, law-abiding member of the community. I 
submit that this offers the best prospects for the safety of our 
communities in the long term.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 is one building block in this government's response to 
the complex issues involved in having a criminal justice system 
that contributes to the overall protection of the public and the 
safety of our communities. Bill C-45 by itself is not the sole 
answer, but I believe it makes important reforms that demonstrate 
forward movement.
<P>
	As I outlined to the House during second reading debate, the bill 
makes improvements in a number of substantive areas. There are 
situations where the protection of the public means the usual 
conditional release process should not apply. Therefore, the bill  
strengthens the detention process by responding to concerns about 
the early release of sex offenders who victimize children, which in 
the bill includes persons under the age of 18. The law will make it 
much easier for the parole board, at the request of the correctional 
service, to keep such persons in prison for their entire sentence. 
Where a further offence against the child is likely, such an offender 
can expect to serve the full sentence in custody without any period 
of conditional release in the community.
<P>
	I would like to reiterate that this measure is not needed because 
we believe sex offences against children are considered more 
serious than those against adult victims, but because the current 
legislation has proven less effective in cases involving children.
<P>
	The second main area of change in the bill relates to the 
accountability and credibility of the National Parole Board. There 
have been many changes in the board's operation in the past year. 
This government has placed an emphasis on recruiting 
experienced, knowledgeable individuals. I believe the 
government's record of appointments in the past year bears this 
out.
<P>
	The members of the board have an extremely difficult job to do, 
one that few of us in this Chamber would willingly take on. I think 
we should recognize the challenges involved and the dedication of 
the members. The board makes thousands of decisions a year and 
sometimes, despite everyone's best efforts, unforeseen tragedies in 
the community do occur. These are sad moments and are clearly 
very painful for those who are directly affected by them.
<P>
	Every effort possible is being made and will continue to be made 
to improve the quality of the board's decision making. To support 
this, the board has recently adopted a code of conduct as well as 
performance standards. Renewed emphasis has been placed on 
training and evaluation.
<P>
	Where problems arise and no other resolution has been 
successful, Bill C-45 provides for a review of the board member's 
performance and a process for remedial action to be taken. This 
amendment in Bill C-45 is there to be used where a board 
member's performance has clearly fallen below acceptable 
standards.
<P>
	Frankly, I think the provision will prove to be a success if it does 
not have to be used. This may seem paradoxical, but I say this 
because if it does not have to be used it will mean that we are 
appointing top-notch individuals, we are providing the necessary 
training and support, and that corrective action is being taken 
before serious problems arise in the performance of board 
members that would necessitate use of the new procedure. At the 
same time, if the House adopts this measure and it is adopted by the 
other place and given royal assent, which I hope and expect it will, 
then the procedure is in the act and of course it is there to be used if 
circumstances require it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14935"> 14935 </A></B>
<P>
	The third area of reform in the bill is the provision relating to 
calculating the sentences of offenders who commit multiple 
crimes or who reoffend while on conditional release during the 
sentence period. Clearly, tougher provisions are needed to deal 
with these repeat offenders. Bill C-45 will help eliminate the 
situation whereby many such offenders may be immediately 
eligible for parole, notwithstanding the imposition of a severe 
consecutive new sentence, something that is possible under the 
current law.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	Bill C-45 will cure in large measure the problem of the merger of 
sentences which has been raised with a great deal of concern by 
many organizations of the community, including police 
organizations. I hope this will help bring about the support of the 
House for this measure.
<P>
	A fourth area of reform will give the National Parole Board the 
authority to impose residency conditions on offenders being 
released on statutory release who pose some risk of committing a 
violent offence but who do not meet the detention criteria that 
would, if met, allow the National Parole Board at the request of the 
Correctional Service of Canada to detain a person until the end of 
that person's sentence. This amendment was brought by the 
government during clause by clause study of the bill in committee 
in response to recommendations by the Canadian Police 
Association, the Stephenson inquest, and the standing committee 
itself.
<P>
	Bill C-45 was one of the first bills to follow one of the new 
routes for legislation I proposed to the House as House leader and 
which was agreed to early in 1994. I am talking about referral of a 
bill to committee prior to second reading.
<P>
	The Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs devoted a 
great deal of time and energy to reviewing this bill. In a little over 
three months the committee heard from over 60 witnesses on both 
this bill and Bill C-41, the bill on sentencing. Those individuals 
who testified represented 32 different organizations, including 
victims' groups, police organizations, professional groups, 
women's groups, aboriginal organizations, as well as a range of 
organizations from the voluntary sector.
<P>
	During both the committee's clause by clause review and the 
debate during report stage in the House last week, a much broader 
range of motions was debated than would have been likely under 
the system of review of a bill in committee only after second 
reading.
<P>
	While I know that some members may have been disappointed 
that not all the motions they put forward were adopted, this new 
process allowed members to consider and discuss issues that 
otherwise would have simply been ruled out of order. I want to 
thank the members of the justice committee for their work and I 
want to point out that at least some of the suggestions  from 
members, including opposition members, have been accepted by 
the government.
<P>
	I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks several other 
important legislative initiatives taken by this government to help 
provide safer homes and safer streets for Canadians. As my 
parliamentary secretary reminded the House last week, significant 
advances have been made by this government over the past two 
years to protect the basic rights of Canadians to live in peaceful and 
safe communities.
<P>
	I want to conclude my remarks by mentioning some of the 
initiatives that were taken that did not need legislation to be 
adopted by this House.
<P>
	In November of last year I announced a national information 
system based on enhancements to the Canadian Police Information 
Centre, or CPIC. This will make more and better information 
available to organizations across the country to help them screen 
out convicted sex abusers applying for work with children. These 
improvements to CPIC have allowed organizations to more 
thoroughly screen the backgrounds of individuals applying for paid 
or voluntary work with children or other vulnerable persons.
<P>
	This government made a commitment in the red book to help 
prevent the sexual abuse of children by people in positions of trust 
and the government has acted on this commitment. While the CPIC 
system is now in place, as I have said, these measures will only be 
truly effective if organizations working with children are aware of 
the changes and the need for screening in general and make use of 
the new system. We have a role to play in providing leadership, 
education, and awareness to make sure this happens.
<P>
	Along with partners involving the Department of Justice, the 
Department of Health, and the Canadian Association of Volunteer 
Bureaus and Centres, work is under way to create educational 
materials and to deliver training to voluntary organizations across 
the country on screening volunteers and paid staff in positions of 
trust with children and other vulnerable individuals. These 
measures will help us to communicate the importance of screening 
to help prevent child abuse. I am sure this is a goal we all share.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	Another positive example of this kind of co-operative effort is 
recent work in the area of high risk offenders. In January of this 
year the Minister of Justice and I met with federal, provincial and 
territorial colleagues in Victoria to discuss the report of our task 
force on high risk offenders.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Not only did we achieve consensus around the criminal justice 
recommendations put forward in that report, we also had the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14936"> 14936 </A></B>
<P>
opportunity to meet jointly with  representatives from federal, 
provincial and territorial health ministers.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This allowed us to have a frank and useful discussion of those 
issues which crossed traditional criminal justice and mental health 
boundaries.
<P>
	I believe we must take a comprehensive view in developing 
meaningful solutions to the issue of high risk violent offenders. 
This involves seeking effective answers which draw on the 
facilities of federal, provincial and territorial systems.
<P>
	I think it was helpful that the task force looked at the system as a 
whole. It examined strategies at its front end as well as situations in 
which offenders are approaching release into the community. The 
report stressed and ministers endorsed a focus on improved 
measures at the front end of the system so we would hopefully have 
fewer problems arising at the eleventh hour when an offender is 
nearing the point of release.
<P>
	Implementation of the report is under way and we will continue 
to fully involve our provincial partners.
<P>
	Some of the matters in the report require further development 
before they can be put into operation, while we have been able to 
move more immediately on others. For example, I announced the 
implementation of a flagging system which will assist prosecutors 
in identifying cases which would be appropriate for a dangerous 
offender application.
<P>
	The House will recall that if the court at the time of conviction 
and sentencing rules the accused to be a dangerous offender, that 
person can be imprisoned indefinitely. In a large country such as 
Canada where there is a high degree of mobility it is not always 
easy for a provincial crown prosecutor in one corner of the country 
to have all the information available which would have a bearing 
on how a case may be prosecuted. The flagging system which also 
makes use of the Canadian police information centre will help 
make that information link.
<P>
	Similarly, a research project, the crown files project, is nearing 
completion. This project will provide concrete information about 
the factors which are significant predictors of dangerousness and 
which are central to successful dangerous offender applications.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice and I are also working on legislative 
changes to make it easier for provincial crown attorneys to make 
more frequent and more effective use than is the case at present of 
the existing dangerous offender provisions in the Criminal Code. 
One key element involves making an indefinite sentence of 
imprisonment the only sentencing option for those found by the 
courts to be dangerous offenders. Another would provide for new 
expanded presentence risk assessments in place of the current 
requirement for the evidence of  two psychiatrists, one for the 
prosecution and one for the defence.
<P>
	Another important amendment we are working on in line with 
the task force report is to change the Criminal Code to create a new 
category of long term offender which would give the courts a new 
sentencing option. This would require long term supervision of the 
offender for up to 10 years following the end of the offender's 
penitentiary term.
<P>
	In May the Minister of Justice and I convened a forum involving 
constitutional and legal experts, including those working with 
police and with victims groups, to tackle the matter of those 
offenders who remain dangerous at the end of their court imposed 
sentence. The forum was a productive session that is assisting us in 
addressing some very fundamental issues such as constitutional 
questions and how we identify those offenders with the greatest 
risk of reoffending in a violent manner.
<P>
	We are working to develop further legislative action to deal with 
this important and troubling aspect of the matter of high risk 
dangerous offenders.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	We must recognize the criminal justice system is a system. 
Activities and events in one part of it have a ripple effect through 
all the other parts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	More vigourous law enforcement places increased demand on 
courts and corrections, prosecutorial policies can direct more or 
fewer offenders to community or prison, the availability of 
community programs may determine what sentences courts view as 
realistic.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Actions seen as positive from one perspective may have 
unintended negative side effects. Clearly the criminal justice 
system is very complex. Moreover, the various segments which 
make it up come under the authority of different levels of 
government.
<P>
	Nevertheless, it is truly one which can work best only if it is well 
integrated and co-ordinated. It is clear all levels of government, all 
sectors of the system, social policy groups, police and victims 
groups must work together. That is one reason last year the 
government created a national crime prevention council.
<P>
	I believe we have made an extremely good beginning on 
improving the criminal justice system in the interests of all 
Canadians over the past few years. I thank members of the House 
for all their efforts on the criminal justice front and I look forward 
to our continuing good co-operation.
<P>
	I ask that the House give full and speedy approval to the bill in 
this third reading debate so its useful aspects, every part of the bill, 
can go into effect very soon to help ensure all Canadians have safer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14937"> 14937 </A></B>
<P>
homes, safer streets and  the best possible communities for 
themselves and for their children.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
spring in this House we debated Bill C-41 on sentencing. That bill 
was given royal assent on July 13. Bill C-45 is the legislative 
cousin of Bill C-41; it is a logical continuation to the bill on 
sentencing. One cannot function without the other, without placing 
the cohesion of our penal justice system in jeopardy.
<P>
	Bill C-41 has now become a sort of road map for judges in 
determining sentences. Bill C-45 attempts to do likewise for the 
members of parole boards. It lays out the path to take, the <I>modus 
operandi </I>to be followed.
<P>
	Today, we begin third reading of Bill C-45, a new step toward its 
passage by this House. This bill is wide-reaching in that it modifies 
the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, the Criminal Code, 
the Criminal Records Act, the Prisons and Reformatories Act, and 
the Transfer of Offenders Act.
<P>
	Bill C-45 does not reform the key principles underlying the 
detention of offenders, and that is a great pity. Despite its obvious 
shortcomings, however, Bill C-45 represents at least a baby step in 
the right direction. The Bloc Quebecois has always had protection 
of the public at heart, particularly the protection of child victims of 
sexual offenders.
<P>
	That protection requires a more rigid approach to parole, to the 
calculation of eligibility in consecutive or concurrent sentences, 
and to the conditions for release. A totally new tack is needed, but 
Bill C-45 veers only slightly off in a new direction, far too little.
<P>
	Public safety must no longer be jeopardized by efforts to 
rehabilitate offenders. The solicitor general has caught the germ of 
compromise from his colleague at justice.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	In its red book, the Liberal government promised to enhance 
public safety. Bill C-45, however, remains silent on protecting a 
specific category of victims.
<P>
	Let me explain. The bill will change the criteria used to 
determine whether the perpetrator of a sexual offence involving a 
child should serve his full sentence. At the present time, the 
Corrections and Conditional Release Act permits the National 
Parole Board to detain, until the end of their sentence, sex 
offenders and other high-risk offenders who are likely to commit an 
offence causing death or serious harm after their release.
<P>
	When the victims are children, the serious harm may not become 
apparent for a number of years. The victim may be too young to 
express the impact of what was done. It is therefore difficult for the 
Parole Board to prove that a child has suffered serious harm, to 
justify keeping an offender in detention.
<P>
	Clause 42 of Bill C-45 would, in the case of a sexual offence 
involving a child, relieve the National Parole Board of the need to 
establish the presence or likelihood of serious harm. It would be 
enough for the Board to be convinced of the likelihood of a further 
sexual offence involving a child before the expiration of the 
sentence according to law.
<P>
	In other words, if the Board is convinced that the risk is too 
great, the offender is kept behind bars. The burden of proof is 
substantially reduced.
<P>
	As I said earlier, this is a small step in the right direction. 
However, this measure only affects sexual offenders whose victims 
are children.
<P>
	What about adult women who are sexually assaulted? Are they 
not entitled to the same protection? When we talk about harm 
assessment, could the real harm possibly not become apparent until 
many years later in the case of women as well? If the individual 
assaulted a woman, it will be easier for him to get parole than if he 
assaulted a child.
<P>
	The entire public needs protection, children of course, but also 
women, the other victims of sexual abuse. The solicitor general 
should reread the preamble to Bill C-72 which is about the problem 
created by the use of self-induced intoxication as a defence in cases 
of sexual assault, for instance. The victim in the Daviault case was 
67 at the time of the assault.
<P>
	For the benefit of the minister and those who have again 
overlooked women as victims of sexual assault, this is what it says 
in the preamble of what is now Chapter 32 of the Statutes of 
Canada, 1995, and I quote: ``Whereas the Parliament of Canada is 
gravely concerned about the incidence of violence in Canadian 
society; whereas the Parliament of Canada recognizes that violence 
has a particularly disadvantaging impact on the equal participation 
of women and children in society and on the rights of women and 
children to security of the person and to the equal protection and 
benefit of the law as guaranteed by sections 7, 15 and 28 of the 
<I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I>; -whereas the 
Parliament of Canada desires to promote and help to ensure the full 
protection of the rights guaranteed under sections 7, 11, 15 and 28 
of the <I>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</I> for all Canadians, 
including those who are or may be victims of violence''.
<P>
	That is what this government has to offer the public. Hollow 
sounding words that mean nothing except to Liberals suffering 
from acute navel-gazing.
<P>
	The Liberal government says it wants to protect victims and 
potential victims, but when we look at the means it proposes to 
achieve this, we see the government still does not take this 
seriously.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14938"> 14938 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	I ask the solicitor general to go and recite this magnificent 
preamble to women who are victims of sexual aggression. I think 
he would have very attentive listeners.
<P>
	What victims of sexual aggression should be getting from the 
solicitor general is the assurance that their aggressors will remain 
behind bars as long as possible and not return to haunt them 
through premature release.
<P>
	What the solicitor general is telling them today is that they will 
not enjoy the protection the law should be giving them, because 
they were adults at the time the sexual aggression took place.
<P>
	In 1994, 31,690 cases of sexual aggression were reported in this 
country. The victims may be divided as follows: approximately one 
third of them were under 12 years of age; another third were 
between the ages of 12 and 17. This leaves us with more than 
10,000 adult victims. Are they not entitled to the same protection? 
Will the solicitor general finally have the courage to say that his 
promise of safer homes and safer streets applies to only one 
category of victim and not to others?
<P>
	The solicitor general confided to this House on September 20, 
1994, and I quote: ``Turning to the bill itself, I believe it is 
important because it addresses significant issues of public 
protection in the area of corrections and parole. These are issues on 
which this government promised action in that same red book as 
part of its agenda to bring about safe homes and safe streets for 
Canadians. With this bill we are delivering on these promises''.
<P>
	When the solicitor general said his government was delivering 
on its promises, I wonder what promises he is referring to. 
Certainly not the one about everyone being entitled to the same 
protection at home and in the street. The government did not 
deliver on this promise. Bill C-45 is merely the beginnings of a 
solution.
<P>
	I will give the solicitor general only a passing grade, because this 
is not the only failing of the bill.
<P>
	The solicitor general promised on September 20, 1994 as well, 
and I quote: ``We will also be making other improvements in the 
availability of treatment for sex offenders in the community and in 
prison''.
<P>
	In theory, gradual supervised reintegration into the community 
and the provision of help and support services constitute, according 
to some, the safest way for criminals to be released. I say in theory 
because, unless he agrees to undergo treatment, the offender may 
be a time-bomb just waiting for an early release to explode.
<P>
	Another major flaw of Bill C-45 is that it says absolutely nothing 
about the kind of treatment individuals found guilty of a sexual 
offence involving not only a child but any adult victim should be 
given. It is wrong to say that the mere fact of making treatment  
more easily available will automatically reduce the risk of repeat 
offences.
<P>
	Let me explain. At present, section 88 of the Corrections and 
Conditional Release Act states that treatment shall be conditional 
and dependent upon the inmate voluntarily giving an informed 
consent thereto and ``an inmate has the right to refuse treatment or 
withdraw from treatment at any time''.
<P>
	The treatment referred to includes the care of a disorder of 
thought, mood, perception, orientation or memory that 
significantly impairs judgment, behaviour, the capacity to 
recognize reality or the ability to meet the ordinary demands of 
life.
<P>
	In most cases, this treatment is for the very behaviour disorders 
that have landed the offender in prison.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	If treatment remains elective and dependent upon the good will 
of inmates, those who refuse treatment are in fact refusing to 
change their behaviour and will not have changed a single bit by 
the time they are released.
<P>
	The fact that Bill C-45 remains silent on this subject is 
disquieting to say the least. Remaining silent when it comes to 
tackling the real problem and boasting about keeping promises is 
the kind of attitude that is the trademark of this government. With 
respect to public safety, the solicitor general certainly did not 
deliver.
<P>
	We have every right to wonder why Bill C-45, whose provisions 
affect thousands of inmates who are released into our communities, 
remains silent in this respect.
<P>
	For example, in 1993, 10,317 inmates were granted full parole 
by national and provincial parole boards. Full parole is a form of 
conditional release, granted at the discretion of parole authorities 
that allows an offender to serve part of his sentence in the 
community.
<P>
	Parole boards are administrative tribunals with powers to grant, 
refuse, amend, end or revoke parole for inmates.
<P>
	Bill C-45 corrects a shortcoming that I have denounced several 
times in this House. The Federal Court has a general power of 
supervision over the National Parole Board. This is not enough. 
There was a need to develop some safeguard mechanisms within 
the framework of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.
<P>
	Bill C-45 provides for disciplinary or remedial measures against 
commissioners who do not follow good practices with competence 
and diligence.
<P>
	Under new clause 155.2, the chairperson may recommend that a 
member of the board be investigated. The investigator reports to 
the solicitor general and may recommend removal or suspension 
without pay if he thinks that the member in question is unable to do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14939"> 14939 </A></B>
<P>
the job properly, for example, because he or she is guilty of  
misconduct or has failed in the performance of his or her duties.
<P>
	The National Parole Board is an administrative tribunal with 
significant discretionary powers; the solicitor general had a duty to 
act on our repeated demands. For once, we got our message across 
to the other side of this House.
<P>
	As for the Reform members, it does not augur well. They 
continue to swagger about and think of themselves as gladiators in 
the parliamentary arena.
<P>
	It is easy to behave like a cowboy when discussing parole and 
conditional release. Our western cowboys do so every day with 
their thundering comments on sad cases which, I agree, still affect 
too many victims and their families. But it is easy to make political 
mileage at the expense of these people.
<P>
	We realize that our criminal justice system is not perfect and that 
there will always be room for improvement. Bill C-45 is flawed in 
certain respects, but it is nevertheless a step in the direction which 
the Bloc has always advocated.
<P>
	However, our reform cowboys would rather get rid of the whole 
system to bring justice to the victims. The wild west has a way of 
its own. The member for Wild Rose best exemplifies that way of 
doing things. During the debate at report stage, he invited the 
solicitor general's parliamentary secretary to visit his riding and to 
explain the government's ideas regarding Bill C-45. The member 
for Wild Rose said, and I quote: ``You want to sell my people in 
Wild Rose all your wonderful solutions to crime? You are welcome 
and good luck. If you think I am loud, wait until you get out there''.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	As you can see, Reform members have innate knowledge and 
they know what is good for Canada. This is yet another reason for 
Quebecers to distance themselves. Quebec uses a different 
approach because it does not deal with the same type of criminals. 
The results conclusively show that we are on the right track and 
that our system should serve as an example.
<P>
	In 1994, Quebec had the lowest rate in Canada for violent crimes 
of any category, including sexual assault, assault and kidnapping. 
Quebec also has the best record for other types of offence to the 
Criminal Code, including the violation of conditions for release on 
bail, crimes against public order, arson, prostitution and use of 
offensive weapons.
<P>
	Western solutions are not adequate for Quebec. Quebecers are 
peaceful people. They advocate civic-mindedness, tolerance and 
balanced solutions to their legitimate concerns regarding public 
safety. Although not perfect, Bill C-45 deserves the support of the 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not sure where the member who just spoke gets her information 
about the west. Perhaps she might want to visit out there. I live out 
west and I do not in any way meet the description which she has 
given the House. I am a little bemused by that kind of simplistic 
labelling. Perhaps she will have an opportunity to see other parts of 
the country one day.
<P>
	Today we are debating Bill C-45. It has been introduced in the 
House, examined by a committee and is now at third reading which 
means that if it passes third reading, it will become law very 
shortly. Therefore, I would like to give a bit of an analysis of this 
bill and whether it could be improved.
<P>
	As the House is aware, the Reform Party introduced quite a 
number of motions to this bill, none of which were accepted by the 
government. Those motions in our view would have gone a long 
way toward achieving the stated aim of the bill which is to make 
our justice and corrections system more effective, particularly in 
protecting the public. As most members know, there have been 78 
re-offences by people who were out on parole in the last year. 
These people have killed, terrorized and invaded the homes and 
lives of innocent people.
<P>
	Canadians have been asking for many months that something 
concrete and decisive be done about this situation. Therefore, we 
looked anxiously at Bill C-45 to see whether that had in fact been 
the result of this bill. Unfortunately we find that it is not.
<P>
	Bill C-45 is very technical. It has a lot of administrative details 
about the transfer of prisoners, the calculation of sentences and the 
figuring out of when people are eligible for parole and when they 
are not. However, there are some real flaws in the bill. It is 
interesting to note that the bill was floating around the Department 
of the Solicitor General in the last Parliament when the Tories were 
governing. It has now been introduced by the Liberals in a watered 
down version. It is not even as effective, as strong or as decisive as 
the original bill. We find that extremely unfortunate.
<P>
	We feel a number of the provisions in this bill should have been 
and could have been made much stronger and given a lot more 
teeth. We wish the government had listened to those proposals. 
Unfortunately it did not.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	For example, we talk about the detention of people who commit 
offences while on parole. When people are on parole, given a 
chance to go back out into society and be upright citizens, they 
have been told: ``You do not have to serve the whole sentence you 
have been given. Now you can go back out into society''. We do not 
have in the bill a requirement that when people abuse that privilege 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14940"> 14940 </A></B>
<P>
they have to serve the rest of the sentence they  should have served 
when they were out on parole and the entire sentence for the new 
offence. Again they are eligible for parole on the second offence 
they committed when they have already abused the privileges and 
the opportunity they were given as parolees. We really object to 
that.
<P>
	When offenders have shown once that they have no respect for 
the privilege of parole, an early opportunity not to have to serve 
their full sentence, why should they be given the same 
consideration the next time out? How many times do they have to 
be sentenced and not have to serve their full sentences before we 
start sending the message that we really mean business about 
people who violate the rights of others?
<P>
	That was not done in the bill. It should also have demanded full 
term detention for all dangerous offenders deemed capable of 
repeating their offences.
<P>
	As justice critics we visited prisons over the last few weeks to 
familiarize ourselves with aspects of the justice system. One of the 
questions I like to ask when we talk with prison administrators, 
representatives of guards and prisoners is: ``If there were one thing 
you could change about our justice system, what would it be?'' 
Quite often the answer includes some demand or plea.
<P>
	Officials and frontline workers in prisons know the offenders 
who are likely to reoffend. They know these people. They work 
with them every day. They know their attitudes. They know the 
way they think. They know the way they operate. They know how 
they respond to opportunities they have been given. They say: 
``When we know good and well that these people will reoffend, 
please let us keep them off the streets and out of our communities''.
<P>
	The bill was a golden opportunity for the government to allow 
that to happen. It did not do it and it did not support a Reform 
amendment that would have allowed it.
<P>
	There are administrators and guards in our prisons who say: 
``Please do not make us put these people who are a danger to 
society back out on the streets''. Our government says that it is all 
right and out they go. There has to be something wrong with our 
justice system. It is no wonder the people who work in the system 
are as frustrated as the citizens and the victims of repeat offenders.
<P>
	Other people have mentioned the concern in society that sexual 
assault is not deemed in and of itself to be a danger or to cause 
harm to adults. Clause 129(3) of the bill states that the parole board 
may order an offender not to be released from imprisonment before 
the expiration of his term if the board is satisfied that the offender 
is likely, if released, to commit an offence causing serious harm to 
another person or a sexual offence involving a child before the 
expiration of what otherwise would have been the offender's 
sentence.
<P>
	We are very unhappy with the distinction made in this clause 
between serious harm to another person and sexual offence 
involving a child. We would have thought that offenders who were 
deemed to be likely to commit a sexual offence against anybody 
should be made, at the very least, to serve their full term. Never 
mind going on, as we have suggested, and being incarcerated 
indefinitely if they are deemed to be likely to commit a sexual 
offence.
<P>
<B>(1635 )</B>
<P>
	Sexual offences against children are the only crimes that would 
make a person serve his full term. We just wonder about that. The 
government makes very loud noises about caring and compassion, 
particularly for women, and then it says that a sexual offence 
against an adult woman may not be deemed to be causing serious 
harm. It has to be shown that a sexual offence against an adult 
woman involves serious harm.
<P>
	Sexual offence against any female whether she is eight or eighty 
is by definition a serious harm to the individual. I am very 
surprised the government would make a distinction and say that 
sexual offences against children will keep somebody incarcerated 
and not be too concerned about sexual offences against any other 
woman of an older age. I object to that and I think all Canadians 
should object to that. I find it a very unacceptable distinction in the 
legislation.
<P>
	Much is made by the government side about holding the parole 
board more accountable. All the bill does is allow the chairman of 
the parole board to call an inquiry when an offender released on 
parole by the board reoffends. Can we imagine a chairman of the 
board who let an offender out who reoffended being the best person 
to decide when the actions and the decisions made by the parole 
board should be investigated? Is that not a bit like asking the fox to 
guard the hen house?
<P>
	If we have a parole board that has screwed up, that has let 
somebody out who has hurt other people, should the chairman of 
that body decide whether the particular decision should be 
investigated?
<P>
	One of our amendments was to mandate an investigation of the 
parole board decision in any case where an offender was let out into 
the public on parole and reoffended. Here we have a situation 
where only the chairman of the parole board can mandate that kind 
of investigation.
<P>
	When Liberal members applaud the bill as putting restrictions on 
the operations of the parole board, the public should be aware of 
how toothless those restrictions really are in that the power to hold 
the board accountable can only be exercised by the chairman of the 
board. Certainly that is not what the public has in mind when it 
talks about holding the parole board more accountable and having 
its foul-ups reviewed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14941"> 14941 </A></B>
<P>
	There was an opportunity in the bill to do a number of things 
that the public has been asking for. Yet we see that the bill has 
fallen far short. We in the Reform Party are in a real dilemma 
about the bill. The weak, almost ineffectual steps taken in the bill 
will not necessarily hurt anything. The government should have 
done much to help straighten out the system and get it more 
decisively and solidly on the side of making sure that our justice, 
corrections and parole systems really do the job for Canadians. 
The bill just does not do it.
<P>
	What do we do? There is nothing here we could not support 
because there is really nothing in there at all, except a bunch of 
administrative add-ons that may or may not make very much 
difference. How can we support a bill that should have done 
something substantive for Canadians, for the criminal justice 
system and for the reforms that the Liberals are so fond of talking 
about, promising and saying are a piece of the action, when it just 
does not deliver?
<P>
	On balance, when the government introduces a bill that should 
have done the job decisively, strongly and effectively and fails 
miserably, how can we support that? How can we say this is 
something worthy of support? We cannot do that.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	For some of the reasons I have mentioned and some of the 
reasons my colleagues will be mentioning, we say to the 
government that the bill is not good enough for Canadians. It is not 
something the House should support. It is not something we can 
even in any way suggest does the job that should be done.
<P>
	We ask the government to take back the bill and give us 
something that does the job. Then we will support it 100 per cent.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is an 
honour to speak today on the motion for third reading of Bill C-45, 
an act to amend the Corrections and Conditional Release Act and 
related statutes.
<P>
	Recent polls and letters received from constituents indicate that 
crime is a major concern among Canadians today. Among other 
vital issues such as national unity and the health care system, 
individuals are greatly concerned with crime. Only matters relating 
to the economy and the deficit seem more important to our fellow 
citizens. It is clear that the government must assume leadership in 
this area.
<P>
	We have already made a commitment to address the issue. The 
red book stipulated our commitment to fight crime and violence by 
more effective measures and social reform. Last fall the solicitor 
general introduced the bill as part of a strategic framework of 
initiatives for safe homes and safe streets for all Canadians.
<P>
	I will address the second main area of change resulting from Bill 
C-45, the accountability of National Parole Board members. 
However first let me briefly explain the concept of parole.
<P>
	Canada's discretionary conditional release system is based on 
the principle that a gradual, controlled re-entry to the community 
better serves the interests of public safety than does direct release. 
It is a way of managing with supervision and conditions the 
transition from incarceration to life in the community. The 
numbers support the principle.
<P>
	Clearly the performance of the National Parole Board is only as 
good as the decision it makes. Consequently the credibility and 
accountability of the board are directly linked to the qualifications 
and judgment exercised by its own members and to the quality, 
completeness and accuracy of the information provided to the 
board for review. The requirement for board members to have the 
relevant skills and knowledge to make sound decisions is essential 
in order to perform their responsibilities professionally.
<P>
	Board members face the difficult task of making decisions about 
the timing and conditions of an offender's release in a manner that 
contributes to the long term protection of society. It is therefore 
only logical that the individuals who make those decisions are 
chosen from the best qualified candidates.
<P>
	As mentioned by my hon. colleagues, there has already been 
considerable progress in this area and in others. Over the last 
several months a number of important events and activities have 
taken place which have helped to shape a renewed course for the 
National Parole Board.
<P>
	This was largely brought about with the appointment of a new 
chairperson, Mr. Willie Gibbs, who brought to the board 
impressive knowledge and experience in the criminal justice 
system. Mr. Gibbs was chosen after a comprehensive selection 
process, and a similar system is now in place for all member 
appointments. Already new board members have been recruited 
under these provisions. It should be noted also that the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs has the ability, which it has 
been using, to call new appointees before the committee for 
questioning.
<P>
	Let me explain these measures in more detail. These 
appointment provisions include a set of revised criteria which all 
applicants must meet, emphasizing experience and knowledge of 
the criminal justice system and in particular corrections and 
conditional release systems in Canada.
<P>
	National Parole Board vacancies are now advertised in the 
Canada <I>Gazette</I> and include the qualifications and abilities 
required. After a screening process those who ranked highest in 
meeting the criteria are interviewed by a committee chaired by 
either the chairperson or the executive vice-chair of the National 
Parole Board. A list  of successful candidates is then submitted to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14942"> 14942 </A></B>
<P>
the Solicitor General of Canada. That list is then reviewed and sent 
to the Privy Council Office for the final appointment.
<P>
	In all regions of Canada applicants have gone through the 
process and new part time and full time board members have been 
selected.
<P>
<B>(1645 )</B>
<P>
	The revised appointment process does not preclude the fact that 
current board members are competent, but it does underscore that 
the Government of Canada recognizes the difficulties of being a 
board member and ensuring the challenges are met with the kind of 
knowledge and competence these positions demand.
<P>
	In addition to the improvements I have already mentioned, the 
National Parole Board adopted a code of professional conduct and 
performance standards to guide all board members in their duties. 
The specific provisions of the code of professional conduct cover 
such areas as promotion of integrity and independence, general 
conduct, conflict of interest, decision making, conduct during 
proceedings, continuing professional development, and 
disqualification and reporting, to name just a few.
<P>
	These standards and the code of conduct were created to better 
articulate board members' individual accountability as decision 
makers and to preserve the integrity of the board itself. They 
represent the members' acceptance of the highest ideals of 
professional conduct and the responsibility of board members for 
decisions that directly affect the interests and safety of entire 
communities as well as individual victims, offenders, and their 
families. Most important, these high standards promote respect for 
the law and will help to improve public confidence.
<P>
	The proposed amendments for the adoption of a disciplinary 
system for board members were made in order to correct a board 
member's performance if it has fallen below acceptable standards. 
The enactment authorizes the chairperson of the National Parole 
Board to recommend to the minister that an inquiry be conducted 
by a federal court judge to determine whether a board member 
should be suspended without pay, be removed from his or her 
office, or be subject to other disciplinary or remedial measures. 
This measure is not intended to second guess board members or to 
respond punitively where a case has gone wrong despite everyone's 
best efforts. Rather, this would be a review mechanism available 
where a member is clearly not performing up to acceptable 
standards.
<P>
	The solicitor general has stated that he hopes this provision will 
never be used. I am confident this is a hope all of us share on all 
sides of the House, as it will mean that the renewed appointment 
process and proper training are working well.
<P>
	The solicitor general also mentioned the need to improve the 
quality of decision making at the National Parole Board. This is 
another area in which the board continues to adapt to changing 
needs to ensure the best possible decisions are made. These 
measures have already been implemented and I name here just a 
few.
<P>
	First, the board has created a national training framework. Board 
members require comprehensive orientation and continuous and 
continual training and development to keep abreast of changes in 
law, policies and procedures, risk assessment and management, and 
generally to improve their performance.
<P>
	Second, thorough reviews of specific case audits in national 
investigations are used as training tools to ensure procedures are 
followed and duties are performed in accordance with the law. 
Investigation findings and recommendations may also be used in 
performance appraisal systems.
<P>
	Third, all board members are currently subject to annual reviews 
of their performance. The first round of appraisals is now 
completed and has provided the board with an opportunity to 
address any weaknesses identified, provide the needed training, 
and take appropriate corrective action in certain cases.
<P>
	Fourth, a new training package is provided to board members, 
which addresses the area of risk assessment alone. This cohesive 
training package focuses on how current research, theory, and 
opinion in the human and social sciences can assist National Parole 
Board members in their decision making relating to risk 
management and risk reduction.
<P>
	It is obvious that despite the most recent and precise risk 
assessment tools available, tragedies can and do occur. These 
tragedies affect all of us deeply and we must react by seeking 
solutions to prevent further tragedies. However, we have all come 
to recognize that each case represents different and often complex 
challenges and that even the best research can yield less than 
perfect predictions of reoffending. Our corrections and conditional 
release system is based on human assessments of fellow human 
beings. Even with all of the available information, predicting 
human behaviour has never been and will never be an exact 
science.
<P>
	I think it is important for Canadians to have a clear 
understanding about the success of parole as measured by 
recidivism rates. A successful parole is measured by completion of 
sentence time without revocation of parole. Follow-up studies done 
for the parole board over the last few years have shown a success 
rate of approximately 70 per cent for full parole releases granted by 
the board. Studies showed that some 15 per cent of full parolees 
were returned to prison because of breach of a parole condition, 
while 13 per cent committed a new crime.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14943"> 14943 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Primary consideration of any parole board decision revolves on 
the concern always for public protection. We should also note that 
the average annual cost to incarcerate an adult in Canada is 
$46,000, while supervision of an adult in the community costs on 
average $8,500 per year.
<P>
	There are other areas in which we can work together to minimize 
the risk posed by offenders. Bill C-45, including its changes to the 
National Parole Board, clearly represents a step toward the 
government's commitment to public safety and security. The 
changes dealing with the National Parole Board have not been 
created and will not be carried out in a vacuum. They are only as 
good as the criminal justice system in which they operate. Every 
effort must be made to work in partnership with other agencies and 
with the communities we represent so that use of the limited 
government resources is maximized to ensure public safety at 
every stage in the offender's contact with the criminal justice 
system.
<P>
	As the MP for London West, I have spent time in my city visiting 
the facilities and the people involved with our parole system. As 
the solicitor general has stated, the system will work best if it is 
well integrated and co-ordinated.
<P>
	I am sure we all seek an efficient, professional corrections and 
conditional release system. To this end, I join with my other 
colleagues in the House in urging all members of the Chamber to 
support the amendments reflected in Bill C-45.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do have one question relating to the statistics and the demographics 
the hon. member has put before the House.
<P>
	I constantly hear from the government, in particular in the last 
speech, about success rate, how successful the parole board has 
been and how successful the management of crime has been as far 
as the government is concerned. I would like to ask what the 
member would do or what the government would do with the 
unsuccessful circumstances. For instance, I got a telephone call in 
my riding from a parole board member who went on and on about 
the 87 per cent success rate. I reminded that individual that this 
means there is a 13 per cent failure rate and that it is the failures 
that are affecting family after family.
<P>
	When will the government look at the failure problem and not 
rely on statistics from the government department that has the 
problems? Those statistics are typically about success rates. Could 
the member please respond?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question.
<P>
	The parole system is very difficult to understand if you have not 
been involved with it personally or if it has not been thoroughly 
explained.
<P>
	Failures will always occur in any system invented and dealt with 
by humans. Unfortunately, we are not clones of one perfect being 
on this planet and there will be error. We have to strive to create the 
best system we are capable of.
<P>
	The law will change and will continue to change. I do not think 
any of these ministers who are trying to accommodate the concern 
of the public and the reality of our system of justice in the country 
will stop providing better and better legislation as time goes on. We 
move forward one step at a time. What I want to point out to the 
member though, is that what this act talks about are sections 
dealing with the parole decisions. It is a fact that we do have more 
successful interventions by our justice system with the parole 
system where people get conditional releases than if they just hit 
the wall where they are released into the public, where there is no 
parole given.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	In actual fact, our success rate is much higher than if somebody 
comes to the end of the time they have to serve by law and walks 
onto the street, because there has been no management in the 
community with the assistance and the tools that we can provide, 
and this act provides, if we just say the time is up and let them go. 
Our success rate is better with this parole system. Fortunately for 
Canadians, these are the statistics and they are correct.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I read with 
great attention the speech by the hon. member. I found it 
interesting, especially when it comes to improving the parole 
board. I think there is a need to improve the way the board operates 
as well as the appointment process. I hope that the government will 
keep its word because we were also promised that there would be 
no partisan appointments to the IRB, the Immigration and Refugee 
Board, that appointments would be based on competence, but we 
are not quite there yet.
<P>
	My question has to do with the application of this bill. Why does 
it not apply to sexual offenders whose victims are adult women? As 
the hon. member for Saint-Hubert said, last year, over 10,000 cases 
involved adults and not only sexually abused children.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Barnes:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member across the 
way. I do want to address that, because there is a misapprehension 
that we somehow care less about adult sexual assault victims. That 
is not the case.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14944"> 14944 </A></B>
<P>
	The case is that we really want an equalized treatment. Most 
adult women who are sexually assaulted do realize and recognize 
very rapidly the impact of that assault and are usually in some 
manner able to articulate that well. The parole board can be given 
information by the victim of that assault and that will be in the 
case preparation material. They can file materials that will help 
build that case. But that is not true and that has not worked for 
young sexual assault victims. There are many instances where 
young children are sexually assaulted and they have great 
difficulty in articulating this and sometimes keep secret what 
happened.
<P>
	In that instance, we have taken corrective action in this act. It is 
not to minimize assault to any person, but there is a mechanism 
there to prevent something that was not allowing us to realize the 
impact of the serious harm done to somebody.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
a pleasure for the fifth time to speak on Bill C-45.
<P>
	Before addressing some of the specific things that are not in this 
bill and are in fact refused by this government to be put in this bill, 
I want to talk about a couple of semi-quotes that were spoken here 
today.
<P>
	First, my colleague across the way says that we must move 
forward one step at a time. This is once again the Liberal way of 
managing, one step at a time. It astounds me that this government 
cannot take a bigger step rather than one little step at a time. What 
is the problem with this government which insists we take just a 
little bit at a time? A good example is the Young Offenders Act that 
the justice minister spoke about at noon today in front of the 
Parliament buildings. He expounded on how good a job the 
Liberals have done on the Young Offenders Act. It is a poor job. It 
is an abysmal failure. One only has to ask the victims of violence 
groups who are involved with the Young Offenders Act what they 
think. They will tell you it is an abysmal failure. One step at a time 
is not good enough today.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I have a couple of other comments. The solicitor general in 
talking to this bill said: ``Sex offences are considered more serious 
against children than adults''. Just where does a Liberal 
government get that idea from?
<P>
	I could refer the government time and time again to cases I have 
been involved with relating to adults who were viciously and 
sexually attacked who would disagree with that comment. I know a 
lady by the name of Joan who is watching now. We went to court 
together to deal with the creep who got her. Joan is 63 years old. I 
do not think for a minute that Joan, who was sexually attacked, 
would agree that sex offences are considered more serious against 
children than adults. What kind of statement is that coming from 
any government much less a Liberal government?
<P>
	The previous speaker said: ``Most adults realize the effects of a 
sexual assault''. That is some kind of convoluted reasoning to 
provide more impetus, something for the victims of child assault 
than for adults. What kind of reasoning is that? Most adults realize 
the effects of a sexual assault. That is a reason to downplay the 
effects of a sexual assault on an adult? What kind of logic do we 
have in this House of Commons?
<P>
	They can shake their heads but we are right.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> You're far right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Far right, thank you.
<P>
	The solicitor general talked about bringing forward the Young 
Offenders Act and how the government did a good job on it. He 
then talked about gun control, another abysmal failure of dealing 
with crime. We now have to realize that the largest percentage of 
this bill was in the House before. You may recognize it. It was 
brought in by that party from Jurassic Park. That goes to show us 
where those two parties come from, the same bent. There is no 
change and there is no plan.
<P>
	There is going to be some accountability in the National Parole 
Board. When I asked my question of the previous speaker I asked it 
for a clear reason. It was because of the numerous discussions I 
have had with parole board members and my attendance at 
numerous parole board hearings. The difficulty I have with some of 
the reasoning of the government comes from the fact that it leans 
on success rates. Success rates, while nice, do not give any 
accommodation to the failure rates, the victims.
<P>
	When a parole board member phones me and says they have an 
87 per cent success rate, I tell them to give some thought about the 
13 per cent failure rate. Those are the people coming through our 
doors.
<P>
	Let us have a little look to see what things were put forward to 
the government by the Reform Party which the government said: 
``No, we reject that in Bill C-45''. Let us see if the Canadian people 
would agree with this Liberal government. We said: ``Why not 
provide for compensation to victims of crime and for medical 
treatment for victims of sexual assault to be paid for by the 
perpetrator?'' Was that accepted by the government? No, indeed. 
Why? Ask a Liberal. If Canadians were to ask the people on this 
side of the House we would say there is more to the problems of a 
victim than just room and board payback.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	This is the government that still gives old age security and CPP, 
guaranteed income supplement, GST rebates to inmates. The 
government is still intent on saying it can now introduce a 30 per 
cent charge for room and board. Come on.
<P>
	We talked about no statutory release for violent offenders. 
Would the government go along with that?  No, it would not. What 
is wrong with no statutory release for violent offenders? The 
government knows darn well that the greater percentage of inmates 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14945"> 14945 </A></B>
<P>
will reoffend when they get out. If it does not believe that through 
statistical data it should ask the wardens, talk to the inmates. They 
will confirm it.
<P>
	We said: ``Why not ensure that criminals serve their full 
sentences if conditional release is revoked or suspended?'' What is 
wrong with that? The Liberals do not agree. In other words, if an 
inmate gets out on unescorted temporary absence and reoffends he 
is hauled back in. His parole is revoked but he is entitled to apply 
and gets back out on parole. If these people are getting out on 
parole, perpetrating the same or similar crimes, do you think they 
have been rehabilitated? Do you really think it is a wise idea to 
allow them to apply for parole again? My goodness.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask that the hon. member please 
direct his remarks to the chair. I would be most obliged if he would 
do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is 
something wrong with this kind of thinking. In one particular 
parole board hearing I was at an individual was before it for a 
revocation of his parole. He was a fraud artist. What was he doing? 
He was up setting up his next scam while on parole. What 
happened? His parole was revoked. Is he entitled to get back out? 
Yes, indeed. He can apply again for parole.
<P>
	Something has to be wrong somewhere if the government cannot 
acknowledge the fact that there has not been rehabilitation, that this 
individual will reoffend and that it is not healthy for the victims to 
allow him out. That does not seem like such a difficult problem to 
resolve.
<P>
	We said that we would ensure that criminals served their full 
sentences if conditional release is revoked or suspended. The 
government said no, it cannot agree with that.
<P>
	Let us talk about a child sex offender registry. We suggested that 
a complete registry be established. The government says: ``No. Do 
not do that. CPIC will look after it''. CPIC is the system run by the 
police.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Why can the Liberals not acknowledge the fact that everybody is 
concerned about sex offenders and everybody wants and should 
have the right to know? They should have that right.
<P>
	If I am living in any community in this country, before my 
children go out on the street I want to know if there is a sex 
offender living next door. It is not appropriate simply to leave it to 
the police. The police are not going to sit outside this guy's door all 
day long.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are too busy registering guns.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> It only stands to reason that 
the police get involved with the next sex offence of that sex 
offender after he perpetrates the crime. The best defence for 
victims is to know who is living next door or down the street.
<P>
	That is why people like Sandra Cunningham are leaders in this 
country. She was out in front listening to the wonderful words of 
the justice minister today. She prints the tri-cities child care guide. 
She prints the pictures, the MOs, the dossiers of pedophiles. That is 
necessary in this country.
<P>
	I know there is not much agreement across the way because 
probably that pedophile's rights have been infringed upon.
<P>
	Alan Winter came from my riding. The Liberals call these 
isolated incidents. I have more isolated incidents in my riding than 
most. At last count Alan Winter had victimized 31 children. He was 
incarcerated as a dangerous offender. He got 16 years. 
Unbeknownst to every single one of those victims he was allowed 
out in just over five years. Nobody knew he was out. There was no 
registry. I am not even sure the police knew about him. The only 
reason they found out is because more victims were going to lay 
charges against him and they said: ``He is not in here any more''. It 
does not make sense. This is not partisan politics, this is the real 
world. These are real, sincere problems.
<P>
	Another amendment we asked for was a mandatory review of 
parole board decisions where a violent offender is released early 
and commits another violent offence during release time. That was 
rejected by the government.
<P>
	I have spoken about Wayne Perkin in the House more than once. 
Motion No. 19 was very appropriate for Wayne Perkin. Good old 
Wayne knocked on a door in Aldergrove in my riding and 
encouraged the lady to go out in her garden shed to get a 
lawnmower. When she went in with him what did good old Wayne 
do? He beat her over the head with a hammer, taped her hands 
behind her back, injected her with cocaine and raped her. That was 
not sexual assault as the lawyers would call it, it was rape.
<P>
	What did Wayne get courtesy of our judiciary in Canada? Six 
years. Her life will never be the same.
<P>
<B>(1715 )</B>
<P>
	The parole board let him out early, the good old parole board. 
What did Wayne do? One would think maybe a miracle had 
happened and after two or three years and maybe good old Wayne 
turned into a good fellow. Maybe he took an anger management 
course. They let him out early.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dhaliwal:</B> Do not get too angry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Do not get too angry? What 
do these people think we are talking about here?  Good old Wayne 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14946"> 14946 </A></B>
<P>
went into an apartment and injected Angela Richards with cocaine. 
Is this familiar? He stabbed her 20 times, killing her.
<P>
	When I was sitting in court during the sentencing I thought there 
was something missing in the courtroom besides the 50 of us who 
were allowed in crying. Where was the parole board that let him 
out early? Angela Richards would be alive today. The board should 
have been sitting there listening to the rest of us cry. Then there 
should have been a mandatory review. Those responsible should 
have been fired and taken out the door as fast as Wayne Perkin was 
when he was let out of prison.
<P>
	What do we ask for in the bill? We would have required a 
mandatory review of parole board decisions when a violent 
offender is released early and commits another violent offence 
during release time. Is that too much to ask? The answer over there 
is no, we do not need that.
<P>
	Perhaps the Wayne Perkin case was an isolated incident. The 
members across know it was not. For the life of me I do not 
understand why these backbenchers do not get on the cabinet to get 
its members to change their minds on some of these things.
<P>
	It is like digging holes on a beach; the water keeps coming and 
the sand keeps filling the hole. How do we make this government 
listen? How many people does it take out in front of the House of 
Commons to put some sense into a Liberal government? Is it that it 
just wants a really good fight in the next election? We will see who 
comes out on top on this issue.
<P>
	What I talked about the other night bears repeating, the mentality 
we are dealing with in corrections today. If I can recall all 23 
reasons why it pays to be a criminal in this country I will riddle 
them off. We are talking about charging an inmate 30 per cent for 
room and board. It is not 70 per cent, not 100 per cent, but 30 per 
cent. They cannot have very much behind closed doors in prison.
<P>
	Let us see what an inmate gets in prison and what our senior 
citizens or those with little or no income get on the outside. We 
know they get room and board. We know they get counselling, 
which is good. Anger management courses always work, they say. 
They have the right to refuse to work. They get free condoms, let us 
not forget that. They have the right to call their legal aid lawyer 
when they want. It is ironic that we have a government today that 
had to serve an injunction to Clifford Olson to stop him from filing 
lawsuits against the crown. At last count he had 30.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	They have bleach for their needles; project bleach, as it is called 
in my riding. They get a one ounce bottle of bleach to prevent the 
spread of HIV. They sterilize their needles for cocaine intake.
<P>
	Wait a minute, something tells me this is the same kind of logic 
we are dealing with for the parole board. There is a better way. Stop 
the drugs from coming into the prison. They are not allowed 
alcohol in prisons so perhaps they would allow the prisoners to 
have Diet Coke and ice cubes in the event they bring in booze. This 
is the convoluted logic we see.
<P>
	Let us not forget any additional income an inmate may have. 
They get old age security. I found one individual, a double 
murderer, getting old age security. My grandmother would be less 
than pleased about that. They get the Canada pension plan, the 
guaranteed income supplement and GST rebates.
<P>
	It is so frustrating to drive by Ferndale penitentiary, a couple of 
miles from my house, and see a nine hole golf course. It is 
frustrating when the law-abiding citizen has to go up the road and 
pay $30 or $40. I asked the warden why there was a nine hold golf 
course. The answer was for rehabilitation. They have to learn to get 
along on the outside. There is a difference. Many of us do not golf 
today. It is expensive. All of us have to pay for it.
<P>
	If the government is trying to rehabilitate them I suggest it is 
going about it the wrong way. If members think this is Reform 
rhetoric, ask the employees of corrections. They will say some of 
this is a waste of time. It is not right.
<P>
	When we compare people on the outside to people on the inside 
we wonder who is getting punished. They offer lots of taxes. They 
offer frustration. When we checked to see how much smokes are 
inside a prison compared with outside, they run anywhere from 42 
cents to $1.62 cheaper per pack.
<P>
	With Bill C-45 the government is out to lunch.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
from the comments I have heard from the Reform member, one 
would think we were opening up the prison gates and letting the 
prisoners go free all over the country to commit murder and 
mayhem. What we are doing is tightening up the system, 
toughening up the system, having more concern for the protection 
of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	I suppose if the Reform Party members were writing this bill it 
would be perfect and another crime would never be committed in 
Canada. If Reform Party members are planning to vote against this 
piece of legislation perhaps they would like to explain why they 
want to vote against holding parole board members more 
accountable for decisions they make and why they want to vote 
against retaining people who are a danger to society, particularly a 
danger to children.
<P>
	I do consider a crime against a child as the most serious, most 
heinous crime that can be committed. That is not one bit to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14947"> 14947 </A></B>
<P>
undermine the horrendous damage done by any crime against any 
person, particularly a crime of violence or crimes that violate the 
sanctity of the person, as sexual assault or rape does.
<P>
	When added to that is the abuse of the innocence of a child, I 
regard that as the most horrible thing anyone can do. As a woman I 
well understand-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Fraser Valley West 
will have the right to reply.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not right to 
assume the Liberals would be opening up the gates and letting these 
prisoners go free. In many cases I am not sure why they would want 
to go free. That was precisely my point.
<P>
	It is difficult to oppose at times some bills in the House. This is 
where I get to the problem with the Liberal government legislation. 
Those members come half way to doing the job and we are saying 
the government has to take it all the way.
<P>
	What do we do? We are in a conundrum of either supporting it or 
saying the government has not gone far enough. The government 
makes it difficult in those situations to get agreement from this 
side. That is truly unfortunate because the amendments to the bill I 
mentioned were not unreasonable.
<P>
	The example the member gave about a crime against a child 
being a more severe crime is not the point. The point is if there is a 
sexual crime against a child or an adult, make them both tough. Do 
not isolate the child. Make it child and adult. Why could the 
government not have done that? That is the point.
<P>
	The government is taking these issues half way. If it would take 
them all the way and incorporate some of these things and toughen 
up on this crime like the people of the country are asking for, there 
would be support from this side of the House.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="THEUNDERGROUNDECONOMY">THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY</A></H3>
	The House resumed, from May 18, 1995, consideration of the 
motion that, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the following initiatives for addressing the underground 
economy: (<I>a</I>) an enhanced information campaign to educate the 
public and to encourage their participation in addressing the 
problem; (<I>b</I>) a limited amnesty on interest and penalties otherwise 
payable when a taxpayer voluntarily declares income  previously 
undeclared; (<I>c</I>) a tax credit to taxpayers on home improvements 
and renovations to provide an inducement to create the essential 
paper trail and to serve as one of the primary vehicles for the 
information campaign.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on the motion put forward by the hon. member for 
Mississauga South regarding the underground economy. I would 
like to begin by addressing the thrust of his proposal and comment 
on its three elements, because this proposal is really threefold.
<P>
	Let me say right away that we agree with the thrust of the 
proposal, because I think everyone agrees that action must be taken 
to tackle the problem of underground economy. There are all kinds 
of numbers being put forward and debates taking place, some 
excessive, some not, but the fact remains that a lot of money is 
slipping through the government's fingers.
<P>
	Naturally, taxpayers are not the only ones at fault here. It is 
because the tax system is becoming more and more complex and 
less and less acceptable to taxpayers, to the point that they feel 
justified in turning to the underground economy.
<P>
	Let us look at the three components of the member's motion. 
First, he proposes an enhanced information campaign to educate 
the public. I think everyone will agree with that suggestion. 
However, we must be careful not to end up with some complex 
bureaucratic structure merely to explain the harmful consequences 
of an underground economy.
<P>
	I think the public is quite well aware of the issue. However, such 
a measure would certainly be useful, and it would also be 
consistent with the concept of the people's responsibility as 
citizens. As elected representatives, we all have an obligation to 
promote individual responsibility, and we must also serve as an 
example. It might be necessary to make some members and 
ministers aware of the impact of the measures which they take and 
which lead people to reject our tax system.
<P>
	The second proposed initiative is a limited amnesty on interest 
and penalties otherwise payable when a taxpayer voluntarily 
declares previously undeclared income.
<P>
	Our system already provides for an amnesty on penalties for 
voluntary disclosures. As for the interest payable, we have to be 
cautious. Such a measure should be of a temporary nature, should 
have a time limit set. Otherwise, some people might be tempted to 
not declare income in a given year, since they would not have to 
pay any interest, even if they got caught. Such a scheme would 
enable these people to use the money for a year or two, before the 
department tracked them down.
<P>
	If we are to have an amnesty, it should be defined and limited in 
time. It would be a way to go back to square one and do things 
properly from then on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14948"> 14948 </A></B>
<P>
	The third part of the motion is an interesting approach that 
should be explored. When we talk about the underground 
economy, what comes to mind most of the time is the construction 
industry. The underground economy flourishes there because 
regulations are so complicated. There are other consequences, but 
that industry is very much affected by underground activity, and 
sooner or later we will have to regain control over that industry 
because we are losing a lot of revenue. Entrepreneurs who want 
to operate within the law have a hard time fending off fierce 
competition. Just about everywhere, things are done under the 
table.
<P>
	A tax credit for taxpayers seems like a good approach, but we 
should determine how far we are willing to go, how much the credit 
should be compared to the savings to be made by turning to the 
underground economy, because that is what the population will try 
to figure out, and how much it will cost the government compared 
to the revenues the tax credit will generate. If the credit is not high 
enough, it will not work. It will cost us more than before, and only 
some people will use it. But this is a good start, an approach to 
consider.
<P>
	However, it must be done in close co-operation with the 
provinces, especially where Quebec is concerned. Each province 
may have its own set of rules for the construction industry, and the 
approach used must be consistent with the way tax revenues are 
generated in this sector.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mississauga South has moved a motion 
which makes a lot of sense and which we will support. I would like 
however to address other concerns I have about the underground 
economy.
<P>
	There was a lot of discussion in this House, in Canada and in 
Quebec when the GST was introduced. Many people link the 
increasing popularity of the underground economy with the 
implementation of the GST. I would like to remind everyone that 
the GST was not a new tax. It replaced another tax which the 
population did not see, because it was hidden, but the GST did 
replace another tax. What is new is that the GST applies to 
services.
<P>
	When we talk about the underground economy and the taxation 
of services, we have a problem, because nothing is easier to avoid 
than a service tax. When a carpenter, a plumber or an electrician 
comes to your house and does not charge for his labour by the hour, 
it is very hard to find out whether he did or did not work or how 
long he worked. Ever since the government decided to get into 
taxing services, there is one element that is almost impossible to 
control because it all depends on the good faith of the public, a 
public that felt governments were taxing them enough already. This 
new tax has increased public dissatisfaction.
<P>
	Oddly enough, I saw a poll when we were considering the 
GST-which has yet to be amended, but I will get to that-and it 
seems people work harder to avoid the GST than they do to avoid 
paying income tax. This despite the  fact that income tax rates are 
often 30, 35, 40 or 45 per cent, which means 30, 35, 40 or 45 cents 
on a dollar earned, while in Quebec, the combined QST and GST is 
14 per cent. Nevertheless, people will work harder to avoid the 
GST because they are upset by this tax and find it very hard to 
accept it.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Much of this can be blamed on the Liberal Party opposite. When 
the GST was adopted, they were up in arms and even made a major 
commitment during the last election campaign to abolish the tax. 
After that they said very discreetly that they wanted to replace it 
with something else. Once in power, they said they could not afford 
to forgo 15, 16 or 17 billion dollars worth of revenue, depending on 
the year. Something else had to be found. But how, meanwhile 
trying to convince people that they got rid of the tax? Voters are not 
easily fooled and talk about it to their members, I am sure, because 
these are subjects that often come up in caucus meetings, 
apparently. Their commitment was not met because they were 
forced to collect this revenue, contrary to their campaign promises.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has repeated this in the House. I quote him 
from memory but correctly I think: ``We hate that tax and we are 
going to abolish it''. That was two years ago. In my opinion 
discussing a tax, replacing it or abolishing it, can take a certain 
amount of time from the point the decision is taken. In reality, 
application can take a minimum of six months, generally at least a 
year, due to the time needed to explain it, to have people 
understand it, to try to gain its acceptance.
<P>
	So two years of the mandate are down now, and after three years, 
for it will take at least a year, there will still have been no change, 
because agreement with the provinces on taxation reform is not 
possible.
<P>
	There is a problem when the government creates expectations, 
when it wants to make this type of changes and does not make 
them. That does not do anything to increase people's confidence in 
the taxation system, much less in those who design it and those 
who have to administer it. The government will have to act at some 
point. It is nice to have these motions, I have nothing against the 
member who is moving it, but he will have to exert some pressure 
on his colleagues at Revenue and at Finance, and on the cabinet, so 
that they live up to their commitment and come forward with 
proposals, because we have not seen anything yet.
<P>
	While they are talking about taxation, I would also like to talk 
about something else. In Quebec, at one point there were different 
views of the economy, and the government of Canada was perhaps 
more active on the economic front in the post-war era. During the 
war, it had taken over a lot of taxation power from the provinces, 
particularly Quebec. It never gave it back.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14949"> 14949 </A></B>
<P>
	As a result, in Quebec, we have two income tax collection 
systems. Revenue Quebec and Revenue Canada both collect taxes, 
they each have their own income tax return; every year, we must 
fill out two income tax returns, because taxation can be a powerful 
economic development tool. Through taxation, each government 
imposes its own vision of things, and taxpayers have a hard time 
sorting things out. Very few of them are able to fill out their 
income tax returns on their own, not because they are lacking in 
skills or ability, but because the returns are just too complicated. 
I am convinced that there are not many members in this House 
who fill out their returns on their own. And yet, we are the 
lawmakers and the ones who pass legislation and establish 
policies.
<P>
	So there is indeed a serious problem which, over the years, has 
led to confrontation between Quebec and Canada because Quebec 
would have liked to have full control over its tax system and use it 
as an economic development tool. But this is not the case. I would 
also like to remind people who are watching us today that, not only 
do we have two systems, not only do we pay taxes to both Quebec 
and Ottawa, but there are transfer payment mechanisms to transfer 
money from one government to another. We send our tax money to 
the federal government, which gives it back to the province through 
transfer payments, not always in the proportions that we would 
like. This system is cumbersome and complicated, and requires a 
lot of manpower.
<P>
	To conclude my remarks, since I only have thirty seconds left, I 
want to say that the hon. member's motion makes a lot of sense, but 
I would like him to remind his colleagues that they have made a 
major commitment and that they will have to put forward concrete 
proposals, hopefully before Quebecers make a decision on October 
30, on what they intend to do with regard to our tax system, 
particularly with regard to the GST.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great 
pleasure to address the House this afternoon on Motion No. 382 
sponsored by the member for Mississauga South. I would also like 
to take the opportunity to commend my hon. colleague for his work 
in this area.
<P>
	The underground economy that is the focus of this motion is of 
major importance and has implications for Canadians right across 
the country. There has been a great deal written about the size, 
extent, nature and causes of the underground economy.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	As members are probably aware, estimates on the size of the 
underground economy vary widely, depending on the methodology 
that is used, from 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent of GDP to over 20 per 
cent. That translates into $20 billion to $140 billion a year.
<P>
	The greater the activity in the underground economy the less 
revenue is available to governments. Underground economic 
activity creates unfair competition for honest businesses. Jobs are 
lost. Therefore, honest taxpayers are forced to pay more than their 
fair share of taxes.
<P>
	We all know that deficit elimination and the eventual repayment 
of the federal debt will depend primarily on long term economic 
growth and job creation. While spending cuts may contribute to 
deficit reduction, why should we continue to cut programs when 
the collection of legitimate tax revenue could be substituted?
<P>
	We need to seek out options and solutions. It is imperative that 
an attack on the underground economy be part of the overall 
solution.
<P>
	For many individuals and businesses the underground economy 
has become a convenient way to avoid paying taxes. When these 
people take their financial transactions underground they are 
failing to make their contribution in support of Canada's social and 
economic programs. These people do not pay for the services they 
use. Instead, other Canadians are forced to pay more.
<P>
	People who deal in the underground economy may feel that their 
financial situation justifies their actions. It may be because it has 
been several years since their last raise. It may be because they feel 
the tax system is too complex or unfair. Or it may be just basic 
greed. They see cheating the tax department as a victimless crime. 
Let me say that, whatever the reason, underground economic 
activity makes victims of us all. Indeed, all Canadians are victims 
and this does not sit well with me.
<P>
	I ask members as well as all Canadians to consider the real cost 
of underground economic activity. The cost is large. It shows up in 
reduced essential services, taxes higher than they would otherwise 
be, unfair competition and a reduced standard of living for the 
honest taxpayer.
<P>
	How does the underground economy affect a legitimate business 
which is trying to be competitive? The Canadian Homebuilders 
Association is concerned. Indeed, home renovators who evade 
taxes have an unfair advantage over honest contractors. Honest 
businesses are at a competitive disadvantage because they cannot 
offer a customer the same deal as that offered by someone who will 
do the work but not collect the taxes. The end result is that the 
legitimate business faces unfair competition and job loss.
<P>
	I ask the members to put themselves in the place of an 
entrepreneur who plays by the rules and who diligently collects and 
remits tax to the government. How would they react if they lost 
work because someone dealing under the table outbid them for a 
contract? I would certainly be upset and I would insist that the 
government do something to restore fairness to my situation.
<P>
	We must not forget the dishonest consumer. The dishonest 
consumer who takes the lower price and pays  cash is cheating the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14950"> 14950 </A></B>
<P>
system and becoming a party to the evasion of taxes. These 
consumers benefit from the full range of government services but 
do not pay their fair share. All they have done is take part in a 
transaction which jeopardizes our health, education and other 
essential economic and social services. This is simply shortsighted 
and unfair. It is illegal and criminal.
<P>
	The underground economy results in lost revenues for the 
government which, as I have said, jeopardizes essential social and 
economic programs and forces honest Canadians to pay more 
taxes.
<P>
	The motion before the House is a three-pronged motion. It 
suggests that the government educate the public and encourage 
their participation in addressing the problem. I agree that 
Canadians need to know the facts about the seriousness of the 
underground economy, how it affects each and every one of us and 
what can be done to reduce it. I also agree that governments cannot 
solve the problem alone. We, the citizens of Canada, all must do 
our part and fulfil our responsibilities.
<P>
	We must tell Canadians the facts about the seriousness of the 
existence of the underground economy and how they can help to 
eliminate it. We must address the myth that everyone is doing it. 
We must emphasize that tax evasion is a crime and that it is not a 
victimless crime, as it is often argued. All Canadians are victims. 
Tax evasion leads to job losses, an increase in the deficit, honest 
taxpayers carrying more of a burden and legitimate businesses 
operating in an environment of unfair competition which often 
leads to bankruptcy. We must stress that people who evade taxes 
are cheating honest taxpayers and those in need. We must publicize 
the fact that 14,000 calls are received by Revenue Canada each year 
from Canadians who know tax evaders. Many more would call if 
they only knew that the follow-up would take place.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	To ensure that everyone is aware that the government is serious 
about prosecuting those who deliberately defraud the tax system, 
the Minister of National Revenue publicizes convictions for tax 
evasion. The increased publicity and resulting embarrassment of a 
fine or imprisonment coupled with the payment of taxes, interest, 
and penalties, has had a deterrent effect.
<P>
	During the past year, officials of Revenue Canada have been 
actively consulting with individuals and associations across 
Canada on the issue of tax evasion, the underground economy, and 
smuggling. Revenue Canada has sought and received the support of 
these groups. With the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants, for example, the department established a working 
committee to investigate the causes of the underground economy, 
examine audit techniques and identify training that would assist in 
tracking down unreported or under-reported income, and identify 
opportunities for  reducing the cost and administrative burden of 
compliance for businesses and individuals.
<P>
	These groups are taking the message of the risks of dealing in the 
underground economy back to their membership. Every citizen and 
every business has a role to play in eliminating the underground 
economy. Individuals can start by refusing to deal with businesses 
and tradespeople who ask for cash payments. Businesses can do 
their part by turning down demands to do work off the books. Yes, 
all Canadians must do their part, individuals and businesses. 
Simply put, they must say no.
<P>
	The second prong of the hon. member's motion calls for a 
limited amnesty on interest and penalties otherwise payable when a 
taxpayer voluntarily declares income previously undeclared. My 
colleague has stressed that the amnesty pertains only to interest and 
penalties, not to the taxes owing. The preferred approach is to 
encourage voluntary compliance. It does work, as 95 per cent of all 
revenues are collected without the need for enforcement action. 
Revenue Canada currently has a program in place for voluntary 
disclosure which would waive penalties if an official audit had not 
yet been initiated. However, interest would still be payable.
<P>
	We must encourage an amnesty because it is very important to 
give underground economy operators the opportunity to come 
clean. We must be clear that underground economy is not normal 
business and that Canadians will not continue to tolerate dishonest 
business practices at their expense. Here is a chance for the 
business person to come out.
<P>
	The third prong of my hon. colleague's motion is a tax credit for 
taxpayers on home improvements and renovations in order to 
provide an inducement to create the essential paper trail and to 
serve as one of the primary vehicles for the information campaign. 
By offering an input tax credit for the GST paid on home 
improvements or renovations, the taxpayer would be required to 
submit the original invoice as part of their income tax return. The 
objective would be to create a real paper trail in an area of abuse 
with which most people are familiar. It is a good vehicle through 
which we could educate the public on the crime and discourage 
action under the table. It would also help to support the honest 
businesses that are prepared to provide an invoice.
<P>
	I have spoken to the people of my constituencies about the 
underground economy. Those who follow the law and pay their 
taxes do not like having to pay higher taxes because others are 
trying to cheat the system. Entrepreneurs who are trying to make an 
honest living say they do not like being at a competitive 
disadvantage from businesses and tradespeople who ask for cash 
payments to avoid paying tax. My constituents are also worried 
about how lost revenue is affecting the government's ability to 
maintain the social and economic programs so important to our 
well-being.
<P>
	I will support my colleague's motion. I want to see that all 
legitimate taxes are collected so that the honest taxpayer does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14951"> 14951 </A></B>
<P>
have to bear the burden of both higher taxes and lessening of 
programs. The underground economy is not the norm and it is not 
acceptable to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as I start to make a few comments about this bill, I would 
first like to recognize the hon. member for Mississauga South, who 
proposed this motion. I would like to acknowledge the fact that it is 
aimed at correcting a serious problem we have in our country, 
which is the evasion of taxes, specifically the GST.
<P>
	As the GST is such a magnet for all of the discomfort and 
discontent with the tax system in the country, it is not seen by the 
ordinary citizen as theft. It is not seen as stealing from each other 
by evading the GST.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	I think the hon. member opposite has brought to the House a very 
important consideration. The social contract we all have is based 
on the premise of fairness, that we are all going to pay our fair 
share and that we will do so more or less willingly, provided 
everybody else is paying a fair share.
<P>
	When we combine the fact that the GST is such a horribly 
unpopular tax with the fact that the average Canadian is just barely 
getting by and does not like to pay the tax in the first place, there is 
very fertile ground for tax avoidance. When people avoid paying 
taxes that are legitimately owed it means that somebody else is 
carrying their load, and that is just not right.
<P>
	I want to commend the member opposite for bringing this 
motion before the House. Members know, but for the sake of 
Canadians who are watching I should point out that a motion 
brought to the House will not bind the government in any way to 
act on it. It is really just a means of trying to get the attention of 
cabinet and say that this is something we should do. Although it is 
votable, it is not binding. I am sure the hon. member would like to 
see it binding, but it just plain is not.
<P>
	There are many things that happen in politics in the House and 
outside the House that are not binding, such as promises that are 
made during election campaigns. During the last campaign, 
members will recall members of the Liberal Party made a lot of hay 
out of the fact that they were going to get rid of the hated GST. As a 
matter of fact, I recall specifically being ridiculed on a campaign 
platform by my Liberal opponent because I said we could not 
possibly get rid of the GST without replacing it with another tax. 
The GST generates $18 billion in revenue. We just cannot say poof 
and it is gone. We have to deal with reality.
<P>
	Here we are a couple of years later and the GST is still in place, 
still being corrected. That brings me to the problem we have in 
supporting this bill. We have to do more than just cure the 
symptom; we have to cure the cold.
<P>
	We are in complete agreement that the GST has led to a 
burgeoning underground economy. Simply offering a limited 
amnesty is not of its own accord going to bring people back to the 
market. Advertising or letting people know that avoiding the GST 
or working underground is in fact stealing and is not something that 
should be condoned in our country would be a very worthwhile 
thing to do, with or without any of the other items in this bill. It 
would not hurt to use some of these Dr. Feelgood ads that are 
running across the country right now to say that if you are working 
in the underground economy you are stealing from your neighbour.
<P>
	As earlier speakers have pointed out, how would you like to be in 
the renovation or construction business competing with and losing 
jobs to somebody who is constantly being paid under the table?
<P>
	I had some extensive renovations done in my home a year ago. 
Just try to get them done and pay the GST. It is not an easy chore. 
There are quite a number of people in the construction and 
renovation business who will not do any work if it requires 
receipts. This is not to mention all the service industries that work 
under the table. We all know it exists.
<P>
	The problem is that it is like a speed limit on a highway. You are 
tooling down a highway at 110 kilometres an hour and for no 
apparent reason the speed limit is 80 kilometres an hour and there 
is a radar trap there. Well, citizens will go wherever it makes sense. 
The reaction to the GST was a visceral reaction to the taxation 
levels in the country. That more than anything else is the reason 
people are not paying the GST. It is not seen by the ordinary 
Canadian to be a crime.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Rather than tinkering with this, rather than treating the symptom 
and not curing the cold, I would ask the hon. member opposite to 
give thought to joining with other colleagues in the House in a 
bipartisan approach to see if we cannot do something about the 
underlying problem in the tax system, which is a disincentive for 
reinvestment. My hon. colleague for Mississauga South well 
knows-far better than I because of his experience as a chartered 
accountant-what a disincentive it is for people in our country to 
reinvest profits. That is a much bigger problem than the GST 
problem.
<P>
	My specific objection to this bill is not the thrust of the bill, 
which I think is honourable and in the right direction in saying that 
people have to get out of the underground economy. My objection 
is not to the limited amnesty, which would give people the 
opportunity to get out if they have become involved in the 
underground economy. While we would offer them a carrot, we 
should also offer a fairly substantial stick.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14952"> 14952 </A></B>
<P>
	I do have a problem with the notion of offering a tax credit to 
people for renovations. We might be able to square that circle and 
address that problem if for instance we were to allow people to 
use an RRSP to do a renovation, just as they can for buying new 
homes, depending on the equity level in the home, but only if they 
bring in a qualified receipt showing the GST. That would then 
ensure the public purse does not get hit twice, once for the RRSP 
and again for the tax credit. What about the people who might 
do it themselves, or whatever?
<P>
	I do not think we should be giving tax credits to induce people to 
obey the law. People should obey the law because it is the right 
thing to do. The advertising should be there, amnesty as the carrot, 
and a substantial stick for breaking the law. This is not to induce 
people to do the right thing because we are going to pay them to do 
it; they are going to do the right thing because it is the right thing to 
do and because the underground economy is no longer seen in the 
community as tolerable.
<P>
	I would reiterate that the Liberal government promised to get rid 
of the hated GST. When I go out to buy my next article at the store I 
am pretty sure I am going to be paying the hated GST, which is two 
years after the fact. I would be very surprised if in the life of this 
Parliament the GST is gone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McCormick:</B> You will be surprised.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> I would be very surprised, delighted. 
Members opposite say that I will be surprised. I take that as a 
reaffirmation of the promise made during the election to get rid of 
the GST. You heard it here first. Once again the Liberals opposite 
are affirming their promise to get rid of the GST.
<P>
	We should hope that perhaps the way they will do it is to get 
behind the notion of a flat tax and work with us and other parties, 
with members opposite like the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, who has been working at developing a 
notion of the single tax for years. Finally it seems like this might be 
the opportunity. Let us put all of our energies together to cure the 
cold and not the symptom.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Larry McCormick (Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I 
address the House today on Motion No. 382 introduced by the 
member for Mississauga South. My hon. colleague has done a great 
deal of study on the underground economy and I acknowledge all 
the work he has put into this.
<P>
	I have given this matter considerable thought because many of 
my constituents have been directly affected by the underground 
economy. They are people who operate legitimate businesses. They 
have told me how their businesses are being hurt by the so-called 
under the table entrepreneurs. They want the government to do 
something about the problem before it is too late. These  so-called 
under the table entrepreneurs are not the entrepreneurs I grew up 
with and started businesses with.
<P>
	The greater the activity in the underground economy, the less 
revenue there is available to governments. Underground economic 
activity creates unfair competition for honest businesses. Jobs are 
lost and honest taxpayers are forced to pay more than their fair 
share of taxes. For many individuals and businesses the 
underground economy has become a convenient way to avoid 
paying taxes, to not pay their fair share.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	When these people take their financial transactions underground 
they are failing to meet their contribution in support of Canada's 
social and economic programs. These people do not pay for the 
services they use. Instead other Canadians are forced to pay more.
<P>
	I ask all members, as well as all other Canadians, to consider the 
real cost of underground economic activity. The cost is large. I 
believe it is phenomenally large. It shows up in reduced essential 
services, taxes being higher than they should be, unfair 
competition, and a reduced standard of living for the honest 
taxpayer. If every Canadian paid their fair share everyone would 
pay less. We have heard this before and we have to think about it to 
realize how we can all gain in this situation.
<P>
	How does the underground economy affect the competitiveness 
of legitimate businesses? Many groups have talked to us. A major 
group is the Canadian Home Builders' Association. It is very 
concerned. Home renovators who evade taxes have an unfair 
advantage over honest contractors. Many small legitimate 
businesses in my riding of Hastings-Frontenac-Lennox and 
Addington are being threatened by others operating underground.
<P>
	Right from the start honest businesses are at a competitive 
disadvantage because they cannot offer a customer the same deal as 
offered by someone who will do the work but not collect the taxes. 
The end result is that the legitimate businesses face unfair 
competition and many jobs are lost.
<P>
	My hon. colleague for Mississauga South has put forward new 
specific approaches in the motion to address the underground 
economy. He is offering a limited amnesty on interest and penalties 
when a taxpayer voluntarily comes forward in an effort to crack 
down by engaging more investigators on a contract or commission 
basis. People will hear that this message is for real and people will 
come forward.
<P>
	This phase will continue as long as there is a favourable 
payback. We have to let the public know that when they patronize 
the supplier with a cash price without an invoice they are actually 
condoning fraud, and that by refusing to do business with those 
who do not give invoices they also help the business of honest 
taxpayers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14953"> 14953 </A></B>
<P>
	Turning to an input tax credit, this offer for GST to be paid on 
home renovations would be required in a very simple process. The 
taxpayer would submit the original invoice either as part of his 
or her tax return or by separate filing. The objective is to create 
a real paper trail. We all know about this area of abuse and it is 
time we recognized it.
<P>
	A tax credit would be a good vehicle through which to educate 
the public on the crime and to discourage under the table action. A 
taxpayer would help to support honest businesses that are prepared 
to provide invoices.
<P>
	Revenue Canada's voluntary disclosure policy allows 
individuals, partnerships, corporations, trusts, and non-profit, 
charitable or other organizations to come forward to correct any 
deficiencies in any reporting to the department. The policy operates 
on a simple premise: When a disclosure is made voluntarily before 
the department has started an audit or other enforcement action, no 
penalties or other sanctions such as a prosecution for tax evasion 
will be imposed.
<P>
	The taxpayer will only have to pay the amount, either taxes or 
duties owing, plus interest. This is fair since the interest reflects the 
true value of the money and the fact that those who have not paid 
their taxes on time have had the use of these funds.
<P>
	Revenue Canada under its voluntary disclosure policy generally 
takes a responsible approach to collections. Arrangements can be 
worked out so that taxes owing to government are paid in a manner 
which does not cause undue hardship for the taxpayer.
<P>
	Persons can make a voluntary disclosure by contacting any 
Revenue Canada office directly or by having their accountants or 
lawyers do it for them. A disclosure will be considered voluntary as 
long as it is made before Revenue Canada has started an audit or 
other enforcement action.
<P>
<B>(1805 )</B>
<P>
	In my experience we get what we pay for. When we go 
underground to provide services or when customers accept 
underground services, we can expect lower quality work and lower 
quality materials because those businesses do not have to comply 
and will not comply with industry regulations.
<P>
	As well and most important, consumers do not get the protection 
and the guarantees they would otherwise have if they had an 
authorized purchase order and/or an invoice. When the customer 
goes underground as well he or she has no recourse and no 
protection.
<P>
	A little over a year go an elderly woman in a village near my 
home was visited one day by three gentlemen in a pickup truck. 
They knocked on her door and said they knew that the winter had 
been severe. They wanted to check out her home in case they could 
do any little touch-up jobs for her and save her a lot of money. They  
spent half an hour wandering around her home in a village 
originally called Rogues Hollow, no pun intended.
<P>
	They knocked on the door after they inspected the home and 
said: ``The winter was very severe. There are a lot of problems with 
your back wall. Bricks are coming loose. Your chimney is ready to 
fall down. We have an estimate here for you; it is $6,200. If you pay 
us in cash, I have these professional men available who will do the 
work now. We can do the job for you today for $3,100''. It is a true 
story. They did $300, $400, $500 or $600 worth work that morning 
and she paid them the $3,100.
<P>
	She was sick the next day. She phoned me at home. What can I 
do? It was in cash. Do we have to get hurt time after time, 
especially seniors, to see that these are not business people but 
crooks?
<P>
	Hon. members opposite spoke about the most hated tax in 
Canadian history and how it has added greatly to the underground 
economy. I agree that when the GST arrived on the scene the 
underground economy exploded. Small businesses such as the 
retail business my wife Rita and I operated face the burden of more 
paper jungles. Our ministers have told us that when they change the 
GST there will be less involvement, less paper and less work for 
small businesses. I eagerly await that and will gladly remind my 
ministers.
<P>
	My colleagues opposite have spoken of the GST. Small 
businesses are finally being recognized by the government. The 
Liberal government recognizes that jobs will come from small 
businesses. Recently the Minister of Industry announced 
micro-loans of less than $5,000 for small businesses. They will 
make a great difference. We can encourage businesses to come out 
of the closet and become legal or legitimate businesses.
<P>
	The motion before the House suggests the government educate 
the public and encourage its participation in addressing the 
problem. I agree that Canadians need to know the facts about the 
seriousness of the underground economy and what can be done to 
reduce it. I applaud the member for Mississauga South for his 
efforts to stimulate decision on the issue. I urge members of the 
House to carry the message back to their constituents and I will to 
mine. I urge members to talk with their constituents about the 
underground economy, its seriousness, and how it can be reduced.
<P>
	I also agree that governments cannot solve the problem alone. 
We must all do our part and fulfil our responsibilities. I urge all 
members to support Motion No. 382.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Karen Kraft Sloan (York-Simcoe, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the member for Mississauga South for bringing an 
important issue before the House which demands the attention of 
members on both sides. The seriousness of the underground 
economy cannot be understated.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="14954"> 14954 </A></B>
<P>
	I am sure other members have talked to constituents about how 
difficult it can be to compete with those who deal in the 
underground economy and who insist on being paid cash. The 
greater the activity in the underground economy, the less revenue 
there is for government.
<P>
	Underground economy activities create unfair competition for 
honest businesses. Jobs are lost and honest taxpayers are forced to 
pay more than their fair share. The government is committed to 
ensuring fairness in the tax system and has a strategy in place for 
ensuring compliance with the law. In November 1993 the Minister 
of National Revenue announced a series of measures to address 
non-compliance underground economic activity and tax evasion. 
The department has strengthened its ties with the private sector and 
the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	During the past year Revenue Canada has consulted with more 
than 240 groups, which has helped the department to define its 
strategies, identify areas of non-compliance and explore measures 
for improving compliance.
<P>
	Co-operation arrangements are in place with all the provinces. 
This has led to joint audits with the provinces, the sharing of audit 
strategies, training material and expertise. The department has 
strengthened its ability to identify non-filers and non-registrants 
and has increased and targeted its audits to focus on areas of high 
non-compliance.
<P>
	The construction and home renovation sectors are being paid 
special attention. Revenue Canada officials in their consultations 
with industry and trade representatives have been told how 
revenues and jobs are being lost. Consumers lose out. They forfeit 
any guarantees of a quality product backed by a reputable firm. 
Workers seeking steady, secure employment are also cheated.
<P>
	The government has taken steps to respond to the needs of an 
industry battling under the table entrepreneurs. The reason is 
straightforward. No business that plays by the rules should have to 
face unfair competition from those that do not. The honest taxpayer 
should not be disadvantaged by those who are cheating.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has put special audit teams in place to look into 
transactions. The department examines the classified ads and visits 
construction sites in search of information that will help identify 
non-filers and non-registrants. With information from the financial 
records of lumber yards and building supply companies Revenue 
Canada can verify that the people who purchase construction 
materials are paying the tax they should on the work they perform.
<P>
	There is also follow-up on leads from private citizens which 
often include individuals who are unhappy with the work they paid 
for and who could not get their cash contractor to respond to their 
complaint.
<P>
	Revenue Canada has been working with the Ontario Association 
of Lumber and Building Supply Dealers. The association has 
agreed to display in its member stores a flyer which emphasizes the 
pitfalls for consumers when dealing under the table.
<P>
	The department is involved in ongoing consultations with the 
Canadian Home Builders Association. Specifically Revenue 
Canada and the CHBA have established a working group to 
co-ordinate efforts to address the underground economy in the 
home renovation business. The working group considers how the 
CHBA and its local associations can assist Revenue Canada to 
identify those businesses involved in under the table activity. The 
CHBA and Revenue Canada can work together to ensure Canadians 
are aware of the risks associated with dealing in the underground 
economy. Consultations between the department and CHBA are 
taking place at the local and national levels.
<P>
	The February budget measure for a reporting system for 
payments to subcontractors in the construction industry is a direct 
result of consultations with representatives of the construction 
industry. The measure and others in the budget reinforce the 
government's commitment to a fair tax system and a level playing 
field for businesses.
<P>
	Revenue Canada is now discussing with representatives of the 
industry and trade associations as well as professional accounting 
and legal associations how the reporting system should operate and 
what other measures might be taken. The government wants to 
improve compliance in a way that does not increase the burden and 
cost of compliance for business.
<P>
	The motion of the member for Mississauga South contains a 
proposal for a tax credit for home improvements and renovations as 
a way to create a paper trail. I support the intent of this proposal. It 
is something the government might wish to look at but it must be 
recognized that there would be a cost associated with its 
implementation.
<P>
	Revenue Canada already reviews records of GST rebates paid 
out for substantial renovations along with provincial sales tax 
credits to ensure that proper deductions and claims have been made 
by taxpayers. This paper trail is very helpful.
<P>

	I thank the member for putting forward the motion allowing us 
to debate an issue of key concern to Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to have the opportunity to make  a few 
comments on Motion No. 382 as sponsored by the member for 
Mississauga 
<P>

<B><A NAME="14955"> 14955 </A></B>
<P>
South. I congratulate my hon. colleague on this initiative first and 
foremost.
<P>
	The issue that is the focus of this motion is of major importance 
to all Canadians right across the country. For many individuals and 
businesses the underground economy has become a convenient way 
to avoid paying taxes, not paying their fair share.
<P>
	People who deal in the underground economy may feel their 
financial situation justifies their actions. It may be because it has 
been several years since their last pay raise. It may be because they 
feel the tax system is much too complex or unfair. It also may be 
basic greed. They see it as cheating the tax department, a victimless 
crime.
<P>
	When these people take their financial transactions underground 
they are failing to make their contributions in support of Canada's 
social and economic programs. These people do not pay for the 
services they use. Instead, other Canadians are forced to pay more.
<P>
	Each time someone participates in the underground economy, 
money to help pay for programs such as health care and education 
is lost. It is revenue that may never be recovered.
<P>
	Whatever the reason, underground economic activity makes 
victims of all of us. The cost shows up in reduced essential 
services, higher taxes than would otherwise be the case, unfair 
competition and a reduced standard of living for the honest 
taxpayers. This is simply unfair and shortsighted.
<P>
	The motion before the House suggests the government educate 
the public and encourage their participation in addressing the 
problem. I agree Canadians need to know the facts about the 
seriousness of the underground economy and what can be done to 
reduce it. I also agree governments cannot solve the problem alone. 
We must all do our part to fulfil these responsibilities.
<P>
	The government has recognized that solutions to this problem 
and others now facing Canadians cannot be found in isolation. We 
must understand the problem and its consequences. It is for this 
very reason that in November of 1993 the Minister of National 
Revenue made education a fundamental element of his action plan 
to address the underground economy.
<P>
	Officials of Revenue Canada have been actively consulting with 
individuals and associations right across Canada. These groups are 
taking the message of the risk of dealing in the underground 
economy back to their membership. Every citizen and every 
business has a role to play in eliminating the underground 
economy.
<P>
	Individuals can start by refusing to deal with business and trades 
people who ask for cash payments. Businesses can do their part by 
turning down demands to work off the books.
<P>
	To ensure everyone is aware the government is serious about 
prosecuting those who deliberately defraud the tax system, the 
Minister of National Revenue is publicizing convictions for tax 
evasion. The increased publicity has been a deterrent and has had 
an effect.
<P>
	The number of voluntary disclosures received by the department 
where people come forward to voluntarily correct their tax affairs 
has doubled in the past year. In addition, the number of referrals 
received from people each year providing the department with 
leads on potential tax fraud has risen by some 19,000.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	As members of the House are aware, Canada's tax system is 
based on taxpayers voluntarily filing and paying their taxes. A 
voluntary self-assessing system is the most effective way for a 
government to collect taxes owing.
<P>
	A cornerstone of a sound tax system is the reality and perception 
that everyone pays his or her fair share. It does not ask for any more 
or any less, just everyone's fair share. The underground economy 
undermines the fairness of the tax system.
<P>
	Regardless of its size there is no disputing the underground 
economy exists and that it exacts a toll on Canadian society from 
unfair competition for honest business to taxes higher than they 
would otherwise be for honest taxpayers, to business closures, to 
unemployment and to lost revenues which government uses to 
support Canada's social and economic agenda. It is a problem we 
cannot afford to ignore.
<P>
	I am confident, however, that we are making progress in dealing 
with the underground economy and other forms of tax evasion. I 
applaud the hon. member for Mississauga South for his efforts to 
stimulate discussion on this issue. I certainly solicit the support of 
all members of the House to support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Marlene Catterall (Ottawa West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
compliment my colleague from Mississauga South for bringing 
forward this initiative on an issue which is important to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	One principle Canadians want in their tax system above all is 
fairness. Everybody should pay their fair share.
<P>
	The underground economy has increased the burden on those 
law-abiding taxpayers who voluntarily report their income 
honestly every year. The underground economy has a certain 
segment of our society saying it will carry on business and benefit 
from the economy of the country but it will not contribute to it.
<P>
	It hits us in a number of ways. People who do not report income 
from jobs they have performed obviously avoid paying income tax 
on that revenue. They avoid paying the GST and provincial sales 
tax on the work they have performed. All governments lose when 
that happens and all Canadians lose.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="14956"> 14956 </A></B>
<P>
	We have only to sit in the House every day to hear the 
tremendous financial pressures on the government and on all 
Canadians. We know we are in a period of finding any way we 
can to save on expenditures. It is leading to some very difficult 
decisions which will not necessarily help the economy or our 
standard of living. However, we know they are necessary because 
for a number of years now there has been a serious imbalance 
between what we have to spend and how much we are taking in.
<P>
	This motion goes to the heart of how much we are taking in. 
While there may be disagreements about the extent of the 
underground economy and the amount of money being lost by 
unreported income, nobody can deny it is substantial and that it has 
grown dramatically in recent years.
<P>
	What is it costing us when people are not paying their fair share? 
We have all heard from constituents who are worried about the 
future of our health care system. We hear about waiting lists at 
hospitals. We hear about pressures to close hospitals. Certainly that 
is very much an issue in Ontario today and in the national capital 
region.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	We hear about reducing the benefits to people who are 
unemployed and need the assistance of the unemployment 
insurance system. We hear about a reduction in the money 
available to those in need to survive through difficult times. We 
hear about less services being available to support children in our 
community. We hear about less resources being available to fulfil a 
major role that Canada has always played in the world in terms of 
international development. It goes on and on.
<P>
	This motion gives a committee of Parliament the opportunity to 
examine how we can bring this under control. There are people 
who are making money in the economy and cheating their fellow 
Canadians by not paying taxes on that income. How can we get 
those people back into the mainstream of society, contributing what 
they should be contributing so that others do not have to pay more 
than their fair share? This would make it possible to carry on doing 
for Canadians those things that are important to the building of a 
prosperous and sane society.
<P>
	We all know people who have had work done around their 
homes. I recently had some work done and as a member of 
Parliament I insisted on an invoice and that the GST was 
documented. However I can understand someone who has had their 
income frozen for the last five years, or perhaps had their income 
drop because they have moved to another job which pays less, or 
perhaps is unemployed and has to get some necessary work done, 
would look for the best possible bargain to get the cheapest 
possible price, even if they suspect that the person doing the work 
is not paying the taxes and,  therefore, is not paying their fair share 
of being a member of Canadian society.
<P>
	This motion offers an opportunity. I want to pay tribute to a 
constituent of mine who brought a suggestion to my attention a 
couple of years ago and which I have been promoting with the 
Minister of Finance and the Minister of National Revenue. The 
idea is to give homeowners an incentive to ensure that anybody 
doing work around their home is part of the economy, is 
contributing, is paying the taxes on that work. It could come from a 
number of ways.
<P>
	This motion gives an opportunity to a committee of Parliament 
to look at a variety of means by which we can start to ensure that 
the vast majority of Canadians who are honest-and our tax system 
is really based on honour-and abide by that system are not 
penalized to the benefit of the very few who choose not to pay their 
fair share.
