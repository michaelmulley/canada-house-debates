</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-310, an act to require special interest groups that 
receive grants or loans from public funds to submit for tabling 
in Parliament a report on the purposes to which the funds were 
put, be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased on opening day to 
discuss a topic which Canadians want to discuss, at least those 
who I met this summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe I have all party agreement to share my opening 15 
minutes.  I would take 10 minutes and share the other five with 
the hon. member for Dauphin—Swan River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With your permission the hon. member will take five minutes at 
the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey:</B>  Madam Speaker, as members read in the 
introduction, this bill was to be debated the Monday after the 
House recessed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pay tribute to the hon. member from 
Hamilton—Wentworth who did a tremendous amount of work on this 
in the last session.  I can tell the hon. member that I used his 
material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took his material along with my bill to every local government 
in my constituency.  I made a visit to see what they thought 
about what the hon. member had presented and, in a minor form, 
what I was presenting.  There is a fundamental difference in our 
presentations, in that I want this government to be held 
accountable to the people of Canada for some $49 billion which is 
handed out to special interest groups with absolutely no 
requirement for accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer, after giving local government people an 
explanation, I heard responses such as:  “I cannot believe 
it”.  “That is incredible”.  “How dare they”.  Madam 
Speaker, I might tell you that they said some words which I 
cannot repeat in this House more frequently than the examples I 
have given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic tenet of this bill is that every Canadian should have 
the right to know who is receiving funding from this government 
and what is the purpose of the funding.  Let us bring this to 
debate so that Canadians will have accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister mentioned the other day that if he is going 
to increase grants in health aid or other help to the provinces 
he wants accountability.  We would not argue with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear government members saying that what people do not know 
will not hurt them.  I would turn that around and say that what 
people do not know about this funding is hurting them.  It is 
hurting them by $49 billion a year.  It is hurting hep C people 
who are deserving of payment.  It is hurting them because this 
money is not accounted for and not audited.  It is hurting them 
because it is forcing them to pay higher taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it abundantly clear to everyone that my intent in 
bringing this bill forward had one goal and one goal only; that 
is, to offer Canadians, no matter where they live in Canada, the 
opportunity to see totally, with accountability, where their tax 
dollars are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a witch hunt.  This is not a bill to embarrass some 
private interest groups.  This is strictly trying to give 
Canadian people accountability as to where their money is going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians across Canada will tell us that it is a growing 
industry, hidden under the secrecy of government.  Government is 
not making figures, facts and the individuals who are receiving 
these funds available to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk a moment about our heritage and what happened in the 
village next to where I live.  Because of rail line abandonment 
and property taxes its total revenue is down to some $200,000. 
It has to hire an administrator who is bondable. It has to 
prepare a budget as to how that money will be spent. At the end 
of the year it has to have an auditor come in to show the public 
where every cent of that money has gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of our history.  Part of the Canadian way is to 
have responsible people, including elected politicians at the 
local level and the federal level, who will say “Here is where 
our money is being spent”.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that a group that will get as high as $15 million or 
$16 million does not even have to submit a statement as to the 
intent of how that money is going to be used?  That is 
incredible.  What is worse is that the money is not accounted 
for.  There is no audited statement and we do not know the 
source, who is running the operation, or the the purpose of that 
group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the grassroots aboriginals have had something to say about 
this bill.  They said things this summer and I want to quote two 
of them.  The first quote is “Without democracy, equality and 
accountability there can be no self-government”.  Grassroots 
people all over are saying that this is a terrible plague which 
this government has.  It is willing to take $49 billion of 
taxpayers' money and tell us it does not have to account for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government can take $100,000, as the hon. member from 
Hamilton—Wentworth pointed out, and does not have to say it gave 
any amount and then can repeat it five times.  It can make that 
half a million dollars.  There is not even a record on the books. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the people of this House sit by when we have groups like 
the hepatitis C group outside and we are not telling them how we 
are spending $49 billion on special interest groups?  How can 
this government do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second quote told to me by a grassroots aboriginal this 
summer was “A significant roadblock to accountability is indeed 
the Indian Act itself”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out a few things.  Let me point out what happens. 
We have a special interest group which knows it does not have to 
put forth a statement as to its intent and does not have to 
describe or give an accounting for one red cent.  They can 
actually take that money and use it for any political purpose 
they like.  That money may be used to counteract or go against 
worthy volunteer organizations within a community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted a few things this summer.  I met with several museum 
groups in my constituency.  What are these people doing?  They 
are working, volunteering, scraping up money to get a building to 
try to preserve part of our heritage which is the heritage of the 
homesteader who came to Saskatchewan.  They cannot get $50 worth 
of grants from either government.  I showed them how much money 
was flowing out of this government into unknown coffers. They, to 
put it quite bluntly, are extremely disgusted that this type of 
thing is taking place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member from Hamilton—Wentworth made this statement 
loud and clear.  Any group of people receiving government funding 
should not be allowed to make political contributions. It is 
happening all the time.  I suggest if a study is made of this we 
will find that there are some very strange gifts going out when 
an election is near which are not accounted for and the parties 
which receive them make huge contributions to a political party. 
That is wrong.  Canadians all across Canada say it is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need are regulations in place governing the funding of 
any organization.  I would challenge anyone in the House, from 
any party, to stand and say that it is wrong for an 
organization receiving government funding, first, to state a 
purpose for which that funding will be used, and second, to have 
an annual audited statement as to how the money was spent.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat as a CEO to a school division.  We had no choice but to 
print a final statement as to the money that was spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If senior government thinks that is a great thing for our 
villages, rural communities, towns, cities and province, why is 
it not a good thing for the government to exercise the same 
practice?  Why is the government prepared to hoodwink Canadians 
into the billions of dollars but to deny help to hepatitis C 
victims and local museums?  I could list a hundred of them, but 
the government will not move on this issue, to its demise, I 
hope.  The lack of accountability of the taxpayers' dollar should 
show up come next election time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say how the people feel about this issue when it is 
explained to them.  The trust in government goes down.  What they 
think of politicians goes down.  What they think of the whole 
nation because of this scam goes down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this uncontrolled industry continues, what will we find?  If 
they can do it, why can we not do it?  If the government can hide 
millions of dollars, why should I not cheat on my income tax? 
Why should I not cheat on the GST?  Why should I not cheat on 
this and that as it pertains to government?  The very act of 
government doing this is a signal to the rest of Canadians to go 
ahead: if they can do it we can do it.  It is time for the 
government and the House to say no, we are finished, that our 
books will be open and there will be total accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this is not a votable bill, I would encourage members 
who sit on the finance committee to give Canadians a right they 
deserve.  Let us give Canadians a right to be able to look at the 
thousands of different organizations that get money and for the 
first time make government completely accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to bring a halt to this practice does nothing but foster 
mistrust in government.  It makes parliament weaker and, above 
all, it deprives our citizens of their God-given right to know 
where their taxpayers' dollars are going.  I challenge anyone to 
come up with some logical reason why this should not happen. 
There may be many defenders, but there is no defence against this 
accountability act.  No one could muster up or find a defence.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Parliamentary Secretary to President of the 
Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, over the years 
considerable study and discussion have taken place on the subject 
of accountability for parliament.  It remains a timeless subject 
of interest not only for us as members of parliament but for the 
bureaucrats and academics who study parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of the past debate has been focused on accountability to 
parliament when program delivery is through an intermediary or 
third party rather than directly by public servants or under 
contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The practice of third party delivery is most evident in the area 
of grants and contributions and other types of transfer payments. 
I am aware that concerns are sometimes raised that current trends 
in management reform and alternative program delivery run the 
risk of significantly weakening the accountability chain, leaving 
parliament with no one to hold responsible.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-310 is not necessary.  There is already an accountability 
regime in place and information in this area has already been 
tabled in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each year parliament approves through the estimates funds for 
the payments of grants, contributions and other transfer 
payments.  Significant information on grants and contributions is 
disclosed annually in both the estimates and public accounts. 
Grants normally require the authority of parliament before they 
can be paid.  Parliament is normally informed about planned 
contributions within a program through the identification of such 
contributions in the tables of transfer payments included in part 
II of the main estimates or in supplementary estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments should further ensure that parliament is fully 
informed about the nature of the program, its objectives, target 
groups and expected results.  This is normally done through 
supplementary descriptive material in individual departments and 
agency reports on plans and priorities.  After the year is 
finished information is made available in departmental 
performance reports as well as in the public accounts.  If this 
is not enough, detailed actual spending information on specific 
transfer payments of over $100,000 is also publicly available 
upon request from Public Works and Government Services Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contributions are conditional transfer payments.  They are for a 
specified purpose subject to accountability and are audited 
pursuant to a contribution agreement.  Listing of contributions 
in the transfer payments table found in the estimates while not a 
legislative requirement is considered necessary for proper 
disclosure to parliament.  The payment of a contribution is 
conditional on the performance and achievement of a program, and 
contribution agreements are subject to audit to satisfy the donor 
department that all conditions both financial and non-financial 
have been met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grants are different.  They are unconditional transfer payments. 
The main criterion that distinguishes a grant from a contribution 
in practical terms is that once again contributions are subject 
to accountability and are audited pursuant to a contribution 
agreement.  Unfortunately the unconditional nature of grants 
gives the impression that the government does not require them to 
be spent in furtherance of specific program objectives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposite is in fact true.  While grants are not subject to 
being accounted for or audited, eligibility and entitlement may 
be verified.  Eligibility or entitlement criteria must be 
specifically approved by Treasury Board for all class grant 
programs.  Furthermore, departments have established verification 
procedures.  Most class grant programs are subject to management 
review and/or in some cases formal program evaluations on a 
periodic basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Grants are usually paid out in instalments as required by 
Treasury Board policy.  In many cases procedures are such that 
departments generally verify continued entitlement prior to 
making further payments.  Many organizations maintain close 
relationships with the recipients.  When problems arise it is 
possible for them to act quickly in order to stop the payment of 
the next instalment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government conducted a review of funding for special 
interest groups in 1994.  We know the hon. member from Hamilton 
had a lot of influence in the process.  The Minister of Finance 
announced in the February 1994 budget that the government would 
review its policy with respect to funding for special interest 
groups with a view to reducing the overall level of funding and 
encouraging further reliance on funding from other sources.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's review looked specifically at funding for 
interest groups, that is non-governmental, non-commercial groups 
pursuing an interest using federal government funding primarily 
through grants and contributions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This definition included what is often referred to as the 
voluntary sector as well as groups such as sports administration 
bodies, research institutes, industry associations and 
professional associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government recognizes the important role of the voluntary 
sector and other interest groups in Canadian society.  These 
groups can play an important and cost effective role in program 
and service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interest groups often perform other important functions such as 
bringing Canadians together, providing a voice for people who 
would not otherwise be heard and conducting research.  Despite 
this the government's relationship with interest groups has 
evolved and has had to change over the years to accommodate new 
needs in a program review environment of fiscal restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's review demonstrated that it had become 
increasingly more difficult to justify some special interest 
group funding when many government programs were being downsized 
or discontinued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could not afford to continue funding all the 
interest group activities that it was funding at that time since 
the review principles were developed and provided to government 
departments to assist in priorizing funding for interest groups 
as part of the program review exercise.  These principles remain 
valid today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First and foremost, departments were and are now to consider the 
extent to which the interest groups members or the larger public 
benefit from its activities.  The larger the benefit to the 
public from the group's activities, the more likely that group 
should receive funding from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the group's ability to obtain alternative sources of 
funding has to be considered.  The higher the ability of the 
group to access alternate sources of funding, the lower the 
priority of that group for government funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third consideration was the focus of the group's activities. 
Interest groups that confine their activities to support their 
own members should in most instances receive lower priority for 
government funding than groups that deliver important services to 
the public on behalf of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departments are to consider the consistency of the activities of 
groups with government priorities.  The guidelines were designed 
to be flexible so that they could be applied by each minister to 
the interest groups funded by his or her department.  Departments 
co-ordinate their funding activities with those of other 
ministers to ensure that a particular interest group does not 
obtain similar funding from more than one department of the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Loans and loan guarantees are handled differently.  They are 
made for a variety of purposes and in accordance with a variety 
of different terms and conditions.  The Treasury Board has policy 
statements for loans and loan guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Loans must be authorized through specific legislation or 
appropriation acts while loan guarantees require parliamentary 
authority and loan guarantee programs such as the Canada student 
loans program must be supported by separate program legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should also highlight that information on loans is available 
in the public accounts, volumes l and 2, part I, as well as 
policy statements for loans and loan guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a note on the administration of the reporting regime 
proposed by Bill C-310.  It would be an onerous task when one 
considers the number of grants, contributions, loans and loan 
guarantees made by the government each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task of such administration would also duplicate work since 
considerable information of this type is already tabled in 
parliament each year both in estimates and public accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am satisfied that departments and agencies—

</I></B></P><P align=left>With this bill, organizations in receipt of federal grants would 
be required to report to the minister on the use made of the 
grant funds and the minister would table this report in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill reminds us that our primary role as legislators is 
first and foremost to represent the people and not our party, 
and to ensure the sound management of public affairs. That is 
why the Bloc Quebecois supports this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that, soon after I was elected in 1993, the auditor 
general's report examined the responsibility of the various 
departments to be accountable for their activities. The auditor 
general suggested there was an urgent need to define more 
precisely the specific objectives and expected results of 
departmental programs. 
The auditor general wrote, and I quote: “Parliament may wish to 
consider more radical solutions to obtain more timely, relevant 
and reliable effectiveness information”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today, while far from being a radical 
solution, could be useful to both departmental managers and 
members of Parliament in determining whether grant funds were 
indeed spent on achieving the stated objectives. This 
requirement to table a report on the use made of these funds 
would fill the inexplicable vacuum whereby, at present, 
organizations receiving contributions are required to report on 
how their activities are funded, while those receiving grants 
are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A specific issue—and an infamous one—allowed us to show the 
major flaws that prevent the auditing of the actual use of 
public funds by the organizations benefiting from grants. This 
example helps us understand why, unlike the Liberal member, I 
feel this bill is essential to sound democracy in Canada. I am 
referring to Option Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This organization received $4.8 million from the Department of 
Canadian Heritage to promote Canadian unity. That money was 
granted in the fall of 1995, over a 33 day period, during the 
referendum campaign, in contempt of the legislation on the 
financing of public consultations passed by the Quebec National 
Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three years later, no one, including the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, can tell us where that money went, money that was 
taken from the budget for the official languages support 
program. 
This is unbelievable. It is not known what use was actually made 
of that money, nor whether that investment produced the 
anticipated results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the letters accompanying the payment of millions of dollars 
to Option Canada, Michel Dupuy, the then Minister of Canadian 
Heritage, used rather protracted and trivial formulas to express 
his expectations, such as “I do hope this additional grant will 
allow you to complete all your activities and to reach your 
objectives under the official languages support program”. This 
“I do hope” shows remarkable rigour on the part of a manager of 
public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Option Canada did not submit any report and no one in the 
Department of Canadian Heritage expressed any concerns about the 
situation until the matter was reported in the newspapers and 
the Bloc Quebecois began questioning the minister in the House. 
The cat was out of the bag and the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
ordered an internal investigation in March 1997, one and a half 
years after the fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after seeing internal reports pointing out numerous 
irregularities in how grants were issued to Option Canada, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage refused to take action.  Worse 
still, when she appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Canadian Heritage in November 1997, the minister tried to 
conceal the truth by saying, and I quote:  “I checked to see if 
these funds were spent in accordance with Treasury Board 
regulations. It would appear that they were.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, when the minister made this statement to committee members, 
she had in her possession a briefing note prepared by her 
officials that said quite the opposite. 
Following a request under the Access to Information Act, the 
minister finally resigned herself to releasing the results of 
her internal investigations into the grants paid to Option 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consultant Bill Coleman was tasked with conducting the 
investigation and his report was explicit and devastating with 
respect to the lax approach and the degree to which Treasury 
Board regulations were followed.  He established the following 
facts clearly:  Option Canada did not fill out any form to 
obtain its grants; Option Canada met only two of the 22 
conditions for obtaining a grant; Option Canada did not supply a 
piece of information as essential as the name of a person with 
signing authority; Option Canada did not undertake to provide a 
report on activities and a financial report; Option Canada did 
not undertake to return unused funds.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Canadian Heritage did not act in accordance with 
the program's funding conditions and failed to follow her own 
procedures requiring that specific forms be completed in order 
to obtain a grant.  It was only a matter of days before Option 
Canada received approval and obtained its grants, without being 
required to provide any justification as to how the amounts 
previously received had been spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would appear, then, that 33 days were all that was required 
to receive, study, recommend and approve three grant 
applications totalling $4.8 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, after several months of insistence by the Bloc and the 
auditor general, Option Canada was forced to produce two reports 
that proved to be very imprecise and fragmentary on how funding 
had been spent, or rather misspent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general's conclusion on the first report, tabled in 
January 1998, was that it was minimal and that it could not be 
determined from it whether what was involved was a deficiency or 
a misappropriation of funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the second Option Canada report, tabled in March 1998, 
the Principal in the Auditor General's office reached the 
conclusion that, without better information, it was not possible 
to have any assurance that this funding had indeed been used as 
authorized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a CBC radio interview, the Auditor General of Canada went so 
far as to state that fraud could not be ruled out without access 
to all information concerning Option Canada spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the flagrant lack of political will on the part of the 
Liberal government to at last bring the funding and spending of 
Option Canada fully out into the open, doubts must still remain. 
According to the documents obtained under the Access to 
Information Act, at the time of the 1995 referendum, Option 
Canada was supposed to organize VIP visits, have organizers in 
place, organize federalist rallies, and even purchase media 
space. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to review all the coincidences in this matter: $4.8 
million in public funds spent in the fall of 1995 by Option 
Canada, made up of friends of the regime, in the thick of the 
referendum campaign on the future of Quebec, in order to attain 
the objectives of the program supporting linguistic duality. 
So, who was being led down the garden path?  I will let you be 
the judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we to conclude from this adventure?  That Option Canada 
had people like Guy Bertrand and Howard Galganov on its payroll? 
That Option Canada financed some of the employees or some of 
the activities on the no side? 
Did Option Canada resolve the financial difficulties of a number 
of friends of the regime with ties to the Council for Canadian 
Unity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one can answer these and many other questions.  The Liberal 
government refused and still refuses to act responsibly and 
explain the use of the $4.8 million in public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his 1995 report, the auditor general wondered whether 
financial management and control were all they ought to be.  He 
wrote, and I quote “I believe there are good reasons for 
concern. My staff continue to find significant problems in 
financial management and control across a broad range of 
government operations. [—] There is increasing delegation of 
authority and empowerment of employees, but without 
corresponding accountability for financial results within 
organizations”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time the Liberal government moved to improve 
political practices and improve government efficiency. Scrutiny 
must not be left to officials or organizations receiving grants. 
It must be mandatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Passage of this bill will enable us to ensure that the millions 
of dollars of funding given out each year by the government to 
various organizations is really spent for the purposes intended.

surprised when I read this bill to find that it has rather 
obvious oversights and mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that when the hon. member was drafting the bill he 
had a rare lapse in judgment.  I wonder if he took some advice 
for the bill from some of his Reform Party colleagues.  That 
would explain how the flaws came about. In any case, having 
carefully considered the bill before us I cannot support it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the House, one of our most important 
responsibilities is to ensure that the government serves the 
people of Canada effectively. To that end we must make sure that 
government is not bogged down in administrative and bureaucratic 
red tape. Reform has pushed this issue on numerous occasions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake, Madam Speaker.  I greatly value the work that 
our public servants do for the country, but we must always make 
sure that the work we give them advances the public interest. 
Creating unnecessary red tape is an unproductive waste of 
society's resources. That is what this bill would do.  It would 
create unnecessary red tape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would require every charity receiving federal funds to 
file an annual report to Parliament to show how these funds were 
used.  In principle that sounds fine and dandy but think of the 
cost of implementing such a scheme. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the charities themselves would have to devote more of 
their resources to accounting for where every penny of their 
federal funding goes.  This might be possible for larger 
charities like the United Way, but what of the smaller ones? 
Many charities, including many food banks, are run by just a few 
dedicated volunteers.  And in these days in Canada under this 
government we have needed more and more food banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people give so much of themselves already.  Many have to 
fill out reams of forms just to apply for a little federal 
funding to keep them afloat.  It is hardly fair to expect them to 
fill out even more forms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regardless the size of the charity, whether it is the United Way 
or the local priest who hands out winter boots to underprivileged 
children, all this time and energy spent doing even more 
paperwork for the government would be better spent carrying out 
their charitable work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only would this bill be an unnecessary drain on charities, 
it would be an unnecessary drain on the government itself.  Think 
of the bureaucracy it would take to process the reports.  Knowing 
the current Liberal government, the funding for this bureaucracy 
would come from existing budgets.  Public servants, many of whom 
are still waiting for the pay equity they are entitled to by law, 
have been denied by 14 years of government stalling tactics. They 
would have to add this new paperwork to their workload. This 
would mean fewer resources devoted to health care, fewer 
resources devoted to getting EI cheques out on time, just to 
process these redundant charity funding reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say these reports are redundant because the various government 
departments and agencies that dole out the grants and loans 
already serve the function of holding them accountable.  If they 
do not see results, they can simply discontinue funding.  Since 
this mechanism is already in place to make sure public funds are 
not wasted, the extra expenditures called for in this bill are 
unnecessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As if this bill did not waste enough resources, it would then 
require each report to be tabled in the House of Commons.  I 
cannot even fathom a guess as to why the hon. member for 
Souris—Moose Mountain included this in the bill.  Why would he 
not just have the Treasury Board publish and release the reports? 
Why bog down the House by tabling financial reports when it 
should be debating issues that matter to Canadians?  It makes no 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that I question about this bill is its name.  I 
know the naming of a bill is not important in how the bill 
functions.  For instance, 20 years ago the government passed a 
bill called the Canadian Human Rights Act.  One would think that 
an act with such a name would guarantee Canadians their 
fundamental human rights.  But this has not prevented the current 
Liberal government from trampling on the human rights of 
Canadians by brutally cracking down on a peaceful democratic 
protest at the APEC summit, or by denying female public servants 
equal pay for work of equal value.  So clearly the name of a bill 
has little relevance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the name of a bill can offer insight into what its 
writer is thinking.  I wonder what was going through the mind of 
the hon. member when he called this bill before us the Special 
Interest Groups Funding Accountability Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 2 of this bill specifies that it only applies to groups 
or individuals who receive public funds for charitable purposes. 
From this I can only conclude that the hon. member considers 
charities to be special interest groups.  He does not seem to 
understand what a special interest group is:  a group that works 
to further its own interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charities on the other hand do not fit that definition.  Instead 
of serving themselves, they exist to serve others. They provide 
countless valuable services to society from meals on wheels for 
shut-ins to emotional support for cancer victims and their 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one have experienced some of the things the member talks 
about.  After the last federal campaign there was a rumour that 
the Reform candidate had received some funding from a group that 
was receiving government funding.  But I am not willing to sell 
out the work that the charities do for the sake of one person or 
one organization that may not be doing things accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to conclude by thanking the hon. member for 
bringing this bill before us today. 
Although the bill is flawed and redundant I appreciate and agree 
with his sentiments that there should be greater accountability 
for the spending of public funds.  However, it is not the 
charities that need to be watched more closely, it is real 
special interest groups like corporations.

from the Government of Canada, yet there is no mechanism for 
holding them accountable for how these funds are used.  Many 
corporations take this money but lay off hundreds of thousands of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members of the House to closely examine the tax breaks 
and subsidies government gives to corporations.  Let us not be 
fooled into believing that all corporate tax breaks and subsidies 
are good or that they are detrimental.  Some are undoubtedly used 
in ways to stimulate the economy while others waste monies that 
could go toward health care or tax relief for Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to identify corporate tax breaks and subsidies that 
advance the public interests and do away with the ones that do 
not.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Coderre (Bourassa, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, the real 
purpose of this private member's bill is most likely to ensure 
that the best possible use is made of limited government 
resources. I doubt that the demanding procedure for accounting 
to Parliament proposed in the bill would ensure such an 
objective is achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the program review process is in its final 
year. The purpose of this exercise would be to rethink the role 
of the State. 
As the President of the Treasury Board announced in 1995, the 
new expenditure management system will ensure that the scrutiny 
of government spending conducted as part of program review will 
now be a fixed public sector management component. The program 
review routine will be maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all recall that, in 1994, we did not have the capacity or the 
resources required to maintain the status quo, let alone deal 
with new issues. We had to reach a point where the role of 
government would be more reasonably and logically in line with 
its financial resources and jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was achieved with program review. Every program of every 
federal government department and agency was reviewed. The 
government looked at the financing of special interest groups in 
particular, as announced by the Minister of Finance in his 1994 
budget. 
This review of the financing of special interest groups was 
conducted as part of the program review process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main challenge for government in reviewing programs was 
determining which areas of activity to focus on and what was the 
most efficient and effective way of providing these services or 
carrying out these activities, in light of its current financial 
situation. In some cases, the most efficient and cost-effective 
was of delivering a program or service was through special 
interests groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers and their officials looked after reviewing the 
programs of their respective departments as well as evaluating 
their owns programs and activities. They consulted their clients 
and stakeholders as required and oversaw implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In developing their strategic plans, the ministers and their 
representatives took into account six criteria concerning their 
organizations.  These criteria are still being used and continue 
to be consistent with the expenditure management system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program or activity should meet a certain number of criteria 
before there can even be any question of the government, alone 
or in partnership with others, such as special interest groups, 
becoming involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the public interest: does the sector or program 
activity still serve the public interest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the question of the need for government participation: 
is the government's role in this sector or program activity 
essential and legitimate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the question of appropriateness: is the federal 
government's current role appropriate, or should the program or 
activity be harmonized with provincial programs or activities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the partnership aspect: what activities or program 
elements should or could be dropped completely or partially by 
the private or volunteer sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the criterion of increasing efficiency: if the program 
or activity is maintained, how could it be made more efficient? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And there is funding ability: can the government afford to 
maintain all the resulting programs and activities with its 
reduced financial resources?  If not, which programs or 
activities will be dropped? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of program review, the government looked at the funding 
of special interest groups with a view to reducing the overall 
level of funding and encouraging greater reliance on funding 
from other sources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government realized that it was 
becoming increasingly difficult to justify funding certain 
special interest groups, particularly at a time when many 
federal programs were being dropped or curtailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could not afford to keep on funding all the special interest 
group activities we were then funding.  Under program review, 
special principles were developed to help departments establish 
an order of priority for the funding of interest groups. 
Departments were asked to make a distinction between interest 
groups offering important services to the Canadian public and 
those who primary purpose was defending their members' interests.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The feeling was that sizeable reductions in the funding for 
interest groups providing services to a broad range of Canadians 
would not be desirable, since these interest groups represent 
the most efficient way of delivering public services. 
Departmental representatives were asked to scrutinize the 
funding of interest groups that did not provide any essential 
service to a broad segment of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the funding of interest groups was being examined, 
departmental representatives and ministers were asked to keep in 
mind the following four principles: first, how much the interest 
group membership itself or the general public benefit from the 
group's activities; second, how capable the group is of finding 
other sources of funding; third, the intended purpose of the 
group's activities, and fourth, how much the groups' activities 
fit in with government priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has attached great importance to program review 
and to a review of the funding of interest groups.  The six 
criteria for program review still apply today, and are taken 
into consideration when designing new programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The four principles drawn up in 1994 for examining the funding 
of special interest groups have now become the general criteria 
used for determining the funding of interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government acknowledges the significant role played by the 
volunteer sector and other interest groups in Canadian society. 
These groups may play an important and cost-effective role in the 
implementation of programs and services.  Often interest groups 
perform other important functions: they bring Canadians 
together, they speak for those who would not otherwise have a 
voice, and they carry out research. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that our process of re-examining the role of the 
State comprised a proper examination of the funding of special 
interest groups.  Treasury Board has issued policies on grants 
and contributions, as well as statements of principle on loans 
and loan guarantees. 
These are part of an appropriate regime of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are already proper mechanisms in place for reporting to 
Parliament through the estimates, departmental planning and 
priorities reports, performance reports and public accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implementation of the reporting structure proposed by Bill C-310 
would cut across the lines of already established mechanisms by 
which ministers report to Parliament on their programs.  In 
conclusion, I do not support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I stand in support of the private member's motion submitted by 
the member for Souris—Moose Mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the debate this morning I believe people are really missing 
the boat.  They are getting the basic simple premise of this bill 
confused. I will reread the intent of this bill.  The intent is 
that those receiving money from the government table a report on 
how the funds were used.  In principle I do not think there is 
anyone in the House who would disagree with that.  This is an 
issue of accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of parliament we are accountable.  We are accountable 
on how we spend our budgets and how we offer public service to 
the people of this country.  Obviously our books are open to 
people all the time.  I cannot understand why members in the 
House would disagree that any groups in this country receiving 
grants should be accountable for how these funds are spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give members an example of my own experience this summer. 
I called the National Action Committee on the Status of Women for 
an audit.  I asked for a copy of its expenditures.  Lo and 
behold, was I surprised how difficult it was to get a copy of 
expenditures for this past year.  I was told I would have to go 
through the access to information.  I did that and I am still 
waiting for the report.  I contacted the Library of Parliament. I 
received a 1995-96 copy of its expenditures, but that is several 
years old. I can imagine what citizens of this country have to go 
through when a member of parliament does not have access to 
records of expenditures of taxpayer dollars when one needs to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing I found ironic this summer was that having spoken to 
the media about expenditures of the national action committee, 
they seem to have all the figures at hand.

this member of parliament certainly has problems doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that all members of this House support this bill, 
certainly in principle, because it is about accountability and 
how money is spent by the special interest groups in this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the member for Souris—Moose Mountain for 
putting forward Bill C-310 because he has given credit to some 
work I did in the past. The parliamentary secretary also gave 
credit to the work I did in the past on bringing transparency and 
accountability to special interest groups.  I appreciate the 
support the member is giving to that issue by Bill C-310. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the government did respond excellently to the report 
I presented in 1994. It did do the things that the parliamentary 
secretary said.  It did bring greater transparency, greater 
accountability to those groups involved in contributions.  It 
also cut back drastically on many groups that were abusing the 
public trust by taking money from government and spending it in 
ways that were not necessarily beneficial to the public interest 
but more beneficial to themselves and beneficial to the lobbying 
that many of these groups undertook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-310 addresses one gap that still exists in the 
matter of public accountability of funds to special interest 
groups.  That is the question of grants.  I cannot speak for the 
government, and I rarely do, but I think one of the reasons why 
the government is a little reluctant to bring the same level of 
transparency and accountability as suggested by Bill C-310 to 
grant receiving organizations may have something to do with what 
the member for Rimouski—Mitis brought up. That is the whole 
question of options Canada and the suggestion that perhaps an 
organization like options Canada or any other organization may 
have been using some of the money it receives from the federal 
government in order to promote national unity.  In the climate of 
the referendum the province of Quebec was looking for just that 
kind of opportunity to attack the federal government to suggest 
the federal government was interfering with the unity debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-310 should be supported. There is never an instance when 
a group should not be prepared to account for itself on how it 
spends money to parliament or to the ministry.  If the federal 
government wishes to support national unity then it has my 
endorsement to use as much money as it wants.  I am sure that 
everyone who is interested in national unity would want to see 
the government use the money. There is no reason to hide behind 
any special interest group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support and endorse this bill one hundred per cent. I also 
wish to acknowledge that the government did act with alacrity and 
efficiency on the report I presented in 1994. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member for Wentworth—Burlington's 
giving support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member who spoke for the NDP had things a little mixed up. 
Perhaps I should say mixed up a lot.  Perhaps the reason why she 
does not want to get into this is the contributions made by 
interest groups that get large amounts of money from the federal 
government, namely the CLC.  In the last two elections that party 
received $1.5 million out of my pocket and everyone else's 
pocket, taxpayer money.  That is what this bill is all about. 
That is why this is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking about charities.  The hon. member said that 
giving to one special interest group and not to another is 
unbalanced and unfair.  This would change that.  This government 
has no right to be giving money to groups that want to influence 
their own thought against the will of the majority of Canadians. 
That is wrong.  If they want to raise money let them go out and 
raise it themselves. 
There are many organizations and some of the largest 
organizations in Canada do just that.

Speaker, you were right to point out that it is the riding of

since my colleague is the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré et l'Île-d'Orléans, Montmorency

</I></B></P><P align=left>But let us get back to the real issue. At first glance, Bill C-20 
may seem important and interesting, but it includes some 
provisions that the Bloc Quebecois does not like. This is why we 
are proposing some amendments today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before explaining these, I remind members that Bill 
C-20 is, for the most part, patterned on Bill C-67, which had been 
introduced in the House before the election. That bill died on 
the Order Paper because the Prime Minister decided to call a 
general election earlier than expected. Indeed, instead of 
waiting four years, he called the election after three and a 
half years. Thus, Bill C-67 died on the order paper.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill was reintroduced last fall, and we had to start the 
whole legislative process over again, including committee work. 
We again heard witnesses, such as representatives of the 
competition bureau and those of business people and consumers. 
A lot of people have noted that the legislative process can be 
lengthy, for all governments, but especially for the Liberal 
government, which preferred to call an election rather than 
continue its legislative work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, I think it is high time we legislate deceptive 
telemarketing. 
We must be very careful. We do not want to prohibit 
telemarketing here. In this technological and communications 
era, it is a modern, practical and efficient tool.  But over 
time, some people have come to use it to make fraudulent sales 
over the phone or by some other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in its bill, the government neglected to include 
the word “Internet”, but we will talk about this later.  In our 
opinion, it really must be included in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United States recognized the problem much earlier than did 
Canada.  Some organizations are talking of losses of $40 billion 
for individuals. So this a significant phenomenon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, the same groups are citing a figure of $60 million, 
probably because they have not managed to grasp all the 
ramifications of the problem. 
Deceptive telemarketing occurs not only nationally, but 
internationally.  It is therefore not limited by borders.  One 
reason this is the case is the reduction in long distance costs. 
Telephones are now available reasonably everywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At first glance, going after deceptive telemarketing appears to 
be a good thing to do.  Everyone agrees, including the members 
of the Bloc Quebecois.  However, the government's approach seems 
paradoxical, to say the least.  It wants to criminalize 
deceptive telemarketing, that is make it a new crime, and yet 
the bill talks of decriminalizing the penalties.  That strikes 
us as paradoxical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other paradoxes as well.  Apparently to speed up the 
process, there is a series of fines.  So then the matter becomes 
civil.  Quebec's civil code differs from that of the rest of 
Canada. 
Quebec has many provisions regarding the whole consumer 
protection question.  It even has an agency that deals with the 
issue on a specific, ongoing basis.  But, in its wish to improve 
controls that should already have been improved, the federal 
government is using this bill as an excuse to interfere in 
provincial jurisdiction.  As we have agreed, however, we will 
not focus on this exclusively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are less happy about, though, is the manner in which the 
government is attempting to regulate this area.  On the one 
hand, it wants to give the Competition Bureau's director, whom 
we shall henceforth call the commissioner, quite a few more 
powers than he previously had.  He will now have sole authority 
for making decisions that used to be made by a bureau, following 
hearings, in consultation with commissioners who examined the 
issue with him.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the director, or the future commissioner administering the 
Competition Act, can act alone, but must give those who will be 
charged 48 hours' notice.  Another paradox is that the bill 
allows companies who are breaking the law to negotiate an 
out-of-court solution before any hearing takes place or any ruling 
is made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our view, section 52 of the old Competition Act was 
preferable.  The measures being introduced in Bill C-20 are 
measures that weaken the legislation. 
It is odd that there is a desire, on the one hand, to introduce 
tighter regulations over deceptive telemarketing, which was not 
regulated at all before, while, on the other, the controls are 
being weakened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took part in the hearings of the Standing Committee on 
Industry and people from the Competition Bureau said that they 
were already looking at certain situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that we are way behind the United States as 
far as the financial consequences for individuals are concerned. 
Witnesses said:  “We could not list all the problems, but we 
have seen enough and it is sufficiently harmful to the 
disadvantaged, particularly the elderly with their savings, who 
are the most frequent victims.”  It is the elderly who are most 
often the victims of deceptive telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People might think that the bill would offer better protection. 
On the contrary, we think that the bill is weakened by this 
provision. 
The means available to the competition bureau are weakened and 
no one in the Department of Industry has indicated that the 
means or resources allocated to the competition bureau will be 
stepped up, yet we know this phenomenon is likely to increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the reason behind our motions Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  Motion 
No. 1 covers everything we want.  If Motion No. 1 were defeated, 
we would certainly move on to motions 2 and 3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are calling upon everyone in this House to pay close 
attention, because this bill has huge consequences for the 
entire population, but particularly for the elderly, the 
disadvantaged, the house-bound, who are seen as a preferred 
target by companies or individuals involved in fraudulent 
telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not wishing to end on a sour note, I would emphasize that there 
are many companies involved in very honest telemarketing. 
Those are not the ones targeted by either the government or 
ourselves.  There is good telemarketing, but the target here is 
fraudulent telemarketing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on 
these motions today.  I normally do not speak on the preamble to 
the motions, but it is with regret that I must. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When this bill was brought forward, the intention was to have it 
completed before the summer recess.  However, it was the member's 
party that delayed it and would not allow the bill to be passed 
in the spring session.  The first minute we were back in the 
House which was at 12 o'clock today, Bill C-20 was back in the 
House so that we could proceed with the passing of this act to 
amend the Competition Act. I want to make it perfectly clear that 
it is this government's intention to get this bill through as 
soon as possible, hopefully with the assistance of the other 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support these motions.  They would effectively remove 
the proposed new required element of a knowing or reckless 
intention.  They would leave the existing subsection 52(1) of the 
Competition Act dealing with misleading advertising and deceptive 
marketing practices unchanged.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This discussion during committee took many hours to make sure 
that we would have items in place in the act to protect from 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing.  The question of 
deleting the knowingly and reckless requirement was raised many 
times in committee.  It appears to be linked to a concern that we 
are softening the law with respect to the deceptive marketing 
practice provision in the act.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As witnesses for the competition bureau explained during the 
committee hearing, this is simply not the case.  The committee 
dealt with and accepted the mens rea requirement along with the 
whole balanced criminal and civil regime provided for in Bill 
C-20, the amendments relating to deceptive marketing practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand the reason for the change in the criminal 
provision and the creation of a new civil regime to deal with 
misleading advertising and deceptive marketing practice, it is 
useful to put the current regime in context.  While the 
prohibitions against misleading or deceptive advertising have 
generally been effective in dealing with many aspects of this 
problem, the current provisions are solely criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons a wider range of enforcement 
mechanisms would allow more appropriate and effective responses 
to the variety of such conduct in the marketplace.  For example, 
the stigma of the criminal process may encourage an adversarial 
response and preclude the informal and speedy resolution of many 
cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the 1970s several studies have suggested that criminal 
sanctions with a focus on punishment are an incomplete response 
to misleading advertising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultative panel that provided advice to the director in 
the development of Bill C-20 also supported a dual track 
educational approach to deal with the problem of misleading 
advertising and deceptive marketing practices.  In particular it 
supported the approach contained in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the misleading advertising and deceptive 
marketing provision is to ensure that consumers in the 
marketplace are getting the correct information they need to make 
their purchasing decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that in most cases the civil regime will provide the 
most effective and efficient means to achieve that end.  The 
availability of more efficient, flexible and effective tools such 
as the administrative monetary penalty cease and desist orders 
and publication orders should provide a more rapid and cost 
effective response than the criminal law.  It is better 
protection to the consumers and will encourage greater compliance 
by business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residual criminal provision in clause 12 is being retained 
to deal with the most serious instances of intentional 
misconduct.  Given the gravity of the offence it is appropriate 
and necessary to change it from a strict liability offence to a 
full mens rea criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we believe that the provisions contained in Bill 
C-20 create a balanced and effective way to ensure that there is 
fair competition in the marketplace and that Canadian consumers 
are getting accurate information to make their purchasing 
decisions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I feel particularly honoured today to be making my first 
official statement in the House as the industry critic for Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition.  I hope I can serve the Canadian 
people with the same integrity and common sense as my colleague 
from Okanagan Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to be addressing Bill C-20, a bill that I 
believe will work to modernize the Competition Act.  Having 
studied the amendments to the bill put forward by the hon. member 
for Mercier, it is apparent that they are certainly not without 
merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, at this stage of debate we must decide whether these 
amendments warrant the delay of legislation that will among other 
things offer much needed protection against telemarketing fraud 
that is most often directed at Canada's senior citizens. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT17"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT17"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect, it is my conclusion that these amendments do not 
warrant the support of the House.  To begin with it is my opinion 
that all the Group No. 1 motions should be opposed.  If supported 
these motions would remove the words knowingly and recklessly 
from clause 12 of the bill and would change the intent of the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that part of the purpose and design of Bill 
C-20 is to provide a new civil law framework to deal with 
deliberate and flagrant telemarketing frauds.  It will provide 
for a civil law regime that will complement existing Criminal 
Code protection against fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intention of the legislation is not to soften the legal 
approach to deceptive telemarketing, as is feared by the member 
for Mercier, but to allow the courts to draw the distinction 
between those transgressions of the Competition Act that are 
deliberate and those that are not.  This will allow these 
transgressions to be dealt with more expeditiously, which will 
benefit immensely the Canadian consumer.  For this reason I 
recommend to the members of the House that Motion No. 2 and the 
entire Group No. 1 motions be opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 provides a much needed legal framework for the 
telemarketing industry.  Motions Nos. 4, 5, 7 and 8 of Group No. 
2 would expand the framework to include Internet communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may seem tempting to share the Bloc member's belief that the 
legislation would better serve Canadians if its scope were 
broadened.  In fact it appears to make perfect sense that 
deceptive marketing over the Internet is as fraudulent and 
abhorrent as deceptive marketing over the telephone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the sections of Bill C-20 that deal with telemarketing 
were designed with the understanding that telephone communication 
involves a potential for psychological coercion that is largely 
absent in Internet communication.  The manipulation, deceit, 
pressure and intimidation that unfairly mark the telemarketing 
industry are not as acute in Internet trade where the customer 
can with the simple click of a mouse make the offensive party 
disappear.  It is much more difficult to hang up on a live voice 
over the phone.  It is much easier to be persuaded by a deceitful 
salesperson over the phone than on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the question of how to regulate electronic commerce 
is one that demands a thorough investigation.  I remind the House 
that in October of this year at a ministerial conference this 
issue will be addressed in its entirety, at which point the 
industry committee can examine the legal and regulatory questions 
with greater understanding.  For these reasons I recommend to my 
colleagues that all Group No. 2 amendments be opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 presented to us again by the hon. member for 
Mercier stands alone in Group No. 3 and, if supported, would 
expand the guidelines provided for telemarketers to include 
fraudulent claims regarding warranties and the overall 
performance and efficacy of a product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My immediate concern is that the amendment would wrongly place 
the onus on the telemarketer to ensure that the manufacturer's 
product claims are accurate.  While I strongly believe 
telemarketers must act with due diligence in their relationship 
with manufacturers, the quality and efficacy of the product as 
supported by the manufacturer's claim should be the 
responsibility of the manufacturer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 52 of the act as amended by Bill C-20 is sufficiently 
broad so as to include false claims concerning warranties and the 
overall quality of products.  For these two reasons I recommend 
that Motion No. 6 in Group No. 3 be opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at Group No. 4 amendments I would first like to 
address Motions Nos. 9 and 10 and then move to Motion No. 11 to 
conclude my speech.  As many members of the House are aware, all 
complaints that fall under the Competition Act are investigated 
by the commissioner and where deemed appropriate are then placed 
before the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 9 and 10 would allow a private individual over the 
age of 18 to bring a case to the commissioner for investigation. 
The current procedure, however, is to insist that at least six 
individuals submit a complaint.  This is a mechanism intended to 
help to ensure against frivolous and vexatious submissions to the 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a consumer has a complaint that he or she believes involves a 
violation of the Competition Act, he or she must find five other 
individuals who share the opinion that a violation of the 
Competition Act has occurred. This is not an unreasonable demand 
to place on the Canadian consumer.  By insisting that six 
individuals be a part of the application process to the 
commissioner we can work to ensure that Canadian businesses are 
not subject to a barrage of frivolous complaints. 
For this reason I recommend that Motions Nos. 9 and 10 in Group 
No. 4 be opposed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1225"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 is one that I strongly considered supporting.  I 
think the intent of the motion was to give Canadians direct 
access to the tribunal, thereby removing a barrier to 
communicating the needs of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion would allow a single individual to bring a matter 
directly before the tribunal removing the direct involvement of 
the commissioner.  While I would normally support an initiative 
that would allow citizens direct access to this court, this 
motion unfortunately maintains the insistence that a single 
individual can bring a case to the tribunal instead of the six 
individuals currently required.  For the same reasons I opposed 
Motions Nos. 9 and 10 I must also oppose Motion No. 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recommend to all members of the House that the 11 motions put 
forward by the hon. member for Mercier be opposed.  Canadians 
have for too long gone without adequate protection against 
telemarketing fraud and this legislation should do much to 
provide that protection. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I will 
restrict my comments to the amendments proposed by the Bloc in 
Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  I believe we will have additional time 
to talk to the other amendments later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the opportunity to speak to these motions which 
deal with a fundamental component of Bill C-20.  The component is 
an effort to move many issues of corporate non-compliance out of 
the realm of criminal courts and into a civil resolution 
mechanism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a practical solution that achieves several goals.  First 
and foremost it reduces the cost of moving a corporation into a 
position of compliance.  Second, it creates a more positive 
environment for dispute resolution.  Third, it is a time 
efficient approach to an issue that has all too often seen 
disputes dragged out for excessive periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not necessary for me to emphasize the exorbitant costs of 
criminal proceedings.  For that purpose, except for the most 
egregious situations the goal of Bill C-20 should be to make 
corporations conform.  The bill in its form does this.  The bill 
should also assist in lessening combative relationships between 
the competition bureau and corporate Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Critics may claim that this is a watering down of present 
legislation.  The Progressive Conservative Party does not see it 
that way.  In fact quite the opposite is true.  What we will 
achieve is successful compliance in a cost effective and time 
efficient manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an enlightened and reasonable approach to legislation. 
For that reason we cannot support the proposed amendments by the 
Bloc. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, unlike the last speaker I do not think we should 
be watering down the competition legislation that we have in 
Canada.  We do not have very tough competition legislation as it 
is and I think it is important that we maintain close scrutiny 
over the competitiveness of our marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me to be at the cornerstone of the way in which we 
are to protect consumers and the way we are to create a dynamic 
economy in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the specific measures proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois, it is important to ensure that there are not easy ways 
out of misleading representations on the part of corporations. 
Not only does that harm consumers when they are tricked into 
buying goods or services that are not as they were represented to 
be, but legitimate, honest and decent businessmen and women 
competing with those deceptive businesses suffer losses as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to ensure that a whole range of options is available to 
the Government of Canada, to the competition bureau, to ensure 
that we have vigorous competition in the various marketplaces 
across the country. 
Consequently I think it is important to be quite specific about 
what we expect businesses to do and we need to require them a 
rather greater standard of care than the government is suggesting 
here.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not surprising that the Liberal government and the 
Progressive Conservative Party would want to respond to the 
difficulties businesses face in trying to keep themselves honest 
and straight with consumers.  After all, they receive 
considerable support from all businesses, those who might be 
misrepresenting statements as those who are being perfectly above 
board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have to call businesses to account to make sure that 
they actually pay some attention to what they say. I might call 
attention to the whole raft of letters people may be getting from 
Reader's Digest and Publishers Clearing House. In the letters, on 
the envelopes and all across these things they say one has won 
hundreds of thousands of dollars when quite plainly one has not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might say that's a load of nonsense and throw that into the 
garbage but plainly Publishers Clearing House and Reader's Digest 
would not be distributing that kind of promotional literature 
were it not persuasive to some consumers in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context it seems to me with these changes Reader's 
Digest, Publishers Clearing House and others like that would be 
even freer to distort the marketplace, even freer to gyp honest, 
hardworking Canadian citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than weaken these provisions I think we should be 
toughening them.  We should be moving toward tougher competition 
legislation, not because it is hard on business but because it is 
good for business and it is good for Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK25"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
it is nice to see you and all other members in the House after 
the summer vacation.  I have been looking forward to the opening 
of the session to hold the Liberal government accountable.  But 
today in the next 10 minutes I will be kind to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to speak 
against the proposed Bloc amendments to Bill C-20, an act to 
amend the Competition Act and to make consequential and related 
amendments to other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition supports this bill.  We agree with the 
objective of this bill.  My colleague from Edmonton—Strathcona, 
our new industry critic, has very eloquently expressed our 
support for this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill was introduced in the House earlier the Reform 
Party put forward certain amendments to the bill before we could 
support it.  The government has accepted all those amendments. 
Therefore we approve of the efforts by this government to 
modernize the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports vigorously measures to ensure the 
successful operation of the marketplace.  This includes promoting 
competition, competitive pricing and strengthening and vigorously 
enforcing competition and anti-combines legislation.  We support 
severe penalties for collusion and price fixing.  In a 
competitive marketplace which serves the consumer well, it is 
reasonable to expect freedom from deception or collusion or any 
other anti-competitive practice that would inhibit the successful 
operation of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can deal with the four groups of amendments as a whole because 
the official opposition opposes all four groups of amendments. In 
Group No. 1 the first motion and the third motion are 
unnecessary. They only seek to change the structure of the bill 
and do no affect the contents of the bill.  Motion No. 2 would 
change the intent of the bill by removing the words “knowingly” 
and “recklessly”.  The motion would counter the creation of the 
new civil law framework meant to deal with deliberate and 
flagrant telemarketing frauds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group of amendments would expand Bill C-20 to include 
Internet communications. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is aimed at addressing the telemarketing industry. 
This bill will also address the potential psychological coercion 
during person to person telecommunication or telephone 
conversations.  The Bloc amendments do not account for the fact 
that the same level of coercion recognized in telephone 
communications is not present in Internet communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internet communications allow one to simply point and click in 
order to delete and put an end to this solicitation, whereas 
person to person live communication is not as easy to terminate. 
It is more interactive.  No doubt there is a need for some rules 
to be applied to Internet communications.  We can appreciate what 
the third party in the House intends to accomplish with Motions 
Nos. 4 through 8. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is not the appropriate vehicle and cannot accommodate 
the inclusion of Internet communications.  In the third group of 
amendments, Motion No. 6 would include a prohibition against 
offering a statement, warranty, guarantee of performance, 
efficacy or length of life about the product without adequate and 
proper test thereof.  This amendment wrongly places the onus on 
the telemarketer to ensure that the service provider or 
manufacturer claims are accurate.  While telemarketers must act 
with due diligence in their relationship with the manufacturer or 
the service provider about the quality and efficacy of the 
product or the service as supported by the manufacturer's claim, 
it should be the responsibility of the manufacturer and not the 
telemarketer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legal framework provided in the bill offers enforceable 
guidelines for professional conduct among telemarketers. 
Furthermore, section 52 as amended by Bill C-20 is reasonably 
broad so as to include false claims concerning warranties, et 
cetera. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Group No. 4, Motions Nos. 9 and 10 ask that a single private 
individual over the age of 18 be allowed to bring a case to the 
commissioner for investigation.  The current procedure requires 
that at least six individuals submit a complaint.  This is a 
mechanism to help to ensure against frivolous and vexatious 
submissions to the commissioner. All complaints that fall under 
the Competition Act are investigated by the commissioner and, 
where deemed appropriate, are placed before the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 requests that a single individual be allowed to 
bring a matter directly before the tribunal, removing any direct 
involvement of the commissioner.  Again, it is more desirable to 
have all complaints that fall under the Competition Act 
investigated first by the commissioner and then, where deemed 
appropriate, placed before the tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is twofold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I believe we 
are to be talking on this go around only on the first three 
amendments.  I notice the last two speakers have been covering 
all 11 amendments put forward by the Bloc.  We should be 
addressing only the first three. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member for Markham is quite 
correct.  The debate before the House is on Motions Nos. 1, 2 and 
3 which have been grouped for debate.  I believe there are other 
groupings that will be debated later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps hon. members can confine their remarks to the motions 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on the same point of 
order.  It must be remembered that individuals speaking to these 
particular issues can do so as they feel it affects the 
particular grouping.  I do not think the hon. member should be so 
stringent as to suggest that they are not dealing specifically 
with those groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Occasionally there is reason to 
believe that discussion of other groups is relevant to the 
discussion of the group currently under debate in the House.  It 
is also fair to say that general comments about other aspects of 
the debate are generally not permitted in the debate on a 
specific group of motions.  I have indicated that. 
In any event, I am sure the House will want to hear what the hon. 
member has to say.  He will now want to resume.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the nature of the 
amendments is such that we could group them and discuss them in 
that manner but I appreciate your comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is twofold, to modernize the 
Competition Act and to respond to a changing business and 
enforcement environment by increasing efficiency in the 
administration of the act.  In principle this bill deals with 
deceptive marketing and deceptive telemarketing.  It makes 
criminal prohibition broader and more flexible.  It streamlines 
the approach to merger reviews. One good thing about how this 
bill addresses deceptive marketing is that it will create 
efficiency by allowing civil offences to be addressed without 
lengthy court delays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New provisions under Bill C-20 will address deceptive 
telemarketing practices.  For example, in selling lotteries, 
gambling or vacations to our senior citizens, some telemarketers 
sell emotions and they defraud them.  But high pressure selling 
tactics are addressed through this bill by requiring 
telemarketers to give fair and reasonable disclosure of 
information at the beginning of each telephone call.  This 
includes the identity of the company, the purpose of the 
communication, the nature of the product or the business 
interest, the price, any material restrictions and so on.  This 
is particularly important because more businesses like banks, 
credit unions, airlines, et cetera, are expanding their call 
centres. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill addresses streamlining the merger process.  Under the 
current legislation the requirement for information is very broad 
and not necessarily efficient or effective.  The amount of 
information required will depend on the complexity of the merger. 
The government will have time to examine the critical merger 
proposal thoroughly.  For example, there is the controversial 
merger of the Royal Bank and the Bank of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us are experienced in receiving junk mail certificates 
that grant us millions of dollars.  Some fraudulent businesses 
grant winning prizes while they ask for money in advance for 
shipment, et cetera, and keep the money.  We have to stop all 
these practices.  We must address these unfair practices and 
ensure fair competition.  That is what all members of the House 
should be doing.  We should work toward fair competition in the 
marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition believes in a competitive market arena 
that serves consumers well.  It must be free of deception, 
collusion or any anti-competitive practice that inhibits its 
successful operation. On behalf of the people of Surrey Central 
and other Canadians, in particular senior citizens who need 
immediate adequate protection against telemarketing fraud, I will 
be voting in support of Bill C-20.  I will have to vote against 
the amendments we are considering today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I begin by complimenting the Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Industry and the minister for these amendments to the 
Competition Act.  Especially in the area of telemarketing scams, 
one cannot believe the amount of damage and harm being caused in 
this nation to many of our seniors.  This is the type of bill I 
am sure all parties would want to put through the House as fast 
as we can.  I am sure there is not a member in the House of 
Commons who has not had a phone call from a son or a daughter of 
a senior citizen to try to get us as parliamentarians to amend 
the Competition Act to provide not just the Competition Bureau 
but the various police forces in Canada with the necessary tools 
that will enable them to do their jobs in shutting down these 
deceptive telemarketing scams.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that the amendments the minister and the 
parliamentary secretary have brought forward provide for a new 
criminal offence for deceptive telemarketing, much stricter 
disclosure requirements, a more effective and quicker resolution 
for misleading advertising and deceptive practices, and an 
investigative tool that will allow the police forces to close in 
on the organizations that are using these price-fixing, 
bid-rigging and deceptive telemarketing systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We sit here and draft legislation on a continual basis, but 
sometimes we forget the human factor that generates the 
legislation we are drafting.  In the case of these telemarketing 
scams that deal mostly with senior citizens, I am sure we all 
realize that very rarely will a senior citizen call his or her MP 
and say “I have been had” because most of the senior citizens 
who are victims of these telemarketing scams feel embarrassed 
that they have been had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact there are incidents, and I have heard this from some of 
my own constituents, where sons and daughters go into their 
parents' homes and suddenly see different items, such as 
paintings, rubber boats and different sorts of trinkets.  They 
will ask their mother or father where they got these things and 
the parents will slough it off.  The parents do not want to tell 
because they feel embarrassed.  It is almost an inadvertent 
experience that it will be discovered that the senior citizen is 
being had by these vicious, deceptive telemarketing scams.  God 
only knows the thousands and thousands of senior citizens who are 
victims who may not have living children.  We never hear about 
those cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to take up a lot of the House's time on this issue 
today, but I do want be on the record as being forcefully 
supportive of Bill C-20 which will amend the Competition Act.  I 
urge all members of the House to push this through in a speedy 
way so that the various enforcement agencies can shut down these 
operations which are active in every province of our country.

be an opportunity to deal with those cases through fines, through 
cease and desist orders or by means of information notices.  That 
is preferable because it just provides much more flexibility in 
dealing with those types of cases.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Mr. Speaker, in fact, it is still the riding 
of Lévis, except that, in one of the last bills we passed before 
adjourning for the summer, “Chutes-de-la-Chaudière” was added in 
recognition of the fact that it makes up half the federal riding 
of Lévis. In fact, Chutes-de-la-Chaudière is a separate provincial 
riding and there is even a regional county municipality by that 
name. That is why this change was made. We will get used to it. 
This is not so bad considering that some of my fellow MPs 
represent ridings with four names. Chaudière Falls are the most 
beautiful in the world after Niagara Falls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The various proposals made in connection with the motions in 
Group 2 relate essentially to the word “Internet”. 
We feel the government was mistaken in not including the word 
“Internet” in this bill. After all, the Internet and 
telemarketing may be considered closely related since more and 
more people are connected to the Internet at home, and companies 
readily use the Internet to promote and, if possible, sell their 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are talking about here, of course, is fraudulent 
telemarketing. We cannot and should not prevent companies from 
conducting operations that are conducted properly, honestly and 
efficiently, but it seems to us that not mentioning the Internet 
in today's context is a serious mistake. That is why we stress 
the word “Internet” in each motion in this group.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also a notion which we did not have time to really 
examine earlier, but which is essentially the basis of the 
speech made by the parliamentary secretary. I am referring to 
the word “knowingly”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we prove that someone does something knowingly? The 
legal provisions that deal with this issue are often challenged 
in court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to be funny, but are we going to rely on a lie 
detector to determine whether someone did something knowingly? A 
company employs a number of people. The manager may do something 
knowingly, but is it also the case for the employees? This is 
very much a grey area. 
I think a better definition is in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our opinion, section 52 of the Competition Act was more 
precise and included the word “knowingly”. I think that the 
government and the other parties have good intentions. Everyone 
is in favour of combatting fraudulent telemarketing. No one can 
oppose virtue. However, if an act or a provision can be legally 
challenged because it is very difficult to prove someone's 
intentions, we could end up with a strange and paradoxical 
situation in that we may not be able to do what we sought to do 
because the legislation cannot be enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the five years that I have been here, a number of members 
have dealt with the question of what constitutes good 
legislation. 
We all know that an act must be fair and equitable, but we must 
also determine whether it is enforceable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the best legislation in the world cannot be enforced, it will 
be useless. All of us in the House of Commons and all those 
involved in the legislative process want to make a useful 
contribution. We want our work to produce results. We do not 
want to take futile measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what we are concerned about. This is why the Bloc 
Quebecois feels that the word “knowingly” should be removed, 
since that notion is impossible to prove. We are not trying to 
oppose this legislation, but to improve it and make it even more 
effective, more enforceable. We must try to make it easier to 
enforce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Internet, I think it goes without saying. As we 
approach the new millennium, I do not think there is any need to 
demonstrate that this means will be used increasingly. Many 
companies will do business through the Internet. This is already 
possible, but it will be done on a larger scale. The purpose of 
the amendments in the motions in group 2 is to add the word 
“Internet”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Motions Nos. 4, 5 and 7 would 
effectively add the Internet communications, even where they were 
not interactive, to the ambit of the provisions covering 
deceptive telemarketing.  The Internet issue was raised and dealt 
with by the committee, which accepted Bill C-20 wording.  The 
telemarketing provisions are designed to focus on the use of 
abusive, high-pressure tactics during interactive telephone 
communications where the victims are vulnerable and have little 
time to reflect on the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Broadview—Greenwood has expressed many times in 
the House the concern about the high-pressure tactics that are 
used on senior citizens, and we heard that again this morning. 
These particular problems do not apply to the Internet and for 
that reason, it is not appropriate to include the Internet in 
section 52.1.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Representations made over the Internet and by means of 
electronic commerce are subject to the same laws as other 
representations and would be covered under the Criminal Code and 
section 52 and the proposed section 74.01 of the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the Competition Bureau has already had some success in 
relation to pursuing Internet situations under section 52.  We 
believe that the Internet issues are most effectively dealt with 
by the co-operative enforcement initiatives at the international 
level.  These are being actively pursued. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too soon to tell what competition problems may arise in 
relation to the Internet.  This situation will be kept under 
review for further amendments as and when necessary.  This 
discussion was held at the industry committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 8 would remove the possibility for legitimate 
telemarketers to streamline their business by providing all the 
necessary information concerning their product to the customer by 
some other means, for example by direct mail or in a catalogue 
prior to the telephone call. Customers may also appreciate or 
even prefer the savings on their time if the required information 
is provided in some written form ahead of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have difficulty supporting this motion.  The existing 
disclosure requirements in Bill C-20 are tailored to elicit a 
reasonable level of disclosure while balancing the burden to be 
placed on legitimate telemarketers.  I must emphasize that we do 
have legitimate telemarketers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal does not benefit consumers significantly if at 
all, but could significantly increase the burden on business.  It 
is for that reason we speak against the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I got a little ahead of myself this morning.  I wanted 
to speak against all these motions saying that they were not good 
for this bill.  Now I am able at least to address Motions Nos. 4, 
5, 7 and 8 once again to say how I believe that this is not going 
to help the competence of this bill in any way.  They should be 
opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 provides a much needed legal framework as we know for 
the telemarketing industry.  Motions Nos. 4, 5, 7 and 8 of Group 
No. 2 would expand this framework to include Internet 
communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may seem tempting to share the Bloc member's belief that this 
legislation would better serve Canadians if its scope were 
broadened.  In fact it appears to make perfect sense that 
deceptive marketing over the Internet is as fraudulent and as 
abhorrent as deceptive marketing over the telephone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the sections of Bill C-20 that deal with telemarketing 
were designed with the understanding that telephone communication 
involves the potential for psychological coercion.  That is 
largely absent in Internet communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The manipulation, the deceit, the pressure, the intimidation 
that unfairly mar the telemarketing industry are not as acute in 
Internet trade where the customer can, with the simple click of 
the mouse, make the offensive party disappear.  It is much more 
difficult to hang up on a live voice over the telephone and it is 
much easier to be persuaded by a deceitful salesperson over the 
phone than on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the question of how to regulate electronic commerce 
is one that demands a thorough investigation.  I would like to 
remind the House that in October of this year at a ministerial 
conference this issue will be addressed in its entirety, at which 
point the industry committee can examine the legal and regulatory 
questions with greater understanding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these reasons I would recommend to my colleagues that all of 
the Group No. 2 amendments be opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, telemarketing scams hurt the poor and the 
vulnerable.  Senior citizens are less reliant on the Internet and 
this therefore is not a pressing issue.  Rather than confusing 
this part of the bill to add the Internet regulation, I think it 
is important that we just deal specifically with the 
telemarketing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to commend Industry Canada on this initiative.  It 
deserves our support.  Trying to add motions to this part of Bill 
C-20 would just complicate the issue further.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not think adding the word Internet to this 
particular provision in a number of places complicates matters 
very much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the OECD the government, along with the secretary general who 
is a Canadian, is aggressively pursuing the very question of 
Internet commerce and how we deal with the abuse of it and how we 
deal with fraud on the Internet.  We are still in the relatively 
early stages in dealing with the protection of the interests of 
Internet users in this regard.  We are still not sure that 
secrecy and confidentiality can be fully observed but we are 
moving in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To suppose that there is less pressure upon the users of the 
Internet, the kind of pressure that we have seen forced 
particularly on older people to send large amounts of money to 
telemarketers is open to debate.  It is not clear to me that the 
pressure is any less pressing, that we should not respond by 
adding the Internet in the context of telemarketing.  We are 
talking about a fairly new type of commerce, a new type of 
interaction, a new type of communication and a new type of media. 
To walk away from the problems that are already on the Internet 
and the problems that we can easily foresee seems not to be wise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière 
for adding the provision relating to the Internet and for drawing 
attention to the implications of the potential for fraud or 
coercive activity, for misleading representations which persuade 
people to engage in commerce on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the government's commitment at the OECD level, it 
was odd that it would not also provide some sort of commitment 
locally.  What does it say about its commitment at the 
international level that there is no provision within a piece of 
national legislation which is presently before the House, that 
the government has left it out altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to draw attention to this question to consider 
the Internet and the abuse of the Internet in not a very 
different way than the abuse of telephone marketing.  It would be 
useful if we ensured that our competition policy was up to date 
to the extent that it was dealing with the way in which commerce 
is being carried on in the country today.  More commerce will be 
dealt with over the Internet, so we had better get organized to 
do something about it and not wait until we find out whether or 
not it is more or less coercive, whether or not it is worse, or 
whether or not it tricks more people because we know the 
potential is there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge that we support this provision and not in the words of 
the member for the Reform Party see it as something terribly 
complicated.  It does not look very complicated to me. 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the Internet is 
very important but in this particular case it deserves special 
discussion and more public consultation with the people involved 
in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party will not support Motions Nos. 4, 5, 7 and 8. These are 
very troubling amendments in that they seek to put a certain 
level of regulation on the Internet in what can only be referred 
to as a haphazard attempt.  There are questions to be answered 
and maybe we should be looking at ways to protect consumers on 
the Internet.  It needs to be done in a thoughtful manner with 
greater public involvement.  To do so in a reckless manner would 
be a disservice to the legislation and to all Internet users.  We 
only need to look at our southern neighbours and their 
unsuccessful attempts at regulation of the Internet.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue where the public demands to be heard.  No 
matter how well intentioned this amendment may be, we have not as 
parliamentarians had an opportunity to study all the potential 
impacts.  Let us not deviate from our primary purpose with this 
Bill C-20.  It is designed to deliver a crushing blow to 
fraudulent telemarketing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it is true that electronic commerce via the Internet is 
growing in an exponential fashion, it does not constitute the 
same insidious risk that telemarketing does.  Professional 
telefraud artists know how to seek out the most vulnerable in our 
society.  These slick individuals are more adept at defrauding 
the aged and the lonely merely by building a degree of empathy 
over the telephone. In this type of situation the victims, like 
most Canadians, do not wish to be rude and hang up on the caller. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No such situation exists on the Internet because one always has 
the opportunity to delete or to back page or just turn off the 
computer.  The Internet is necessarily a colder, more impersonal 
means of communication.  It lacks the necessary characteristics 
to create trust and empathetic relations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I respect the intention of my hon. colleague's amendment, 
let us seize this opportunity to handle one situation at a time. 
At this time our priority must be telemarketing fraud. 
<P><A NAME="LINK35"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
earlier I addressed the four groups together.  Now we are on 
Group No. 2 of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Industry Canada deserves our support for this particular 
initiative.  We recognize that Bill C-20 is very important and 
some of the amendments are pretty good.  The thing here is we are 
fighting against a timeframe and while we are against a 
timeframe, fraudulent telemarketing is hurting the most 
vulnerable and very poor in our society.  It hurts people who 
cannot defend themselves against these marketing scams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, our senior citizens are the hardest hit category in 
this particular scam.  We all know that deceptive telemarketing 
hurts honest people and those telemarketers mar the whole 
industry. Senior citizens are less reliant on the Internet at 
this time. We know that Internet is coming up very fast.  We know 
therefore it is not pressing at this time. The amendments in this 
bill should have been passed yesterday because every day 
telemarketing scams are hurting vulnerable seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's high tech economy will become Internet dependent one 
day.  The time will come when we have to address this issue.  I 
agree 100% the Internet must be regulated. It must be regulated 
in a way that allows commerce to flourish and consumers to be 
protected.  This matter will be addressed at a ministerial 
conference in October, and the industry committee will be 
addressing this particular issue. This issue should be studied at 
the steering committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second group of amendments will expand Bill C-20 to include 
Internet communications.  Bill C-20 is aimed at addressing the 
whole telemarketing industry itself.  This bill will address the 
potential for psychological coercion during personal telephone 
communications.  High pressure telemarketing sales people try to 
sell their programs and services.  It is difficult for senior 
citizens to hang up sometimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc amendments do not account for the fact that the same 
level of coercion recognized in telephone communications is not 
present in Internet communications. Internet communication allows 
one to simply point and click with the mouse in order to delete 
and put an end to the solicitation.

some rules to be applied to Internet communication, but, as I 
said, this issue should be resolved later so that we can give 
adequate protection to our senior citizens who are vulnerable to 
these telemarketing scams. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will therefore oppose the particular set of motions in group 
2.  I do not think there is a member in this House who does not 
support this bill.  We should get on with passing this bill so

bill which remains imprecise.  I point out the particular 
context of this bill, which will give greater powers to the 
director of the competition bureau, to be known in future as the

alone, whereas in the past there were other commissioners.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I have difficulty supporting 
this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated earlier when referring to the motions affecting a 
general criminal provision in subsection 52(1) against misleading 
representation, the wording of the proposed subclause 13(a) would 
in most cases be broad enough to capture the matters specifically 
detailed in the suggested paragraphs, namely: performance claims, 
warranties and ordinary price claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that the wording suggested by paragraph (a.3) of 
this motion does not take account of the proposed new tests 
dealing with ordinary price claims in section 74.01, which were 
thoroughly canvassed, accepted and debated by the committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will take a few brief moments to rehash my thoughts on 
Motion No. 6 to amend Bill C-20 presented by the hon. member for 
Mercier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion stands alone in Group No. 3 and, if supported, would 
expand the guidelines provided for telemarketers to include 
fraudulent claims regarding warranties and the overall 
performance and efficacy of a product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My immediate concern is that this amendment would wrongly place 
the onus on the telemarketer to ensure that the manufacturer's 
product claims are accurate.  While I strongly believe that 
telemarketers must act with due diligence in their relationship 
with manufacturers, the quality and efficacy of the product as 
supported by the manufacturer's claim should be the 
responsibility of the manufacturer.  Furthermore, section 52 of 
the act, as amended by Bill C-20, is sufficiently broad so as to 
include false claims concerning warranties and the overall 
quality of products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these two reasons I would recommend that Motion No. 6 be 
opposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a final note, it is not in the best interests of consumers to 
create legislation that will be unduly costly and cumbersome for 
business.  My colleagues in the Reform Party have constantly 
argued that we need to try to create opportunities by putting 
less obstacles in the way of business.  Being a small 
businessman, I know that the biggest obstacles which are usually 
faced are government red tape and bureaucracy.  Let us look at 
ways to try to eliminate that and make it easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 6 unfortunately goes down the road of putting 
obstacles in front of business.  We need a balance between the 
protection of consumers and the freedom of business.  As I 
mentioned earlier, I commend Industry Canada for this initiative. 
We are starting to see more of a direction toward eliminating 
bureaucracy and red tape for business.  I wish that the 
government would follow that direction and that we would see more 
of this type of direction in legislation on other bills.  We need 
to try to create more opportunities in our economy and we should 
all work together to try to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned, I believe it would be in the best interests of 
the House to oppose Motion No. 6.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chris Axworthy (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the provisions which have been recommended under 
Motion No. 6 are pretty standard provisions of most competition 
legislation and, in particular, of all legislation dealing with 
warranties and guarantees, basically dealing with representations 
made not only by someone who makes a product but also by someone 
who sells a product. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The warranty is a larger legal term than just the type of 
guarantee you get from a manufacturer for a product that is being 
sold, statements made about the efficacy of a product, about the 
standard and quality of a product and indeed about the prices at 
which products are traditionally being sold are not only made by 
the person manufacturing the product, who in this day and age is 
probably in another country altogether, but also by the importer, 
the wholesaler and the retailer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is important to include a provision of this sort 
for greater specificity, for greater protection for consumers and 
for greater protection for businesses which are honest and 
forthright because they are being penalized by the deceptive 
practices of other businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to add this kind of provision.  It is a common 
practice amongst most legislation of this sort.  It would add 
extra specificity to the section dealing with telemarketing 
practices.  It would provide an extra person, who might be 
responsible, to be pursued legally for damages above and beyond 
the manufacturer, the importer, the wholesaler and any other 
retailer.  It seems to widen the net a bit to bring in more 
deceptive practices perpetrated by those businesses which are 
dishonest and out to cheat Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to emphasize a point made by last the speaker. It 
is odd to suggest that a provision such as this, which would 
prohibit misleading representations to the public concerning the 
price at which things are sold, which would prohibit 
representations which are untrue as to the performance, efficacy 
or length of life of a product, with respect to a warranty or 
guarantee of a product with regards to repair, replacement and so 
on, could be damaging to business, at least damaging to 
legitimate business. If the member wants to protect illegitimate 
business that is another matter.  It would be damaging to those 
illegitimate businesses which are out to cheat consumers and 
their competitors in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely we are here to present a level playing field for 
businesses and protection for consumers.  If the hon. member 
looked back at other consumer protection legislation, not only in 
other parts of the world but throughout Canada, he would have 
seen that this is a very normal provision and one which would add 
to the protection of consumers and to the protection of 
legitimate businesses.  It seems to me that it is in everyone's 
interest.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
Conservative Party will be opposing Motion No. 6 put forward by 
the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-20, a 
bill that we had hoped would be expedited so as to provide our 
law enforcement officials with more tools in their ongoing battle 
with telemarketing fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent estimates have put telemarketing fraud figures at $50 
billion annually in Canada and the U.S.  A quick calculation 
tells me that this equates to over $137 million each and every 
day.  I ask that members pardon my frustration, but I have to 
wonder why we are allowing even one more day of delay on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps these amendments are reasonable.  However, I believe 
that deceptive telemarketing provisions are already adequately 
addressed by legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must add that perhaps if this motion, as well as the preceding 
ones, had been introduced at the committee stage we would have 
had the opportunity to study them in an in-depth fashion. 
That is the purpose of our parliamentary committee work.  Once 
again I feel that we would be slipping into an indiscriminate 
approach to legislation if we were to pass this motion.  This 
could only lead to shoddy legislation, and the PC Party will not 
be supporting it.

<P><A NAME="LINK43"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, when I was 
preparing to come to the House today to speak to the bill and to 
speak to the amendments, it caused me to reflect on the proper 
role of government in a free market economy.  Reformers for the 
most part see this role as very limited in terms of the economy 
itself.  We see it limited to the rule of law, freedom of 
contract, the enforcement of contract, the ability of Canadian 
companies to rely on the law to ensure that the contracts they 
enter into are going to be observed and that the rule of law will 
see that happen, and of course for the protection of consumers to 
ensure that no criminal or untoward actions of businesses and 
enterprises in the free market would be countenanced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a series or a successive number of 
governments, both federally and provincially, that have practised 
intervention more and more over a long period of time.  In Canada 
we have as a result of this a distorted market at times, very 
much distorted when we take into account the grants and subsidies 
and other false inducements that government provides to the free 
market to try to influence it to do one thing or the other, the 
government's desire of the day, whatever that may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing we see in this country is punitive taxation 
rates.  I recently did a comparison.  Take a person working in 
the United States and earning a salary of $60,000 a year. If that 
same person were in Canada and had a comparable take home pay, 
they would have to earn $134,000 a year when the difference in 
the dollar and the difference in taxation rates are factored in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to see that Canadians and Canadian businesses are 
very much disadvantaged by that.  The government's response 
typically is not to go to the heart of the matter, which is 
taxation and regulation.  The government's response is regulate 
it.  If it moves, regulate it, then regulate the regulations and 
then regulate the regulators.  This seems to be the Canadian way, 
regulate everything in sight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest what we need is less regulation.  If hon. members do 
not think government is intent on regulating, just consider what 
we are doing here today.  What are we talking about?  We are 
talking about regulating competition.  While we are at it, why do 
we not start regulating the laws of gravity? Why not repeal 
Newton's laws?  Why not repeal the laws of supply and demand? 
Government can do it.  Obviously it has the power to do it. That 
is what the government is intent on doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine if we tried to regulate Donovan Bailey or Wayne Gretzky 
and said we want you to run fast but not too fast, we do not want 
it to be unfair, we do not want your competition to be unduly 
disadvantaged.  We cannot do that.  Competition is competition. 
By the way, competition is good for the consumer. It is healthy. 
It sparks innovation.  It causes people to look for the best way 
to accomplish something, whether it is building a house or a 
ballpoint pen.  It causes anybody who is in that market scenario 
or that situation to look at the best way for them to participate 
and to draw customers to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we talked about here in the House is regulating 
competition.  I submit that the best thing this or any government 
can do in terms of competition is reduce regulations, stop 
interfering in the marketplace and abandon this punitive taxation 
system we have in Canada so that Canadians and Canadian 
businesses have more money to take home and more incentive to do 
what we all know needs to be done, which is create a viable, 
healthy economy.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
we are debating Bill C-20, an act to amend the Competition Act 
and to make consequent and related amendments to others acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are four groups of amendments put forward by the hon. 
member for Mercier.  We already debated two groups of amendments 
and in the third group of amendments we are talking about various 
aspects of businesses, as the hon. member for Skeena has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the third group, Motion No. 6 would include a prohibition 
against offering a statement or a warranty or a guarantee for 
performance or efficacy or the life of the product without 
adequate and proper tests thereof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would wrongly place the onus on the telemarketer 
to ensure that the claims by manufacturers or service providers 
are accurate.  Telemarketers must act with due diligence in their 
relationship with the manufacturer or the service provider 
regarding the quality and efficacy of the product or service as 
claimed by the manufacturer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So it should be the responsibility of the manufacturer and not 
that of the telemarketer.  The legal framework in the bill offers 
enforceable guidelines for professional conduct among 
telemarketers.  Furthermore section 52 of the act, as amended by 
Bill C-20, is reasonably broad.  It is sufficiently broad so as 
to include false claims concerning the warranty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Skeena has mentioned, we are talking 
about businesses.  On the other side we are talking about 
consumers. The official opposition supports small businesses. We 
understand that small businesses need more opportunities because 
they are the ones that create 96% of the jobs in the country. 
But we know the red tape is too much for them. Government is 
always on the back of small businesses.  The cost of doing 
business in this country is going up.  Taxes are going up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to create a balance between the protection of the 
consumer and freedom of business.  It is not in the best interest 
of consumers to create legislation that will be unduly costly, 
cumbersome for business and not be hurting the fraudulent 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be supporting Bill C-20 but opposing Motion No. 6 because 
senior citizens, the most vulnerable in our society, are damaged 
more and more by fraudulent telemarketing scams. We have to 
protect them immediately against telemarketing fraud. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
had the pleasure of being part of the industry committee that 
reviewed Bill C-20 at some length and had some input into our 
party's actually deciding to support this bill and go behind the 
bill.  We are in agreement that it should be passed through the 
House as quickly as possible. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1340"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1340

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would our party support this bill?  I am looking at some of 
the statements we put together in recommending that our caucus 
support this bill.  With respect to this bill the industry staff 
has made sure that telemarketers give fair and reasonable 
disclosure of information at the beginning of each call.  This is 
an important point.  It must include the identity of the company, 
the purpose of the communication, the nature or product of the 
business interests, price, material restrictions and any terms or 
conditions that apply to delivery.  Those are the kinds of things 
my party and I support, fair and reasonable disclosure of 
information and accountability throughout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one issue we have with this motion is that it places the 
responsibility in the wrong place.  It is calling for the 
telemarketer to be responsible for the manufacturer's product 
claims.  We are suggesting that is going a little too far.  The 
responsibility should be in the correct place and left with the 
manufacturer.  If the manufacturer is giving certain guarantees 
and warranties, that is where the responsibility should lie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with this bill I encourage the House to consider some of 
the principles behind it.  It is the desire of my party that we 
see the principles for the open, complete and reasonable 
disclosure of information, as we see in the bill and as addressed 
in Motion No. 6, exercised by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an area where we have failed in reasonable disclosure 
of information.  For a fleeting instant there was a surplus at 
the end of the last budget year.  That surplus was applied 
quickly and before anyone knew what had happened to a millennium 
fund, billions of dollars.  It is interesting that the auditor 
general picked up that this was not in keeping with the kinds of 
principles we see in this bill.  The auditor general said that it 
is not right to expense to a millennium fund in which you have 
not actually spent the money but are going to spend it some years 
hence so you will not have a surplus today.  The thrust of his 
comments was that it was not a fair and reasonable disclosure of 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is doubly tragic when we look at some of the red book 
promises of the Liberal Party.  It said it would apply some of 
the surplus to debt and tax relief.  Yet it took that surplus and 
expensed it for some future fund that is intruding on provincial 
jurisdiction and is going to benefit only a very small number of 
students.  It did this so there would be no surplus and Canadians 
would not see debt and taxes reduced as this party has long been 
calling for.  This debt is sucking the lifeblood out of our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the Liberals talking a little about debt and tax relief. 
Yet when I heard the throne speech and when I read the red book 
there were between 25 and 30 new spending initiatives.  It is 
pretty hard to reduce debt and give Canadians the long needed tax 
break they have been crying for.  Canadian taxes are the highest 
of the G-8 countries.  In a comparison of Canada and the United 
States, my hon. colleague from Skeena pointed out the gross 
taxation in this country and what it is doing to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may hear more in the House about some of the things that 
happened at the APEC summit which I would say are not at all in 
keeping with the principles in this bill.  This bill tries to 
make sure the purpose of communication is clear.  There was a 
situation at the APEC summit where it seemed the prime minister's 
office was more concerned with protecting the rights of a known 
harsh regime as far as human rights go.  It was more concerned 
with protecting him and putting some of our own quiet and 
reasonable protesters under abuse.

principles and precepts.  Our hope would be that someday there 
will be a government, and I suggest it would be a Reform

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again for hon. members opposite, we would hope that there 
be fair and reasonable disclosure of information, making sure 
that the purpose of communication is clear, that the nature of 
the product or business interests, the price and material 
restrictions are there for all to see.  That is what we call

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Lakeland, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the opportunity to have a very short intervention in 
the report stage debate of Bill C-20. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-20 is an act to amend the Competition Act.  The 
Competition Act is an extremely important act in terms of 
providing responsible regulation to business.  Regulation is 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the member for Skeena talk about what an acceptable 
role for government is in the marketplace.  I certainly share his 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens with this Group No. 3 amendment, Motion No. 6 in 
particular which was brought forth by the Bloc is that it really 
confuses this legislation beyond what is necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already the Competition Act is complex.  This legislation 
amending the act is complex.  Motion No. 6 not only would 
complicate it more should it pass but it also really would make 
it more confusing.  That is the key here.  It would provide 
improper emphasis in the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would provide a prohibition against offering a 
statement, warranty, guarantee of performance, efficacy of length 
of life and that type of thing about a product unless there is 
adequate testing done. Should this Bloc amendment pass, it would 
put the onus on telemarketers to provide testing that of course 
is the responsibility of the manufacturer.  Putting this 
amendment forth would provide the wrong direction for this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, I would like to point out that section 52 of the act as 
amended by Bill C-20 is sufficiently broad in order to deal with 
and include false claims concerning warranties, et cetera.  That 
has been dealt with already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that this motion is out of place here.  It is 
important to consider the proper role of government.  In many 
cases governments over the past 30 years and probably longer have 
tried to play an improper role and have become too involved in 
the marketplace in trying to unreasonably protect consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have talked to several people who have been suckered in by 
telemarketing fraud, in some cases by blatantly fraudulent 
telemarketers.  The RCMP in two cases I know of dealt with this. 
Charges were pressed and the issue was cleared up as well as it 
could be cleared up. I really feel for the people who have been 
taken advantage of and I refer to the very elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a concern.  This is not the way to deal with it. That is 
important to note.

many years ago in school we used to report to the class on what 
we did during the summer break.  Frankly, my summer was not half 
as interesting as the Reform Party's, so I thought I would report 
on its summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform's summer to remember began with their leader's disastrous 
Asian vacation.  The member for Calgary Southwest infuriated 
Canadians by becoming the first leader of the opposition to go 
overseas and criticize our economy in front of foreign investors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, while some Reformers were recanting their previous attacks 
on the MP pension plan, others began discussing what most 
Canadians have known for some time, that Reform has no chance of 
forming government with its current leader.  What about the 
so-called united alternative?  Reform MPs are not united. 
Canadians do not see them as being much of an alternative.

will want to be personally involved”.  Canadians want to know 
the extent therefore to which the Prime Minister was personally 
involved in the security arrangements for APEC.

been in Vancouver at that time he would have seen the protesters 
that some of my ministers and all the members of the delegation 
saw during their visit.

but it does not believe in two standards of pay equity, one for 
the private sector in the Bell Canada case and one for the public 
sector in the case of the human rights tribunal.  With two 
different interpretations of the law by two different tribunals 
it was clear that we had to go to the appeal court and ask them

there will be public hearings, and it has been referred to the

the superintendent of financial institutions and the Competition 
Bureau to report on that matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with one of the most fundamental changes in

the decision should be made by parliament on behalf of the people

there would be further hearings on that.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot bring them back to life, but I want the grieving to 
know that the Government of Canada is doing all it can to get to

solve this mystery and put to rest their burning questions. We 
cannot end their suffering. But I want to say how deeply proud 
Canadians are regarding the way the people of Nova Scotia reached 
out to them, the hard work put in by our incredible search and 
rescue teams, and the way the people around Peggy's Cove without 
hesitation got into their boats and went out to see if there was 
anything they could do, hopeful at first, only to find out that 
the victims were, in the end, in the hands of God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can be most proud of the comfort that Nova Scotians offered 
to the suffering families when they came to Peggy's Cove to 
mourn.  They opened their hearts and their homes.  They offered 
helping hands and a friendly ear. 
Mostly they were just there, perhaps feeling that what they could 
not do for the victims they could do for the families.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Like many of you, the news of Swissair flight 111 came to me as 
a shock, a shock that such a disaster could happen so close to 
home, so close to the tranquillity of Peggy's Cove.  Like many 
others, as I stood on the rocks of Peggy's Cove that first 
morning looking out at the ocean at the rescue scene, I was 
filled with hopes and prayers that there would be survivors.  It 
was so hard for all of us to accept the fact that this hope was 
to be in vain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the sadness persists, there is also an element of honour. 
This country can be very proud of the professional and efficient 
manner in which this disaster has been responded to by the many 
volunteers and professionals who saw the need and reached out 
quickly with compassion:  the fisher people who on that fateful 
night pulled on their boots and without thought of self rushed 
out to sea to help; the Emergency Measures Organization; the 
military and the Canadian Coast Guard; the RCMP; the volunteer 
fire departments and rescue workers; the Transportation Safety 
Board; the harbour master; the Red Cross and Salvation Army; 
clergy and parishioners of all denominations; provincial and 
federal fisheries officials; politicians; and especially all the 
community residents from all walks of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over these difficult days since the crash, my pride has been 
reinforced over and over again as I have watched the people of my 
riding and of the South Shore riding conduct themselves with 
dignity and unselfishly offer their skills, provide meals, open 
their homes and their hearts to help in any way they could.  Even 
a special memorial service originally planned by the community to 
assist the area residents in dealing with their sorrow and grief 
was unselfishly shared with the country and indeed with the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the media cameras were turned off and the rest of the 
country went back to the daily routine, the residents in and 
around Peggy's Cove were faced with a grim reality.  Not only did 
they have to deal with the aftermath of haunting images and raw 
emotions, but also they were left with an economic crisis.  Many 
of these people rely on the ocean for their livelihood, a 
livelihood that had been suspended.  Everyone accepted that there 
must be restrictions around the crash site.  Efforts have been 
made to resolve this very real problem. I on behalf of my 
constituents will continue to work co-operatively in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my constituents for all that they have done and given to 
assist in this tragedy.  Thank you also to the many other 
Canadians who showed love, compassion and the common bond of 
humanity in this time of great tragedy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I extend on behalf of my caucus our sincere condolences to the

</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) & (b) (iii) The excise duty program is responsible for the 
protection of revenues for excisable goods subject to the Excise 
Act, including alcohol and beer, as well as tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enforcement of federal laws on tobacco use is an important 
part of the department's global strategy.  However, the amount 
of money spent on enforcement is not broken down into specific 
commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) & (b) (iv) Revenue Canada's customs contraband resources are 
dedicated to preventing not only tobacco but alcohol, drugs, 
firearms and other types of smuggling.  As such, it is impossible 
to separate resources used solely for enforcing laws against 
tobacco smugling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997-98 the department received $23 million to implement an 
anti-smuggling initiative and allocated $19 million of the total 
to the Customs and Trade Administration Branch.  To fight 
contraband smuggling, the department dedicated over 700 FTEs, full 
time equivalents, to the program, of which about 300 have been 
funded though the anti-smuggling initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from this special effort, the department also deploys over 
3,500 uniformed customs officers across Canada to prevent 
smuggling, not only of tobacco, but other products as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Royal Canadian Mounted Police, RCMP, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) & (b) (iii) & (iv)  It is impossible to detail the amount of 
funding for enforcement of federal laws on tobacco use or 
enforcement of laws against tobacco smuggling.  The reason for 
this is that the RCMP priority under the customs ans excise 
program is the investigation of organized criminal groups 
involved in smuggling.  Although a criminal organization may be 
involved in tobacco smuggling only, it is more often the 
experience of the RCMP that organized criminal groups are 
simultaneously involved in a variety of illegal activities.  The 
most common illicit products are tobacco, liquor, drugs and firearms. 
Therefore, an investigation would overlap a number of illegal 
activities and contraband goods at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general terms, the following can be provided in relation to 
customs and excise enforcement.  The RCMP was provided with 
$66,300,000 for customs and excise enforcement and related 
statutes through the anti-smuggling initiative for the fiscal 
year 1997-98.  Of this amount, $18,104,000 was provided directly 
to the integrated proceeds of crime initiative to support 
human resources and to cover the costs related to investigations 
of proceeds of crime activities related to the Customs and Excise 
Acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remaining $48,196,000 is used to support 332 regular members 
and 25 public service support staff.  In addition, there are 249 
regular members and 33 public service support staff with the 
customs and excise program.  These resources are funded through 
the “A” based RCMP budget.  This would amount to approximately 
$25,000,000 per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the above, the cost of support programs to customs 
and excise enforcement would need to be included.  There is, 
however, no way of determining the direct cost of these resources 
to tobacco related investigations.

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What studies has the Government of Canada commissioned 
concerning the extent of potential financial liability to 
taxpayers resulting from challenges by foreign investors against 
allegedly non-conforming measures at the national and subnational 
level under the investor-state dispute settlement processes of 
(<I>a</I>) NAFTA and (<I>b</I>) the proposed MAI? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister for International Trade, Lib.):</B> 
The right of corporations to sue governments is not 
unprecedented.  Under Canadian law, both domestic and foreign 
owned companies have the right to file claims in Canadian courts 
if they believe that they have been treated unfairly by the 
government.  Investor-state arbitration ensures that Canadian 
investors abroad have recourse to fair and transparent dispute 
settlement, especially in countries which may not provide the 
same legal and judicial protection that is guaranteed in Canada. 
Recourse to investor-state arbitration is an important feature of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, and of bilateral 
investment treaties that Canada and many other countries have 
concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government works continually to ensure that its measures 
conform to its international legal obligations. Indeed, the 
government consults broadly and assesses a variety of 
implications in the development of policies and initiatives.  The 
government's potential financial liability pursuant to challenges 
by foreign investors against allegedly non-conforming measures 
under the investor-state dispute settlement procedures of the 
NAFTA and a potential Multilateral Agreement on Investment, MAI, 
would depend upon the number and nature of the disputes in 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Respecting subnational measures, Canada secured a grandfathering 
of all existing non-conforming subnational measures in the NAFTA. 
In the MAI negotiations, Canada has indicated clearly that the 
application of the MAI to measures under the jurisdiction of 
Canadian provinces cannot be assumed and would depend upon the 
content of any potential deal.  Should the negotiations result in 
a satisfactory agreement for Canada, the coverage of provincial 
investment measures would not exceed the NAFTA. Canada would 
ensure that all existing non-conforming measures maintained by 
provincial and local governments would be excluded from the 
coverage of any agreement. As well, Canada would fully safeguard 
our freedom of action at both the federal and provincial levels 
in key areas, including health care, social programs, culture, 
education, programs for aboriginal peoples and programs for 
minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the outset of the MAI negotiations in 1995, the government 
has consulted the provinces on a frequent and consistent basis. 
The provinces are debriefed after every negotiating session, 
copied on all reports and have access to all negotiating 
document.  Numerous meetings between federal and provincial trade 
officials have taken place over the past three years to address 
issues related to the negotiations.  The federal-provincial trade 
ministerial meeting of February 19, 1998 allowed for a thorough 
discussion of Canada's objectives and bottom lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governement will continue to consult closely with Canadians 
respecting the MAI negotiations.  Consultations with provincial 
and territorial governments, non-governmental organizations, 
business and individual Canadians are vital to ensuring that all 
our interests are properly reflected in Canada's negotiating 
position.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Harbance Singh Dhaliwal (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> (a) Revenue Canada has effective processes in place to 
ensure that duplicate payments cannot be made in respect of a 
child, for the same period. As a result, such cases are extremely 
rare. A review of all compliance activities for the 1997-98 
fiscal period, over 31,000 actions, revealed only one case of 
duplicate payments being made in respect of a child. Data were 
not kept at that level of detail prior to 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) For statistical purposes, the percentage is effectively 
“O”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The one case detected involved an overpayment of $1,574. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) Not applicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) For the case detected, overpayments continued for 17 months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) The overpayment is being recovered from the client. In 
general, overpayments are recovered by deducting 50% of the 
amount of future benefits until the debt is repaid. However, a 
lower rate will be accepted if the client demonstrates that the 
50% withholding causes significant financial hardship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) Each year, about 400 clients fail to report the death of a 
CTB, child tax benefit, entitled child to Revenue Canada, and 
continue to reveive benefits in respect of that child for an 
extended period of time, i.e., more that a year following the 
death of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) This represents 0.007% i.e., about one child in 14,000, of 
children in respect of whom CTB is being paid for the year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) The annual total of 400 cases is about 18% of CTB entitled 
children who die each year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(j) Losses for the last and current fiscal years are estimated 
to be less that $800,000 and $1,000,000 respectively, against 
annual expenditures of $5.1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(k) The average annual overpayment per case is approximately 
$510. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(l) If neither the client nor Revenue Canada take corrective 
action in respect of a case, payments may continue for an average 
of 9.6 years following the child's death. Using this as a worst 
case scenario, Revenue Canada risks overpaying CTB by an average 
of $4,900, over the duration of the case. It should be noted that 
CTB is a relatively new program, with the first payments being 
made in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the near future, Revenue Canada hopes to obtain detailed 
infromation on child deaths directly from the provinces, so that 
the department can accurately and quickly take appropriate action 
to prevent overpayments, without adding to ghe stress and duress 
experienced by the grieving family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(m) In most cases the parent contacts Revenue Canada when he or 
she realizes that benefits are still being received in respect of 
a deceased child. They may be detected during routine reviews of 
the account, but the frequency of occurrence is too low for this 
to happen more than a few times a year. In either case the 
account is adjusted and any overpayment is recovered without 
interest and penalities being charged, barring deliberate fraud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(n) To date Revenue Canada has not undertaken any compliance 
reviews that specifically target the failure to report the death 
of a child. Revenue Canada has concentrated its efforts on 
imforming the public of the need to advise the department 
immediately of such an event. Assuming the required data will be 
made available by the provinces, Revenue Canada will soon be able 
to take prompt corrective action at a very modest cost.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
(a) Infectious salmon anaemia, ISA, has only been found in 
Atlantic salmon marine farms in the Bay of Fundy along the south 
west coast of New Brunswick. Twenty one farms have been infected 
in three bays, Limekiln, Bliss Harbour ans Seal Cove. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The aquaculture industry on the east coast has supported the 
establishment of a comprehensive ISA control program. A series of 
procedures have been or will soon be implemented including strict 
site disinfection and disinfection of waste water from fish 
processing plants. The industry has also relied on early harvest, 
i.e. before there are signs of the disease, as a measure to 
control ISA. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million 
Atlantic salmon have been, or are in the process of being, 
eradicated in the three affected bays. The economic impact of ISA 
is estimated to be as high as $25-30 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Infectious salmon anaemia, ISA, is a viral disease with no 
known treatment, so chemicals and antibiotics are not being used 
to control this disease. There are also no vaccines available to 
prevent infection of Atlatic salmon with the ISA virus. Instead, 
the prevention and control of ISA are based on comprenhensive 
management measures such as cleaning and disinfection of farm 
premises and equipement, restricted movement of live adult fish, 
disease surveillance, and disinfection of offal on waste from 
fish slaughterhouses. Sanitary slaughtering of market fish, i.e. 
slaughtering fish before there are disease signs, form farms 
where ISA is present il also recommended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) No chemicals antibiotics or other medicines have been used 
to control this disease, so there is no impact on wild salmon, 
shellfish and other marine life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) It is always possible that local wild Atlantic slamon, the 
same species as cultured Atlantic salmon, have been affected by 
ISA. However, ISA was first recognized in Norway in 1984, and the 
Norwegian authorities still consider ISA as a disease of farmed, 
not wild, Atlantic salmon in marine cages or land based 
facilities using seawater. The same situation is observed in New 
Brunswick. ISA has only been found in cultured Atlantic salmon in 
seawater, and testing of wild salmon and juvenile salmon in 
freshwater hatcheries has been negative for ISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) In New Brunswick, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, 
DFO, has no direct responsibility for controlling ISA in marine 
farms. The provincial department of fisheries and aquaculture has 
the responsibility for controlling diseases in salmon farms under 
the provincial aquaculture act. DFO's mandate in New Brunswick 
relates only to protecting the health of wild fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, DFO has provided considerable scientific support to the 
province in terms of disease diagnostics, disease surveillance in 
wild fish, and participating on committees established to advise 
the New Brunswick government on ways to control ISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(g) ISA is not known to occur in wild fish, either in Canada or 
Norway where the disease was first detected. ISA has also been 
reported very recently in Scotland for the first time, again only 
in farmed fish in coastal waters. So DFO has not taken any 
specific action to date to control the spread of ISA to wild fish 
in New Brunswick. DFO is represented on committees mandated to 
control and manage the disease in aquaculture facilities and is 
monitoring the situation closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(h) ISA is not believed to be transmitted from parents to 
progeny via eggs. However, if transmission of ISA to ohter 
provinces on the east coast is to occur, it would likely be 
through the movement of live eggs and fish. Such transfers are 
controlled under the fish health protection regulations or under 
section 4 of the Fisheries Act. Live eggs or fish are only 
tranferred to other provinces form New Brunswick if sources have 
been inspected for and found to be free of the ISA virus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) There is no historical evidence that ISA occurs in wild 
fish; nor is there evidence that ISA has been transmitted to wild 
populations of salmon in New Brunswick. In 1997, DFO tested more 
than 100 wild salmonids for the presence of ISA and all fish were 
negative. And additional 120 wild juvenile Atlantic salmon have 
been tested by DFO in 1998, as well as samples from herring, cod, 
pollock, mackerel and flounder. Furthermore, adult Atlantic 
salmon returning to rivers draining into the inner Bay of Fundy 
are being sampled, 30 adults so far, including some fish that 
escaped from aquaculture cages. As in 1997 all tests to date are 
negative for ISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(j) Research efforts in DFO Science has focused on comfirming 
that ISA was the disease agent for the syndrome that was causing 
high mortalities on salmon farms in south west New Brunswick, and 
to assess the validity of cell culture to diagnose infectious 
salmon anaemia. All the research results on transmission of the 
disease are completed and were made public during scientific 
conferences, workshops or meetings. The laboratory work on using 
cell culture as a diagnotic tool has just been completed, and 
results will be made available as described upon completion of 
the data analysis. DFO is also paying for a contract to study the 
epidemiology of ISA. The contract report will be a public 
document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(k) Work by DFO on ISA has been performed periodically by 
several DFO scientific staff within the existing work-plans. No 
additional money has been allocated, although it has necessitated 
a rearragement of priorities in certain cases. DFO is also paying 
$45,000 for a contract that is now in progress, to study the 
epidemiology of ISA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(l) ISA is considered a manageable disease in Norway if 
management measures described in (c) are implemented. DFO has not 
studied alternatives to net-pen culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(m) In North America, ISA has only been found in Atlantic salmon 
reared in marine cages in the Bay of Fundy south west New 
Brunswick. As the Atlantic salmon farmed on the west coast are 
the same species they would be susceptible, but there is no 
indication of the disease in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(n) No, ISA has not been detected on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(o) The Department of Fisheries and Oceans is responsible for 
protecting the health of fisheries resources in Canada. Any 
interprovincial movement of live salmonid eggs and fish, e.g. 
transfers from New Bruswick to British Columbia, is subject to 
requirements of the fish health protection regualtions, or under 
section  of the Fisheries Act. Sources of eggs and live ish 
originating from New Brunswick would have to be inspected and 
certified free of ISA before and import permit was issued for the 
importation to another province such as British Columbia. As an 
added precaution because of the presence of ISA in New Brunswick, 
local fish health officers who administer the fish health 
protection regulations on the east coast have agreed not to 
approve request to transfer live fish from marine cages located 
in the Bay of Fundy to any other province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(p) The measures described in (o) minimize the risk if ISA being 
transferred to the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(q) The measures described in (o) minimize the risk of 
transferring ISA to any salmonid stocks on the west coast. These 
meaures are meant to protect wild coho salmon as well as farmed 
salmon. It should be noted that Pacific salmon is a different 
genus to Atlantic salmon, and the virus has not been found in 
Pacific salmon species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(r) This is a highly hypothetical question since ISA is not 
present on the west coast and its distribution is limited to 
farmed fish in south west New Brunswick. ISA is a disease 
affecting only farmed Atlantic salmon. To our knowledge it has 
never been found in wild Atlantic salmon populations. Atlantic 
salmon is the only species that we know is susceptible to this 
disease.

conditions for the further elaboration and strenghtening of this 
procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b)  Regarding the issue of funding allocated by the federal 
government to help developing countries achieve compliance, 
Canada has, so far, contributed $25.3 million U.S. directly to 
the multilateral fund of the Montreal protocol shared between the 
Canadian International Development Agency, CIDA, and Environment 
Canada, of which $3.2 million U.S. was provided by Environment 
Canada to the bilateral assistance fund.  In addition, 
Environment Canada has provided, so far, a total of $1.12 million U.S. 
in financial support to house the multilateral fund 
secretariat in Montreal.  Canada's ongoing commitment to assist 
developing countries under the Montreal protocol totals 
approximately $8.2 million Canadian on a annual basis.  Finally, 
CIDA is making two contributions to the Ottawa-based ENGO, 
Environment Non-Governmental Organization, Friends of the Earth, 
for ozone related activities in developing countries: a $300,000 
Canadian grant over the next three years to strengthen public 
awareness about ozone issues, and to build national capacity to 
accelerate the transition from methyl bromide to environmentally 
benign alternatives in Chile, Ghana and Malaysia; and a grant of 
$75,000 Canadian this year for an international youth internship 
program which targets ozone depletion activities.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the government explain what ongoing action it is taking, 
what progress has been made to date and when a final resolution 
is expected, with respect to the present situation whereby 
American shipbuilders have open access to the Canadian market,

USA? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.:)</B> A number of maritime 
laws collectively known as the “Jones Act” impose a variety of 
limits on foreign participation in the U.S. domestic maritime 
industry. Under these laws, the carriage of cargo or passengers 
between points in the United States is restricted to U.S. built 
and U.S. documented vessels owned and operated by U.S. citizens. 
Similar restrictions apply to dredging, salvage and other 
commercial marine activities in U.S. waters. In international 
shipping, there are limitations on foreign ownership of vessels 
eligible for documentation in the United States. In addition, 
several subsidies and other support measures are available to 
operators of U.S. vessels: cargo preference laws restrict the 
carriage of military cargo and limit the carriage of government 
non-military cargo, aid cargo and certain agricultural 
commodities to U.S. vessels. These and other restrictions coupled 
with defence related prohibitions of the Byrnes/Tollefson 
amendment limit Canadian participation in U.S. shipping 
activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada has sought to enhance access to the U.S. market 
in this sector through trade negotiations, the United States has 
refused to negotiate improvements and has protected these 
restrictions in both the North American Free Trade Agreement, 
NAFTA, and the World Trade Organization, WTO, agreements. In the 
NAFTA and the WTO, Canada protected our ability to utilize similar 
measures wtih respect to imports from the United States. In 
practical terms, imports of ships from the United States into 
Canada have not been significant due to production and 
competitive realities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada will continue to use every appropriate opportunity to 
encourage the liberalization of these restrictive provisions. 
Although there have been renewed calls for reform, the cabotage 
and cargo preference restrictions continue to enjoy significant 
support in the United States, limiting the prospect of any major 
change in the short term.

operating under the title of “chef de poste du Québec”; (<I>c</I>) 
the names of those representatives; (<I>d</I>) whether Quebec has

and (<I>f</I>) whether any provinces other than Quebec have provincial 
employees working with diplomatic status in Canadian embassies? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> (a) As of June 3, 
1998, no representative of the Quebec government has been 
accredited as a diplomat within the Canadian embassy in Beijing. 
The federal government is currently negotiating with Quebec a 
memorandum of understanding for the co-location of one Quebec 
official, supported by one locally engaged program officer and 
one locally engaged secretary, to perform what are to be 
essentially trade development, investment promotion and 
development assistance duties. Under current practice, provincial 
governments may, with the approval of the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs, be permitted to co-locate within Canadian embassies 
abroad on a full cost recovery basis and where space is 
available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The title “chef de poste du Québec” is not an official 
diplomatic designation and would not be authorized for use in the 
official publication “Canadian Representatives Abroad” nor in 
the diplomatic list provided to host country authorities. In 
comparable situations, the senior Quebec government officer is 
assigned the title of “First Secretary” followed by an 
appropriate description of his area of responsibility, for 
example, “Immigration—Quebec” or “Commercial and Development 
Assistance—Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) The negotiations of a co-location agreement are in progress. 
The Quebec governement has not yet nominated an officer to send 
to Beijing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) Quebec government immigration officials are co-located 
within the Canadian missions in Damascus, Vienna and Hong Kong. A 
Quebec officer from the Ministry of International Relations 
working in the field of educational and social affairs is 
co-located within the Canadian embassy in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(e) It would be inappropriate for Quebec officials located in 
Canadian missions abroad to distribute material promoting an 
independent Quebec. Under the terms of the co-location memoranda 
of understanding with provincial governments, the provinces agree 
that their provincial officials fall under the overall authority 
of the Canadian head of mission. The head of mission has the 
power to take appropriate disciplinary measures, including in the 
final resort to request the return to Canada of members of staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(f) At present, only the province of Alberta has a co-located 
employee with diplomatic status at the Canadian embassy in Seoul, 
Korea. Several other provinces, including British Columbia, 
Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland have 
co-located employees within Canadian missions abroad in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Experience to date has been that co-locating provincial staff 
within Canadian missions abroad provides for a closer 
co-ordination and a better sharing of the workload between 
federal and provincial officials that is likely to occur between 
a Canadian embassy and a separate provincial government office. 
Co-locations make optimal use of scarce resources abroad reflect 
the team Canada spirit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>*Question No. 115—<B>Mr. Paul Forseth:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regards to the weather-related “leaky condo” situation in 
British Columbia, which has evolved into financial disaster 
exceeding the Manitoba Flood and the Ontario-Quebec Ice Storm, 
does the Government have a plan to assist condo owners repair 
unforeseen damages by way of short-term emergency relief, and if 
so, does it permit any or all of the following: <I>a</I>) RRSP funds 
to be used without tax penalties: <I>b</I>) interest costs of repair 
loans to be used as a deductible expense, as it is for landlords: 
<I>c</I>) repairs to be GST-exempt: and <I>d</I>) expansion of the limits 
of the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK249"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> 
I am informed by the Department of Finance and Canada Mortgage 
Housing Corporation as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>a), b) & c) With regard to the Barrett commission's 
recommendations on using the tax system to deliver assistance in 
this circumstance, a careful review has raised a number of policy 
concerns. For example, since the federal tax system in nationally 
based, it would be difficult to provide tax assistance to owners 
of water damaged dwellings in B.C., while excluding individuals 
in similar circumstances in other parts of the country. It would 
also be difficult to provide a tax subsidy for unexpected repair 
costs arising from a particular cause but not others such as 
fires, floods, earthquakes, et cetera. Because of these policy 
concerns, the tax system was not used to provide relief for those 
affected by the recent natural disasters in Ontario, Quebec and 
Manitoba. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>d) On July 13, 1998, the Government of British Columbia 
introduced legislation responding to 47 of the recommendations of 
the Barrett commission. British Columbia noted that discussions 
are underway with the federal government, local government, 
financial institutions and building professions on another 26 
recommendations, and the other 9 recommendations are subjects to 
further analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two bills, the Homeowner Protection Act and the Strata Property 
Act, were introduced on July 13, 1998, and will make warranty 
protection in new homes mandatory; require residential builders 
to be licensed and meet standards; establish an industry funded 
home protection office; and, increase access to information and 
ensure that owners and strata corporation can effectively respond 
to construction problems if they should occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of British Columbia will commit $75 million as 
bridge financing for an industry funded reconstruction program 
that will provide no interest loans to owners for repairs. 
Priority will be given to those most in need who have exhausted 
all other financing options. The provincial contribution will be 
paid back over time through a special assessment on residential 
builders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 17, 1998. the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services of Canada advised the Honourable Jenny Kwan that Canada 
Mortgage Housing Corporation, CMHC, has been authorized to enter 
into negotiations with the B.C. government on the terms and 
conditions for a matching mortgage insurance fund, MIF, 
investment in the reconstruction program of up to $75 million 
for bridge financing. The minister also confirmed that CMHC 
mortgage loan insurance is available to enable owners of water 
damaged homes to fund repairs by way of existing, refinanced or 
second mortgages. Within its responsibility to manage the MIF in 
a prudent manner, CMHC will encourage early discussion and 
flexibility in applying CMHC mortgage options. CMHC will also 
continue to work with the industry and others to undertake 
research and transfer information of use to housing 
professionals. Since 1996 CMHC has committed approximately $1 
million to this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works and Government Services of Canada 
advised the provincial minister that the delivery of assistance 
ot condominium owners through the tax system raises a number of 
public policy concerns. Since the federal tax system is national 
in scope it would be difficult to limit assistance to owners of 
water damaged homes in B.C.. It would also be difficult to 
provide tax subsidies for unexpected repairs arising from one 
cause, i.e. poor design and construction of homes, but not others 
such as floods and earthquakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Public Works and Government Services of Canada 
noted that it would not be possible to increase British 
Columbia's share of the national budget for the residential 
rehabilitation assistance program, RRAP, because it would require 
funding to other jurisdictions to be reduced. Federal RRAP 
funding is allocated on a fair share basis among the provinces 
and territories.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>APEC SUMMIT 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
as you have indicated, I did write to you pursuant to Standing 
Order 52(2) to tell you that I would be rising in my place today 
to seek leave to propose an emergency debate concerning the 
actions of the officials of the Prime Minister and of the Prime 
Minister himself in relation to actions taken by the RCMP during 
the APEC summit in Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Documents have been released to the RCMP public complaints 
commission inquiry that lend credence to concerns that have 
previously been raised about the direct intervention of the Prime 
Minister's office with the RCMP concerning security arrangements 
at the summit.  There is now documentary evidence that officials 
with the PMO and perhaps the Prime Minister himself requested 
that actions be taken against peaceful demonstrators exercising 
their democratic rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any political interference in policing is highly improper, but 
when there is documentary evidence that the Prime Minister 
intervened with the RCMP to take actions against demonstrators so 
he could retain cordial relations with Mr. Suharto, the former 
authoritarian leader of Indonesia, and that such political 
interference resulted in the use of pepper spray and of physical 
force to arrest peaceful demonstrators, we know there is a real 
possibility that Canadian democracy has suffered a deep wound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 52(5) states that in deciding upon an application 
for an emergency debate, the Speaker shall consider “the 
probability of the matter being brought before the House within a 
reasonable time by other means”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister has clearly stated that he will make no 
statement in the House of Commons concerning the matter so there 
is no likelihood that the House of Commons will have an 
opportunity to address this grave and urgent matter.  An 
emergency debate is therefore the only way for members of this 
House to address threats that have possibly been made to two of 
the foundation stones of democratic governance:  freedom of 
expression and the political independence of the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An emergency debate in the House of Commons would in no way 
interfere with the RCMP inquiry.  The public complaints 
commission has a specific mandate under the RCMP Act to conduct 
investigations.  The House of Commons is a body with its own 
constitutional duties and obligations to hold the government 
publicly accountable for its actions.  Surely it is appropriate 
that members of the House should have an opportunity to perform 
those democratic duties during the week that Nelson Mandela will 
address the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge you, Mr. Speaker, to consider favourably this request. It 
would give an opportunity not just to us but to the Prime 
Minister to give an account of himself and perhaps to refute 
convincingly the allegations that have been made against him. 
Nevertheless, in the interest of the public and of democracy that 
kind of debate should occur and occur soon in this Chamber.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In my view the hon. member's application does not meet the 
requirements of Standing Order 52 at this time.  Therefore I 
would rule that there will not be a standing debate on this issue

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 52, I ask that the House hold an 
emergency debate on the use made of budget surpluses and the 
management of the federal debt. Several economic indicators are 
disturbing and lead me to believe such a debate is really 
necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since August 4, the Bloc Quebecois has been demanding that the 
Minister of Finance table a special budget to deal with the 
various problems the Canadian economy has been confronted to in 
recent months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the recent hike in interest rates by the Bank of Canada, 
following the ups and downs of the Canadian dollar on 
international markets, is a key factor that may have a very 
significant effect on this country's economy and consumer habits 
if we are not more careful and if expansionist economic policies 
are not promptly put forward by the federal finance minister in 
a special budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the drop in the Canadian GDP over the past three months, 
together with an inflation rate that remains below the targeted 
range, clearly show that the Canadian economy is facing serious 
difficulties, which have led all analysts to a downward revision 
of the 1999 growth forecast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This alarm bell calls, in our opinion, for vigorous and 
immediate action, if we do not want to find ourselves in a 
recession within a few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons, I believe an emergency debate is 
required. The government must explain and justify its choices, 
which are contrary to the priorities of the people of Quebec and 
Canada as well as to the commitments made during the 1997

</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is deteriorating a little more every day, and that 
is why the government must immediately account for its 
management and take the urgent actions required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask that you give favourable consideration to my 
request for an emergency debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker: </B>I received the hon. member's letter this 
morning, read it and gave it due consideration. I have concluded 
that his request does not meet the requirements of Standing 
Order 52 at this time. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now hear from the hon. member for

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-68 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I seek to present a motion under Standing Order 52(1) 
and 52(2) for the adjournment of the House for the purpose of 
discussing a specific and important matter that requires the 
consideration of all hon. members.  It is the anticipated 
decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal regarding Bill C-68, an 
act respecting firearms and other weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court decision on the challenge of Bill C-68 is due any day 
and it is widely expected that it will rule in favour of the 
province.  The decision will likely read that the federal 
government does not have the right to regulate private property. 
This will not only strike down the government's plans to force 
the registration of sporting rifles and shotguns.  It will also 
strike down the registration of handguns as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great number of Canadians, including many who are opposed to 
the registration of hunting rifles and shotguns, would be 
extremely concerned about the loss of the handgun registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I propose we examine an alternative to the court ruling by 
debating the feasibility of the government repealing Bill C-68 
before the court decision is rendered and then petitioning the 
court to dismiss the action as having been settled.  I believe 
this is in the best interest of all Canadians and in the best 
interest of the government.  Someone does have to look out for 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  A point of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK259"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  On the point of order, I wonder if the 
hon. member would permit me to give my response first.  I just 
want to check on one thing here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I address myself to the hon. member for 
Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan.  I have the letter in front of me 
and have of course listened very attentively.  At this time it 
does not seem that the application meets the requirements under 
Standing Order 52.  I would therefore rule at this time that he 
will not have an emergency debate on the motion he brought 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I will deal with the point of order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the point I wanted to raise was in anticipation of what you said 
about the timing not being right. I believe that the timing is 
crucial because if the Alberta Court of Appeal brings its ruling 
down— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The member's point of order is out of order 
and I say that in the gentlest way possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member put his case to me and I have made my decision. 
Therefore my decision will stand at this time, notwithstanding 
the fact that no doubt the hon. member would have other advice to 
give me.  I would ask him to give it to me perhaps in my chambers 
a little later on.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>COMPETITION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK263">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-20, an act to amend 
the Competition Act and to make consequential and related 
amendments to other acts, as reported (with amendment) from the 
committee; and of Motions Nos. 9, 10 and 11. 
<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege for me to 
talk about the fourth grouping on the various motions brought 
forward this morning and this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot support Motion No. 9 or its short form version, Motion 
No. 10.  It would in effect require the director or the 
commissioner, as proposed in the new Bill C-20, to take a 
reviewable matter to the competition tribunal in situations where 
there was a complaint by just one person, without any opportunity 
to investigate the basis of the complaint or consider its merits. 
This raises concerns of fairness and could lead to abuse of 
process and a potential for waste of time, money and needless 
damage to reputation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hasten to note that the director gives serious consideration 
to all complaints which are made to him and takes action as he 
deems appropriate in various circumstances.  In addition, the 
Competition Act currently provides for what is known as the six 
resident complaint which requires the director to open an 
inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The six resident complaint process is adequate to do the job of 
compelling the director to inquire into an alleged breach of the 
act.  It also provides some assurance that there is some 
seriousness to the complaint about a practice that is distorting 
what should be a level playing field in the market and that the 
director's time and resources are not being wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned this motion would open up the door to potential 
abuse of process, raises concern about fairness and could result 
in time, energy and resources being squandered on groundless 
complaints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to Motion No. 11, which is part of the fourth 
grouping, a private party access to the courts is an important 
issue that was considered by the bureau.  The consultative panel 
reported that the matter is extremely complex and requires more 
detailed analysis and meaningful public consultation.  The 
director has already clearly stated that he would consult on this 
issue in the context of the next round of possible amendments to 
the Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to rebut some of the items the member from Lévis 
mentioned earlier.  The director of the Competition Act, soon to 
be called the commissioner, reports to parliament although policy 
and policy changes comes through the Minister of Industry.  The 
amount of discretion the minister has with the director is very 
little, being able to ask him to review a specific complaint or 
have another review of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the director and consultative panel that further 
analysis and consultation is required on Motion No. 11.  I thank 
the member from Lévis for his comments but I cannot support 
Motions Nos. 9, 10 and 11. 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am happy to address the final grouping of Motions Nos. 
9, 10 and 11.  When looking at Group No. 4 amendments I would 
like to address the motions independently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members of the House are aware all complaints that fall 
under the Competition Act are investigated by the commissioner 
and where deemed appropriate are then placed before the tribunal. 
Motion Nos. 9 and 10 would allow a single private individual over 
the age of 18 years to bring a case to the commissioner for 
investigation.  The current procedure, however, is to insist that 
at least six individuals submit a complaint.  This is a mechanism 
intended to help ensure against frivolous and vexatious 
submissions to the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a consumer has a complaint that he or she believes involves a 
violation of the Competition Act, he or she must find five other 
individuals who share the opinion that a violation of the 
Competition Act has occurred. 
This is not an unreasonable demand to place on the Canadian 
consumer.  In fact by insisting that six individuals be part of 
the application process to the commissioner, we can work to 
ensure that Canadian businesses are not subject to a barrage of 
frivolous complaints.  For this reason I would recommend that 
Motions Nos. 9 and 10 of Group No. 4 be opposed. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1545"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT58"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT58"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1545

<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 is one that I strongly considered supporting.  I 
think the intent of the motion was to give Canadians direct 
access to the tribunal, thereby removing a barrier to 
communicating the needs of consumers.  This motion would allow a 
single individual to bring a matter directly before the tribunal, 
removing the direct involvement of the commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I would normally support an initiative that would allow 
citizens direct access to this court, this motion unfortunately 
maintains the insistence that a single individual can bring a 
case to the tribunal instead of six individuals currently 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Competition legislation around the world has achieved mixed 
results.  It is needed to ensure competitive practices.  However 
we must not create legislation that entangles honest 
entrepreneurs in a regulatory mess.  Consumers never benefit from 
creating a regulatory environment. That drives up the cost of 
business and places those costs on the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the same reasons that I oppose Motions Nos. 9 and 10, I must 
also oppose Motion No. 11. 
<P><A NAME="LINK266"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
address Motions Nos. 9, 10 and 11. These motions as they pertain 
to Bill C-20 deal with the director of the competition bureau and 
what constitutes a reviewable matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present we have a system in Canada whereby any six Canadians 
can petition the director of the competition bureau to begin an 
inquiry that he can then forward to the competition tribunal. 
These motions would effectively change this provision to allow 
any one Canadian to petition the director and force him to begin 
an inquiry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fail to see how this can in any way be perceived as fair or 
reasonable.  The opportunity for abuse by a corporation with an 
axe to grind is brazenly apparent.  The present provision 
requiring six signatories is a reasonable approach designed to 
avoid such abuse.  If the potential for abuse does not scare us 
off, the potential backlog that this would create within the 
director's office should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member seems to be aware of the need to guard against 
such abuses when she includes the wording “frivolous or 
vexatious”. If this is the case, then it should be self-evident 
that the present provisions need not to be tampered with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for Motion No. 11, this deals with private access to the 
tribunal resolution process.  In the early rounds of public input 
on Bill C-20, in fact while it was still known as Bill C-67, it 
was decided that this issue should be put off until the next 
round of public consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many submissions that lead to this decision and as a 
result different parties with vested interests in such a move 
have acted accordingly.  To change this now would be the 
equivalent of the unseemly marketing practice known as bait and 
switch.  As law makers we need to be setting an example here. 
Toward that end the Progressive Conservative Party will be voting 
no to these motions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have already debated the first eight motions of Bill C-20 
which were divided into three groups.  Finally we are debating 
Group No. 4. There are three motions in this group, Motions Nos. 
9, 10 and 11. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motions Nos. 9 and 10 ask that a single private individual, an 
adult over the age of 18, be allowed to bring a case to the 
commissioner for investigation.  The procedure now requires at 
least six individuals to lodge a complaint before it can be 
brought forward before the commissioner.  This is a mechanism to 
help to ensure against frivolous and vexatious submissions to the 
commissioner.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose is to avoid any abuse of the system or abuse of the 
liberty given to the individual to bring forward the complaint. 
On the other hand all complaints that fall under the Competition 
Act are investigated by the commissioner and where deemed 
appropriate would be placed before the competition tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Motion No. 11 requests that a single individual be allowed to 
bring a matter directly before the tribunal, removing any direct 
involvement of the commissioner.  This will have potential for 
abuse again incurring unnecessary additional costs and creating 
unnecessary additional math for the small businessman. It is more 
desirable to have all complaints that fall under the Competition 
Act investigated first by the commissioner and then where deemed 
appropriate placed before the tribunal.  Let us not put a small 
business or any business for that matter into an unwanted 
regulatory mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize I remind the House that when the bill was 
introduced in the House the Reform Party put forward certain 
amendments to the bill so that we could support it.  The 
government has accepted all those amendments.  Therefore we 
approve of the effort by the government to modernize the 
Competition Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports vigorous measures to ensure the 
successful operation of the marketplace.  This includes promoting 
competition and competitive pricing and strengthening and 
vigorously enforcing competition and anti-combines legislation. 
We support severe penalties for collusion or price fixing in a 
competitive marketplace that serves the consumer well.  It is 
reasonable to expect freedom from deception or collusion or any 
other anti-competitive practice that will inhibit the successful 
operation of the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad to support Bill C-20 on behalf of the citizens of 
Surrey Central who are citizens of this great country and senior 
citizens who are more vulnerable to fraud by telemarketers.  We 
will be more than happy to support the bill but not at any cost. 
At this time we cannot support the amendments in Group No. 4, and 
as I mentioned earlier in the other three groups as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
one of the final speakers to Bill C-20 I want to approach this 
from a different perspective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the intent of the amendment put forward by the hon. 
member from the Bloc.  As I understand it his intent is to make 
it easier for people to bring their concerns and complaints 
before the commissioner and the competition bureau. We have to 
look at this in a larger context to really understand the impact 
and to see if that is really achieving the goal that we were 
trying to do in the first place with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the thrust of the bill we can see that the key 
things this bill is trying to do is to make sure that 
telemarketers give fair and reasonable disclosure of information 
at the beginning of each call, including the identity of the 
company, the purpose of the communication, the nature of the 
product, business or interest, the price, material restrictions 
and any terms and conditions applicable to delivery. The key 
thing in summary is that those who are involved in this kind of 
business are forthright, totally honest, provide all the 
information to the consumer and that there is no 
misrepresentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the bill is trying to do. It is trying to protect 
those who have been abused by those who have not followed the 
rules in the past. If that is what we are trying to do, then 
maybe it is good that we have it clearly laid out in the 
legislation.  For those who violate those criteria or cross the 
line, perhaps it is better that we have the tools in place to 
bring swift conviction and have appropriate penalties to serve as 
a deterrent.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal here is to have people adhere to the principles of 
honest business.  The answer, I propose, is not to make it easier 
to complain and grow the regulatory quagmire and cost all 
Canadians more, including the consumers, to deal with all these 
complaints.  Instead, the more cost-effective answer would be to 
have clear guidelines with a clear process for penalties for 
those who breach the guidelines and when warranted, significant 
penalties that serve as a deterrent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This kind of approach results in less abuses and a lower cost to 
the consumer and the marketplace in general.  I think it is 
prudent upon all of us here as we face the debt we have and the 
taxes we have not just to cut taxes and not just to pay down the 
debt, but even before all that to ask ourselves in every piece of 
legislation that comes before the House, are we doing it in the 
most cost-effective manner?  Are we approaching it in a way that 
achieves the results with the minimal regulatory and bureaucratic 
quagmire that can result?  Are we driving it home and achieving 
the results in the most cost-effective manner? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we have to be asking ourselves today with the state 
of our national economy and the taxes that Canadians are paying. 
That is what they are expecting us to be asking here and that is 
the reflective position the Reform Party is taking on these 
particular amendments.  We do not think it is a move in the right 
direction.  It is not serving the Canadian taxpayer.  Let us make 
sure the rules are clear and that if the rules are broken there 
is a significant enough penalty to serve as a deterrent.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK272">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 9 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA identification and to make 
consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK273"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Reform Party is committed to restoring 
confidence in our justice system and providing Canadians with 
true security.  This means providing our law enforcement agencies 
with the latest technological tools to detect and apprehend the 
perpetrators of violent crime.  DNA identification is that type 
of tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If used to its full potential, the DNA databank could be the 
single most important development in fighting crime since 
fingerprinting. It is time that we move from early 1900 
technology to 21st century tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current form Bill C-3 is reprehensible and unacceptable 
because it maintains an unnecessary level of risk to the lives 
and safety of Canadians. Bill C-3 gives Canadians a false sense 
of security.  The Reform Party cannot support the bill in its 
current form.  We support the creation of a DNA databank, but the 
current scope of the bill is too limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have taken what should be a relatively simple issue 
and have complicated it.  This bill will provide lawyers with 
more business, but will solve very little crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The civil libertarians may be concerned, but in reality the 
databank is to be exclusively restricted to criminal detection 
and crime solving.  Any abuse is subject to criminal penalty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA databanks are currently in use in the United States, Great 
Britain and New Zealand.  DNA forensic analyses have been 
instrumental in securing convictions in hundreds of cases in 
Canada and have helped the release of wrongly convicted persons, 
for instance, Guy Paul Morin to name but one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have been dragging their feet on DNA despite 
co-operation by the Reform Party going back to 1995 when we 
assisted the government in passing Bill C-104 which enabled 
police to obtain a warrant to seize bodily substances for DNA 
purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Bill C-3 now reads it would not have assisted in the 
investigation of Paul Bernardo, as he had never been convicted of 
a listed offence to tie him to the DNA profiles left at the scene 
of his criminal activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 gives our police the full use of DNA technology, but 
Bill C-3 does not allow the taking of a DNA sample at the time of 
charge.  It does not allow samples to be taken from incarcerated 
criminals, other than designated dangerous offenders, multiple 
sex offenders and multiple murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the multiple murderer commits the murders on the same night 
we cannot take a sample from him.  The murders must be committed 
separately.  This is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 provides a dangerous and unnecessary exemption.  It 
authorizes judges not to issue warrants for the taking of samples 
if they believe that in doing so the impact on the individual's 
privacy and security would be grossly disproportionate to the 
public interest and the protection of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee the Reform Party asked for an example of such an 
instance.  Nothing was forthcoming.  The government it seems 
would rather protect the interests of criminals who would commit 
heinous crimes over those of law-abiding citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cites finances as one reason why it is not 
willing to expand the DNA databank and allow for samples to be 
taken at the time of charge rather than conviction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party proposed that samples be taken at the time of 
charge and not be analysed until conviction.  This would have 
satisfied the Canadian police associations and their concerns 
regarding offenders who are released on bail pending trial and 
skipping out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During committee hearings on March 10, 1998, Dr. Ron Fourney, a 
research scientist in charge of the RCMP's forensic crime 
laboratory, said that the cost of a DNA case is about $4,500, but 
the cost of getting one's sample into the database is between $50 
and $60.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At that cost it is justifiable to take a DNA sample from all 
persons charged with indictable offences, just like those who are 
fingerprinted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that the total cost of the DNA bank will be between 
$15 million and $18 million.  The conclusive nature of DNA 
evidence often results in substantial savings for police and the 
courts since an investigation can be narrowed down and a trial 
very much simplified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the long term this is a cost effective tool and a great 
protection to society.  By analyzing the DNA of all persons 
charged with violent offences other than common assault we could 
have 57,000 samples in the databank.  Think of the added security 
that this would mean to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the Clifford Robert Olson case and what Inspector 
Gary Bass, officer in charge of E Division of the British 
Columbia major crimes section had to say in committee and how 
essential it is to broaden the terms of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe for a number of reasons the case of Clifford Robert 
Olson provides useful insight into various aspects of the 
currently proposed legislation.  Not only is it a case that many 
Canadians have some knowledge of, but his earlier criminal 
history is not dissimilar to that of many of our most violent 
offenders.  His criminal convictions date back to July of 1957 
for break, entry, and theft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed legislation this would be a secondary 
designated offence under section 487.04.  Pursuant to proposed 
paragraph 487.05(1)(b), application in theory could have been 
made at that time to take a sample for DNA analysis and entry 
into the DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1960 Olson had added convictions involving 19 offences of 
theft, break and entry.  Through the 1960s he was convicted of a 
further 43 offences, which included break and entries, armed 
robbery, false pretences, and escapes.  Through the 1970s he was 
convicted of another 25 offences involving similar crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between 1961 and 1982, 16 offences were either stayed or 
dismissed.  One of these was robbery with violence in 1978.  In 
April of 1981 stays were entered on indecent assault, buggery, 
rape, and gross indecency charges.  By this time Olson had 
already killed his first known victim. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this backdrop, it's useful to examine what may have 
happened in Olson's case had we had DNA technology and the 
legislation proposed in Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were several occasions during Olson's criminal career when 
DNA may have been taken pursuant to a secondary designated 
offence having been committed.  It is unlikely that authorization 
would have been sought in the first instance.  However, many more 
opportunities presented themselves over the following years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until 1980 there had been no primary designated offence for 
which he had been charged.  In November of 1980 he was charged 
with buggery in relation to a 15-year old male.  Olson's first 
known murder victim died November 19, 1980.  Just six weeks 
later, on January 2, 1981, Olson was charged with rape, buggery, 
and other sexual offences and weapons offences in relation to an 
offence that undoubtedly would have ended in murder had the 
victim not escaped.  In April 1981 these charges were all stayed 
by the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 16 Olson's second victim was murdered, and five days 
later his third.  The murders continued into August.  Twice 
through that summer he was arrested and charged for sex-related 
offences and released again on bail.  On July 2, a warrant for 
Olson's arrest for sexual assault was issued in relation to an 
offence committed two weeks earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never know how many sex-related offences Olson committed 
before and during the time he was committing the murders. 
However, there were many; by some accounts in excess of 100.  We 
learned of previously unknown victims as recently as last summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the currently proposed legislation, Olson's DNA profile 
would not have made its way into the DNA data bank for the rape, 
buggery, and indecent assault charges, which were later stayed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important.  This is a policeman telling us what the 
concerns are for a very serious offender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He continued before the committee: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt that Olson had committed numerous 
other sexual offences prior to 1980. 
There's a strong possibility he had committed murder before 1980. 
Given today's technology and appropriate legislation, another 
Clifford Olson could be apprehended much sooner in his criminal 
career. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Olson's particular case and with today's technology, he would 
have been apprehended after the first murder, if his DNA had been 
banked pursuant to the long history of secondary designated 
offences or if legislation permitted the taking and banking of 
DNA upon arrest and charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I've used the Olson case as an example because it clearly 
illustrates the points I'm trying to make.  One is that violent 
sexual offenders progress through a pattern of other criminal 
activity.  Two, once they become involved in sexual offences, 
there is a predictable pattern of increasing violence and shorter 
intervals between the offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said this, I do not want to leave the impression that 
this case is in any way unique in terms of the value of the DNA 
data bank to police investigations.  Unfortunately, there are all 
too many criminals with characteristics similar to Olson's.  The 
large number of homicides involved is unique; however, the 
frequent sexual attacks are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is this category of offenders for which DNA data banking has 
the greatest potential in terms of gross numbers of criminal 
offences.  The ability to data bank the DNA profiles at the time 
of the first offence charge provides the best chance to interrupt 
criminal careers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is highly unlikely that a serious sexual offender will be 
arrested for their first offence.  Most first-time offenders will 
be granted bail, so it is important any previous similar activity 
be identified at that time.  Linkage to other cases at this stage 
would provide stronger evidence through which bail could be 
opposed.  Submissions of the DNA profile upon charge affords the 
opportunity to address these concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gross numbers of DNA profiles, which will be contained in 
the proposed DNA data bank, will be relatively small compared 
with our fingerprint files.  Searching and cross-referencing, 
once the infrastructure is in place, will be relatively fast. 
There is no reason the DNA data bank should not work as well or 
better than the automated fingerprint identification section. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of the proposed DNA bank cannot be overstated, if used 
to full potential.  There is indeed a valid public interest in 
the early detection, arrest, and conviction of offenders.  In the 
class of offenders that we are discussing, early detection often 
means the prevention of further serious harm or loss of life—. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The DNA data bank has the potential literally to end an 
investigation after weeks as opposed to years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the police investigator's perspective, in the investigation 
of serious criminal offences—in particular primary designated 
offences such as sexual offences and homicides—there would be 
significant benefit in entering suspect DNA into the data bank at 
the time the suspect is charged.  I believe this would be a 
reasonable and fair approach that would balance the legitimate 
privacy concerns of individuals against the public interest in 
the detection and prevention of serious criminal activity and in 
effective law enforcement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is not reason enough to broaden Bill C-3, I do not know 
what is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side of the House have debated this issue at second 
reading and at committee.  Now we are at third reading.  Yet we 
heard even in question period today the minister talking about 
listening to what is going on and having commissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police in our land are asking for help.  They are telling us 
how we can save money, how we can process criminals more quickly 
so they cannot commit crimes again, but they are being ignored. 
It is really said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of unsolved assaults, rapes and homicides 
where DNA evidence has been left at the scene.  DNA 
identification now offers unparalleled opportunity to solve many 
of these cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has this thing about the rights of the 
perpetrators.  It has a real opportunity to turn the tables on 
our weak justice system and it refuses to budge.  For a moment it 
can forget about the supreme court and the preoccupation with the 
charter of rights and freedoms.  People's lives are at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate what I said during the second reading debate on this 
bill on May 4, on which I spent a lot of time, as did other 
members of this party.  The public wants DNA testing.  The public 
wants protection against these types of criminals and the public 
deserves this kind of protection from this government.  It would 
save us literally millions of dollars if we could catch some of 
these people quickly, put them in jail and get them out of 
society's hands so they can be rehabilitated, if that is 
possible. 
In the meantime they are not going to commit more crimes against 
humanity.  We do not understand why the government is not 
prepared to put in proper DNA testing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the taking of a blood sample in 
the case of a suspected impaired driver does not raise too much 
concern. In fact society applauds this.  Somebody gets stops and 
you can take a blood sample.  No problem.  Why is it different in 
the case of DNA samples left at the scene of a crime?  We take 
blood samples for the purpose of determining impairment.  There 
is no difference.  The invasion of privacy has already taken 
place in the Criminal Code.  It looks after that.  Is there any 
difference at all?  I do not see any difference.  We take 
fingerprints.  We take blood samples.  What is wrong with DNA? It 
would help the police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The authority to take samples is already there and overrules the 
privacy issue in this case.  If the fear is over the databank and 
the keeping of blood samples we just have to look at the 
thousands of blood samples taken by doctors and nurses each day 
and kept in some sort of bank.  These blood bank files are not 
being exploited.  Why would a DNA bank be any different? 
Everybody in the House has probably had at least one medical and 
had some blood taken.  Somewhere that blood is in a bank.  If 
somebody wanted for whatever reason they could find it, but it 
has not been exploited.  For some strange reason the government 
wants to set up a difference between fingerprinting, blood 
samples and DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listen to the experts who came to a committee before the House. 
They all are in favour of this.  Why is the government afraid to 
take the next step?  It will do it sooner or later.  Do it now. 
The Canadian Police Association prepared and submitted a legal 
opinion and concluded there would be no constitutional concern 
with taking samples at the time of being charged.  As we said 
before, we can take the samples and they can be held until a 
conviction if that is what we want.  Why wait when there is so 
much that could be done? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to the Clifford Olson case.  We could have saved some 
people from being murdered if this was in process then.  It was 
not but we can stop other crimes from happening in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the government so bent out of shape on this issue and so 
intransigent?  We all want to fight to reduce crime.  We all want 
to solve crimes.  My party does not understand why the government 
is so upset with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a letter signed by the Canadian Police Association, Neal 
Jessop, president.  He is offering help by saying let us come to 
help you make the legislation better.  That is why we are here as 
legislators.  We want to make better legislation. This piece of 
legislation is flawed and it needs some improving.

I also know members would want to make sure innocent people are

preventive measures into place to better protect Canadians.

if the government had listened to the amendments in committee and 
instituted them into this bill we would have a bill that would be 
supported by every party in the House, every police association 
and, more important, the majority of Canadians who would like to 
have this protection.  It is necessary and parliament is making a 
big mistake if the bill is passed the way it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Associations are writing and faxing us today saying hoist this 
bill for six months so they have a chance to tell the government 
to take this extra step.  We have to give the police the tools to 
work with.  We know that Canadians want this and we in parliament 
have to try to make that happen.  We hope the government will 
really listen and hoist it for six months.  Let us listen to 
Canadians, the police association and others and bring in a bill 
that will be good for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK276"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have not had the opportunity to be that close to debate on the 
bill, although I have certainly been aware of it. For those 
who are watching I ask the hon. member for West 
Vancouver—Sunshine Coast to explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As he has articulated today, with the way the bill is structured 
right now the DNA sample is taken after conviction.  It is like 
shutting the door after the horse is already out of the barn. 
There is not much point in doing it.  Whereas if a DNA sample 
could be taken at the time of indictment the benefit of this 
would be greatly increased.  The current state of the bill almost 
makes it ineffective and not that beneficial.  The change the 
hon. member is calling for makes it worthwhile and effective.  Is 
it really even of much benefit the way it is compared to the 
amendment we have been calling for? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my answer to that is what 
the police testified before the committee.  I use the Olson case 
as an example because it clearly illustrates the points I am 
trying to make.  One is that violent sexual offenders progress to 
a pattern of other criminal activity.  If we can take the sample 
when people are charged, at least somebody like Olson would have 
come up on the screen.  It would have matched itself right away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government talked about a cost of $4,500 to process all this 
stuff.  I quote Dr. Ron Fourney: “When the database gets 
established, we fully intend to use a control standard by way of 
collecting.  I showed you some bloodstained cards.  We can put 
blood on that card, do a one millimetre punch off the card and 
process the DNA in about 15 or 20 minutes.  Having it ready for 
CPR and running it through the entire test it is estimated that 
one sample will cost $50 to $60”. Here is a case of 15 to 20 
minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could all buy life insurance for that same price would we 
not all buy it?  That is what this is.  DNA is life insurance for 
Canadian citizens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is insurance to make sure that one does not get raped or 
robbed by somebody who is a continuous offender.  It allows 
society to know that the minute they are arrested and charged 
they can be checked in the databank.  If they have committed 
rapes in Ontario and they are in British Columbia they are not 
going to escape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had an interesting case today about people going through the 
system.  I just received a report a few minutes ago about a man 
in British Columbia who was charged and convicted for the rape of 
a young British Columbian woman with cerebral palsy a number of 
years ago.  He was ordered deported with his conviction.  He 
served his time, got one-third off for good behaviour and is on 
the streets today.  The young woman who was raped and her mother 
are terrified that he is going to come back and go after them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I phoned the immigration department and was told that he was 
ordered deported and that the department should find him.  The 
system is failing.  I use that as an example to match against the 
DNA.  In this case we have a convicted rapist now wandering the 
streets of Vancouver.  If we do not use DNA we are going to have 
convicted criminals coming in, getting out and then we go after 
them later.  They know how to disappear very fast. That is why it 
is so important that we get this bill improved before it gets 
third reading.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak in the 
House today on Bill C-3, the purpose of which is to create a 
national DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will create a tool accessible to all the police forces 
in Canada.  As well, this innovative approach will enable Canada 
to be one of the first countries to make use of cutting edge 
technology for the identification of genetic fingerprints in 
order to create a national DNA bank. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government proceeded cautiously with this legislation in 
order to have a full examination and public debate on privacy 
issues, among others.  Because DNA has the potential to reveal 
much more about the person than the breath sample, fingerprinting 
or even routine blood tests, we have had to examine individual 
privacy rights of today and also look beyond to consider how this 
legislation might affect those rights in the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right from the start, the Solicitor General carried out an in 
depth examination of the issues involved.  The government 
drafted the bill that was tabled last year after consulting 
groups and individuals across the country.  The bill was 
subsequently submitted to the Standing Committee on Justice and 
Human Rights prior to second reading.  The committee, which 
heard over 30 witnesses, did a remarkable job of examining the 
bill in record time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its presentation, the bill has been subjected to an open 
and transparent examination.  I must also give tribute to the 
Solicitor General, who took the necessary steps to focus the 
process on consultation and to maintain its transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the protection of privacy constitutes an important element 
in this bill, I would like to share with you the government's 
point of view on these matters and to show you how Bill C-3 is 
rooted in a solid and balanced approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, I would like to address the question of sample 
retention.  Scientists have brought out solid arguments 
demonstrating that it is essential to retain biological samples 
for the DNA data bank in order to be able to benefit from future 
technological progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last March, an RCMP expert in criminalistics told the committee 
that major progress has been made in recent years in the area of 
using DNA fingerprints for identification.  Now it is possible 
to examine smaller samples, including ones from decomposed 
material. 
This technological progress indicates that DNA analysis is one 
of the most active and rapidly evolving areas of technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the technology evolves, today's gains from DNA identification 
could easily become obsolete.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 provides for the storage of samples of bodily 
substances. This means that Canada's first national DNA data 
bank will keep pace with the technological progress and will be 
able to communicate with the other laboratories and data banks 
in the world. The main concern may have to do with access to 
these samples and DNA profiles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is patterned on a bill passed in July 1995 that dealt 
with warrants—and members of the opposition should listen to 
this most important part—authorizing the collection of samples 
for forensic DNA analysis. Bill C-3 includes similar protective 
measures and provisions regarding the collection of samples for 
forensic DNA analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, these legislative provisions on warrants have survived 
all the legal challenges made under the charter, and they have 
served as a sound basis for the establishment of the DNA data 
bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, Bill C-3 includes strict rules governing the 
collection of bodily substances and DNA identification, as well 
as the storage of DNA profiles, so as to protect people's 
privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the RCMP will be responsible for the safe storage 
of all bodily substances. Moreover, under the act, only those 
responsible for operating and maintaining the data bank will 
have access to the profiles and samples. To ensure that the 
information is used properly, the act explicitly provides that 
only the name indicated in the profile will be transmitted to 
police authorities in the course of criminal investigations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides a maximum sanction of two years less a 
day for all those not abiding by these provisions.  Offences 
involving misuse of the data bank will be included in the 
Criminal Code and in the DNA Identification Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that the data bank respects the right to privacy of 
all innocent individuals found at the scene of a crime or law 
abiding citizens who volunteer to provide samples for genetic 
analysis, the bill contains provisions to permanently deny 
access to information in a criminal case pertaining to a victim 
or an individual no longer considered a suspect in a police 
investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this important protective measure is to exclude DNA 
profiles of innocent individuals from the data bank. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 also provides an opportunity for persons required to 
provide DNA samples to express their preference as to the type of 
sample they would like to give.  The police are then required to 
take that preference into account but are in no way obligated to 
take the sample specified by the person.  This is because the 
police must take other considerations into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a judge from the Ontario court of justice recently 
ruled that the taking of hair samples was unconstitutional. In 
addition, forensic scientists have advised that blood provides 
the best sample for successful DNA typing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bearing all this in mind, Bill C-3 allows the police to make the 
final decision on the sample to be taken. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the protective measures and sanctions provided in 
Bill C-3, other mechanisms exist to ensure that the bill will be 
applied in such a way as to maintain a balance between the 
protection of privacy and the protection of the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the data bank is in operation, the Privacy Commissioner 
will be able to verify this at any time.  The Privacy Act 
permits him already to oversee the use of personal information 
in the hands of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, Canada's forensic laboratories are currently 
developing regulatory standards. 
Once these standards are in effect, the forensic labs may be 
studied by an independent body to ensure they meet international 
quality assurance standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provisions already exist, like the one in the Privacy Act, 
providing that information, including genetic information, may 
not be transmitted to another country unless an agreement exists 
with it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, under the Privacy Act, information may be disclosed 
to a foreign state only for the purpose of administering or 
enforcing a law or carrying out an investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the RCMP will be responsible for the DNA data bank, all 
functions must be consistent with that organization's internal 
standards, which are among the most rigorous in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP also works closely with a number of international 
groups and committees in this area, including the technical 
working group on DNA analysis sponsored by the FBI, which keeps 
Canada up to date on the most recent technology and helps us 
ensure that our standards correspond to those in effect 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to explain why the bill provides for samples to 
be taken at the time of sentencing, and not when an arrest is 
made or a charge laid, as certain colleagues are proposing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the consultations held on the bill and committee 
hearings, many individuals and groups told the government that 
taking samples at the time of arrest would present difficulties. 
Rarely is someone convicted on the strength of DNA evidence 
alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, DNA evidence is not always available at the crime 
scene.  Various factors, such as alibis, motives, fingerprints, 
evidence of eyewitnesses, and so forth, are taken into 
consideration in a criminal proceeding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been considerable discussion to determine whether 
taking samples when an arrest is made or a charge laid without 
first obtaining a warrant is consistent with the provisions of 
the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three eminent former appeal court judges from Quebec, Ontario 
and British Columbia examined the issue as part of an 
independent review. Their findings clearly confirm the 
government position that taking samples when a charge is laid 
would be contrary to the provisions of the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be quite clear on this point. The government must 
continue to act carefully, responsibly and thoughtfully in this 
respect. We want to take the approach that is in the best 
interest of Canadians. Therefore, we must ask ourselves the 
following questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, is it justified to collect bodily substances every time 
someone is arrested, when DNA data may not even be relevant? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, how would the criminal justice system benefit since 
judicial experts have told us time and time again that the risk 
of a charter challenge was much too high? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third and last, why jeopardize the establishment of a DNA data 
bank designed to better protect all Canadians by going too far? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking samples at the time of conviction is the approach that 
ensures both effective law enforcement and protection of 
individual rights during the course of a criminal investigation. 
As the Privacy Commissioner of Canada told the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Human Rights, intelligent privacy protection is 
compatible with effective law enforcement.  Let us give both a 
chance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police know all too well how easy it is for a case to be 
thrown out on a constitutional basis.  In light of this, it is 
the responsibility of every member of this House to play a 
constructive role in creating a DNA data bank that will balance 
public protection with the charter and individual privacy rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think such a balance has been struck by the government in 
Bill C-3. That is why I support it wholeheartedly and urge all my 
colleagues to do the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before allowing questions and comments, it 
is my duty, pursuant to Standing Order 38, to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows: the hon. member for Acadie-Bathurst, 
National Defence; the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, Employment

<P><A NAME="LINK278"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
found two things interesting in my colleague's remarks with 
respect to Bill C-3 on the DNA data bank.  First is the opinions 
of judges on what is constitutionally or lawfully allowed to be 
taken in terms of samples by any police force or judicial system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT69"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT69"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I checked, this was the building and we were the 
people who were supposed to be the law makers.  The judges who 
are appointed in this country were supposed to be the group of 
people who uphold those decisions. I think it is another 
indication of where this government has gone, putting far more 
responsibility in allowing the courts, including the supreme 
court, to make the decisions that need to be made and enforced 
from within this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I have for my colleague concerns the innocent 
person.  He talks about protecting the rights of innocent people. 
I know a lot of police officers in police forces across this 
country.  They do not go around arresting innocent people because 
they have nothing else to do on a Saturday night.  They obviously 
have some strong evidence in order for them to make that arrest 
initially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our recommendations, the bill would make it so that it is 
a guarantee that anybody who was arrested by mistake would be 
found innocent.  It is almost an ironclad guarantee with the use 
of DNA evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask my colleague that very simple question.  If he is so 
interested in protecting the rights of innocent people, why would 
he not be in favour of using DNA evidence at the point of arrest? 
If that person is found innocent, then that DNA evidence or 
report would not go into the DNA bank.  It is very, very simple. 
To me it makes no sense that we would not be looking at that kind 
of system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am quite surprised 
frankly that a member would say that we can change the 
constitution in this House alone when we know full well that the 
constitution of the country can be amended only with certain 
provisions having to do with the involvement of provinces, unless 
we want to refuse to recognize the prerogative of provinces to 
interfere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the question of using DNA at the time of arrest, I 
would like to remind my hon. colleague that this can be done. The 
only condition that there must be to fulfil it is to get a 
warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The protection of civil liberties is guaranteed by the fact that 
the judge has to order the taking of DNA samples.  It can be done 
but it cannot be done randomly.  It cannot be done without any 
form of protection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are a society where we want to balance our fight for civil 
liberties with the requirements for tools for our justice system 
to be executed in a most secure way for Canadians.  That is a 
fundamental philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would accept that the hon. member does not share this 
philosophy or that anybody else does.  You may also differ with 
me, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that our fundamental philosophy is preservation of 
civil liberties at the same time as the absolute fight against 
crime. 
<P><A NAME="LINK279"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to have the member respond to the letter from the 
Canadian Police Association.  I know he has received a copy of it 
as all members have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the getting of samples at the time of arrest, the 
letter states that this issue is paramount to Canadian police 
officers.  By virtue of the CPA they have obtained an 
independent, and mark that word independent.  Unlike the picked 
judges who wrote decisions supporting the government's position, 
they have an independent legal decision stating that their 
position on this issue is constitutionally sound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The letter states “We attempted to work with the Department of 
Justice and they were unable to understand the significance of 
our position, perhaps because they never had to look in the eyes 
of a sexual assault victim or a grieving family member. We now 
turn to you our elected representatives to do what is right for 
Canadians. If you choose not to, we police officers will be 
forced to explain to that grieving family member that his or her 
government had the information and the ability to prevent such an 
act of violence but they chose not to”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a response for the police officers all over this 
land who support our stand on this issue. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find that interesting, and I 
am going to respond in my mother tongue in order to express 
myself a little more easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that strikes me, although it ought not to 
surprise me.  Members of the Reform Party attach more importance 
to the statements made by the Canadian Police Association than 
to three eminent judges from three different provinces, more 
than they do to representatives of the Ontario Ministry of 
Justice, or to representatives of the Quebec Ministry of 
Justice.  None of these comments hold any importance for them, 
compared to those reported here from the Canadian Police 
Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, I believe, reveals the fundamental difference in 
philosophy between wanting to turn up criminals everywhere, at 
any price and with absolutely no respect for the basic freedoms, 
and really finding the criminals as part of an organized process 
that respects people's rights. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK280"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I just have one question for my colleague across the 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We pay attention to the police association because we know the 
police are out there dealing with criminals every day.  I do not 
believe judges should be making political statements either. They 
are supposed to be judges and should not be commenting on this 
type of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me ask about the charter of rights because the member talks 
about that.  The charter of rights allows us to fingerprint 
people.  If people get arrested their fingerprints are taken. The 
charter of rights allows blood to be taken from people if the 
police think they are impaired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the member think this would be any different?  DNA is 
as simple as putting some saliva on a piece of card and taking a 
blood sample.  It is a very simple thing to do.  It does not 
affect anyone's rights.  We have to be charged and arrested to 
get it done.  It certainly will save a lot more people.  We can 
put protections in there to make sure that if one is acquitted it 
can be eliminated.  There can be a lot of ways to remove this, if 
there is concern about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting.  Our fingerprints are taken for a passport. 
That is now in the system so if people commit a crime they can be 
picked up right away.  They have done it for a simple reason, to 
get a visa to go to the United States or somewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do a lot of things in life.  Those of us who are not involved 
in criminal activity do not mind our blood being taken and do not 
mind fingerprints being taken for travel documents.  I would not 
mind having my DNA somewhere either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems we are more concerned about protecting criminals than 
we are about people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is one thing I 
would like to understand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions raised by my hon. colleague have been answered 
time and again before the committee that he claimed he attended 
so assiduously over the deliberations.  The answers were given so 
I am going to repeat them for him in case he missed that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take fingerprints we take a picture of a finger.  It 
does not reveal anything else but identity based on a picture. 
DNA is much more revealing than simply a picture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Like what? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B>  The likelihood of the occurrence of a 
genetic sickness, for example.  I do not want to get into a 
debate on that.  It is much more revealing.  If the member does 
not know what it is, he should consult scientists and they will 
tell him how much more revealing a DNA sample is compared to a 
fingerprint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague is right.  We can at the present time take a blood 
test for purposes of conduite avec facultés affaiblies par les 
effets de l'alcool.  The reasoning which was given by the courts 
in this regard is very clear:  if we do not do it then the 
evidence will disappear.  That is the basis on which it was 
allowed, not because it was an infringement upon any right of 
anybody else but because the evidence would disappear if we did 
not do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This balanced approach and interpretation of the charter must be 
maintained.  That is how our rights will be preserved and 
criminal activity will be fought against at the same time.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to speak to the amendment put 
forward by my hon. friend from West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast.  I 
am pleased as well, Mr. Speaker, to see you back in the chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 is obviously one of great importance to not only police 
officers and the judicial system but to all Canadians. 
Unfortunately, however, the government's reluctance to accept 
substantial amendments to Bill C-3 will seriously undermine this 
law's effectiveness.  An unfortunate opportunity is being missed 
here.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate my thanks and appreciation for the many individuals

this legislation.  The committee stage reviews were truly an 
exhibition of the legislative process at its best in that a huge 
diverse range of opinions and suggestions was brought forward by 
those who testified at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the member's amendment and the amendments by other 
members to this legislation were not accepted, the process has 
continued along.  It did not get mired down in partisan politics. 
Yet we find ourselves at the brink of this legislation coming 
into being, I would suggest, in a very flawed and unfortunately 
damaged fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not intend to review the entire substance of the 
legislation as many of my colleagues and I have spoken to the 
bill on previous readings.  I intend, however, to highlight the 
sad and unfortunate situation in which members of the opposition

<A NAME="LINK285">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-3, an 
act respecting DNA identification and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the third time and passed; and 
of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK286"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is not the first time I have been interrupted on 
this bill.  I have no difficulty with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find myself as do other opposition members in the unfortunate 
situation that we, along with members of the policing community 
and other Canadians, are anxious to see the legislation come to 
fruition.  We want to see it before the Canadian people and 
entrenched in our criminal law in a way that the police can use 
it effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I indicated before we are in support of the bill in 
principle.  It is fair to see that almost everyone without 
exception is supportive of the bill, but there are serious 
problems with the legislation that we in the House have the 
golden opportunity to fix.  Yet the government has chosen to 
refuse pleas from a non-partisan group as the Canadian Police 
Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government proceeds with the legislation in its present 
form it will lose a significant and real opportunity to put into 
the hands of the law enforcement community the ability to fight 
crime, which is ultimately the task with which it has been 
charged, a tool that would give it the ability to effectively 
investigate and would assist it in its ability to combat serious 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not political posturing, I would suggest, by any 
opposition member who states this is the case.  Everyone agrees 
the Canadian Police Association is an excellent organization that 
represents the concerns of frontline police officers, those 
individuals who form the thin line between the criminal element 
in society which exists, a rust and a cancer in our communities, 
and those individuals who are day to day out there risking their 
lives and putting themselves in harm's way to combat crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from the Canadian Police Association's most recent 
publication in the context of the legislation:  “Getting this 
bill straightened out should be the government's priority when 
parliament returns unless the Liberals yearn for more 
embarrassment in the criminal justice field”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This opportunity is being put forward to get it right and to get 
it right the first time.  The Solicitor General and Minister of 
Justice have talked incessantly about the importance of crime 
prevention and about it being a priority of government.  Yet by 
refusing to amend the bill to allow the use of DNA at the time of 
charge, the Liberals are removing a key tool to help law 
enforcement officers and their communities to prevent crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a DNA sample could be collected at that point in time and 
used in the same investigation in which the police were involved, 
it would be a very important way to match a DNA crime scene 
sample to the DNA crime bank that would be in existence. 
The evidence of that investigation could be used to see if there 
was a match with unsolved crime or crime scenes from other 
unsolved matters. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that this would be very useful in the 
approach to ongoing or unsolved crimes.  Again I would suggest 
that the emphasis here is on serious serial rapists, murderers, 
crime at the very high end, at the very top echelon of the 
Criminal Code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a DNA sample that was taken from an individual 
charged with an armed robbery or a break and enter could be 
cross-referenced with the data in the databank that would be in 
existence to see if there had been a match and consequently 
uncover an individual in question who may have left a DNA sample 
at a previous crime scene.  It would be a preventive method, a 
proactive ability by the police to prevent further crime and in 
essence hold a person in custody and hold a person later 
accountable if that match proved consistent with other evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should consider the high frequency of flight of individuals 
on bail.  A person who is being held on evidence in relation to a 
particular offence goes through a process of judicial interim 
release or a bail hearing and is released from custody after an 
analysis has taken place.  Having that DNA sample and the ability 
to make a match, in a very straightforward and simple process 
which I hope to address later in my remarks, between the offender 
being held in custody and the DNA bank that exists for 
outstanding criminal offences might be the pivotal piece of 
evidence to prevent the person's release. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would adamantly reiterate to the House the experience of the 
courts, police officers and prosecutors throughout the land.  If 
individuals being held in custody for relatively minor 
offences—and I say relative when we are talking about crimes of 
violence, invasion of a person's bodily integrity, rape, murder 
or such offences—were to be released and a DNA sample could be 
taken at that time to see if they were involved in more serious 
unsolved or outstanding offences about which there is crime scene 
analysis evidence available through the DNA bank, if we have the 
physical ability to make those matches, why would the government 
not take that opportunity?  It seems absolutely asinine that we 
would pass up this opportunity.  This is the position that the 
CPA and other law enforcement agencies have been seriously and 
adamantly suggesting to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was suggesting, when one considers the frequency of 
individuals who flee when out on bail, it becomes a penetrating 
statement of the obvious to say that this is an opportunity to 
prevent crime and to prevent a person fleeing not only the 
jurisdiction but possibly the country.  Unfortunately in this 
country there is a very low frequency of jurisdictions that will 
then return a person to face prosecution in a jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without the provision in this legislation to collect at the time 
of charge, Bill C-3 is seriously flawed and will create a 
databank that fails to meet the full potential in the prevention 
of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not what it is all about?  Is that not something all of 
us in the Chamber as Canadians should be concerned about in our 
justice system?  Should we not be doing everything in our power 
to try to prevent crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been mention by other members, and other members in 
opposition in particular, of the exculpatory nature of this type 
of evidence.  As other hon. members would agree from a defence 
perspective exculpatory evidence is that again which has an 
immense purpose and an immense importance in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One only has to conger up the names of Milgaard, Morin and 
Donald Marshall in my home province of Nova Scotia to recall that 
if the ability to take a DNA sample and if the ability to use 
that type of technology existed, perhaps these abominations of 
justice where individuals were wrongly accused, wrongly convicted 
and spent a good part of their young lives behind bars for crimes 
they did not commit could have been avoided.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are strong arguments to be made on both sides of our 
justice system which is often very adversarial in nature, but 
from a defence perspective as well.  We are talking about the use 
of exculpatory evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if a person found himself in the 
unfortunate position of being charged with an offence that he did 
not commit that individual would be rushing to come forward and 
give a sample of his DNA. If the person has nothing to hide, by 
all means he would want to clear himself of that cloud of doubt 
and that criminal charge.  He would by all means ask to have his 
blood taken or a sample of his hair or saliva taken because he 
would want to prove his innocence.  Why would we want to 
discourage that from happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the solicitor general and this Liberal government 
should be able to recognize that.  Certainly the Department of 
Justice should be able to recognize that in its drafting of this 
bill.  Then again the solicitor general has displayed here today 
in question period that he does not necessarily recognize the 
difference between a criminal investigation and a judicial 
proceeding in relation to the hearings that the RCMP Public 
Complaints Commission is going through. I realize I digress but 
there appears to be an apparent contradiction in the approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals as well as my hon. colleagues in the Bloc and the 
NDP have expressed their concern with the standard for the 
collecting of DNA samples at the time of charge.  They feel, and 
perhaps fairly, that there needs to be a very high standard 
applied. I would like to address that momentarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former crown attorney I would like to echo the assertion of 
many, including a noted criminal defence lawyer, Tim Danson, that 
at the time of charge there must be a certain standard.  However, 
that standard must be based on reasonable and probable grounds to 
hold a person in custody.  This is the standard that is applied 
universally in our justice system.  There has to be enough 
evidence coupled with the appearance of DNA at the scene before a 
person would be held.  Surely that standard is not going to be 
subverted by the additional use of DNA in any judicial hearing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the trepidation and perhaps some reluctance on the 
part of the NDP to have full use of DNA at the time of charge. 
But I again suggest that it is not only for the use of the state 
in the prosecution of offences.  It would surely be of great 
significance and assistance in the defence of those who are 
wrongly accused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to further refer to the comments of Mr. Danson who was 
solicited by the Canadian Police Association to give an 
independent opinion with respect to the use of DNA and the fear, 
and I would even suggest constitutional constipation, that this 
government has repeatedly displayed when it comes to the use of 
DNA. Mr. Danson stated that if Bill C-3 were amended to allow for 
the collection of DNA samples at the time of charge, it would 
withstand a constitutional challenge under the charter of rights 
and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During justice committee hearings on this bill the government 
was urged to provide its legal opinions that collecting DNA 
samples at the time of charge would endanger the legislation, 
endanger meaning that it might result in the legislation or parts 
thereof being struck.  The Liberal government refused to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government chose, after the committee had completed 
its hearings and deliberations, to then go out and seek a legal 
opinion from three retired—and to quote the government 
speaker—eminent jurists in this country, who gave a contrary 
opinion to Mr. Danson's.  I am not going to cast aspersions on 
that opinion.  Suffice it to say that within our justice system 
time and time again we have seen differences of opinion not only 
from other lawyers but certainly from the judiciary itself 
otherwise we would not have a court of appeal, we would not have 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  Time and time again we have seen 
differences of opinion with respect to this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask rhetorically whether we in this House and the government 
should be curtailed in our passage of laws that would apparently 
be of benefit to the law enforcement community in their combating 
of serious crime and of great benefit to all Canadians.  Should 
we be curtailed, so paranoid as to what the courts might or might 
not do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the government to give us a substantial example of 
where that abuse of DNA is going to take place. 
Its drafters of this legislation have within its body included 
serious ramifications for any sort of misuse or misappropriation 
of DNA evidence.  There are safeguards in place.  There are very 
definite and very serious ramifications for the misuse of this 
type of DNA technology.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would emphatically suggest that we have to move forward.  We 
have to move into the 21st century with the technology that is 
available to us.  Why on earth would we hesitate to do so when it 
comes to such a critical issue as the use of DNA in the combating 
of serious crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the timing of the release of the opinion is suspect, 
that is the contrary opinion to Mr. Danson's, I do not intend to 
delve into why that contrary opinion came back from the jurists. 
It would not surprise me if the opinion had come back the other 
way. A difference of opinion in our justice system, which is an 
adversarial system, is healthy.  It is to be expected. However, 
juxtaposed positions taken by those involved in our justice 
system is the way that things currently work.  This is part of 
the process.  It is part of a healthy debate and part of the 
practice of law as you well know, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not hide behind the fears about a 
potential charter challenge especially in light of the considered 
opinions submitted by other legal minds, like Mr. Danson.  The 
government should not hide behind legal opinions submitted by 
retired jurists who, though well-intended no doubt, I would 
suggest have been given an incomplete and inaccurate term of 
reference by the Department of Justice.  It was also a rather 
rushed opinion given the amount of debate and the amount of 
in-depth analysis that took place at the justice committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of being redundant, I repeat that Bill C-3 is a 
golden opportunity to optimize the use of this new technology. 
The Liberal government has done a disservice to the law 
enforcement community and to all Canadians by holding back on the 
use of this type of legislation.  It treads with caution and 
tables legislation which hampers the ability of law enforcement 
agencies to effectively do their jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us let parliament act in the name of public safety and not 
out of constant fear of judicial intervention.  We have an 
opportunity to use legislation to the full degree of the law, not 
treading on the rights of innocent individuals, not crossing the 
line when it comes to civil liberties.  There are safeguards in 
place within this piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I am fully in support of this initiative 
taken by the government.  I commend it for its decision to 
introduce DNA.  I do not want to over emphasize it, but in my 
former life as a crown attorney I was involved in cases that 
involved DNA evidence.  It is extremely useful.  It is absolutely 
vital to furthering the cause of justice in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation in its current form does not go far enough.  It 
is an opportunity that we have now to right a wrong and to make a 
relatively minor adjustment as to the timing of the taking of the 
sample and the use thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we in this chamber and we as members of 
parliament should not be held back.  If we pass this legislation 
with this fear, this somewhat unrealistic and perhaps paranoid 
fear that the legislation would not survive judicial scrutiny, we 
are doing a tremendous disservice and we are holding back at a 
time when we should be moving forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a rational fear that exists on the part of 
government.  It is certainly something worth deliberating.  It is 
something worth discussing in this chamber, in this public forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Progressive Conservative Party, that is why we 
are supportive of this motion.  If it means delaying the passage 
of this legislation by a relatively short time, by six months as 
suggested by the hon. member, I am in support of that.  I would 
suggest that all law enforcement officers and all Canadians would 
want to get it right in the first analysis, in the first 
instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of our party, we support this amendment.  We suggest 
that the government and this House be provided with another six 
months to examine this piece of legislation and make sure that we 
provide a piece of legislation that is going to best serve 
Canadians and best serve our judicial process.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a 
very important debate that we are having today.  I listened with 
great interest to the intervention made by the member from the 
Conservative Party.  It was a very, very thoughtful approach, one 
which we would all do well as parliamentarians to listen to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to comment, if at all possible, on one 
question. It has to do with the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, the committee has heard all of the different 
witnesses.  They have come forward.  Undoubtedly they have heard 
arguments on both sides. It seems to me from what he was saying 
that the overwhelming amount of evidence in committee was to 
support the conjecture that the testing should be done at the 
time of arrest, that it should be strengthened.  That is what I 
have been gathering here.  I would like him to clarify that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that, I would like to give him the opportunity with this 
question to respond to the process in this House.  I am going to 
be as judicious as I can because I do not want to be accused of 
any unparliamentary procedure. I would like him to comment on the 
level of interest among the members on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a justice issue and it would be wonderful to see the 
justice minister rise in her seat and ask questions of him to see 
whether or not there would be a possibility of a change.  What he 
has said has been so utterly reasonable that I do not think even 
an unreasonable Liberal would want to refuse to listen to the 
argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the level of interest here is so low that it must be a 
little frustrating.  I think it is time to shake up and wake up 
this Liberal government to respond to these very, very serious 
justice issues in the way we on this side of the House are trying 
to promote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps I can have the member respond to those two questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his questions.  Perhaps I will respond to the last one first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member is aware and I as a new member of this House 
was made aware very early on, it is not appropriate to comment 
specifically with respect to the appearance in the House or 
absence from the chamber of certain individuals.  However I 
certainly echo his remarks when he suggests that there is an 
apparent—I would not go so far as to say lack of interest—but 
an apparent presence with respect to this government on 
particular justice issues in a public forum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have always been of the mind and I would like to make the 
statement that this of all places is the most public forum I know 
of to have these types of discussions, to bring forward these 
important issues, justice issues, health issues and issues of the 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may be wrong in my interpretation of the words of the House 
leader when he held a press conference last week in anticipation 
of this opening. There was a suggestion that there was going to 
be greater emphasis from this government to have members of the 
government side, particularly ministers, present in the chamber 
when these discussions were to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen many examples in the last year where important 
government announcements were made at the press gallery across 
Wellington Street as opposed to here in the chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given the Prime Minister an opportunity to stand today 
in his place to make a prime ministerial pronouncement clarifying 
his role in what took place in Vancouver and the RCMP's handling 
of the security at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that this government's constant repeating of the 
mantra of transparency and accountability and openness is 
something that is going to be demonstrated in this chamber as 
opposed to simply lip service done through the press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the first comment made by my hon. friend 
regarding the deliberations and the debate that took place at the 
justice committee, I had the honour of being a member of that 
committee.  I did attend faithfully those committee hearings when 
this discussion took place.

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is correct to suggest that a good number of the 
witnesses who appeared at that time were very supportive of the 
contention that we should be allowing police officers to take DNA 
sampling, not necessarily at the time of charge which some police 
officers suggest, but at the very least at the time that a charge 
has been laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That threshold of reasonable and probable grounds and evidence 
has then been met.  There is sufficient evidence to lay a charge. 
That is the standard which all peace officers in this country 
must meet.  Having a DNA sample only furthers that.  A DNA sample 
is perhaps the most decisive piece of evidence that can be found 
at a crime scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again we are seeing this government put the reins and blinders 
on police officers and not allow them to go far enough in the 
pursuit of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again call on this government, I beg it, to permit this debate 
to continue and let us get this piece of legislation in a form 
that is going to do the most to ensure justice in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is 
almost embarrassing because I think the government should be 
asking these questions.  When it speaks we ask questions to 
expand on its views and to better understand where it is coming 
from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we on this side speak, if members opposite have any 
comments or questions, they should be up there speaking.  I am 
publicly here chastising them.  Why are they sitting on their 
duffs?  This is an important issue.  Let us get with it here. Let 
us do something about it.  Let us make sure this bill is handled 
correctly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an amendment on the floor right now to slow this thing 
down.  One might ask is that intended to kill it.  No, it is just 
the opposite.  It is intended to make sure that when this bill is 
passed into law that it is a good law instead of a mediocre one 
as it is in its present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for the six month delay in the vote and the reading 
is to allow time for the public to get involved and for the 
Liberal government to rethink its position, its position of 
stubbornness and of saying we have this thing down, this is how 
we are going to do it and you guys better just accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true the Liberals have a majority.  It is a small one. It 
slipped by 20 or thereabouts from 1993 to 1997 because they are 
being unresponsive to what Canadians are saying, particularly in 
the areas of economics and justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over we hear from Canadians that they want the justice 
to protect law abiding citizens.  Over and over we hear they want 
the justice system to work correctly in identifying people who 
are guilty and in exonerating those who are not guilty.  They 
want a smaller level of error in those things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an opportunity to make a quantum leap in the ability of 
the government, our justice officials and police departments to 
work correctly to find those people guilty who in fact are and to 
prevent crime from happening, something the Liberals over and 
over say they want to do. Let us prevent the crime.  Here is a 
case where it can be prevented but not in this present form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my hon. colleague from the Conservative Party to 
again comment on this and to maybe join me in chastising the 
government for being so flaccid in this particular case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his comments.  I think he has made a very eloquent and 
pointed plea to the government side and has emphasized quite 
clearly the need for some interaction, some debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does appear that at this very instance there is a deafening 
silence that has fallen over the government benches. I am not 
going to say that definitely indicates a lack of interest.  I do 
not think it does but it is somewhat disappointing.  This is an 
opportunity to engage in debate and exchange of ideas and that is 
not what is happening.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point the hon. member has made which I think is also a 
very important one is the use of this type of technology. The use 
of this type of evidence can be used to close the margin of 
error.  To use this type of evidence in an effective way is 
something we should all be striving for. There is an old legal 
maxim that the law is an ass if it is administered by an ass.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite the 
fact that many in this House, I am sure, would like to listen to 
me talk for hours on end, I have decided, unlike many of my 
colleagues, not to speak for the sake of speaking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, of which I 
am a member, has studied Bill C-3 in depth.  I was present along 
with my colleagues from all the other parties, a number of whom 
have spoken just before me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During these discussions, the Bloc Quebecois proposed a number 
of amendments, which, unfortunately, because of the government's 
hard head syndrome, as I would call it, were rejected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, the Bloc Quebecois remains convinced, and so 
indicated in votes in the House at previous stages, that the 
bill should be passed quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In committee, and in this House even, we have listened, 
discussed, spoken and “parliamented” and it is time now to act. 
Clearly the Bloc Quebecois is opposed to this amendment.  It 
would like the motion defeated, the bill passed as quickly as 
possible and an end put to this waste of time and these 
fruitless discussions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I was listening to the remarks of the member for Elk 
Island.  He suggested that members on this side of the House are 
not sufficiently concerned about this debate to participate as 
actively as perhaps we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did intend to make some remarks at a later time but I want 
members to know that I have difficulties with this question of 
allowing DNA sampling upon charge or immediately after a person 
has been charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am afraid it will be an invitation to the police to arrest 
people and to charge them in order to get this type of DNA sample 
in order to pursue criminals and to hopefully lead to further 
convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that DNA sampling is an invasive technique 
and that one superior element with respect to how we treat other 
human beings is to remember the dignity of the human person and 
to remember that even in the pursuit of crime and apprehension of 
criminals, we must remember we are dealing with human beings 
first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding which is rural the holstein industry is very 
active.  There is a lot of genetic research, samples taken of 
various animals, not only cattle, and it is all part of today's 
modern animal husbandry.  I would not want to see a situation 
where we forget that human beings are human beings.  They are not 
to be treated like cattle even when they are capable of 
committing the worst possible crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do support the government's reluctance to move too fast on 
this issue despite the fact that we are coming under all kinds of 
pressure from the police associations to agree that crime 
prevention should be uppermost in our minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something more than crime prevention here. We must not 
rush into the new age of technology when human beings are reduced 
to ciphers in the sense of the communication technology or on the 
Internet or reduced to animals in the sense of how we pursue 
issues of justice. 
To the member opposite I plead with him to give us time to 
examine the implications of DNA sampling which is an invasive 
technique.  Let us think about it.  Let us pass the legislation 
as it is, see what happens and give time for a meaningful public 
debate.  Let us not be stampeded into doing something because the 
police are putting pressure on us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have serious reservations about the police actually lobbying 
and threatening politicians with political action in order to get 
their way on this issue.  This is something that I hope to 
address in my own remarks. We on this side are seriously 
concerned about this issue.  We welcome the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK290"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad 
that finally we woke up one Liberal over there.  It is good to 
hear his comments, but I cannot believe that he is saying what he 
said. DNA is an invasive technique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We already have the great invasion of poking a person with a 
needle to draw a blood sample when we suspect him or her of 
drunken driving.  That is a much greater invasion.  One can give 
a DNA sample by very simple means compared to that.  It is 
incredible that he should make that excuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the Liberals would stop making excuses in trying to 
justify their limp attempts at legislation which are going to— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Flaccid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I thought maybe none of the Liberals 
understood the word flaccid and that is why I used limp this 
time, so I could catch more of them in understanding what I am 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that the hon. member, whom I respect, falls 
into line to defend what is an inadequacy in the legislation.  I 
would be much more pleased if the member said what the members in 
opposition, not only the Reform members but also members from the 
other parties, are saying about the legislation is important.  We 
had better listen to it.  Perhaps we ought to pass the amendment 
to hold the process for another six months so that we can have 
another look at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead we have an instant and automatic defence mode.  Let us 
defend what we are doing because it cannot possibly be wrong in 
even the smallest regard so we will just keep on defending it. 
As long as that attitude persists we are not going to have proper 
adjustments and amendments to the bills so that the laws which 
result from them are truly effective. That is what we are seeking 
in the DNA act legislation.  We want this to fly but we want it 
to be an effective system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would like to say something regarding the concerns with 
respect to the invasion of the privacy of the criminal.  Maybe we 
should start abridging their rights.  Certainly an accused person 
has a right to a fair and speedy trial.  A person charged has 
that right.  We should as a society not feel hesitant at all to 
require a person so charged to co-operate fully with the judicial 
process by providing a DNA sample for not only the case that is 
the result of the charge but in order to link that individual 
with other possible crimes both past and future.  It would be a 
valid part of reducing crime.  I cannot understand why the 
government would be opposed to it, especially a government which 
has absolutely no qualms about trampling on human rights when it 
comes to confiscating property without compensation.  It has no 
qualms at all marching into every household in the country to 
confiscate by the coercion of taxation half of their earnings 
every year.  That is major intrusion.  No qualms about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg the government to be a little more consistent in how 
vigorously it claims to be defending rights of citizens and 
freedoms of individuals in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for Elk Island for his indirect compliment that he was not 
completely offended by what I had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do wish to add that I would be very disappointed if as a 
result of my remarks I were to be painted as somebody who 
sympathizes with criminals and will give the benefit of the doubt 
to criminals before the victims. We always must remember that no 
one is a criminal until he or she is convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the difficulties with this debate in the whole pursuit to 
try to bring people to justice and to spare victims injury from 
the acts of criminals is that we must always bear in mind that 
people are innocent until proven guilty before the courts.  There 
is no question if somebody is convicted that all the DNA sampling 
in the world ought to be available to the police authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reservation is before a conviction.  This is where I have 
difficulties with the position taken by some members of the 
opposition.  This is something we have to give second thought to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Elk Island drew the analogy with blood samples in 
drunk driving cases, when there is a possibility of charges being 
laid in the case of drunk driving.  I suggest to him that in the 
very analogy he brings forth there is still some doubt about 
whether or not this is an infringement of a person's individual 
rights.  We do believe in this country, or we used to believe, as 
far as I know, that we were not to be required to testify against 
ourselves.  There always has been a problem even with respect to 
the breathalyzer and whether the breathalyzer takes it too far 
when it comes to getting the evidence from a person as a result 
of charges being laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make one final comment.  DNA sampling is a far more 
invasive and intrusive process than a blood sample or a 
breathalyzer in that it actually gets genetic information. This 
is big brother. This is the new world order.  We have to be 
cautious as a government and a parliament when we debate these 
issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to Bill C-3 today and officially register my 
opposition to this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My opposition is based on the Liberal government's refusal to 
allow police officers the power to collect DNA samples at the 
time of arrest.  I feel that is simply a major step backward in 
the fight against crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to the arguments by the member for 
Wentworth—Burlington.  I listened to the arguments by the 
parliamentary secretary.  Once again what I am hearing from the 
other side is all the things that can be put into place which 
speak on behalf of the criminals of Canada but there is not a 
whole lot speaking on behalf of the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the suggestions that we had about the DNA data samples 
being taken at the time of arrest would be a tremendous victory 
for the victims of this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and the police association called for several 
amendments to Bill C-3 before third reading in the House of 
Commons.  Since these amendments were not forthcoming, both 
parties cannot support the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am looking at a letter that was received on September 16, 1998 
from the Canadian Police Association.  It was sent to every 
member of parliament.  When we first started talking about DNA 
there was some action taken back in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last paragraph of this letter states “Please accept our

public safety and still remain constitutionally valid.  Despite 
contradictory rhetoric from the Department of Justice, it is an 
achievable goal.  As an MP we urge you to take this opportunity 
and come to your own conclusion, not that as dictated by the 
Prime Minister”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of appeal I would like to make as a member of 
the official opposition.  I would like to say to the people that 
the police commission is saying it is an achievable goal that is 
constitutionally valid, that it is sure it can work with us to 
come up with the legislation that would accomplish that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that since 1995 we have not involved the experts in 
helping us to come up with the proper legislation?  Why do we 
always think we are the big shots, that we know all the answers, 
that we can come up with the legislation because we have a law 
degree, or this degree or that degree? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are talking about the crime fighters of the land whose 
number one goal is to protect the lives and the property of the 
citizens of this great country.  That is just an elementary goal. 
That is something elemental about the whole justice system.  It 
is supposed to be something that does exactly that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is ridiculous when the government rejects certain ideas of 
those who have the expertise, when it does not even involve them 
in the process.  It reminds me of when I was the principal of a 
high school, that I should tell all the grade one teachers who 
they should pass and who they should fail after they had worked 
with the students all year.  It would make about as much sense. 
It reminds me of bringing into the school a bunch of farmers who 
had worked on the crops all summer and getting them to determine 
who should go on to the next grade and who should not because 
they may have been elected to a school board.  Even elected 
officials of a school board know of their own abilities and 
authorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get to this place it is strange.  Everything seems to be 
settled on that front row.  Then all the little boys and girls in 
the back rows do exactly as they are told time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are people who are representing I do not know how many 
thousands of police officers.  They are begging parliament to 
give them the opportunity to help in the development of 
legislation that will be constitutionally sound and extremely 
effective in protecting the lives of the victims of this land. 
And we are hesitating.  It is now 1998 and we have not even 
involved them.  I think the police officers were referred to as 
an interest group.  You bet they are an interest group.  They 
have a lot of interest in doing their work and in doing it well 
and they want the tools to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My Reform colleague who moved the motion to delay any decision 
on this bill and to speak to it six months down the road had a 
tremendous idea.  I suggest that during that six months the 
justice committee and any other members of this House could 
invite the police commission to come with its expertise to help. 
We should ask it to help us develop that which would be good for 
all Canadians instead of letting the Prime Minister's Office and 
the justice minister, who is another I do not know what, make the 
decisions while everyone in the back row waits to see what they 
are supposed to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is going on too much in this country.  It could stop and 
does not need to happen but it will, mark my words.  That is 
enough of this.  I can hear the words now.  “We have to cut the 
debate on this bill.  We have to cut it out because it is going 
on too far.  We have to make a decision.  Here is what you will 
do”.  They will pull the string and they will vote the way they 
are told.  Thank goodness there are a few I know on those 
backbenches who would not necessarily do that.  There are not 
many but there are a few and I thank them for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at another paragraph from this letter.  It states “This 
issue is paramount to Canadian police officers and by virtue the 
CPA.  We have obtained an independent”—I want to repeat 
that—“we have obtained an independent legal decision that 
states our position on this issue is constitutionally sound”. 
Why do we not investigate that to see if there is some truth in 
it?  No, we have our justice system made up of all our little 
lawyer buddies and we go to a selected handful of judges who have 
not done a great deal about fighting crime. 
They do not really know what it is like to face a criminal on the 
streets and they are making all the decisions.  They give no 
credit at all to the people who are genuinely on the streets 
fighting crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage everybody in this place to stop and think 
about it.  We are going to run through a piece of legislation 
that according to all the feelings of the experts who fight crime 
is seriously flawed.  It will cost extra billions of dollars to 
put into place.  I do not know if that is necessarily true.  I 
know my friend over there from Renfrew and Pembroke does not know 
if it is true but he ought to be willing to bring in the experts 
to find out if it is.  Let us do the right thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just because this legislation came out of the justice department 
does not make it the greatest thing that ever happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of playing an instrumental role back in 1995 
when the first phase of the government's DNA testing plan was 
passed.  Bill C-104 allowed the police to take samples without 
consent from individuals suspected of criminal offences, 
generally those involving serious violence.  The sample taken 
from the suspect would be matched to samples from the crime scene 
to determine whether the suspect had committed the specific 
offence being investigated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation did not deal with the storage of the information 
or the samples derived from its testing.  It provided a 
reasonable scheme to ensure that DNA samples were not taken from 
suspects unnecessarily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the results that the first phase of the legislation had 
for Tara Manning's family.  I am not sure if members remember her 
but many do.  I will never forget June 20, 1995 when the justice 
minister said that he was prepared to introduce legislation by 
the end of the week for the purpose of adding DNA testing to the 
Criminal Code.  That brought out quite a cheer from a lot of 
people. I know it meant a lot to the Manning family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a great day for victims because it provided a mechanism 
to answer many questions and for the police to solve crimes. The 
mechanisms were there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have the police association writing to us on September 
16, 1998, over three years later, informing us that what we are 
trying to do now is seriously flawed.  However, we are not 
willing to pay attention.  We are going to get this through third 
reading and vote on it all because the frontline people here have 
decided that it is great stuff and should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage everyone to at least think about the amendment my 
colleague made.  We must give this more time and bring in the 
people who say they are willing to help us develop legislation 
that will enhance public safety and will be constitutionally 
sound.  Let us not judge too quickly that that will not be the 
case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are working on phase two of this legislation.  We hear 
arguments that a DNA sample is unduly intrusive compared to 
fingerprinting.  I have to agree with the words of Tim Danson who 
said in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> “The high court has ruled that 
taking DNA samples as already allowed by law is not unduly 
intrusive.  The method of sampling consists of cutting off a 
piece of the person's hair, rubbing a Q-tip swab inside the mouth 
or taking blood by a simple pin device similar to that used by 
diabetics”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, the court has made it clear that privacy is far more 
affected when an individual is arrested, taken to court and 
forced to face the public and personal shame and humiliation that 
follows all of this.  Privacy interests protected by the charter 
of rights and freedoms relate to a reasonable expectation of 
privacy and not privacy at large.  I want to repeat that. It is a 
reasonable expectation of privacy and not privacy at large.

</I></B></P><P align=left>People who engage in criminal activity should expect some loss 
of privacy.  Their victims certainly have.  They have lost a lot 
of privacy.  Perhaps the armchair, constitutional academics 
sitting over there should join us in the real world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we want to solve problems we should go to the people who 
have the expertise.  We should go to the people who do the real 
work in trying to protect the lives of Canadians.  We should talk 
to the police and give them the opportunity to help develop 
legislation.  We do not always have to listen to the lawyers and 
the judges.  They are not the only smart people in Canada. There 
are a few more around.  I hope they take the time to check who 
they might be.  We would be glad to give them a hand in 
developing proper legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us please not pass this bill at third reading.  It is 
premature.  We can come up with better things than what we have 
in this flawed material that is before us today.  I encourage 
hon. members to think about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK292"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
have been involved in the debate on Bill C-3 since its inception 
about a year ago.  I would like to ask the opinion of the member 
for Wild Rose on this.  The thing that bothers me more than 
anything, as far as the government's position on the bill, is 
that it has thrown out, it has ruled out, it has given no 
credibility to probably the two most important groups in this 
country on this issue.  One of those groups is the people who 
serve us on a daily basis, the front line police officers who, 
right across this country, have given overwhelming support to the 
idea of taking samples at point of arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal members have put far more credence into the opinions 
of their appointed pals, the judges, on this issue rather than 
listening to the front line people, the police officers of this 
country and the victims' associations of Canada, the two groups 
who have far more to say, in my opinion, on making changes to the 
justice system in order to make it work better and to make it 
more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to know from my colleague from Wild Rose if that is his 
opinion.  Does he think, as I do, that the Liberals put far more 
credence into those elected judges rather than the people whom I 
believe are the most important in this country, police officers 
and victims' associations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I certainly do agree 
with that.  There is no doubt about it, there has been no effort 
made on the part of the committee or anyone else dealing with 
Bill C-3 to get an independent legal opinion on this particular 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a group of people who did get an independent legal 
position and that was the police association.  Now they are 
prepared to say to the people in parliament that they have this 
statement clearly made by an independent body that the change 
that we are suggesting, that the police commission is suggesting, 
can be done and can be constitutionally allowed.  It would be 
extremely effective in saving the lives of numerous Canadians 
from violent criminals.  It would be extremely effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is our plight.  That is what we are supposed to do, create 
legislation that will do some of these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at a rally where people asked questions at a microphone. 
Before they asked their questions they were to say what kind of 
Canada they would like to see in the year 2000.  A statement was 
wanted before they asked their question. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were people who talked about good job situations, money, 
prosperity, economics.  They talked about the health care system. 
But one person nearly stopped the whole rally when he asked “Do 
you know what I want?  I want to live in a country where my wife 
can leave this hotel, walk two blocks to the parking lot where we 
have parked our car and come back without the fear of being 
mugged, attacked, assaulted, murdered or raped”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“I want to live in a country” this man went on to say “where 
the authorities, the politicians and the elected officials do 
their darndest to meet the most elemental duty that we have.  That 
duty is to protect the lives and the property of Canadians”. 
That is an elemental duty and we have that duty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are willing to pass legislation that the experts say is 
flawed, then we are not responding to that duty.  If members 
cannot respond to that duty, they should not be here, they should 
be at home.  Someone who is willing to do it should be sent here 
instead. 
<P><A NAME="LINK293"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to say to my hon. friends opposite that I have been one of 
the people who has been sitting here flaccid, and any other word 
that the hon. member for Elk Island has said.  I have been 
listening to the debate and it is certainly food for thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make one comment and it speaks to the intervention 
that was just made.  I also think it is odd.  We are trying to 
balance various rights and privileges here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPA is also a proponent of gun registration, as is CAVEAT 
and hundreds of other groups.  How can we decide when the CPA is 
right?  Is there a quick way of determining that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am not so sure that 
there is a quick way of determining that, but there is one thing 
I can assure the hon. member of.  If there is a rash that breaks 
out on someone's body or if some kind of illness overtakes them, 
please go to a doctor and not a politician.  If someone's child 
is having a learning problem, please go to a school teacher and 
stay away from the judge around the corner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are experts out there.  We do not know what all the 
answers are.  Sometimes even the experts foul up.  They certainly 
have fouled up if they support the idea of registering shotguns 
and rifles.  There is no doubt in my mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us throw it out there and give them the opportunity.  Why 
should they not have an opportunity to show us legislators that 
they can produce legislation that will not be flawed, that will 
be constitutionally sound, that will be balanced and provide a 
good law for the safety of Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the member listening seriously to the debates. 
Most of the time that does not happen and I applaud him for that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK294"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I again feel privileged to take part in this 
debate.  I listened very intently to the comments made by the 
hon. member for Wild Rose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has articulated some very important points.  He 
has placed some of the emphasis where it needs to be placed, and 
that is on the rights of victims.  I received a comment in that 
vein very recently.  This is something, again, that has to be 
taken into consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other comment I would make was raised by the member on the 
government side, and that is the speed with which we can make 
this decision based on the conflicting expert opinions and 
evidence that appears to exist in the context of this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is an important backdrop here.  It is exactly what 
this motion, brought forward by the official opposition, is 
about.  This is too important an issue to rush headlong into, 
resulting in flawed legislation that might very well wind up back 
here on the floor of the House of Commons.

of this legislature is subject to judicial interpretation.  But 
we cannot be curtailed or hobbled in our work with that paranoia 
in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those comments, I reiterate that this is an opportunity for 
us to get it right.  This is an opportunity for us to use what 
can only be called cutting-edge technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example that I discussed recently with the member 
opposite is the use of DNA in retrieving the bodies in the recent 
air crash at Peggy's Cove, Nova Scotia, and allowing those 
families to have closure on the issue.  It puts emphasis on how 
important this is and how important it is for victims to have 
closure on some of the terrible unsolved crimes.  In British 
Columbia alone there are over 600 unsolved murders.  The use of 
technology to have closure on those matters is extremely 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  Madam Speaker, the very quick 
response is that the hon. member is exactly right.  He said what 
needs to be said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing about this debate is:  Are they listening? 
It is so important and the listening part has to happen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK295"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I am delighted to speak on this particular amendment to the bill. 
Before I start I would like to commend my colleague, the hon. 
member for Wild Rose, who put forward the official opposition's 
position on this bill very eloquently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the people of Surrey Central, I rise to express our 
opposition to Bill C-3, an act respecting DNA identification 
which would make amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the official opposition, Canadians concerned 
about victims of crime, my constituents and a host of others 
inside and outside of the law enforcement community are very 
disappointed with what the Liberals have done with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is firmly committed to restoring confidence in 
our justice system and providing Canadians with a true sense of 
security.  This includes strengthening our law enforcement 
agencies by providing them with the latest effective 
technological tools to quickly detect and apprehend the 
perpetrators of the worst violent crimes in society.  DNA 
identification is that kind of tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If used to its fullest potential, the DNA databank could be the 
single most important development in fighting crime since the 
introduction of fingerprints.  The technology available through 
DNA identification would make our society safer.  It would 
protect our homes, our families and our lives from criminal 
activity and, in particular, violent crime.  It is my 
understanding that DNA capability will greatly enhance the work 
of our law enforcement community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next few years and perhaps decades this technology will 
virtually change the world in terms of crime solving, crime 
detection and the positive identification of criminals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If passed unamended, Bill C-3 will provide Canadians with a 
false sense of security.  Therefore, the Reform Party cannot 
support this inadequate and incomplete piece of legislation.  The 
Reform Party fully supports the creation of the DNA databank. 
However, we do not support the limited scope of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I oppose this bill?  Bill C-3 does not grant our police 
forces full use of DNA technology.  Bill C-3 does not allow for 
the taking of the DNA sample at the time of the criminal charge 
being laid.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where fingerprints are taken.  This is exactly the time 
to take DNA samples.  How can the Liberals fail to provide our 
law enforcement agencies with the opportunity to get a DNA sample 
at the time of the arrest? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does not permit samples to be taken from incarcerated 
criminals other than designated dangerous offenders, multiple sex 
offenders and multiple murderers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hands of the Liberals Bill C-3 is actually a hindrance 
to more effective law enforcement and a safer society.  This is a 
needlessly restrictive use of DNA in Bill C-3.  The official 
opposition is holding the Liberals responsible for denying our 
police the use of DNA which they have been asking for for quite 
some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are so arrogant that they are attempting to fool 
Canadians about what the bill does and 
does not do. It does not go far enough and we must not be fooled. 
It is an inadequate piece of legislation and we cannot support 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from a September 16, 1998 letter addressed 
to me by the president of the Canadian Police Association.  I am 
sure that other members in this House may have also received 
similar letters.  This letter which I am going to quote from is a 
scathing indictment of the Liberal government.  On the first page 
it reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Police Association represents approximately 35,000 
front line police officers across Canada.... Bill C-3, as 
currently drafted, is seriously flawed, and will needlessly allow 
Canadians to be put at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CPA has lobbied for the creation of a DNA databank for many 
years. Since the beginning, we stressed the important impact a 
bank could have on public safety, a goal that we work towards 
everyday whether it be on the streets or on Parliament Hill.  We 
said then, as we say now, that for this initiative to work 
samples must be taken from suspects when arrested.  By doing so, 
we will maximize the potential crime prevention aspects of the 
bill which is a goal we all share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not underestimate the importance of this issue to the CPA. We 
are not, and never have been, averse to take every public 
opportunity to inform the public when the government creates and 
passes flawed legislation.  We will do that again regarding Bill 
C-3.  We will make sure that Canadians understand that their 
government is risking their lives.  We will make sure that if one 
of your constituents is harmed because of this flawed 
legislation, that they will know who to ask for an explanation. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals should be ashamed that 35,000 Canadian police 
officers on the front lines have been seriously disappointed by 
this Liberal government's legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want our police officers to be protected and do the 
best job they can.  The Liberals are not allowing our police 
officers the use of DNA identification that they are asking for 
and our police officers deserve more support from us, from our 
government, than that which this Liberal government is giving 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are choosing to slow down this process of the 
advent of DNA identification into our crime fighting efforts. The 
Liberals are crippling the ability of our law enforcement 
agencies to use this technology. 
This government has refused to allow the amendments to this bill 
that have been put forward by the official opposition.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an issue to play politics with.  These amendments 
would put teeth into Bill C-3. But it is as if the Liberals do 
not want that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are afraid to unleash this powerful crime fighting 
tool because they are more concerned about the criminals and the 
rights of the accused than they are about the victims of crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our law enforcement agencies should have been given the go ahead 
to use DNA identification tools ever since the technology was 
first invented. For example, it would just be like forcing people 
to use candles or kerosene lanterns instead of electric light 
bulbs. We ask our police forces to use fingerprints but not DNA 
identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is supposed to be responsible for shaping 
our justice system.  This is the government of the day. Canadians 
are relying on the government but the government is just sitting 
on its hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister continues to show his willingness to place 
the lives and safety of innocent people in jeopardy, whether by 
allowing the parole of violent offenders who go on to rape and 
murder again or by allowing freedom of convicted violent 
offenders through conditional sentencing or by tying our police 
officers' hands through Bill C-3. The safety of our society is a 
secondary issue for this Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 provides a dangerous and unnecessary exemption 
authorizing judges not to issue warrants for the taking of a 
sample if they believe in doing so the impact of the individual's 
privacy and security would be grossly disproportionate to the 
public interest and the protection of society.  It seems to me 
that if DNA identification were positive and unequivocal proof 
then the rights of an individual would be best served by that 
person providing a DNA sample.  DNA samples are conclusive if 
processed carefully and correctly.  A DNA sample can disprove as 
well as prove whether an accused person was involved in a crime. 
The Liberal's argument in support of allowing the judge not to 
issue a warrant for the taking of a DNA sample fails. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of the government's irrational fear of violating the 
privacy rights of a person accused of heinous crimes, the 
Liberals are restricting the use of this very important 
technology by our law enforcement agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we are watching the Liberals use cold hearted legal 
talk to deny giving our law enforcement agencies what they need. 
The Liberals used cold legal arguments and some kind of numbers 
to deny help to all of the victims of tainted blood, so probably 
they are used to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are devastated when innocent victims fall prey to 
violence, whether the motivation is drugs, theft, greed or hate. 
My community wants to know how many more innocent people will 
lose their lives before changes are made in our criminal justice 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is failing our youth, our seniors, our 
communities and our society because it lacks the moral strength 
to deal with violent crime and repeat offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the summer I did some door knocking in my constituency. 
People were amazed and surprised by why a politician would do 
door knocking between elections.

</I></B></P><P align=left>While knocking on these doors I noticed that almost second home 
in my constituency had a sticker on their door or window warning 
that the home was armed with an alarm system.  It gives me the 
signal that people are not feeling safe on the streets, as we 
know, but are also not feeling safe in their own homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few months ago a senior was brutally beaten to death in his 
own home in my constituency.  The constituents I represent in 
Surrey Central are living in the wake of the arrest of five young 
men for the brutal beating and murder of a temple caretaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Liberal government is spineless, heartless, gutless, deaf 
and blind.  Everyone knows that the government is not getting 
tough on crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My constituents and I are warning this government to get tough 
on crime.  We want it to do the work that is necessary to protect 
our society.  That is why we are not supporting Bill C-3.  It 
does not do the work necessary to give our police what they want 
in terms of using DNA identification tools. 
<P><A NAME="LINK296"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just 
want to make a quick comment and ask a question of my hon. 
colleague who just made his remarks with regard to Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about his door knocking this summer and noticed that a 
good number of houses in his riding were equipped with security 
systems.  When I campaigned in 1997 that was one thing I took 
note of in Saskatoon.  At least half the houses in supposedly 
small town Saskatoon were equipped with alarm systems as well. 
Saskatoon is number three on the crime list in Canada. Regina is 
number one and Vancouver is number two in the number of crimes 
committed per capita. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my colleague's perspective why does he think that the crime 
rate is increasing not only in my province but in his as well? 
What steps could the Liberal government take in order to get 
tough on crime? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for asking this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will recall that when Clifford Olson made an attempt 
at the faint hope clause his hearing took place in my 
constituency.  If when that violent criminal committed the crime 
the DNA sampling was there and the law enforcement agencies had 
that tool they could have solved so many other murders years 
before.  They probably could have put a stop to the murders 
before more were committed.  He was on the loose and we could not 
convict him.  If we had had this particular tool we may have been 
able to save many more lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the alarm signs on the doors and windows of homes in 
our constituencies it gives us an indication that Canadians do 
not have faith in this Liberal government.  It gives us the 
message that something needs to be done but the government is 
sitting on its hands.  Why are we not giving such an innovative 
and modern tool to police forces?  Who are we afraid of?  Are we 
afraid of the violent criminal? 
Do we not want to protect the rights of the victims?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crime is on the rise simply because there is no one to put a 
stop to the criminals.  I think the government should do 
something, do the honourable thing and accept the amendments from 
the official opposition and give a tool with teeth to law 
enforcement agencies. 
<P><A NAME="LINK297"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the PC 
Party, as my colleague for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough has so 
eloquently said, believes that recording of DNA is good but it 
does not go far enough as it is in its present state. Basically 
it curtails the ability of police to do their job effectively. It 
can lead to the flight of criminals who have not gone to trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the registration of long guns imposed by the 
ill-conceived Bill C-68, the registry of criminals through DNA 
databanking is something we applaud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague for his comments about the bill 
not permitting retroactive testing of DNA for convicted criminals 
such as Clifford Olson or Paul Bernardo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I may not answer the 
question very satisfactorily because I do not know the background 
details of this bill.  I want to be honest and straightforward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I believe if the amendments proposed by the official 
opposition are accepted this will be a very effective tool.  It 
will be much more effective than the fingerprints which we allow 
the RCMP or law enforcement agencies to use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example.  Let us say we sent a soldier to war and 
we give him a gun but we do not give him any ammunition. What 
good is the gun? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have given the fingerprint tool but why not DNA 
identification?  The Canadian Police Association is asking for 
it.  There are 35,000 members who have to deal with crime who are 
asking for this technology.  They are on the frontlines defending 
us, making our streets free from crime and making our homes and 
streets safe.  They are the ones who are pleading in strong 
language to the government to make DNA identification an 
effective tool. 
<P><A NAME="LINK298"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Allan Kerpan (Blackstrap, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
sat here for the last couple of hours listening to the debate on 
Bill C-3.  A couple of concerns that initially come to my mind is 
that it seems as though all the debate is taking place from this 
side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reform members have spoken about it and a number of Progressive 
Conservative have spoken about it obviously showing concern for 
the bill, but I have heard very little, in fact nothing, from the 
government, the Bloc Quebecois or the New Democrats on an issue 
which I would think should be one of the prime issues in this 
fall's session with today being day one in parliament.  It should 
be an issue of great importance and yet the government seems to 
be sitting back thinking one of two things.  It will either let 
the Reformers and the Tories rant on a little bit about it and 
ram the thing through, which is all too common in the House over 
the past number of years, or it does not care about the bill. I 
am not sure which one of those answers would be accurate, but I 
have a notion it is probably a bit of both. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make my comments on third reading of the bill. I have 
spoken on it at least once before, if not twice, if my memory 
serves me correct.  I want to go back a year.  A good friend of 
mine who is a police officer in the Saskatoon police service, 
Sergeant Jim Bracken, and I spent a week in Washington, D.C.. 
last October.  We went down there for what I think is a very 
important reason. 
Jim is as interested in reforming the criminal justice system as 
I am.  When I was appointed deputy critic for the solicitor 
general I wanted to learn more about the American system.  It is 
not that I think we should go to the American system of justice, 
but it is always important to study the differences in another 
country that is our closest neighbour.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent a week in Washington talking to people from the 
attorney general's office, parole board, victims groups and so 
on.  One afternoon we had a meeting in a government building with 
an expert on DNA evidence.  As a bit of an aside, it took us 25 
to 30 minutes to get through security.  We had to go through a 
number of x-ray machines and empty our pockets.  We just about 
had DNA testing done on us before we were allowed into the 
building.  From that perspective I am glad we live in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an appointment with an academic in his office.  He was 
the stereotypical academic, a short skinny little guy with big 
glasses and a bow tie, somebody I would think would be in movies 
as a scientist.  That is what he was.  When I first looked at him 
I expected he would give me a very dry rendition or account of 
what they had done with DNA evidence there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As soon as I introduced myself as a member of parliament from 
Canada and my colleague, a sergeant from the police service in 
Saskatoon, and told him that we would like to learn about DNA 
evidence his face lit up like a Christmas tree.  We could tell he 
had something to say.  He was absolutely thrilled that somebody 
would come from another country to listen to him on what he had 
found and on how the DNA testing system was being implemented in 
the United States.  We spent about two hours in his office.  We 
had not originally scheduled a meeting for that long but we 
wanted to learn everything we could in that short time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans are much further ahead with respect to DNA 
evidence, sampling and databanks.  I obtained a book down there 
of case studies from both sides of the coin.  There were cases of 
people who were wrongfully convicted being later exonerated 
through the use of DNA evidencing.  There were case studies of 
people already in prison who were convicted of other crimes and 
who were found through the use of DNA evidence to have committed 
other violent acts.  The more I read from this book, the more I 
was convinced we were on the right track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the government for bringing this issue to the House of 
Commons.  I applaud it for taking upon itself to talk about the 
idea of DNA bank.  However that is as far as I can applaud the 
government.  We are taking what is probably the best, most useful 
and effective tool that has ever come down the pike for solving 
crime and we are throwing it away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me use the example of a carpenter to show what we are doing 
with the bill the way it is.   It is like saying to the carpenter 
that we will let him have a hammer but he is only allowed to 
pound nails from the outside of the house.  It will look good on 
the outside, but we all know what will happen when we get to the 
inside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be like saying a doctor may use an x-ray machine but 
only in certain cases because it may infringe upon the rights of 
someone.  If we take a dental x-ray we might find out that the 
patient has some other disease we are not prepared to find out 
about and do not think we should know about because it would 
intrude upon the rights of the person and his privacy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look into the eyes of a victim of crime—over the past 
five years since I have become a member of parliament I have had 
the opportunity to do so—we realize it is incumbent upon us as 
lawmakers, as the people who really make the legislation and 
implement it, to do absolutely everything within our power to 
solve crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to use a good example that is very well known in Canada. 
It is a case that happened in Saskatchewan in my city of 
Saskatoon, the case of David Milgaard.  Through the use of DNA 
evidence we now know for sure that David Milgaard did not commit 
that murder.  We now have another person who is to stand trial 
for that murder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we did not have the use of DNA evidence at the time 
Milgaard was first tried.  I will not argue that.  Had we the 
proper use of this tool, cases like the Milgaard case would be 
very unlikely to ever happen again because we would be able to 
ascertain guilt or innocence almost for certain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want to see anybody else having to spend any time in 
prison for a crime that they did not commit, just as I want to 
see crime solved through the use of this tool.  We will solve 
crimes through the use of this tool.  It is a given.  No one 
would argue with that except lawyers and the odd Liberal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could use DNA evidence for people who have been convicted of 
other crimes while they are in prison for another crime.  The 
failure to do that is abdicating responsibility as a government 
to the people of the country.  As someone else said previously, 
if we cannot provide security and safety and the feeling of 
security for Canadian people then what have we accomplished as a 
government or as an MP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe, as I have said before many times, that the first and 
most important role of any government is to provide for the 
safety and security of people who live in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This coming weekend right behind this building there will be a 
police memorial service.  Many of us have been around to the back 
of the building and have seen the police memorial located there. 
I have been a strong supporter of the Police Association of 
Canada since day one and I continue to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about those officers who gave their lives in the line of 
duty protecting every one of us in the country.  I think about 
the fact that we will not give the colleagues they left behind 
the opportunity to solve crime with the use of this tool. Frankly 
I am embarrassed to say that we have let down those men and women 
who have given their lives to protect us on the streets of our 
communities.  That is a sad thing because if we cannot honour the 
lives of those people then we have done nothing in this area as 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it in a country like Canada that in 1998, nearing the 
year 2000, we are in a situation where we would not pay attention 
to the most important people in the country, the people who live 
and work in our justice system on a day to day basis and the 
people who are victims of violent crimes?  Far too often even in 
our little city of Saskatoon, what normally would be thought of 
as a very nice peaceful little city, I run across cases of 
violent crime.  I have spoken with the victims.  I do not 
understand why and it is amazing to me the government of the day 
that sits across the way would not put more credence into what 
they tell it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was at the committee meetings that were held on this bill. 
Steve Sullivan appeared before the committee on the particular 
day I recall offhand and spoke on behalf of a number of victims. 
They want to see all steps taken that are possible and reasonable 
to prevent crime.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was mentioned before, the police association, some 35,000 
strong, completely support the idea of DNA sampling taken at the 
point of arrest, yet the government fails to listen to them.  The 
government fails to listen to the opposition members here today 
who I think have made some very, very strong points.  I do not 
see anyone who really seems to care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a notion that this bill will be rammed through and that 
we will see closure invoked on this bill because it is an 
emotional issue to a great many people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not stand here today and say that the opposition parties 
are always right.  We are not perfect.  I do not pretend to be a 
perfect member of parliament just as the government is not 
perfect. However when the huge outcry of emotion on this issue is 
heard, just like on other issues such as Bill C-68, where the 
government refuses to listen to the vast majority of the people, 
we have a democratic problem in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Wild Rose mentioned in his remarks that there 
are members opposite who would support our way of thinking but 
unfortunately the way party discipline works in this place they 
will not perhaps get the opportunity to vote the wishes of their 
constituents.  That is a systematic problem and one that needs to 
be changed very quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the big arguments from the government about why it would 
cut this bill off at the knees and reduce its effectiveness is 
the fear of invasion of privacy or the intrusion into private 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about this in the same way I think about a breathalyzer 
test. Obviously we use blood samples.  They can be obtained and 
used for driving under the influence tests.  There are also 
breathalyzers where someone would be required to give a sample of 
breath which is no different in my opinion than plucking a single 
hair from one's head to provide DNA evidence. If I had the 
choice, and thankfully I have never had to have a sample of any 
sort taken to this point, I would rather have somebody pull a 
hair out of my head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore that argument does not wash with me.  That is a no 
brainer, a non-starter in my opinion because it is non-intrusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing which is very important and critical to this 
whole issue is what we will do as a government to prevent the 
abuse, the misuse of DNA evidence. I think the government is on 
track on that part of the bill.  I do not argue with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Strict, harsh penalties will be imposed for anyone who abuses or 
misuses that DNA information.  That is great and so it should be. 
No one in this House I believe would ever argue that point. If 
samples are taken for some cases and not others, then the 
opportunity still exists for the abuse or the misuse of DNA 
evidence.  Therefore that argument does not wash. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument that does wash with me is the protection of people. 
Just a few minutes ago my colleague spoke about the number of 
houses with security systems in his riding.  He thinks as do some 
others here that we could improve the safety and security of 
Canadians with the use of DNA evidence, DNA data banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it will happen overnight.  If the bill were to go 
through according to our recommendations, I do not think 
Canadians would feel safe overnight but they would over time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the right step to take at this point in time because as we 
move into the next century, I do not see any drop in the number 
of violent crimes.  Our social system is in such a state that it 
could perhaps get worse.  We have to take every step in order to 
protect people down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key thing is that if a known criminal knows that DNA 
sampling and evidence are available, they are more likely to 
think twice before they enter someone's house or commit a violent 
crime. 
They know that DNA evidence and the use of it is available. That 
also makes them a little bit more concerned if they have 
committed other violent crimes in the past.  Over the long term I 
believe that we will make Canada a much more safe and secure 
place in which to live.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the biggest group of people who would be opposed to the 
use of a data bank as we would like to see it is the legal 
profession.  If I am a lawyer anywhere in Canada and DNA evidence 
sampling is available, it is going to be pretty hard to defend 
someone who we know almost for sure is guilty.  Far too often in 
my life I have seen the legal profession make a living out of 
other people's misfortune.  That is a sad thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not stand up here today to take a round at the legal 
profession because I know that we need them.  Everybody should 
have a token lawyer.  They are necessary.  There is no question 
about that.  What I am saying is that we must take every step 
that we can to ensure and assure people that their best interests 
are looked after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to sum up what I have said.  The two most important 
groups to me on this issue are the men and women who serve us, 
who defend our property and defend our safety and security on a 
day to day basis, the police officers of this country.  We would 
do a terrible disservice to those people if we did not listen and 
heed their words of advice on this bill.  A more important group, 
and the group I will leave to the last is the victims of violent 
crime in this country.  I have looked, and I would ask my Liberal 
colleagues from the other side to go home this weekend and look 
deep into the eyes of a victim of violent crime.  Then come back 
next week and tell me that they do not think that the DNA data 
bank that is effective is worth talking about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK299"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for the opportunity to bring out an aspect of this bill 
that I think we have missed, even though we have heard a lot of 
speakers and we have had a lot of things brought forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key part of this bill we need to focus on is the fact that 
the resistance we are running into on this bill relates exactly 
to the privacy issue, personal privacy.  Whose privacy are we 
actually talking about?  We are talking about the privacy of 
people who have been indicted.  The police do not indict someone 
without good cause.  What we are really looking to protect is the 
privacy of an individual who may have committed a heinous crime 
as opposed to the security and safety of Canadian citizens.  We 
heard some of the heinous crimes that have been committed against 
women and children and if we can do anything to stop those 
heinous crimes.  We are trading off the privacy issue and the 
safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bill on the same issue and which is going to be voted 
on next week, Bill C-284.  It has to do with allowing parents and 
those who hire people to look after children to know whether or 
not the person has a history of being a paedophile. In that 
situation they would know if he has ever received a pardon. They 
would not put those children at risk again.

<A HREF="#LINKT92"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debated that bill in the House it was the same kind of 
thing.  Everybody on this side was supportive of the bill, but 
what came from that side was “We have to protect the privacy of 
the convicted paedophile more than we need to protect the 
children who could be exposed to this kind of risk”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the key difference.  Are we going to protect citizens as 
we have been elected to do?  Many of us are here because of our 
frustration with the justice system being too much concerned and 
overly focused on protecting the rights of criminals or those who 
are indicted, putting that at a higher level than the victims in 
our society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal approach is just not working.  This loose approach 
to the justice issue not only puts law-abiding citizens at risk, 
but it makes those who are contemplating criminal activity more 
likely to step into that kind of activity because the barriers 
are just not there.  They are not seeing it as a deterrent.  It 
has become a laughing stock. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can talk about Bill C-3 which is the DNA bill, my Bill C-284 
and we can talk about the Young Offenders Act. This theme is 
pervasive across all the justice issues:  the protection of 
privacy, protection of the criminal and protection of those who 
have been charged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When do we ever hear from the other side of the House about the 
protection of the victim, victims rights, the protection of those 
who may be harmed or who have been attacked and the protection of 
law-abiding citizens?  That is what is at the heart of justice, 
law and order and peace in our society.  That is what was at the 
heart of many of the election campaigns we fought only a little 
over a year ago and why many of us are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular bill points out a fundamental difference between 
the members on this side of the House and those on that side of 
the House.  It is a fundamental difference that says they are 
going to protect criminals over the rights of law-abiding 
citizens and we are focusing on making sure that Canadians are 
not put at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police are the people who are closest to the action, closest 
to the issue.  In so many cases businesses realize that if they 
want to know where the waste is they go to the front lines.  They 
have implemented empowering people at the front lines because 
they have had to live with the waste and the issues.  But the 
government is still stuck in a top down way of thinking that says 
that judges and those who live behind brick walls will decide for 
those who do not.  The police know.  They are on the front lines. 
They hear the stories.  They see the broken lives.  They have to 
live with the tragedies. They have to pick up the pieces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the police tell us “Come on, let us get 
some things in place so our job has meaning again, so we can 
actually do the job we are paid to do, protect our communities 
and do something to serve as a deterrent”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, may I just ask at this point how much time I have 
left? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has 14 
minutes remaining in his remarks, but I am afraid that the time 
for the consideration of Government Orders has come to an end for 
today.  When debate resumes on this bill he will be able to carry 
on at some length.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on 
April 1, I rose during question period to ask the minister of 
defence whether he would put an end to the privatization of 
non-core activities in several Canadian forces bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privatization of CFB Goose Bay has caused considerable 
hardship.  Close to 200 workers were not rehired by SERCO.  Wages 
have been cut dramatically and the low morale of the base 
employees has plunged to new depths.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transitional allowance to compensation workers who had their 
wages slashed will end April 1, 1999, leaving the affected 
employees with reduced wages.  Just like with the pay equity 
issue, the government chooses to turn its back on its former 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the new service provider SERCO is eligible to receive a 
performance bonus for the next five years if it meets certain 
criteria.  This once again demonstrates that this government is 
more concerned with lining the pockets of foreign companies than 
protecting the interests of Canadian workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these bonuses are to occur, the wages and benefits that SERCO 
employees now receive should be one of the evaluation criteria 
used in determining whether bonuses should be given. Those 
employees who are now working for SERCO should receive equitable 
wages and benefits comparable to what they were receiving as 
public servants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is willing to give SERCO $875,000 for its 
performance in the period from August 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999. 
These bonuses should not be earned on the backs of hardworking 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore there is still great concern that these 
privatization efforts will be extended to other bases.  Six 
additional sites have been designated to go through the 
alternate service delivery process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The communities of Gagetown, Kingston, Shilo, Suffield, 
Wainwright and Edmonton have a right to know on what basis they 
are being evaluated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is known that these sites will have an opportunity to reach 
the status of most efficient organization.  If these sites are 
successful in doing so, the ASD process will stop. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How committed is the government to this process?  Would further 
cutbacks in the department impede the MEO process?  What is the 
percentage in savings each site has to achieve to be considered a 
most efficient organization? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The workers of these bases have a right to know what their goal 
is.  The financial security of entire families hangs in the 
balance.  The experience of CFB Goose Bay has shown us that 
privatization hurts workers and their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope that the Minister of National Defence has learned 
his lesson and will put a stop to any further privatization 
efforts. 
<P><A NAME="LINK303"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as the Minister of 
National Defence stated in the House previously, the Department 
of National Defence has an obligation to meet budget reduction 
targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian forces and the Department of National Defence must 
deliver the missions defined by the government in the defence 
policy in the most cost effective way possible within the 
constraints of the budget available. Achieving cost savings in 
support activities is something that can be done with the 
alternative service delivery program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time, however, this government has had an obligation 
and the desire to make sure that employees are treated fairly. We 
have demonstrated that with the way we have gone about downsizing 
the public service. We will demonstrate it again in terms of how 
we treat employees affected by the ASD program. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The options being considered include alternate service delivery 
such as competitive contracting, which includes internal 
submissions and the taking over of services by government 
employees, partnership agreements between the government and the 
private sector and, finally, privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Minister of National Defence has ordered the 
department to ensure that the six locations chosen in the spring 
for a study on alternate service delivery have an opportunity to 
show that savings may be made through internal work 
restructuring before a decision to award contracts by 
competition is reached. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The alternate service delivery program provides means for 
consultation and the fair participation of all stakeholders, 
including management, employees, unions, industry, local 
communities and other federal departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of initiatives that could lead to staff reductions, 
the Department of National Defence and the Canadian armed forces 
will discuss the potential impact of the reductions planned with 
union leaders and the employees affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In such cases, arrangements will be made to ensure that the new 
employer hires department employees preferentially, and 
employees not offered jobs will be offered separation packages 
or a new position within the public service under the workforce 
adjustment directive.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK305"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on March 26, 1998, here in the House, I asked 
why the federal government did not put additional money into the 
transitional jobs fund in order to put more money into the 
resource regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the three months that followed, that is April, May and June 
1998, $100 million less was paid out in employment insurance in 
the Lower St. Lawrence region  than in the same months of 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was as if a decision had been made to break the agreement 
that had more or less been in place in Canada, that the resource 
regions would produce and manage the natural resources and ship 
them out to the major centres, where industry would process 
them.  The people in the resource regions would get financial 
compensation, such as employment insurance, to allow them to 
have a decent standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the employment insurance reforms, that compensation has 
been taken away from those working in primary sector industries, 
without giving them the possibility of diversifying their 
regional economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our question addressed this, and is still pertinent today.  Is 
the government going to decide to put more money into the 
transitional jobs fund, which is financed from the government's 
day-to-day funds and not from the employment insurance fund? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That money could be used to implement projects in our regional 
economies. For example, those who work in seasonal industries 
such as tourism, logging and agriculture, would then have an 
opportunity to develop projects and businesses, to promote 
winter tourism, to process wood or to expand the milk processing 
industry in their own communities. In other words, they could 
benefit from the annual surplus collected by the government as a 
result of the reduction in EI benefits. With revenues totalling 
some $19 billion and $12 billion being paid in benefits, the 
government ends up with a $7 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be possible for the federal government to find some 
way to put money back into the transitional job creation fund, 
so as to allow our regions to benefit from that fund, to 
diversify their regional economies and to reduce their 
dependency on employment insurance? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK306"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as we have stated over and over 
again, the central pillar of this government's mandate is 
employment growth.  In the last four years, over one million full 
time jobs have been created in the private sector with more than 
370,000 being created in 1997 alone.  The unemployment rate is 
lower than it has been since 1991 and our commitment is not about 
to change now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The transitional jobs fund was introduced in 1996 to help 
individuals and communities of high unemployment areas adjust to 
EI reform.  Projects approved to date are expected to create over 
31,000 sustainable jobs.  However, a transitional program cannot 
be extended indefinitely, especially without a thorough 
evaluation which is currently underway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, through labour market development agreements 
with the provinces employment insurance continues to offer active 
measures to help the unemployed re-enter the workforce.  Examples 
include targeted wage subsidies, earning supplements, employment 
assistance services as well as other benefits and support 
measures.  The 1998 budget also sets aside money to promote 
employment for young Canadians as well as youth at risk through 
EI premium holidays and the youth services Canada program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the hon. member's comment and I reiterate that this 
government is committed to employment growth.  The transitional 
jobs fund is under review.  After that review is completed a 
decision will surely be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the hon. member talked about the surplus in the EI 
account, I reiterate that back in 1986 the auditor general 
required the government of the time to consolidate the EI account 
into general revenues.  So those moneys are going directly into 
consolidated revenues and are certainly being used for what are 
Canadian priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
