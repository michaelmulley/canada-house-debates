<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (for the Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
Lib.)</B> moved the second reading of, and concurrence in, amendment 
made by the Senate to Bill C-52, an act to implement the 
comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Julian Reed (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to see that 
Bill C-52 has now passed through the other place, unanimously, 
with an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate amendment is a modification of the amendment of this 
House which inserted article 27.1(2), which reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs shall cause a copy of the report 
to be laid before the House of Commons on any of the first 
fifteen days on which that House is sitting after the minister 
receives the report. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has amended the text of this amendment as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs shall cause a copy of the report 
to be laid before each House of Parliament on any of the first 
fifteen days on which that House is sitting after the minister

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We fully support the Senate amendment.  We consider it important 
that pursuant to Canadian parliamentary tradition the annual 
report of the CTBT national authority should be presented to both 
houses of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the House that for the past 50 years Canadians 
have worked hard to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear 
weapons through the construction of an effective international 
non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passage of Bill C-52 will allow Canada to implement one of 
the cornerstones of such a regime.  I am proud to be associated 
with the legislation before us today.  I urge all of my 
colleagues to support this amendment and ensure its rapid 
adoption by this parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
on behalf of the great people of Surrey Central and all 
Canadians, and as the deputy critic for foreign affairs for the 
official opposition I am delighted to speak to the Senate 
amendment of Bill C-52. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate has passed Bill C-52, an act to implement the 
comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, with the following 
amendment to clause 27.1.  The senators want us to replace lines 
6 to 10 with the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2) The Minister of Foreign Affairs shall cause a copy of the 
report to be laid before each House of Parliament on any of the 
first fifteen days on which that House is sitting after the 
Minister receives the report. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will actually be voting on the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment made by the Senate to Bill C-52, an act to 
implement the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, be now read 
a second time and concurred in. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, the official opposition, offer our general support to the 
amendment.  The chief critic for foreign affairs, my hon. 
colleague from Red Deer, addressed this bill at length when we 
were debating it in the House.  Liberal members and in fact the 
whole House can learn a great deal from the hon. member's vast 
experience in foreign affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was also privileged to attend the numerous meetings of the 
foreign affairs and international trade committee where we 
discussed at great length the nuclear issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems like a reasonable amendment on a very critical issue. 
It is a step in the right direction and a step forward.  But we 
remind the Government of Canada that it, along with its NATO 
allies, must remain on guard against rogue states and the 
terrorists that may threaten Canadians and the people on this 
planet with weapons of mass destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition agrees with the amendment and hopes that 
as a result of this bill Canadians will become more interested in 
international affairs and the security of our great nation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased today to rise in the House to indicate my support and 
that of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues for Bill C-52, specifically 
the Senate amendment moving that lines 6 to 10, paragraph 27.1, 
on page 13 of the bill be replaced by the following: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tabling of report 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Foreign Affairs shall cause a copy of the report 
to be laid before each House of Parliament on any of the first 
fifteen days on which that House is sitting after the Minister 
receives the report. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am particularly proud that this amendment was the result of a 
Bloc Quebecois initiative. 
The Bloc Quebecois has always taken a keen interest in 
transparency and correspondingly in increasing the involvement 
of members of this House in the implementation of a treaty such 
as the one before us today, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban 
Treaty. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1010"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT3"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT3"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1010

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the Australian parliament has already approved a 
provision very similar to that in the Comprehensive Nuclear 
Test-Ban Treaty Implementation Act.  Thus, the report the person 
designated as the national authority has prepared and submitted 
to the minister will be tabled in that parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this is another step in the direction of more 
democratic practices in our parliament, it would be a very good 
idea in future for this practice to become more widespread here 
in the House in Ottawa.  Parliament should approve treaties 
before the government signs and ratifies them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague for Beauharnois—Salaberry, who is also the foreign 
affairs critic, has called upon the minister to submit this 
matter to the foreign affairs committee, in order to bring our 
treaty process in line with that of other Commonwealth 
countries, where a far more democratic process is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said he was open to examining this matter and the 
Bloc Quebecois will keep after him until he responds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, returning to the contents of the bill, the Bloc Quebecois 
supports it for the values of peace and international security 
which it puts forward. 
It is an essential tool for attaining complete nuclear 
disarmament.  For us in the Bloc Quebecois and for all parties 
here in this House it is important to promote, without a 
moment's hesitation, any legislative measure focused on those 
values of peace and security. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By implementing the comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty, Canada 
will now be able to contribute to the ultimate objective of the 
total eradication of nuclear arms.  In this way we shall be 
helping to solve a problem caused by using energy contrary to 
the interests of humanity itself, abusing of a resource the 
peaceful applications of which have contributed, and will 
continue to contribute, to the greater well-being of humankind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The enactment relates to the implementation of Canada's 
obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The 
parties signing the treaty undertake not to carry out any 
nuclear weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion, to 
prohibit and prevent any such nuclear explosion at any place 
under their jurisdiction or control and to refrain from causing, 
encouraging or participating in the carrying out of any nuclear 
weapon test explosion or any other nuclear explosion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important feature is the international monitoring system 
put in place under the treaty. The purpose of this system is to 
detect, locate and classify nuclear explosions. In addition, 
on-site inspections may be carried out under the treaty to 
clarify the situation following a nuclear incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already the treaty has reaped positive results. A number of 
nuclear nations like France and the United Kingdom have made it 
clear that, in signing the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, 
they agreed to discontinue nuclear testing. Other nuclear 
weapons states, such as China, the United States and Russia, 
have suggested that they too would discontinue nuclear testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, we cannot claim victory yet. The nuclear threat still 
hangs over us. We need only look at India and Pakistan, which 
recently conducted nuclear tests, and at some other nations with 
nuclear capabilities, including Israel and South Korea, two 
countries whose intentions are still cause for concern. These 
nations have yet to confirm their willingness to stop conducting 
nuclear tests and to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban 
Treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois, the other political parties represented in 
this House, as well as the people of Quebec and Canada agree 
that it is essential that we rid the world once and for all of 
all nuclear weapons and nuclear tests. It is a matter of getting 
our priorities in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the critic for international co-operation, I see shocking 
statistics on human misery every day. More than 1.3 billion 
people are living in abject poverty, living on less than a 
dollar a day. Every day, 34,000 children die from malnutrition 
and disease. 
Every year, 17 million people die of infectious and parasitic 
diseases.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The priorities of the world and of our governments must focus on 
basic human needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody on this planet has the right to proper food, shelter, 
care and education. Yet, since 1945, it is estimated that the 
world has spent a whopping $8 trillion on nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should try to imagine what could have been done with all 
that money in poor countries. Even now, the gap between the rich 
and the poor is constantly growing wider. The time has come to 
put a stop to this waste and to invest where it really matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a medium size military power with no nuclear weapons, how can 
Canada help further and promote in a tangible way the 
comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty? Canada, through its 
Department of Foreign Affairs, has displayed great leadership in 
its crusade to ban land mines. The Bloc Quebecois wants to 
acknowledge the work done by the minister on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if Canada does not have nuclear weapons, and even if it is 
officially opposed to the proliferation of nuclear weapons, can 
it claim that it has done nothing wrong? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can think of China, to which Canada sold Candu nuclear 
reactors. There is also the fact that our country allows nuclear 
bombers to enter its airspace and use its low level flight 
ranges for pilot training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is on the right track, and we are very aware of the fact, 
but we are also aware of the fact that it could do even more. 
We in the Bloc Quebecois want Canada to go even further.  Does 
this government have the real political will to be innovative in 
nuclear disarmament? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This challenge concerns the international community as a whole, 
and Canada has a duty to take concrete action and especially not 
to accept the status quo.  On the contrary, it must be proactive 
and thus help the heads of nuclear countries translate the will 
of the people into decisive action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the dawn of the 21st century, the middle powers must make 
these heads of state take this opportunity in the name of 
humanity and the planet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is acutely aware of the challenge nuclear 
disarmament represents. 
We will continue in our desire to build an international 
community where nuclear weapons exist only in history books, so 
that future generations may realize the dangers of nuclear arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell you that a sovereign Quebec will not hesitate as a 
new country to sign the comprehensive nuclear-test ban treaty and 
to ensure its implementation both nationally and 
internationally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the approach of the new millennium, it is time to put an 
end to the scourge of nuclear weapons.  This is our duty to 
future generations.  Let us do so, to give all children on the 
planet the opportunity to enjoy life without the threat of 
nuclear arms.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this treaty has been an arms control and disarmament objective of 
successive Canadian governments since the 1960s.  The Right Hon. 
Joe Clark made this issue a high priority when he was foreign 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty was open for signature 
at a special session of the United Nations general assembly in 
New York on September 24, 1996 and has now been signed by over 
150 countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada played an important role in the treaty's negotiation, in 
particular in relation to the verification regime.  Approximately 
15 Canadian monitoring stations will be part of the international 
monitoring system as well as one radionuclide laboratory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has also worked with other countries such as Australia to 
find a way to open the treaty for signature and ratification. 
Twenty-one countries have now ratified the treaty, including two 
nuclear weapons states, the United Kingdom and France, and eight 
of the thirty-nine non-nuclear states designated under the treaty 
as having nuclear energy or research programs.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They therefore, along with the nuclear weapons states, must also 
ratify the treaty before it can come into force. Canada, one of 
the world leaders in nuclear technology for solely peaceful 
purposes, is a designated state.  It is therefore most 
appropriate and important that Canada be one of the first group 
countries to ratify the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not underestimate the importance and complexity of this 
seemingly straightforward legislation.  Bill C-52 criminalizes 
the carrying out of or aiding and abetting in the carrying out of 
nuclear explosions.  It establishes a national authority to serve 
as a focal point for a liaison between Canada and the CTBTO in 
Vienna, with other states party to the treaty, and obligates 
Canadian industry to report large scale chemical explosions which 
might be confused with nuclear tests.  Once passed, this 
legislation will allow Canada to ratify the treaty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take a minute to talk about Canada's record.  This 
government made a very weak statement about France's testing in 
the Pacific.  It was clearly a race to a large nuclear capacity 
for France before ratification.  It is also disgraceful that 
Canada has not pursued more vigorously its assistance to Russia 
and the former Soviet Union states in demobilizing their nuclear 
capability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative government started with a small fund in the 
early 1990s to help scholars so that they might remain within 
Russia and the Soviet Union and not sell their knowledge and 
dangerous expertise to other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally disturbing is this government's lack of response to the 
troubled Arctic waters.  Time and time again, both in Russia and 
elsewhere, concerns have been raised in relation to the nuclear 
waste that is embedded on the floor of the Arctic Ocean and, in 
the words of many, contaminating our waters around the world. 
This government has paid only lip service to this problem.  If 
this government wishes to be consistent with this new treaty it 
must again raise these issues as we did in the early 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the wake of the 1974 nuclear explosion test by India, using 
Canadian technology transferred in good faith solely for peaceful 
purposes, we learned a hard lesson.  Under the leadership of my 
party Canada went on to become one of the first nuclear exporters 
to require International Atomic Energy Agency full scope 
safeguards on all our exports of nuclear material to non-nuclear 
weapons states.  We also put in place arrangements to ensure that 
any transfers for peaceful purposes to a nuclear weapons state 
would not be diverted for military purposes.  These are 
longstanding Canadian policies which were groundbreaking in their 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regrettably, however, against that backdrop of exceedingly high 
standards and practices must be set the seemingly casual way this 
government went about signing a nuclear co-operation agreement 
with China, a nuclear weapons state which still does not require 
full scope safeguards for its nuclear exports and whose record of 
proliferation of significant transfers has been dangerous.  I 
want to know how this government can square the ease with which 
we entered into nuclear co-operation with a communist country 
with brutal non-proliferation credentials with a very high 
priority which this government purports to give to preventing the 
spread of nuclear weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada is to continue to play a leadership role in preventing 
the spread of nuclear weapons and promoting their successive 
reduction, we must attend to all aspects of our nuclear policy 
with equal vigour and credibility.  But the government never 
learns.  Why?  For money.  From the events of last year's APEC 
summit we know the government cares more about money than human 
rights.  We also know the government cares more about money than 
it does about world security. We should not so easily forget the 
lessons of India in the 1970s and the question being raised about 
our nuclear installations and uses in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee on foreign affairs and international 
trade in the other place has just finished a review of Canada's 
non-proliferation arms control and disarmament policy.  The 
minister asked that we have full House support for the committee 
report.  My party will be forthright.  Nuclear weapons are not 
land mines.  My party supported the minister's efforts in the 
land mine treaty and congratulate him on his success.  We are in 
favour of stopping proliferation.  We are in favour of arms 
control.  The world has been, is currently and will be a 
dangerous place.  Ridding our security system and calling for the 
U.S. to rid itself of its weapons in Europe is gutting our 
security system and will make the globe more dangerous, not 
safer.

Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to have this 
opportunity today at third reading of Bill S-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to implement income tax conventions 
that Canada has signed with Chile, Croatia and Vietnam. Currently 
Canada has tax treaties in force with 64 countries.  We have been 
building and updating this network of tax conventions for almost 
three decades. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-16 is part of the ongoing maintenance of Canada's system 
of tax treaties but that does not mean it is merely a routine 
housekeeping bill of no importance to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In today's environment tax treaties are more relevant than ever 
to Canada's competitiveness and overall economic performance. 
Foreign economies are opening up, individuals are becoming more 
mobile and as the pace of international trade and investment 
quickens tax treaties are becoming increasingly important to 
investors and entrepreneurs tapping into these opportunities.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Like all of the other tax conventions that Canada and its 
trading partners have implemented over the years, Bill S-16 has 
two overriding objectives.  One is to avoid double taxation and 
the other is to prevent income tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The potential for double taxation arises when a taxpayer who is 
a resident of one country earns income in another.  In the 
absence of a tax convention, both the country of residence and 
the country that is the source of income would be justified in 
claiming tax on that income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties address the problem of double taxation in one of 
two ways.  The treaty allocates exclusive taxing rights either to 
the taxpayer's country of residence or to the country that is the 
source of the income.  Or, if the income would be taxable in both 
countries, the treaty requires the country of residence to give 
credit for the tax paid to the source country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measures that reduce double taxation also serve the purpose of 
preventing tax evasion.  Laws that limit the potential for double 
taxation normally include provisions that encourage the exchange 
of information between the participating countries.  It is that 
sharing of information that helps these countries' revenue 
authorities to identify cases of tax evasion and in fact act on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another benefit of this legislation is the certainty for 
taxpayers, certainty that a rate of tax limited under any of 
these agreements cannot be increased without substantial advance 
notice of any changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition there will be a reduced compliance burden for 
Canadian taxpayers who have investments or business interests in 
Chile, Croatia or Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key part of any tax treaty bill is the withholding tax rate 
reductions.  In this regard Bill S-16 is no exception.  Canada 
and other countries generally impose withholding taxes on various 
types of income paid to non-residents.  In the absence of a 
bilateral tax treaty or a unilateral exemption from withholding 
tax, Canada's statutory non-resident withholding tax is 25%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under our network of tax treaties however, there are several 
rate reductions in effect, and these reductions apply on a 
reciprocal basis.  Where such a tax treaty is in effect, the 
country in which the taxpayer resides can withhold tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without going into a country by country explanation of the 
various withholding tax rates proposed, I would like to point out 
that the rate is generally limited to 5%, 10% or 15% on dividends 
in branch profits.  In addition the withholding tax on interest 
and royalties is generally limited to 10%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exception is the agreement with Chile, which provides for a 
15% rate. In some cases royalties on copyright, computer 
software, patents and know-how are exempt at source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another feature of Bill S-16 is that it respects Canada's right 
to tax pension and annuities paid to non-residents.  The 
agreements with Vietnam and Croatia provide for pension payments 
to be taxed in both countries with the source country collecting 
no more than 15% of the total payment.  In both Vietnam and 
Croatia, social security benefits will be taxable in the source 
country with no limitation. Under the Canada-Chile income tax 
convention, pension and social security benefits will be taxed by 
the country from which the payments are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that is addressed by Bill S-16 is the treatment of 
capital gains realized by non-residents.  In these cases the 
source country would retain its right to tax capital gains on the 
sale of real property, business assets and shares in real estate 
companies or interests in real estate partnerships or trusts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of Bill S-16 are in fact tailored to the 
realities of international commerce.  Reduced withholding taxes 
and the other benefits of this legislation are reciprocal in 
nature.  This tax convention entails no revenue loss whatsoever, 
not for Canada and not for any of the other signatories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Bill S-16 received second reading in the House of Commons, 
it received support from members of all parties. Earlier in the 
week the bill passed through the finance committee without 
amendments.  It is well understood among hon. members that this 
is legislation that will prevent double taxation and facilitate 
trade.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation, we all know that almost 40% of our wealth depends 
on exports, foreign commerce and direct foreign investment.  Tax 
treaties help to ensure that Canada's tax policies are applied 
consistently in transactions that reach beyond our borders.  They 
also contribute to an environment of stability and certainty for 
investors and traders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-16 will therefore increase our ability to compete and to 
harness the opportunities of a vibrant and modern economy. For 
the reasons I have indicated, I urge hon. members to support this 
bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak to Bill C-16. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether everybody here knows the full implications 
of the bill.  It is certainly a good housekeeping bill.  As has 
been indicated, it went through committee and there were no 
amendments because the bill as it stands presumably is fairly 
good.  It solidifies and gives legislative approval to some very 
necessary provisions.  It provides that we should have agreements 
with countries with which we have a flow of capital, in which 
people are investing and where there is money earned.  It is 
reciprocal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is an act to implement agreements between Vietnam and 
Canada, between Croatia and Canada, and between Chile and Canada. 
Whether some of their people invest in our country or vice 
versa, this bill has some tax provisions to avoid double 
taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I discuss the bill's provisions I will talk about the 
<I>S</I> in Bill S-16.  This is very relevant to the bill.  A bill 
that begins with a <I>C</I> originates in the House of Commons, 
the House to which people are elected and whose members are 
obligated to represent their constituents.  On the government 
side in particular there are numerous examples of situations in 
which MPs are not permitted to represent their ridings and the 
people who elected them. On command they stand up and vote the 
way they are told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least every four or five years, or three and a half years if 
the government gets scared as it did the last time, voters have 
the opportunity to put an <I>x</I> on a ballot and give either 
their approval or disapproval for what a particular member stands 
for and to indicate whether they believe that member did a good 
job in representing the riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is significant that in the last election the number of 
Liberals elected went down quite a bit.  The Liberals went from 
having a very healthy majority which allowed them to go off and 
do whatever they wanted without having to worry about having 
enough people in the House, to what is now a very marginal 
majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have very few members to spare. As a result, there 
were two occasions in this parliament in which there were no 
Liberals in the House at all.  This allowed us to pass things 
that are good for the people.  The latest example is the changes 
made to the Private Members' Business procedure. The changes give 
members some freedom to represent their constituents despite the 
draconian control of the party over its members.  Private 
Members' Business is a very important part of representational 
democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The <I>C</I> at the beginning of a bill number indicates the bill 
comes from the House of Commons, which represents the common 
people.  That is where bills like Bill S-16 should come from. 
On the other hand are the <I>S</I> bills which originate in the 
Senate.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I forgot to mention that while the number of Liberal members 
went down in the last election, the Reform membership went up by 
20%.  It is an absolute indication that Canadian people are ready 
for a higher degree of democracy.  They are ready to have people 
in this House who will represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me get back to the <I>S</I> bills, which originate in the 
Senate.  Who are the senators?  Some look at them as being hockey 
players.  The only problem is they do not really have to answer 
to anybody.  If the coach says to go and play somewhere, well 
they can or they cannot.  It depends on who the coach is.  If it 
is the Prime Minister who appointed them, then they will jump to 
attention.  But it is the people they represent who pay for their 
salaries, pensions, travel, offices, and for their Mexican—but I 
should not say that as it is over.  They do not have to listen to 
people in their ridings.  And there are actually Liberals in the 
House who continue to defend this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last night we debated a private member's bill that said that 
senators should be elected.  What can possibly be wrong with 
that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask any Canadian what he or she would rather have.  We all 
acknowledge that the Senate is part of parliament.  Would 
Canadians rather have a person in parliament who is elected by 
the accumulation of more votes than the other candidates in the 
area that he or she represents, or would they rather have someone 
else pick them? I do not think we would find one Canadian in a 
thousand who would say “I think it is important that they be 
picked because we are not smart enough.  We do not want 
democracy.  We do not want to have a say in that”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely absurd.  Yet this government continues time 
after time, year after year to break election promises on it and 
to do nothing about it. The Prime Minister said “We will have an 
elected Senate”.  He said during the 1993 election campaign that 
within two years of a Liberal government being elected that we 
would have an elected Senate. Then he went on to say that as the 
Prime Minister he could make that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I guess that was as good a vote getter as promising to kill the 
GST and it went the same way. After the Liberals came to power 
they did not kill the GST. They increased it by about 100%.  That 
is what happened with the harmonization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what has happened on the promise with making the Senate 
elected, something the Prime Minister could do just by simply 
saying that he would do it?  All he would have had to do instead 
of giving a great big insult to every Albertan in the country was 
to say “Yes, people, if you want to choose your own senators, I 
will be honourable enough and will appoint that one because that 
is the way it is right now.  I will appoint the one that you 
select.  You give me the list and I will choose from that list 
instead of from my own list of Liberal hacks”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure, every once in a while he picks somebody who does not have 
Liberal credentials.  Every Canadian can see through that ruse. 
That is a way of trying to legitimize it.  Yesterday in the 
debate one of the members opposite said that Mr. Manning was an 
appointed senator.  That is Mr. Manning, the father of our leader 
so I am not breaking any House rules.  He was appointed. Well of 
course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people appointed to the Senate who do not have tight 
Liberal connections.  Every once in a while there is one. Why? 
Because it only takes a little bit of salt to affect the taste of 
the whole bowl of soup.  Put in a few of these little grains of 
salt, really honourable people who have credentials beyond just 
being Liberal Party supporters and participators and that gives 
some air of respectability to the process.  But it is a phony 
process and it needs to be stopped. It is time on behalf of 
Canadians to stop this charade of appointing people. Democracy is 
not served by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the Senate should be to balance powers.  Power 
only works properly in a democracy if there is a proper balance. 
Checks and balances we call them. 
We need in the Senate a balance against the dictatorial power of 
a single person in the House who can control majority members in 
the government and then can turn around and control majority 
members in the Senate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the bill is about taxes, I should talk about the GST. 
During the GST debate several parliaments ago the majority of 
Canadians said <I>nyet</I>. I should speak English or French; they 
said no or non.  They said they did not want the GST.  In my 
riding 85% of the people were reputed to say that the GST as 
proposed was bad.  They did not want it, but the prime minister 
of the day sat in his seat and told his members they would vote 
for it whether or not they wanted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MP for Elk Island voted for the GST.  It was one of the 
things I heard more often than any other during the campaign. 
People said they would not vote for him again because he did not 
vote for them on the GST.  He voted against them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said the Reform policy is that I will represent them.  If 
there is a clear indication from my riding that my constituents 
have a certain wish on a bill, I will represent that.  I am so 
proud to be a part of a party where that is not only permitted 
but required.  I would be in trouble with my party if I failed to 
do it.  In the other parties, whether it is Liberal, 
Conservative, NDP, or even Bloc, I suppose, if members do not 
vote the party they get punished.  It is just the opposite in my 
party.  It is time we had a truly democratic Reform government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the prime minister of the day do when the GST bill went 
to the Senate?  In that chamber of sober second thought there was 
a majority of Liberal senators at that time and the present 
Liberal government was on the opposition side of the House.  They 
said no to the GST.  The present Prime Minister who was then the 
leader of the opposition said that if they got in they would kill 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happened at that time, but the prime minister of 
the day wanted the GST.  He had all his Conservative MPs rise 
when their strings were pulled.  Then it went to the Senate where 
bad bills are supposed to be stopped.  Indeed the Senate stopped 
it because a majority senators, either for the sake of discipline 
to the Liberal Party of the day or for Canadians as a whole, said 
no to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the response of the then prime minister?  He pulled out 
of the hat some obscure rule and was able to load the Senate up 
with extra members.  He stacked the Senate with members whose 
only qualification was that they had enough energy to stand up 
when asked to vote whether they were in favour of the GST.  He 
found eight such members, put them in the Senate and the bill was 
jammed through.  That is not democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need an elected Senate.  That is why we need a 
Senate that truly represents the people from the provinces in 
which senators originate.  That is long overdue.  What is so 
totally disgusting and annoying is that the Prime Minister, who 
promised he would do it and could do it if he had the will, 
refuses to do it.  That is what is disgusting.  He could have 
simply said when the opening came up in Alberta that he would let 
democracy rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the current legislation he does not have the right to 
appoint senators.  Strictly speaking that is to be done by the 
Governor General, but of course the Governor General is also a 
favourite appointee of the Prime Minister.  They work together in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister could simply say whomever the people select 
is the person who will be there.  I am proud to say that this 
coming week these elected senators will be in Ottawa.  Maybe they 
will be observed.  They will be around.  We hope they will be 
able to get some media interviews and perhaps breathe a breath of 
democracy into this place that is so much in need of it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to take a little pause and have a drink of water 
before I get to stage two of my speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I know the hon. member for Elk Island 
at stage two will want to talk about the tax consequences of the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I am very happy now to speak about taxation 
because that is what the bill is about.  The other part of my 
speech was very appropriate because it is Bill S-16.  As I said 
before it cannot be ruled irrelevant.  It is very relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud the principle of the bill to make sure that people pay 
taxes which they should be paying in a fair manner.  It does two 
things.  It helps to prevent people from avoiding paying the 
taxes they should and it prevents people from paying twice the 
taxes they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people make money in a country sometimes the country 
charges them tax on it.  When they bring their money home they 
have to pay taxes on it again.  That is called double taxation. 
Very frankly it is not good for the economy of a country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fine bill.  It is regrettable that it was not brought 
in, in the House of Commons.  It would have had the same support 
from us that it has from us now in principle.  Instead it was 
brought in from the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking about double taxation, it occurred to me not very long 
ago that we have too much double and even triple taxation.  Let 
us talk about gasoline.  I used to teach mathematics.  I did a 
few calculations.  I do not remember the exact numbers so I will 
have to do the calculations all over again on the run.  I think I 
can do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say I earn $2.77.  At my marginal rate of taxation and at 
the rate of most middle class Canadians, I have to pay about 40% 
of my earnings marginally to income tax.  Those are federal and 
provincial income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I take 40% away from the $2.77, that leaves me with $1.66. 
Having earned $2.77 I have only $1.66 left.  Then, if I go to the 
gas station to buy some gasoline with the $1.66 in my pocket, I 
notice that the pump says 40% of the price is taxes.  I end up 
with another 40% taken off.  Finally I buy $1 worth of gasoline. 
For $1 worth of gasoline $1.77 went into taxes and $1 went for 
the gasoline.  Now $1.77 in taxes on a $1 purchase is a 177% tax. 
That is double taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in taxing us for gasoline.  It even taxes the 
taxes. Part of the price of a litre of gasoline is the federal 
tax which is 10 cents or 11 cents.  That is added to the price. 
Then what happens?  The GST is computed on that amount including 
the tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it has not increased taxes.  I will 
never forget that in its first budget the government increased 
the tax on gasoline by 1.5 cents per litre.  At least that is 
what it said at the time.  It was inaccurate.  When the GST is 
added to the 1.5 cents, it is 1.605 cents.  In other words, the 
government said it was taking 1.5 cents more but what it really 
got was 1.6 cents because of the insidious GST which was brought 
in by lack of MP representation in the House and by the lack of 
an elected Senate in the other place. 
It all ties together.  We have double and triple taxation in 
Canada, taxes being put on taxes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give another example.  I will confess about all the big 
money I earned before coming to the House of Commons.  Actually 
my salary is about the same or a little higher than it was when I 
was an instructor at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology 
where I earned $4,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did I do?  I paid my income tax on that $4,000 of 
approximately 40%.  What did I have left?  I had $2,400 left. 
What did I do with that $2,400?  I took out my chequebook and 
wrote a cheque for my municipal taxes which that year were around 
$2,400.  I do not have it with me; I could not use it anyway, 
neither a flag nor a chequebook. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My $4,000 earnings were taxed and then with the money I had left 
I paid my taxes.  When the municipality said that I had to pay 
$2,400 in taxes, how could I reconcile that with the fact that I 
had to earn $4,000 to pay my taxes?  It is double taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you will notice how relevant I am.  I applaud the 
principle of Bill S-16 which says that we should avoid double 
taxation.  It is not good for entrepreneurs.  It is not good for 
investors.  It is only good for the governments that suck us dry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The hon. member will have to contain

of conception. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the early 1970s medical schools stopped requiring new doctors 
to take the oath and the Canadian Medical Association code of 
ethics no longer requires any reference to abortion.  The medical 
profession has abandoned its responsibility for the unborn child 
and now it is up to Canadians to assume that responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year there were over 110,000 abortions in Canada with a 
cost to our health care system of over $10 million.  That is over 
300 abortions each and every day.  It says that each year 110,000 
mistakes are made at the expense of all Canadians by those who 
fail to act responsibly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it too much to ask Canadians just to be responsible for their 
actions?  We do have a choice and that choice should be made 
before we act, not after we have failed to act responsibly.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, in 
the last budget the Minister of Finance put more money into 
federal transfers for health and education.  In the case of 
Newfoundland, that only slowed the rate of decrease in our 
transfers.  This year Newfoundland received $274 million in these 
transfers.  By the year 2002 the amount will have dropped to $245 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of November there have been 429 cardiac surgeries done in 
Newfoundland.  When asked recently in question period about the 
220 cardiac patients on the waiting list at the Health Sciences 
Centre in St. John's, the Newfoundland Minister of Health said 
“Unfortunately we have to live within our fiscal means”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those means keep decreasing it is possible that some people 
may not live.  I call upon the Minister of Finance to increase 
transfers for health in his upcoming budget.  For some people on

</I></B></P><P align=left>Funded under the health transition fund, these four projects

funding for these projects will be $4.8 million.

this week the government showed enormous contempt for the

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been the tradition in the House that the minister be 
called before the appropriate committee to be questioned on the 
money allocated for the respective departments.

supplementary estimates, which are additions to their budgets 
late in the fiscal year.

expenditure amounts to $46 million.  When opposition members 
called for the environment minister to appear before the 
environment committee, the government used its majority to vote 
down this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened to accountability?  What happened to tradition in 
the House?  By refusing to allow the minister to appear the 
government showed not only contempt for the Canadian taxpayer and 
for the principles of an open, responsible democracy, it 
renounced one of the traditions of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises a question.  What is the government trying to hide in 
this $46 million expenditure?

In particular, several local chapters of the Catholic Women's

that in many cases has been in the family for years.  They lose 
their home, their income and their hope.

<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

is.  It is imperative, however, that we make sure that producers 
are able to use the risk management tools that are already there. 
If and when a program is put in place we must recognize that it 
needs to go to the individual producers who are most in need and 
that it is as equitable as possible across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the member very sincerely.  We need to do it and we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is 
just not good enough.  When there is a disaster in any part of 
the country the government correctly leaps to the aid of the 
people who are affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a disaster in western Canada, the provinces where 
agriculture is the very lifeblood of survival, and this is taking 
altogether too long.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lyle Vanclief (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food,

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
because of this government and the lack of getting agreement with

are in trouble.  It is the government's fault.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We started many months ago after the federal-provincial 
agriculture ministers meeting in reviewing the whole safety net

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

Minister stated that the provinces wanted to take the place of 
the federal government. More recently, the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs accused everyone of acting in bad 
faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the reason the government refuses to resolve the social union 
issue surrounding federal spending powers that, in its next

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

Government of Canada has always provided assistance to students, 
but does so without any direct involvement in education. We help 
ensure Canadians have access to education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I might remind the hon. member that, in the United States, 75% 
of public funding for students is provided by the federal

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the eve of 
an election, it is understandable that the minister wants people 
to think that Lucien Bouchard is guilty of bad faith on the 
social union issue.  The trouble is that the minister has no 
credibility, because the 10 premiers are all of one mind.  They 
all signed the same agreement in Saskatoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister think that the 10 premiers are all acting in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for

Speaker, the member should listen to the answers before he asks 
his questions.  I have said who was holding things up in the 
past:  the Parti Quebecois government.  Its reasons for doing so 
are fairly obvious.  Its reasons for getting involved now are 
also fairly obvious because the number one item on its agenda,

Mr. Speaker, there is evidence of a breach of government security

Last Wednesday in the House the minister of public works said 
that “no important documents were in the hands of anyone

suspended its security clearance and we called in the RCMP.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B>

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been confirmed by the RCMP and the minister's staff that 
secret NATO documents went to British Columbia from Ottawa. 
Secret PMO documents went from Ottawa to British Columbia to be 
shredded by a company that had been in bankruptcy at one time.

<P><A NAME="LINK161"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pat Martin (Winnipeg Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services made reference 
to a document during question period and read from the document. 
I would ask him if he would be willing to table the document that 
he quoted from today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK162"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am informed that the document 
referred to in fact constitutes the minister's own briefing notes 
from the department, and as we know those documents are not 
tabled in response to a question.  Otherwise, we might as well 
table the briefing books of the entire cabinet. 
<P><A NAME="LINK163"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the same 
point of order, the standing orders clearly say that it is a 
requirement that if a minister is willing to quote from a 
document then he is obligated to table it.  So his choice is 
either that he quote from it and table it, or that he not quote 
from it.  The minister must be consistent. 
<P><A NAME="LINK164"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Minister of Public Works and

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think we can deal with this matter. 
The minister has indicated that he was quoting from a newspaper. 
He has given the source of the quote.  If it was a state document 
that he was quoting from he would normally be required to table 
the document in accordance with the rules of the House.  But 
since the Vancouver <I>Sun</I> is not a state document, and since 
it appears that it is a public document, I do not think there is 
a necessity for the minister to table the document.  Therefore, I 
think the matter is closed.

</H4><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have an application for an emergency 
debate which was received yesterday afternoon from the hon. 
member for South Shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will have a very short period to put his case 
before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I seek 
leave under Standing Order 52 to propose an emergency debate to 
address the current farm income crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Producers are selling at a loss.  According to Statistics 
Canada, farm cash receipts are down drastically in 1998.  Net 
farm income dropped 55% nationally in 1997 and it is expected to 
be worse in 1999.  It is certainly one of the worst farm income 
crises since the Great Depression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we compare Canada's producer support with other countries we 
should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to figures released by Agriculture Canada, Canada 
ranks second last, with 2% producer support, when compared to 
other OECD nations.  The United States, the European Union, Japan 
and other OECD countries, respectively, have 16%, 49%, 23% and 9% 
support for their farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An emergency debate is required now in order to urge the 
government to address this issue immediately before more farmers 
are forced into bankruptcy.  I believe that all parliamentarians 
do not want to force our producers out of the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate would also give the Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food the opportunity to inform the House about the proposed 
$2 billion package that the government is considering to help 
farmers through this crisis.  Time is of the essence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your careful consideration of this 
very important and extremely urgent matter.

<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I received this request yesterday at 
5.40 p.m. I have considered the request for this emergency debate 
under Standing Order 52 made by the hon. member for South Shore. 
He has explained the general principles of the debate, if it were 
to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concluded that the current crisis in agriculture in this 
country does meet the terms of the standing order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this is Friday, the standing orders would see such a 
debate begin immediately and conclude at 4 p.m. this afternoon.

</I></B></P><P align=left>But I do not think this rather hasty arrangement would do 
justice to the subject, as the hon. member has said in his few 
words, or to the many members who may want to speak on the 
matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have therefore decided to exercise the discretion the standing 
orders afford to the Speaker and to hold over the debate until 
Monday, November 30 at 8.00 p.m.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1998 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK202">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill S-16, an act to 
implement an agreement between Canada and the Socialist Republic 
of Vietnam, an agreement between Canada and the Republic of 
Croatia and a convention between Canada and the Republic of 
Chile, for the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of 
fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on income, be read the third 
time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a 
great opportunity for me to continue my debate.  I will not say I 
was rudely interrupted by question period because I think 
question period is a very important part of the role of 
parliament.  For us to stop and hold the government accountable 
for the things it is doing incorrectly or failing to do is a very 
important.  I wish when such a great speech like mine is 
interrupted by question period that we would also have an answer 
period as well.  But that is for another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was talking about the fact that we have double taxation in 
Canada. We have this wonderful bill, Bill S-16, before us.  It is 
a great bill.  It is long overdue.  It is time we start 
recognizing there is a global economy. We need to not only trade 
with other countries but compete with them. For us to have an 
agreement on taxation will help the businesses from Canada that 
are dealing with these foreign countries and the foreign 
countries will benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly there is an advantage to when Canadians take their 
expertise and investments to other countries.  But there is also 
an advantage to us in the sense that we can help, on the 
international scheme of things, to make these different countries 
financially strong.  This does a couple of things. It helps the 
people in that country.  It gives them goods, services and 
expertise that they would otherwise not have. It helps Canadian 
people and Canadian businesses.  It gives them an outlet for 
their creativity and for their investment dollars.  It is a good 
return but we must make sure the tax regime is good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, I believe in the principle of fair 
international taxation.  Why can we not have that same principle 
enacted in Canada?  We have the statistics.  Over the last five 
years since this Liberal government has been in power the real 
take home value of the average Canadian family has gone down by 
$3,000 a year.  Meanwhile taxes have gone up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance will say we have decreased taxes.  He 
can point to one or two little examples where they have reduced 
the rates marginally.  I commend him for it.  Why should I 
withhold a compliment for the Minister of Finance?  He is worthy 
of so few that when I do find an opportunity I should give it to 
him.  So yes, it has been great that he has taken a few little 
taxes down a bit.  But the big picture shows the opposite. 
Collectively we are paying more taxes than ever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking of thousands of families I am speaking for right 
now, not only farm families in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and 
Alberta, but families in farms, working families, union people, 
all kinds of people right across the country who every month have 
difficulty paying their bills.

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we extract taxes from them at every turn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We take the GST, the HST.  We take the excise tax and the income 
tax.  We take the UIC tax.  It is a tax because by very 
definition money that is extracted from one citizen which goes to 
someone else is a tax.  It is a function that governments in 
Canada have assumed.  Governments believe it is a proper role for 
them to take money from the person who earned it and give it to 
someone who did not earn it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not get me wrong, there are many instances where that is 
good.  It is perfectly fine for us as a society to reach out in 
compassion and care for those who cannot look after themselves. 
That is why I became a Reformer.  I am interested in making sure 
Canada's finances are run in such a way that we can do the things 
we truly value. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make sure we look after those who are ill and cannot 
work.  Let us make sure we look after those who are in dire 
straits.  Let us make sure we have health care for people who 
need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle is sound and it is supported by the majority of 
Canadians.  No Canadian should be denied needed health care 
because of lack of financial resources. I am deeply committed to 
that, notwithstanding the misrepresentations of that belief given 
often by people on the other side.  I am deeply committed to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But what do we have in this country?  We have three levels of 
government, in some instances four, and they tax and they tax and 
they tax on tax.  I gave two illustrations before I was 
interrupted.  One was the illustration of the tax on the tax on 
the tax on gasoline.  The second was property tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has nothing to do with the federal government but I 
sometimes think it would be a good thing for municipalities to 
say that when they have taken taxes from a property that over the 
years accumulate and reach the original value of the property, 
then we have taxed 100% and surely that is good enough. I have 
sometimes thought that might be a limitation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see municipalities, provinces and certainly the 
federal government have some sort of curbs on their relentless 
grabbing of our dollars because Canadians have to work for those 
dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us get up early.  I worked at NATE, the Northern Alberta 
Institute of Technology.  In order to do my work and stay ahead 
of my students and the rapidly changing technical field, I often 
got up at 4 o'clock in the morning so I could get to work.  I 
would work on the equipment before the students arrived so I 
really knew what I was doing so I could act authoritatively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got up at 4 o'clock in the morning and sometimes, in order to 
supplement our income, I would teach night classes.  I used to 
say I work on Tuesday nights for me and on Thursdays for Mr. 
Trudeau because our marginal tax rates are about 50%. We are 
taxed to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught those evening classes because I enjoyed teaching adult 
students who came for night courses.  I had some wonderful 
experiences and great relationships with some of those people. 
But we also needed the money in our family because it was more 
and more difficult to make ends meet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worse now than it has ever been.  We have families whose 
disposable income is down by $3,000 a year since 1993.  The 
government keeps taking it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The example I was using was property tax.  I remember several 
years back when I did a calculation.  I earned $4,000.  Right off 
the top the Government of Canada and the Government of Alberta 
extracted from my earnings let us say 40% as a nominal number. 
The marginal rate is 50% but of course there are some basic 
deductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of my original $4,000, 40% of that is $1,600.  I am now left 
with $2,400 which I deposit in the bank.  Then I take out my 
cheque book, go to the county office and pay my property tax. In 
that year my property tax was $2,400.  So I wrote a cheque for 
$2,400.  Now the municipality can say it only taxed $2,400. But 
the fact is that I had earned $4,000 to pay the $2,400 bills 
because we have taxes on taxes. 
Bill S-16 is right in principle because it says an investor 
should not have to pay income tax in Vietnam, or in Croatia or in 
Chile and then when he brings that money on his investment home 
pay income tax here again.  There is an agreement here that we 
should avoid double taxation. The same thing is true for pension 
funds and other earnings.  This is a very good agreement.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I wish we could apply that principle of avoiding double 
taxation.  Though I have not discussed this with anyone else in 
the party I have talked to other people about it. They think 
perhaps we should have some deductions for Canadian families that 
are struggling.  Perhaps we could have a deduction for interest 
on their mortgages as in the United States.  Perhaps they could 
have a deduction for their property taxes so that they do not 
have to pay their taxes with after tax dollars and avoid that 
double taxation. This is an urgent need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have before us a bill which goes in the right direction on an 
international agreement.  It is correct in principle and I 
support the bill.  I presume most of my colleagues will vote in 
favour of it when vote time comes.  Meanwhile the principle we 
are dealing with here is very important.  We need to start 
applying it to Canadians who earn money in Canada. Let us stop 
taxing them to death. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sometimes think Canadian taxpayers, and I am one of them, feel 
like 500 pound governments are using us as a trampoline.  Of 
course I would be rather bouncy and it would work not too bad but 
there are a lot of other people who would not be able to take the 
crush.  We have right now thousands of families really struggling 
to pay their bills yet the taxman is relentless in his demands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a little off topic, but I am being given parliamentary 
immunity from relevance right now since everyone is very 
tolerant.  I appreciate that.  I need to say something about 
government policy in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a government making a policy.  But it just happens 
to be true that the area in which I live and which I represent is 
suffering immensely these days from long term, wrong headed 
policies of the federal government.  I am speaking about the 
government's policies on agriculture.  With its monopoly in the 
wheat board we have guaranteed to farmers almost consistently the 
lowest price is the law instead of the highest price. 
International buyers wait until the Canadian Wheat Board 
announces its floor price and then that is the price they offer 
and it becomes the price.  It is absolutely crazy the way it does 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of holding out for a good price the Canadian Wheat Board 
claims its only obligation is to sell the farmers' wheat. It is 
not accepting its responsibility to sell the wheat at a 
reasonable price and perhaps to withhold it when it is being sold 
at a loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead the farmers are forced by legislation to give their 
wheat to the wheat board whether they want to or not.  They 
cannot find another market for it.  It is against the law, unless 
they happen to live in Ontario or Quebec.  Then they do not have 
to.  They are free of the wheat board. But in western Canada 
where farmers are suffering so much that is one of the factors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other factor of course is taxation.  I spoke to a number of 
farmers in the last couple of weeks over this issue.  They are 
saying taxes on taxes on taxes.  I had one farmer this week say 
to me “When I make a deposit into my NISA account in order to 
spread off my income in years of loss, why does the government 
take taxes off that?  Why is that deduction not tax deductible?” 
It should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the finance minister and the agriculture minister start 
waking up on policy needed in Canada right now.  If we would 
provide these farmers with a tax regime and a system of selling 
their grain at a reasonable market price, at least something 
above cost, whether it is grain, animals or whatever, then we 
could survive internationally. We could compete with the best of 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to start applying the principles domestically 
that it is using in Bill S-16 and recognize that it is 20 years 
of bone headed Conservative and Liberal policies with respect to 
agriculture that have brought us to the place where now we are on 
our knees begging and pleading for disaster relief.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a manmade disaster.  It could have been avoided.  The 
crops in western Canada were generally not that bad this year. 
There were areas where they were not good.  It is despicable in a 
year when a farmer has a good crop that he still cannot make it. 
He might as well get out of the business and that is what is 
happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was in farming a number of years ago we took some animals 
to the market one day and came back with more than we went with. 
The animals did not sell at the auction.  When we went to take 
the truck back home, somebody had thrown a few calves into our 
truck. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We went there with six calves to sell and came back with eight 
because the farmer could not afford to keep them.  He figured I 
would take them.  Of course I could not bring myself to kill 
these young calves. We kept and fed them.  I used my mate's 
income to subsidize the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was 15 years ago but those policies are still in place. 
While the Liberal government comes out with good things in Bill 
S-16 now and then, every time it has a good principle it applies 
it in only a narrow fashion.  I ask the Liberals simply to 
consider applying those same principles to Canadian businesses, 
to Canadian families, to Canadian farmers.  Let us get the 
country up and strong like it should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is not a country in the world that has the wealth we have. 
If everything is added together such as our natural resources, 
our agricultural capabilities, our manufacturing capabilities, 
our mines, minerals and resources, what a wonderful country to 
travel to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is a safe country.  People here are not generally worried 
about crime because Canadians care for each other.  We do not go 
around beating each other on the head. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an excellent industry of tourism.  We have a vigorous 
population.  No one can live at this longitude and not be 
vigorous.  Winter comes every year.  We are good, hardworking and 
dedicated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am typical of Canadians who get up at 4 a.m. and do a job. 
When I grew up on the farm, my dad used to say the Lord put the 
sun in the sky as a light for us to work and it is wrong for us 
to waste it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summer when the sun came up in Saskatchewan at 5 a.m., we 
were out in the fields.  That is what the light was there for. We 
worked hard.  It is a shame that government policies over the 
years have basically stolen from us what we have worked so hard 
to earn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the family farm where I grew up.  What a shame 
government policies put the continued ownership of that family 
farm at risk because the government cannot get it right. The 
government had better start getting it right.  We will have a 
good debate Monday on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people get on a roll they see things clearly. I commend the 
government for what it is doing in Bill S-16.  I hope it spends 
this weekend studying.  I used to say to my students on Fridays 
“There are no classes tomorrow.  Sunday is the day of rest.  You 
can go home and study”.  I hope the Liberals study this bill on 
the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill will probably come to conclusion and pass today.  It 
has some good principles on taxation.  I hope the members go home 
and study it tomorrow.  I would like not just every Liberal in 
the House but every Liberal in the country to go home and 
contemplate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow morning when they wake up contemplate how they are 
killing the country with excessive taxation and with bone headed 
government policies.  Let them fix it.  Let them serve Canadians 
like they say they are serving them.  Let us see them do 
something tangible for farmers as they are doing for investors 
with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I drifted far from Bill S-16 on occasion but have always kept it 
as my goal in the distance.  I have always come back to it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois does not oppose treaties between Canada and 
other countries insofar as they ensure fair and equitable tax 
treatment for persons and encourage trade and investment between 
countries.  I would mention that the term “person” includes 
physical persons, corporations, trusts and all other groups of 
persons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the tax rate in the countries concerned in this bill is 
similar to Canada's, I will not oppose the bill.  However, I do 
want to take the time accorded me to speak in this context of 
tax conventions in effect between Canada and certain other 
countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the tax conventions do avoid double taxation of 
corporations and individuals, they are in many cases the source 
of problems, and they encourage tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Great care must therefore be taken to ensure that these treaties 
do not open the door to excessive tax evasion.  They must 
therefore be restricted to countries with tax rates comparable 
to Canada's. While the tax conventions do avoid double taxation 
of individuals, as defined earlier, they are in some cases the 
source of problems, and they encourage tax evasion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the most recent treaties, which take their inspiration 
from OECD models, are relatively standard, Canada does have some 
older tax conventions with countries known as tax havens because 
they have low or no taxes on the incomes of individuals and 
corporations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the tax treaty between Canada and these so-called tax 
havens, the Canadian taxation system closes its eyes to these 
amounts, treating them as if they had already been taxed at a 
comparable rate elsewhere, and not taxing them when they are 
brought back into Canada. 
Let us bear in mind that the auditor general has raised this 
matter on a number of occasions since 1992.  I could also point 
out many cases to the government, but that would be like talking 
to a brick wall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another danger to certain tax treaties, the ability to 
change Canadian tax rules to suit the friends of those in power, 
or those in power themselves.  I am referring here to Bill C-28. 
The Minister of Finance is in a clear conflict of interest in 
this case because, if the bill is passed, it will mean millions 
of dollars for Canada Steamship Lines, a scandalous trick 
discovered by my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would remind you that all opposition parties supported the 
Bloc in this CSL business.  The minister ought to defend the 
interests of the Canadian taxpayer as staunchly as he defends 
his own.  Tax treaties and manipulation of the law cost our 
taxpayers billions of dollars. 
Those billions are lost to us, and the public suffers as a 
result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be done instead is for a serious and responsible 
government to devote considerable resources to assessing, 
adjusting and renegotiating problematical tax treaties, 
particularly those with countries that represent the greatest 
risk to Canada as far as loss of taxation income is concerned.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have here is a government turning a blind eye to the 
potential exodus of hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid 
taxes. What we also have is a government that probably spends 
more money on a one-week visit by the Queen of England than it 
spends in a whole year on enforcing and improving tax 
conventions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a serious issue because it undermines the overall 
integrity of our tax system. It also makes Canada look like a 
country where wealth means bigger loopholes. It is very 
troublesome. 
And given the billions of dollars the Minister of Finance has 
cut in transfers to the provinces for hospitals, schools and 
social assistance, honest citizens who pay their taxes to Canada 
want  their government to at least ensure that everyone pays his 
fair share.  It is not such a lot to ask, but it seems to be too 
much for this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I recognize that tax conventions have the 
advantage of preventing double taxation of the operating revenue 
of companies in two countries with branches or dependent 
companies in one country or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another advantage is that, in some cases, tax conventions apply 
to travel by Quebec and Canadian artists who perform abroad, or 
even to travel by those involved in sports, such as hockey 
players and other athletes.  On the other hand, we know that tax 
agreements are nothing new. 
They have always existed and will always exist, and will even

insofar as Canada's corporate tax rates and those of the 
countries with which Canada signed these agreements are 
equivalent or comparable.

agreements signed between Canada and other countries when these 
treaties are aimed at ensuring fair and equitable taxation of 
residents and non-residents, and encouraging trade and 
investments between countries.  But make no mistake, these 
treaties should not open the door to excessive tax evasion.

pleased to have the opportunity today to respond, on behalf of 
the Progressive Conservative Party, to Bill S-16 which will allow 
Canada to ratify tax conventions and tax treaties with Croatia, 
Chile and Vietnam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, as everyone is aware, is a trading nation.  Last year 
our exports totalled some $344 billion.  Our imports were up 
around $329 billion.  That gives us some indication of how 
important trading is to Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the majority of our trade has traditionally involved the 
United States, we do have trade and we do have investment 
treaties and ties with virtually every nation on the face of the 
earth, including the countries mentioned in the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, it is vital that trade and investment be promoted and 
carried out with the maximum degree of certainty that we can 
possibly have both for us and for our partners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last quarter century Canada has sought to expand on a 
number of tax agreements it has with other nations, especially 
with the countries mentioned in the bill. 
That has been the policy, as we are all very much aware, of both 
Liberal and Conservative administrations.  We have now reached a 
point where we have 70 such agreements in place.  That is pretty 
impressive.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Such tax treaties have two main goals.  They sort out who has 
the right to collect which amount of tax when a business or 
person residing in one country earns money in another country. 
They also ensure that taxes that are paid in one country are 
recognized by the other country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One knows, for example, what withholding tax to expect on income 
that one takes out of that country.  As a result, one can invest 
and earn income in the secure knowledge that the foreign country 
will not make it impossible for one to bring home one's profits 
by imposing new and unexpected withholding taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result is that business and individual investors can pretty 
well feel secure that they can invest internationally with 
confidence and that they will not have their profits withheld. 
That is an important economic objective, whether it be through 
treaties such as these or through trade agreements such as NAFTA, 
the World Trade Organization or the proposed free trade agreement 
of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such treaties prevent tax evasion.  They allow the free flow of 
information and encourage communication between individual 
countries that is needed to catch individuals and corporations 
that are evading tax.  This is a result, I am sure we could all 
agree, everyone would be in favour of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Kings—Hants, the finance critic for the 
Progressive Conservative Party, knows full well the benefits of 
international trade.  They are well known to all members of the 
Conservative Party.  It was the PC government, incidentally, that 
designed the the North America Free Trade Agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party also liberalized trade in telecommunications for 
Canadian business.  The Liberals who were in opposition at that 
time were opposed outright to the notion of opening up Canada to 
the rest of the world.  Now we are all aware they have had a 
great conversion.  They have seen the light.  They are quite 
pleased to associate themselves with the North America Free Trade 
Agreement.  Very often the Prime Minister uses every opportunity, 
whether at home or abroad, to promote that agreement.  Just 
recently we saw the Prime Minister actually take credit for 
negotiating the free trade agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On numerous occasions our finance critic has risen in the House 
to remind the government and the Prime Minister that the Liberals 
are born again free traders.  Now that it has become fashionable, 
the Prime Minister and his government cannot get enough of 
international trade and discuss it at every opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party was the party that took the initiative when issues 
such as free trade were not fashionable because we knew that it 
was in the best interest of Canada.  Also the PC Party was the 
party that let Atlantic Canada prosper under more liberalized 
trade both within Canada and other nations around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Free trade has created a prosperous economy and has created 
thousands and thousands of jobs in Atlantic Canada for which the 
Minister of Finance is currently taking credit as he did in the 
House yesterday.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-402, an act to amend the Indian Act (obligations of landlords 
and tenants on reserve land), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan—Coquihalla to debate Bill C-402, an act to amend the 
Indian Act (obligations of landlords and tenants on reserve 
land).  The bill is a direct result of a serious incident that 
occurred in my constituency last fall, and it has implications 
for all Canadians in every province and territory in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In November 1997, 51 families from the Driftwood Mobile Home 
Park just outside Penticton, British Columbia, were evicted from 
their homes through no fault of their own.  Health Canada deemed 
the sewage treatment facilities there to be totally inadequate. 
No one at the federal or provincial level had been inspecting the 
sewage treatment plant to ensure it met provincial or national 
health and safety guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make matters worse, my constituents were not protected by 
British Columbia's residential tenancy act.  The act declares 
that the landlord is responsible for maintaining the building and 
property of rental facilities to provincial and safety standards 
and must oversee repairs of serious problems.  One might ask why 
my constituents were not protected.  It was because they were 
renting property on Indian land.  The residents, many of whom had 
lived in Driftwood Mobile Home Park for years, fell into this 
grey area of the law.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us put a face to these people, these 51 families who were 
evicted from their homes in November.  Who were these people? 
Many of them were senior citizens.  Many of them were low income 
families, single income families.  They had scrimped and saved to 
realize the dream which most Canadians hold of owning their own 
home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nobody at the provincial level had been inspecting the septic 
system of the mobile home park because provincial legislation, in 
this case the B.C. residential tenancy act, does not apply to 
residential tenancies on Indian reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the victims of the mobile home park, the hon. 
Michael Farnworth, B.C. minister of municipal affairs and 
housing, wrote to me stating unequivocally: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with profound regret that I see tenants facing eviction 
under these conditions, however the entire tenancy responsibility 
on federally owned land lies with the federal government.  It is 
apparent that there is a serious federal legislative and policy 
vacuum in this area, resulting in crippling impacts on 
individuals and families who are tenants of federal lands in this 
province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the first time this has happened.  Other incidents 
involving tenants renting on federal Indian land have ended up in 
the Supreme Court of Canada.  In almost every case the supreme 
court has ruled that provincial legislation does not apply to 
residential tenancies on reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These rulings reinforced that parliament, this House, has 
exclusive power to legislate with respect to such tenancies. 
Despite that there is still a legislative vacuum which needs to 
be filled.  That is what I am attempting to do with Bill C-402. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the federal government is responsible for tenants on 
federal land, Health Canada's health services branch, which is 
responsible for approving septic field installations and repairs 
on Indian reservations, claimed that it was never informed of the 
Driftwood septic installation some 10 years ago or those of other 
mobile home parks in my constituency.  Therefore no action by the 
federal government was taken to prevent what turned into a 
disaster for those 51 families in my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every Canadian believes that no matter what happens he or she 
can turn to the courts for redress of grievance.  This was not 
the case for my constituents.  There was no federal law to 
protect them.  They fell through the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the effect of that happening to these people?  Due to 
years of neglect, raw sewage started to seep up through the 
ground of these people's homes.  Many were forced to literally 
walk away from their lifetime investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 9, 1997, in an effort to protect my constituents' 
homes, I tried to pull together the interested parties by 
organizing a meeting with the federal minister of Indian affairs; 
the mayor of Penticton, Beth Campbell; the local MLA, Rick 
Thorpe; and the chief of the Penticton Indian Band, Chief Stewart 
Phillip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all those people and in particular the minister 
of Indian affairs because she was willing to meet with these 
people.  In spite of the best efforts of all parties involved a 
comprehensive solution was not reached.  In November 1997 after 
only 30 days notice my constituents walked away from their homes 
after they were evicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They could not move their homes.  Some of the mobile homes were 
quite old.  Some of them can be seen sitting right there today. 
They have been destroyed, mainly through vandalism.  Some people 
in the area even offered them 10 cents on the dollar for their 
investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of these people literally walked away.  They had nowhere to 
go.  They could not move their homes.  There were no vacancies in 
any other mobile home parks for them to move them to if they 
could come up with the money required to do that. One family 
literally walked away from their home after Health Canada advised 
them to keep their dog in the house and to boil their shoes. 
Imagine being told to boil their shoes after walking in their own 
yard.  That is what happened to these people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This incident brought to my attention the danger thousands of 
Canadians face who rent land on federal Indian reserve lands. 
While my constituents faced the tragedy of being evicted from 
their homes, luckily no lives were lost.  However, the tragedy 
could have been much bigger if the inadequate sewage facilities 
had led to an outbreak of disease.  This is not just a one time 
local problem. There are many other mobile home parks in my 
riding that could end up with the same fate.  I would venture a 
guess that there are probably many right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other Canadians on reserve lands could also lose their home 
faced with this situation.  What is needed is effective federal 
legislation to ensure that the federal legislative vacuum is 
filled so that no other Canadians are crippled by this or any 
other similar incident.  This is the point of Bill C-402. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-402 is designed to prevent future Driftwood mobile home 
parks from happening again by making existing provincial tenancy 
legislation apply to leases granted by the crown. Both the crown 
and the sublessor or the locatee will be subject to provincial 
authorities that enforce the obligations of landlords and 
tenants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, as already mentioned, the B.C. residential tenancy 
act ensures that a landlord must maintain land or residential 
premises in compliance with health, safety and housing standards 
set out by law.  The crown and the sublessor will be responsible 
for meeting provincial standards set out by the various 
provincial residential tenancy acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people had paid their rent to put their mobile home on a 
pad in a park.  They were paying rent in good faith for years and 
the locatee or the sublessor was not spending that money or a 
percentage of that money on the upgrading and care of the 
property.  The crown definitely has a responsibility because the 
crown was one of the signators of the lease. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-402 is a simple non-partisan amendment to the Indian Act 
that would prevent future generations of Canadians from facing 
the tragedy faced by my constituents in November 1997.  This is 
extremely important.  With more economic development happening 
right now on reserve lands across the country, we need a 
solution.  It is required now more than ever before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Driftwood it took 10 years for the problem to 
surface.  Bill C-402 is the answer for future developments on 
Indian lands.  It would protect residential tenants on reserve 
land by making provincial tenancy legislation apply in any 
province. It would mean that in new developments on reserve land 
involving tenants, provincial health and safety standards would 
have to be followed.  Tenants would be protected from arbitrary 
evictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Normally in the course of a speech I would be asking at this 
time for support of my legislation in the House.  Unfortunately 
any support I receive today from the House would be an empty 
endorsement.  This is no fault of the vast majority of the 
members of the House but rather an indictment on our 
parliamentary system.  Our parliamentary system is set up to 
ensure that no private member in the House, no matter from which 
party, is able to pass legislation. Standing Order 92(1) states 
that no more than five private members' bills and five private 
members' motions may be designated votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find this rule ridiculous as do my peers from both sides of 
the House.  Every member of parliament has a sound knowledge of 
the important issues in their constituencies, issues that require 
federal legislation to be resolved.  These are issues that the 
Liberals consider small or insignificant in the big picture or 
the scheme of things.  The Liberals should always keep in mind 
that all politics is local and this issue is very important for 
not only constituents in my riding but constituents right across 
the country in every riding. 
Ministers and departments only see the big picture and ignore the 
unresolved smaller issues.  They have the power to bring in 
sweeping legislation that is always votable. Yet for members of 
parliament bringing in a private member's bill is the only way we 
can change federal legislation for the better.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that Bill C-402 is only a paragraph or two in 
length, it took hours of consultation.  Speaking with 
constituents, speaking with experts in the field of Indian 
affairs and the Indian Act and legal counsel in the House of 
Commons, it took literally hours to come up with the solution we 
have brought forward in Bill C-402. And that was the easy part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the bill is finally drawn up the member of parliament is 
forced to wait until his or her bill is drawn in a lottery 
system.  The merit of this piece of legislation is of no 
importance whatsoever.  If you are one of the lucky ones to make 
it through the House lottery then you must convince the Liberal 
dominated committee that your private member's bill is worthy of 
being voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately for Canadians who rent on Indian reserve land, the 
subcommittee determined that Bill C-402 would not be votable.  In 
fact, about 20 of my colleagues in the House made presentations 
to the subcommittee at the same time I did.  All were refused the 
status of being votable except for one private member's bill 
introduced by an unelected, unaccountable senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way private members' bills and business have been treated in 
the House is absolutely scandalous, and this occurs every single 
day.  This deplorable state of affairs must end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding there is a great deal of economic development on 
reserve land and therefore Bill C-402 is very pertinent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we are asking in Bill C-402 is that the same protection be 
afforded to renters right across the country regardless of living 
on Indian reserve land or non-reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-402 is an important piece of legislation drafted to 
protect Canadians.  If passed, it would ensure that those who 
rent on Indian land are protected by provincial landlord and 
tenant legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has not made this a partisan issue, nor should he 
have. We thank him for that.

with the very real needs of his constituents which he has 
properly identified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation at the Driftwood mobile home park in Penticton was 
extremely unfortunate.  No one can feel anything other than great 
disappointment that the situation ended the way it did. Certainly 
no one wants to see these unfortunate incidents repeated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with the hon. member, the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development was personally involved in trying to bring 
all the relevant parties together in the hope of resolving that 
situation.  Unfortunately these efforts were not successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I do not support the bill for reasons which I will explain 
in a moment, I do share its ultimate goal to improve landlord and 
tenant relationships on reserves in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe the bill is the best way to achieve that goal. 
Sometimes in trying to remedy the particular circumstances of a 
legitimate and specific situation, our efforts lead to solutions 
that do not lend themselves to general application across Canada, 
in this case for all reserves.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In our haste to right a wrong we lose sight of the wider issues 
and broader concerns that involve all Canadians and all first 
nations. I believe this is the case with this proposed 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me focus on three major concerns I have with Bill C-402.  It 
is too limited in scope.  While it does address some of the 
issues concerning leases, it does not address the numerous other 
kinds of residential leases that presumably deserve the same kind 
of protections and certainty intended by the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we proceed with this legislation we create two classes of 
leasehold interests on reserves, those which fall under 
provincial legislation and those which do not.  This may be an 
unintended consequence but it is also an unacceptable result and 
cannot be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the bill would bring confusion, not clarity, to the 
issue of landlord and tenant relations on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third and most important, I have grave concerns about the 
process of addressing landlord and tenant relations on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation offers one solution, to bring the reserve under 
the relevant residential tenancy legislation of the province in 
which it is located. But there has been no consultation with 
first nations to see if this is their preferred option. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It returns us to the old paternalistic approach of Ottawa knows 
best.  It attempts to substitute our judgment for that of first 
nations.  It attempts to alter the relationship between first 
nations and provincial governments without consulting those 
governments as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In “Gathering Strength”, the government's response to the the 
royal commission on aboriginal peoples, we made it clear we were 
not prepared to return to the ways of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We said we had learned from our past mistakes and we were 
determined not to repeat them.  Instead we wanted to develop a 
new partnership with first nations based on mutual trust, respect 
and consultation. This legislation fails that very important 
test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite apart from the commitments made in “Gathering Strength” 
for greater consultation the federal government has a legal 
fiduciary duty to consult first nations on any significant 
changes which might affect them. This legislation also fails that 
important test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of determining the appropriate laws to govern landlord 
and tenant relations is at its core an issue of governance.  In 
“Gathering Strength” the government pledged to work with first 
nations to promote self-governance and this legislation again 
unfortunately fails that test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned this legislation prejudges the outcome of 
several processes currently underway, processes which I believe 
should be allowed to run their course unencumbered by 
interference from Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member knows, the Indian taxation advisory board which 
has an excellent record and is highly respected for its mediation 
of sensitive first nation issues is overseeing a consultation 
process on this issue in British Columbia involving the province, 
first nations representatives, park operators, tenant 
representatives and officials from the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development. The first workshop was held a 
little over a year ago and another is scheduled to take place 
over the upcoming months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also discussions concerning the development of land 
regimes under self-government proposals and the proposed first 
nations land management act, Bill C-49, currently being debated 
in this House.  These discussions may well deal with some of the 
points in Bill C-402. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A whole range of issues dealing with land management is 
currently the subject of consultations involving my department 
and the assembly of first nations and Bill C-402 pre-empts a 
potentially important aspect of those discussions as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know what proposals will emerge from these various 
consultations.  It may be that a recommendation will come forward 
that band bylaws dealing with residential premises are the best 
way to deal with landlord-tenant issues.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what “Gathering Strength” is all about.  That is what 
promoting self-government is all about.  It is not about Ottawa 
rushing in to fix all the problems and to provide all the 
answers. It is about working with first nations and other parties 
to seek honest answers and make honourable, reasonable 
concessions.  In short, it is about partnerships, not 
paternalism; co-operation, not control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all of these reasons I respectfully oppose Bill C-402.  Let 
me say again how much I appreciate the initiative of the hon. 
member for Okanagan—Coquihalla.  While we may disagree on this 
particular approach, I know that we share the same concerns and 
seek similar objectives and goals.  I look forward to continuing 
to work with the hon. member and others in a spirit of 
co-operation, collaboration and consultation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
request of my colleague, the Bloc Quebecois critic for 
aboriginal affairs, I am pleased to rise today to speak to 
private members' Bill C-402, an act to amend the Indian Act, 
introduced by the Reform member for Okanagan—Coquihalla. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill concerns specifically the obligations of landlords and 
tenants on reserve land.  Its aim is to protect individuals 
renting residential premises on Indian land by extending the 
application of provincial landlord and tenant legislation to 
leases on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the bill, native landlords and tenants living in one of 
the ten provinces of Canada would be governed by provincial 
legislation rather than the Indian Act.  Bill C-402 adds a 
provision to the Indian Act at section 88, and it reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>88.1 Notwithstanding this Act, provincial laws relating to the 
rights and obligations of landlords and tenants apply to a lease 
for residential purposes of land or a dwelling unit on land in a 
reserve that is granted 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) by an Indian or any other person acting as sub-lessor under a 
lease from the Minister under subsection 58(3); or 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) by the Minister acting as lessor under subsection 58(3). 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Admittedly, the obligations between landlords and tenants are 
not clearly defined in the Indian Act as it now stands, whether 
the landlord is the crown, a company or a sub-lessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For their part, provincial laws give a very narrow definition of 
the contract between the two parties, the tenant and the owner 
or landlord of a building.  For instance, provincial laws 
determine the responsibilities of owners and tenants with 
respect to maintenance, safety and cleanliness of rental 
accommodation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec's rental commission legislation gives a clear edge to 
tenants.  In Quebec, tenants are often said to have more rights 
than owners.  Although this could do with some clarification, it 
is nonetheless indicative of a certain state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for this bill, it can only give more rights and protection to 
aboriginal tenants living on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understood correctly, the member introduced this bill in 
the House because of the experience of a community in his 
riding, the native community of Penticton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 51 families living in mobile homes on this reserve in 
the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia.  In the summer of 1997, 
they found themselves with a septic tank problem that quickly 
deteriorated into a serious crisis for almost 100 people living 
on the reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government, through Health Canada, ordered people to 
leave their homes before October 31, 1997.  This eviction notice 
was sent to the residents of Penticton 30 days before the date 
they were being ordered to leave. 
As one resident put it, people found themselves all but homeless 
overnight. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some found themselves in real financial difficulty, because they 
had invested a lot of money in their homes.  Some mentioned 
investments of $35,000.  Others said it cost them some $10,000 
to move and relocate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, for the natives who could absorb this cost, there 
was nowhere to go in the region.  Whatever the cost, moving 
costs even more when you live on a reserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government and the Department of Indian Affairs remained 
silent in the face of the distress caused these people, who were 
appalled by the government's lack of action.  They thought the 
Department of Indian Affairs, the city and the band council 
would fix the problem of the septic tank. 
However, as the problem was serious and would have entailed 
expenditures estimated at $22,000, they preferred to solve it by 
evicting the residents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, if these residents had come under B.C. housing 
legislation as it concerned the obligations of landlords and 
tenants, they would not have been evicted so quickly or they 
would not have been evicted at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both parties would have had to do a lot, especially the owner or 
landlord, before such a massive eviction could take place. 
Under provincial law, including that of Quebec, an owner or a 
landlord must ensure that all his rental units meet cleanliness 
and safety standards. 
In this case, the lessor was shamefully in breach of contract. 
This bill is, therefore, a response to a real problem recently 
experienced by an aboriginal community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc Quebecois, Bill C-402 does not appear to be a 
problem in that it provides protection to lessees and lessors on 
the reserve by defining more clearly the obligations and 
commitments of both parties.  However, considering that the 
Indian Act is an obsolete piece of legislation, one which could 
do with a thorough review, we question the appropriateness of 
adding any more modern clauses, such as those the House is being 
asked to add today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be more appropriate to undertake a thorough review 
of this act, in order to give it a better fit with the 
aboriginal reality nowadays, as this century comes to a close? 
The Indian Act goes back to the last century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members will agree with me that many changes have taken 
place on the reserves and in the lives of aboriginal people 
since that time.  It is imperative that these be reflected in 
the legislation, so that the aboriginal nations may find some 
balance, in their social and economic development in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill therefore raises a more complex problem than just 
these few clauses concerning the relationship between lessors 
and lessees, even though we agree that relationship does need to 
be made far clearer.  Now that the issue has been raised, it 
needs to be looked into thoroughly, and discussed with the 
Indian affairs minister and her staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill strikes us as very timely and must serve as the 
starting point for a true debate among the parties involved in 
this area. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it gives me great pleasure to rise today to discuss an issue that 
is overall a very crucial issue at this time in Canada's history 
with respect to our relationship with aboriginal people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pick up on a statement made by the hon. member who 
moved this motion.  He said “all politics are local”.  In his 
statements dealing with Bill C-402 he referred to hours and hours 
of work in preparing this consultation with Indian affairs 
officials and Indian Act experts.  However, I beg to hear from 
him whether there were any consultations with first nations 
people.  Were there consultations with the first nations people 
of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When one is dealing with this act, it is of national scope.  It 
goes from coast to coast to coast.  If there is a local issue 
which is impacting on the national perspective, it is time to 
open the books and look at a major overhaul of an act that may be 
archaic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for the Bloc mentioned, I believe the royal 
commission on Canada's aboriginal peoples tried to address the 
need to modernize our relationship with aboriginal peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I would have to say that I am opposed to the bill, 
but would welcome a new dialogue for us to start a new 
relationship with the first nations of this country.  They are 
waiting for this.  They have been calling on the government and 
on all Canadians for this dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must highlight the fact that a nation to nation treaty was 
written with Canada's aboriginal nations.  It was not the first 
nations which allowed anybody to take hold of this land for 
whatever reason. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1325"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1325

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the treaty was written it was in the context of the British 
nation on behalf of the crown seeking to use and occupy lands to 
build a new nation, but the first nations held obligations to the 
federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial jurisdiction is very suspect when it comes to first 
nations people because the fiduciary responsibilities fall under 
the nation to nation treaty with the federal government.  The 
hon. member is on the right track in asking the House to change 
these laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission also considered creating a provincial 
jurisdiction across this nation, a chequerboard province of all 
first nations, so that they could govern themselves.  There could 
have been a model for self-governance.  This is something that 
was not brought out in the recommendations, but the dialogue was 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, territorial governments have not been taken into 
account.  Nunavut will be created on April 1, 1999.  The 
Northwest Territories will reissue itself and reorganize its 
governance, as will Yukon.  Someday these territories might have 
full provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the present landlord and tenant issues concerning the 
territories?  I believe they fall with the northern affairs 
minister.  I beg to see some response to that in the northern 
jurisdictions because we have to look at this as a national 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A major change happened recently with Bill C-49.  Fourteen first 
nations were included, in a very consultative manner, to deal 
with land management.  However, the bill did not consider the 
issue of residential, agricultural or business leases in these 
first nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First nations governments are saying that they should be able to 
address tribunals, that they should have a means for dealing with 
and appealing decisions on jurisdictional issues, such as a 
business jurisdiction being changed to residential, especially 
for the people who presently hold leases.  This whole topic opens 
up a major concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this time I have to tell the hon. member that I cannot 
support his motion, although I acknowledge that the House of 
Commons needs to address the Indian Act in consultation with all 
first nations of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new millennium would be a fine opportunity for us to provide 
a good example to the world.  There is a human rights conference 
being celebrated right now in Edmonton.  A lot of aboriginal 
people feel that their human rights have been infringed through 
the development of this country, with respect to land use and 
their education, cultural and spiritual life.  All of these 
things have infringed on their way of life.  Let us address these 
issues in an open way, with open and respectful dialogue.  Then 
we can build a nation that will be good for our children and for 
future generations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to draw a few references from the remarks of the member for 
Churchill River.  Unfortunately, I was not able to hear his whole 
discussion, but what I did hear I thought was very well put forth 
and very well thought out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think he could have used a little more emphasis on the 
benefits that can be derived from the protection of both the land 
owners, in this case the first nations, and the lessors of first 
nation lands.  Bill C-49, which the member referred to, deals 
with this issue in a very positive manner.  If we did not have 
Bill C-49, then maybe some type of legislation like this would be 
required.  Unfortunately, this would be inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot willy-nilly and easily change the Indian Act.  This is 
a long, drawn out process that would take the support of all 
members of parliament.  Certainly I do not see that support, nor 
do I believe that most members of parliament see that support.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I speak to Private Member's Bill C-402, an act to amend 
the Indian Act, and specifically the obligations of landlords and 
tenants on reserve land. This bill seeks to have provincial 
landlord and tenant laws applied to leases on reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone in the House is aware, reserve land is a federal 
responsibility.  As such, provincial laws currently do not apply 
on reserve and I would dare to say they will not apply on reserve 
in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a complex issue.  It is not an easy thing to change. We 
simply cannot give provincial laws jurisdiction where there is 
already federal jurisdiction and we do not have a willingness on 
the behalf of the land owners, in this case the first nation and 
the Government of Canada, to grant that jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act sets out provisions relating to reserve land. 
Aboriginal people do not own land on reserve, unless the band 
council with the approval of the minister allots it to that 
individual, usually through a certificate of possession.  Anyone 
with a certificate of possession may lease or sell land, subject 
to restrictions such as approval of the minister.  All lands 
remain reserve lands under the Indian Act unless they have been 
surrendered conditionally or unconditionally to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To lease land on reserve the first nation must surrender the 
land to the minister for the purpose of being leased.  To sell 
land it must be absolutely surrendered to the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to go back to leased land on reserve.  The first nation 
must surrender the land to the minister for the purpose of being 
leased.  It is obvious that the jurisdiction and the 
responsibility and control is in the hands of the minister of the 
day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-402 would provide the ability for provincial landlord and 
tenant laws to apply on reserve.  Provincial laws may include the 
following provisions:  the right to limit rent increases; the 
right to establish rules for terminating the lease, for example, 
evictions cannot occur without notice and reason; the obligation 
to meet certain standards of cleanliness and damage repair. That 
sounds right and most reasonable thinking people would ask why we 
cannot do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, it gets back to jurisdiction, and it gets back to the way 
we run the country.  I am not saying that is correct, but I am 
saying that we cannot change it in the short term.  In the long 
term with a lot of research and due diligence and study on 
everyone's part and the ability to sit down and discuss this 
perhaps, and certainly I for one would support anything that 
brings the first nations out from under the aegis of the Indian 
Act.  It is an archaic piece of legislation; in the long term it 
is harmful and in the short term I would say it is 
discriminatory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to explain some of the reasons this piece of 
legislation in my opinion will not work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are imposing regulations on first nations.  This is a step 
away from self-reliance for first nations.  It is a step away 
from responsibility for first nations.  It is a step away from 
self-government which all parties in the House have proposed to 
support. There is some discussion on what self-government is, but 
that is not in here.  We are discussing something else 
altogether, a bill to impose provincial laws where there is 
federal jurisdiction. This changes one small segment of the 
Indian Act instead of removing the paternalistic and onerous 
obligations required by an act that was flawed from its 
inception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the PC Party has always supported increasing first 
nations self-reliance and self-government, concepts that require 
first nations to assume control and responsibility of resources, 
land and administration.  That sounds like leases of property to 
me.  The bill before us contradicts that goal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act states that the first nations land is clearly 
under federal jurisdiction, so provincial rules have no authority 
on the first nations land if they contradict the Indian Act.  One 
assumes that the first nations negotiated in good faith and 
continue to negotiate in good faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since some first nations rely heavily on income derived from 
leased land, they must ensure rents are set at levels that ensure 
optimal use of that property. Under the Indian Act the first 
nation may lease land with the permission of the minister by 
surrendering or designating such land.  This prevents first 
nations from optimizing economic development opportunities since 
the process can be time consuming. 
As well, this already ensures that some protection is available 
for tenants on first nation land since leases must receive 
federal approval.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I do not support Bill C-402, I see that there is a 
problem between landlords and tenants in relation to first 
nations land.  However, that does not take away from the fact 
that first nations people need to be responsible for first 
nations land.  At the end of the day we must recognize that they 
own first nations land.  It is fine for them to decide they want 
to continue a lease for economic gain or opportunity.  It is also 
fine for them to decide to discontinue a lease which they have 
the legal right to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately provincial laws do not apply because it is within 
federal jurisdiction.  It is a simple concept although some 
members have difficulty wrapping their heads around it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support making changes to the Indian Act.  However this change 
already exists under Bill C-49.  If it passes third reading and 
the bill gets through the House there will be provisions 
available for tenants and landlords to deal with one another. 
That is the way to do this in a democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there may be some sympathy with the member and for the 
lessors involved, they did sign a binding contract with the first 
nations. They are responsible not only for their own investments 
but they are also responsible with the first nations. There is a 
binding contract.  We have to give first nations responsibility. 
At the end of the day we may not be happy with every single thing 
that is done, and the first nations may not be happy, but in a 
democracy the first nations have the right to be masters in their 
own home.  It is as simple as that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to Private Member's Bill C-402. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will amend the Indian Act to provide protection for 
individuals renting residential premises on Indian land by making 
provincial landlord and tenant legislation apply to those leases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impetus for this bill came from an incident in the 
Okanagan—Coquihalla riding in British Columbia.  Although I am 
not a resident of this riding or of the province, I feel the 
implications of this incident are important to Canadians 
nationwide and certainly to constituents in my area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November the 51 families of the Driftwood Mobile Home Park 
were evicted from their homes after Health Canada declared the 
sewage treatment facilities were inadequate and posed a serious 
health hazard.  Under B.C. law it is normally the responsibility 
of the landlord to ensure the building and property are kept in a 
condition that makes the building reasonably comfortable to live 
in.  Part of this responsibility is to maintain the building and 
property to health and safety standards.  In the case of mobile 
home parks, it is the responsibility of the landlord to ensure 
the property is safe and habitable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The unfortunate residents of the Driftwood Mobile Home Park 
enjoyed no such protections.  Why?  Because their homes were 
located on the property of the Penticton Indian band.  Nobody had 
been inspecting this land because it fell under a grey area of 
the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a bit of the history to put this incident 
into perspective.  On March 30, 1988 under section 58(3) of the 
Indian Act, the minister granted authorization to lease Indian 
reserve land to Ethel and Margaret Kruger for their benefit.  The 
term of this lease was from March 30, 1988 to March 30, 1998. 
The property of the lease was to be used for the purpose of the 
mobile home park operated by Sanmar Mobile Home Services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When that firm created the park the septic fields were not 
engineered to handle the high volumes that are being experienced. 
As a result these fields have been saturated beyond a safe level 
and the overflow is creating a serious health hazard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's Indian health services branch, which is 
responsible for approving septic field installations on Indian 
land, claimed that it was never informed of the Driftwood septic 
installation.  This breakdown in communication led to 51 families 
being torn from their community, many forced to abandon their 
homes without any compensation. If this situation were not tragic 
enough, the same fate may await other residents of mobile home 
parks located on the Penticton reserve land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada has declared that both the Driftwood and Delta 
mobile home parks face serious health risks.  Although the Sun 
Leisure and Riva Ridge parks have inadequate septic systems, 
Health Canada has not yet declared them to be a serious health 
risk.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The residents of Driftwood Mobile Home Park were given 30-day 
eviction notices.  In an effort to resolve this problem, my 
colleague organized a meeting between the minister of Indian 
affairs, the mayor of Penticton, Ms. Beth Campbell, and the local 
MLA, Rick Thorpe, and Chief Phillip of the Penticton Band. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the efforts of those involved, a comprehensive solution 
was not reached and the hon. member's constituents lost their 
homes only one month before Christmas.  This is at a time when 
people should be enjoying the fellowship of their friends and 
families in the comfort of their own homes, not worrying about 
where they will be living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This incident should not be repeated but it is a very real 
possibility.  Thousands of Canadians who rent federal Indian 
reserve land are in danger, citizens of Canada who have no idea 
that they have been left in limbo because the law does not 
recognize their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Indian Act is a complex one.  For years different levels of 
government have been struggling with what the bill covers and 
what it does not cover.  According to the Supreme Court of Canada 
there are only two ways for a non-Indian to be in lawful 
possession in a reserve, through the operation of sections 28(2) 
or 58(3). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 28(2) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may, by permit, in writing authorize any person for 
a period not exceeding one year, or with the consent of the 
council of the band for any longer period, to occupy or use a 
reserve or to reside or otherwise exercise rights on a reserve. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 58(3) states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister may lease for the benefit of any Indian, on 
application of that Indian for that purpose, the land of which 
the Indian is lawfully in possession without the land being 
designated. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is under these sections that a 10-year lease was granted. 
Although it was not outlined in the lease, it was implicit in the 
agreements with the sublessees that they would be protected under 
the provincial landlord and tenant legislation.  Indeed it was 
the responsibility of the lessee to provide at its expense all 
services and facilities required for use of the premise.  This 
would include septic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, because of the failure of Health Canada to inspect 
these services, the residents fell through the cracks.  Although 
they appealed to the provincial landlord and tenant board they 
were not successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Supreme Court of Canada stated that provincial legislation 
does not apply to residential tenancies on Indian reserves. 
Parliament has the exclusive power to legislate with respect to 
such tenancies.  This was stated in Millbrook Indian Band v 
Northern Counties Residential Tenancies Board et al, 1978. Again, 
in Anderson v Triple Creek Estates, the supreme court stated that 
provincial legislation does not apply to an eviction dispute 
between a mobile home park tenant and the park proprietor.  It 
continues to say that “although it may be unfair to deprive a 
person of an appeal against a termination at will of a tenancy, 
this matter can only be resolved on reserve land by federal 
authority”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A letter from the British Columbia minister for municipal 
affairs and housing, Mr. Michael Farnworth, confirms this is a 
federal responsibility.  He writes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with profound regret that I see tenants facing eviction 
under these conditions, however the entire tenancy responsibility 
on federally owned lands lies with the federal government.  It is 
apparent that there is a serious federal legislative and policy 
vacuum in this area, resulting in crippling impact on individuals 
and families who are tenants of federal lands in this province. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is apparent that there is a responsibility on the part of the 
government to fill in this void.  That is where Bill C-402 comes 
in.  The bill is designed to prevent future Driftwoods from 
happening again by making existing provincial tenancy legislation 
apply to leases granted by the crown.  The crown, the lessors, 
and the sublessors will be subject to provincial authorities that 
enforce the obligations of landlord and tenants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have already mentioned this, I will do so again for 
the benefit of members opposite.  The landlord and tenant 
legislation in B.C. ensures that a landlord must maintain land or 
residential premises in compliance with health, safety and 
housing standards set out by the law.  The crown and lessor will 
be responsible for meeting provincial standards set out under the 
various provincial residential tenancy acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-402 is a simple non-partisan amendment to the Indian Act 
that would prevent other Canadians from facing the tragedy of the 
unfortunate residents of Driftwood Mobile Home Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize that Bill C-402 is a non-votable item and that is very 
unfortunate.  As has been explained in this House, it is a very 
unfortunate thing that we as members of parliament cannot help 
create laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would ensure that Canadians are all treated equitably 
before the law.  If any of the members opposite would care to see 
what Reform stands for, all they need to do is flip through the 
Reform Party blue book and peruse the statement of principles. 
The first statement says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We affirm our commitment to Canada as one nation, indivisible, 
and to our vision of Canada as a balanced federation of equal 
provinces and citizens. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last statement of principle states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe in the true equality of all Canadian citizens, with 
equal rights and responsibilities for all. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is absolutely plain to see this is a party dedicated 
to the equality of all citizens and I congratulate my colleague 
for bringing this forward.  I know Liberal Party members think 
quite highly of the Reform Party blue book because they have, 
albeit it with mixed success, adopted many of our policies as 
their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, they would do well to consider these two principles 
that are so core to the heart of our party.  It is apparent 
through the actions of this government on many issues that it 
does not consider equality of all Canadians a thing to be 
grasped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, perhaps we should leave this debate for another day. 
It is because of my dedication to the equality of all citizens 
that I support this bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan—Coquihalla, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank hon. members who participated in the debate today on Bill 
C-402. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to respond to some of the comments. Bill C-49, the 
land management act, deals only with 14 bands and that there are 
just about 700 native bands from coast to coast to coast. It 
certainly does not affect the Penticton Indian Band whatsoever. 
Therefore Bill C-49 does not respond to the needs of the people 
from my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate very much the parliamentary secretary's passing 
along his regret regarding the outcome of this tragic incident. 
I will convey that to my constituents.  I will also convey to my 
constituents today that the Progressive Conservative Party and 
the New Democratic Party support in principle the eviction of 51 
families from the Driftwood mobile home park in Penticton. I find 
it quite regrettable today that they could not see there was a 
great deal of support for Bill C-402 which directly deals with 
the problem faced by these families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have to argue with those members opposed to Bill C-402 
that striking another committee to look at the issue does not 
help at this point.  As I mentioned, the establishment of some of 
these mobile home parks in my riding goes back 20 years.  Members 
pointing out that the Indian Act is flawed are absolutely 
correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, Bill C-402 deals specifically with an emergency 
situation and it also brings equality to renters regardless of 
whether they are native or non-native.  It does not matter. Bill 
C-402 brings equality to all people who find themselves in the 
position of renting land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Commons there are many of us who rent apartments 
or homes in Ottawa.  If we found ourselves in the situation the 
people of Driftwood mobile home park found themselves in we would 
have the Ontario provincial tenancy act there to protect our 
rights as renters. That is what Bill C-402 does. That is what we 
are attempting to do with this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is wrong and meanspirited for members of other 
parties to say they will not come to the aid of the people of the 
driftwood mobile home park.  I also point out that on the horizon 
there are four more mobile home parks in my riding that will face 
a similar situation.  We will not be talking about 51 families, 
we will be talking about 200 families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the federal government do at that point? I hope its 
response will not be to strike a committee and seek consultation 
across the country.  We need action and we need it now.  That is 
what Bill C-402 would have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  There are presently negotiations going on between 
parties.  I ask if there would be consent to suspend for about 15 
minutes because there are a few details to iron out in this 
consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either at the call of the Chair or in 15 minutes, whichever 
comes first, Mr. Speaker could entertain what you usually do at 
the conclusion of debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The government House 
leader has requested that the House suspend for no more than 15 
minutes.  Is there consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> There being no 
further members rising for debate and the motion not being 
designated votable, the time provided for the consideration of 
Private Members' Business has now expired and the order is 
dropped from the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 1.50 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 1.50 p.m.)
