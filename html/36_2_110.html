the House, which is the first private member's bill I have taken

Presently these Canadians in waiting are not able to apply for 
such assistance.

bring to society as a whole.

about the value of marriage as the cornerstone of public policy 
which produces real tangible public policy benefits. The 
petitioners draw the attention of the House to the motion passed 
on June 8, 1999 which defines marriage as the union of one man 
and one woman to the exclusion of all others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners also point out that there is inappropriate 
intrusion and discriminatory practices on the part of the federal 
government to extend benefits based on a person's private sexual 
activity excluding other types of dependency relationships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners ask that parliament withdraw Bill C-23 and 
affirm the opposite sex definition of marriage in legislation and 
ensure that marriage is recognized as a unique institution.

Madam Speaker, I am pleased today, along with my leader of the 
New Democratic Party caucus, to present a petition on behalf of

the government to take action against the threats to medicare,

in terms of restoration of funds under the budget and to withdraw 
its secret 12 point agreement with Alberta, which is the 
forerunner to bill 11, and to begin now to address the questions 
of violations of the spirit and letter of the Canada Health Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK45">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for 
having established the Canada Information Office, which gives 
lucrative contracts to those close to the government party for, 
among other things, the purpose of gathering, analysing and 
collating information about a large number of citizens, and that 
this House urge the government to close that Office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: Madam Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to 
the question on the order paper, particularly today in the 
presence of the Deputy Minister responsible for both Public 
Works and the Canada Information Office, whom I am pleased to 
see here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that this is a source of great interest and perhaps in 
certain cases of great concern. 
As parliamentarians, it is not our purpose to cause concern to 
anyone, but rather to inform Canadians, and Quebecers in 
particular, of this formidable propaganda tool, which goes by 
the name of the Canada Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in what the Prime Minister so frequently reminds us 
is the best country in the world, we imagine that certain 
attitudes, philosophies and thoughts exist only in countries 
where democracy is threatened or totally thwarted.  We imagine 
that it is impossible in Canada, for a single instant, for 
democracy to be attacked, weakened or made to serve purely 
partisan interests.  Unfortunately, history has given us a 
number of examples to disprove this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day, I heard the hon. member for Winnipeg North<B>—</B>St. 
Paul say “Find me a single example in Canadian history where 
democracy has been thwarted, where it has not been respected”. 
He also asked for examples where new Quebecers or new Canadians 
had not been respected.

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appreciate the fact that the hon. member for Winnipeg North—St. 
Paul is a new Canadian, but if he reads the official record of 
this House, he will realize that toward the end of the 1980s and 
the beginning of the 1990s, we had to compensate after the fact 
Japanese Canadians who have been imprisoned during the last 
world war, including those who were born in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was not a favour to this ethnic group, quite the contrary, 
because democracy had been abused back then. No doubt good 
excuses were made up to do this at the time, but nobody can tell 
me that democracy and freedom of speech are part of the Canadian 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the time, there is freedom of movement for people and 
ideas, but not when the issue is Canadian unity. In this case, 
an agency has been set up to repress those who may have a 
different opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This agency is exclusively at the service of the Liberal Party 
of Canada. When it was set up in 1996, it was supposed to 
counteract sovereignists in the field, and all federalist 
parties agreed. However, they have been taken for a ride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really felt like laughing, because I have always said that 
when the Prime Minister talks about a chair in the House, we 
should be very careful, because we cannot be really sure that 
what he has in mind is the same thing we do. In the Prime 
Minister's mind, a chair does not necessarily have four legs of 
the same length, a horizontal seat and a vertical back rest. 
If we were to ask the Prime Minister to draw a chair—to see what 
the concept means to him—we would be surprised by the result. We 
would see that no one in the House has the same idea of a chair 
as the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Prime Minister and the then deputy prime minister 
agreed to create the Canada Information Office, self-righteous 
federalists said: “Here is an organization that will benefit 
Canadians, by opposing the sovereignist discourse in Quebec”. 
But they were tricked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he created this organ the Prime Minister's devious plan was 
to use it also for election campaign purposes and partisan 
promotion for the sole benefit of the Liberal Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the other parties were taken in, including the 
Reform and Progressive Conservative members, who believed in the 
Prime Minister's good faith. 
But we in Quebec have a long-standing tradition of distrusting 
this Prime Minister as well as his follower, his disciple who 
follows him like a shadow and who is also in the House this 
morning. Though they are Quebecers, when they tell us something, 
we must always be on our guard, because there is always a catch, 
and history is there to prove that we were taken in by them more 
often than we deserved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office, which was supposed to promote 
Canadian unity, had to get some furniture first. It not only 
needed telephones, tables and chairs, but also employees who 
were trustworthy and able mainly to promote the Liberal Party of 
Canada and to sell it to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some appointments were made. 
Hiring these people required an exemption to the application of 
the public service employment regulations.  The first 
legislative measure passed by this government was to exempt the 
Canada Information Office, by ministerial order, nothing less, from 
the application of the Public Service Employment Act and its 
regulations, including those on hiring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course they wanted docile individuals who would obey 
unquestioningly the dictates of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs of the day, whose job it was to 
promote Canadian unity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They needed docile people and they found them.  But, docility 
comes at a big price.  From the questions the Bloc Quebecois put 
to the Minister of Public Works all week long it is clear that 
docility pays.  We learned that a certain Richard Mongeau, a 
well known lawyer, the lawyer who defended the members of the 
RCMP accused of stealing the Parti Québécois membership list, 
who defended RCMP officers when they torched the barns in Quebec 
and who defended all those who had to do the dirty work.  He was 
an ardent defender of these people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, for his last dirty job he was told “You have to 
come to the CIO. 
Your service record shows you are quite capable of doing the 
dirty work required by the current Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs, the Prime Minister and the Minister of public works 
without remorse or scruple”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was how $160,000 was paid to Richard Mongeau to check 
the spelling and punctuation of the press releases issued by the 
minister of public works allegedly to inform Quebecers about 
federal programs available and beneficial to them.  Mr. Mongeau 
earned $160,000 for that.  In addition, his firm, Leblanc et 
Leduc, probably got another $50,000 to correct Mr. Mongeau's own 
spelling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this whole CIO business, they have both fists in the trough. 
There are a few who are really gorging themselves, but this is a 
Liberal Party tradition. 
There is nothing wrong with that; it has been going on since 
confederation. Poor people with good ideas have become extremely 
rich thanks to all kinds of subsidies and schemes. That is the 
Liberal way of thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When those people across the way rise to proclaim their 
adherence to the Liberal way of thinking, we have to be careful. 
Being a Liberal on the other side of the House means that one is 
willing to do a lot of things, including creating the CIO, the 
Canada Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the rules governing the CIO, the conditions of employment 
of the public service do not apply to that office. It currently 
employs 83 people, which makes it large enough. It seems to me 
that with 83 employees the minister should have at least one 
or two persons capable of revising texts, correcting errors if 
necessary and putting in the correct punctuation. 
But no. Employees are apparently asked to write something up, 
but it is Richard Mongeau, who is paid $160,000 a year, who 
checks for spelling and punctuation errors. It seems to me that 
an office which employs 83 people should be self-sufficient, 
especially with an annual budget of $20 million to $25 million. How is 
the money given the CIO each year to operate and fulfil its 
mandate being used? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contracts are awarded to a lot of people but not to just 
anyone. We have here the list of those who were awarded 
contracts over the last few years. They all have one thing in 
common: they have contributed various amounts to the election 
fund of the Liberal Party of Canada. Sometimes it is difficult 
to establish a relationship on a pro rata basis, and in some 
cases it is almost impossible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, if we look at someone who was awarded a contract 
for $166,000, or for $1 million, as was the case for Tremblay 
Communications, we can see that Michèle Tremblay contributed 
$2,000 to the Liberal Party of Canada both in 1997 and in 1998.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems reasonable, a $2,000 contribution for a $1 million 
contract. But there are other examples of solid supporters of 
this party who, for much smaller contracts, will give $15,000 
while they were awarded a $30,000 or $35,000 contract. Is this 
an indirect way of saying “I give you work, so pay something 
back into our election fund and make a financial contribution to 
our party?” In this case, one has to ask if in fact the work 
was done. Was the work contracted important and necessary? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to read certain work descriptions in some of 
the contracts. For example, Intersol was awarded a small $28,000 
contract. It reads: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—provide advice on the region's organization and on the design 
team discussions and work with this team to develop an approach 
meeting the employees' needs. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a vague mandate. I am sure that, for $28,000, my 
daughter, who is in grade 5, could perform a task like that in 
no time just by searching in dictionaries and finding ideas here 
and there. She would be very happy to receive $28,000. But this 
amount is not for her; it is for the friends of the Liberal 
Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another one, “Advising and auditing”, $35,000. This is 
awarded to individual entrepreneurs, lawyers, et cetera. There is also 
“Implementation of recommendations regarding the CIO contract 
award process”. What does that mean? There is another $57,000 
contract for the “Classification and writing of work 
descriptions”. 
That is a lucrative work. These people are professionals hired 
by the CIO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Les Associés RCN received $8,500 for “Consultation with Human 
Resources Development”. How long did they work? Fifteen minutes, 
three days, six weeks? We do not know, but we know that they did 
not provide useful advise to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, probably because the contract was not lucrative 
enough. They were paid $8,500 but they certainly did not give 
the minister sound advice, because she has been in trouble with 
Human Resources Development ever since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day I was listening to the hon. member from Winnipeg 
North—or something like that, I am not sure, and he was quite 
insulted when I did not remember the exact name of his 
riding—who told the House that what Human Resources Development 
did and was now being condemned for was nothing much: an 
outstanding amount of $2,500 out of several hundred million 
dollars, $1 billion or $1.5 billion in grants. In his mind, $2,500 
in unaccounted for money is nothing, only a venial sin really. 
On the other hand, it gave work to people with disabilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jobs were created for disabled people in that company, which was 
given $700,000 just to change its name. It was strictly a 
request to change its name. Any of my notary colleagues could 
easily have done that for $1,000 or $1,200. Seven hundred and 
twenty thousand dollars were given to that company for a request 
to change its name. The hon. member for Winnipeg North—St. Paul 
says that it allowed disabled people to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we read the list of those who were awarded all these 
contracts, it is obvious that the main disability of those who 
were given grants was that they unfortunately were Liberals. 
This is what explains the advance and disbursement of funds. The 
minister has now been struggling for several months to defend 
herself about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, I can see that an amount of $8,500 was given to Les 
Associés RCN to advise the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. This at least was is written in here. They 
have advised the minister poorly and she will certainly agree 
with that.

He is a 54-year-old lawyer who was called to the Quebec bar in

the federal government, including a case defending RCMP officers 
accused of various crimes:  theft of PQ lists, setting fire to a 
barn, theft of dynamite. 
We remember: it made the headlines at the time.  He was hired to 
represent RCMP officers before two commissions of inquiry and 
before the criminal court as well.  From 1993 to 1999 he 
defended André Lizotte against the Royal Bank.  He is a 
reputable and accomplished lawyer.  After 1998 he became the 
federal negotiator with the Cree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Oka crisis, the federal government appointed lawyer 
Michel Robert, who had been president of the Liberal Party of 
Canada, to head up a commission of inquiry into the entire Oka 
incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> He is a judge now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> He is a judge now.  He knew the proper 
channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After $1.6 million worth of efforts and before his report was 
made public, the present Prime Minister appointed him to the 
court of appeal. 
As a result, all his work and everything he had done up to that 
point was set aside. It could no longer be used.  It was all 
thrown out because the government could not wait.  It was in 
such a hurry to appoint someone with a solid record, as it had 
been when it appointed Michel Robert to the court of appeal, 
that it had no scruples about tossing out $1.6 million of effort, 
of investigations conducted and of mountains of paper in order to 
appoint him immediately to the court of appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party knows how to reward its friends and its good 
friends.  Richard Mongeau was one of those.  I am not in any way 
criticizing the work of Mr. Mongeau, who has been a judge since 
January, but I am speaking of the period before January 13.  He 
represented a senator in a dispute with a member of this House. 
Just recently, before his appointment, he was very prominent 
in the Liberal Party of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not know if the hon. member had the opportunity to say it, but 
since we often hear the Minister of Public Works and Government 
Services say that contracts are always awarded by way of the 
bidding process, can the hon. member for Chambly confirm that 
the CIO contracts have always been awarded, as we often hear in 
the House, by way of public tender? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> No, Madam Speaker. It would seem that the 
CIO started to use the public tender process only recently. In 
fact it would have started to use it no more than one year ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before that, and I can mention a few names for the benefit of my 
colleague who wants to know, there was the Groupe Cible, for a 
$27,100 contract, no public tender; Média Q, $37,500, no public 
tender; Ekos Research Association, $53,500, no public tender; 
Muséobus, $27,750, for graphic concept creation services, and 
for printing and adapting services. Of what, I do not have a 
clue.

provincial laws and public consultation on constitutional 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> As if the people of the justice department 
cannot do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> Indeed, as if the justice department had no 
employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why people rise up against such a way of doing things. 
We have a public service that I believe to be efficient, 
competent and able to do the work it is asked to do, and they do 
not make use of its services. 
Rather, they go into backrooms, they resort to alternative 
solutions, they rely on what is known as the pool of Liberal 
Party friends and they give them contracts worth millions of 
dollars for jobs that could be done by public servants at no 
additional cost, since these people are already being paid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister was never able to explain to us the reasons why he 
relies on contracts with the private sector, when he has all the 
necessary resources within the federal administration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government laid off 45,000 public servants in 1995 and it is 
then that friends of the party in office started getting all 
kinds of contracts right across the country to do things that 
these public servants were paid to do and were doing very well. 
We were proud of their services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is replacing career public servants with 
apparatchiks and friends of the party— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Or with agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel:</B> —or with agencies. The government finds all 
sorts of schemes to make its friends get rich. This is what the 
minister never managed to stop. On the contrary, he blindly got 
on board and was never able to justify his decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should be brought back to reality so as to recognize, like 
everyone else here, that such spending to help his friends and 
ensure his re-election must be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is all over the place. It spends a fortune on the 
drafting of press releases when it has public servants who could 
do a very good job at that, believe me. When will the minister 
stop boasting and bragging with taxpayers' money? He wastes and 
spends but it is not his money. 
It is everyone's money, including yours, Madam Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the purpose of today's opposition motion, to say that 
enough is enough. The government must stop making fun of the 
public. It must stop taking advantage of taxpayers, making them 
work so hard and taxing them to the gills, while wasting public 
money inconsiderately, through extravagant spending, gargantuan 
dinners and so on.

public at large of the role, procedures and many achievements of 
the Canada Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to do so, because, clearly, the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois cannot be expected to applaud the development of 
direct and relevant communications between Canadians and their 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, more people, especially those from Quebec, are 
discovering the services and benefits available to them from the 
Government of Canada, as the separatist issue fades into the 
background.  This is the reason for the unrest among the Bloc 
Quebecois members in recent days.  I can understand this 
frightens them somewhat.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They will never let the facts interfere with their dream of 
breaking the country apart. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Established in 1996, the Canada Information Office first focused 
its efforts on establishing structures and meeting the most 
pressing needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998, the Government of Canada struck a special committee in 
Cabinet to plan and co-ordinate all government communications. 
The Prime Minister did me the honour of asking me to chair it, 
and I can assure you I take this responsibility most seriously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister also made me responsible for the Canada 
Information Office, which he mandated to provide strategic 
advice and operational support to the new ministerial committee. 
This committee and the CIO share a common mission, that of 
helping to improve communication between the Government of 
Canada and the public. Better communication means better 
understanding, and, indirectly, better mutual appreciation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no doubt that the CIO makes a positive 
contribution to Canadian unity through its work, initiatives and 
successes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the members of the Bloc Quebecois are today calling 
for its dismantling, and I can understand them in a way. Still, 
I would remind them that Canadian unity remains more than ever 
an important priority of our government and of all the other 
political parties represented here in this House. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At this point I would like to explain the reasons that led our 
government to examine the whole question of improving 
communications with Canadians, to set up the CIO and to support 
the efforts in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the world the new millennium is associated with the 
advent of new information technology.  We are surrounded by 
hundreds of television channels, 24 hour information networks, 
the Internet, cellular phones, e-mail and many other tools or 
toys bringing instant communications and information to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net result is that we are living in an environment where we 
have access to more information than ever before.  At the same 
time Canadians have developed a taste, even a need, for 
increasingly precise, specialized and complex information. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not made up of an homogeneous group of individuals: 
education, language, economic situation and lifestyle are all 
factors which affect public information needs. However, there 
are some common values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All studies show that in Canada as in other countries citizens 
feel that their governments are not tuned in to their needs. 
They want their governments to give them more precise 
information on available services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each one of the various departments can communicate its own 
priorities and accomplishments but the CIO offers a 
comprehensive perspective of Government of Canada 
communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the context in which the Government of Canada decided to 
give itself an indispensable tool to better communicate with the 
citizens of our great country. That tool is the Canada 
Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Besides assisting the cabinet committee on communication 
matters, the CIO develops projects and co-ordinates with various 
departments and agencies initiatives to better serve the 
Canadian population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our objective is to see the CIO become a centre of excellence in 
government communications. Everyday, the direction and staff of 
the CIO strive with ardour and dedication to reach that 
objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the success of some initiatives shows that we are on 
the right track. I am thinking for instance of the rural guide 
that was distributed all over the country. 
Last week, that guide received an award of excellence from the 
International Association of Business Communicators for the 
National Capital Region.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the Bloc Quebecois members did not even mention this 
honour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very concrete example of why we constantly seek to 
improve communication with Canadians, who have a right to know 
that what they receive from their government is factual, 
essential and relevant information. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO does public opinion research, follow up and media 
analysis.  These activities benefit a number of departments and 
are pursued in collaboration with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to these initiatives, the Government of Canada listens 
more attentively to the concerns and particular needs of citizens 
throughout the nation.  Other projects like advertising in weekly 
newspapers offer Canadians specific information on the services 
that the government makes available to them. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also ministerial tours, which give Quebecers an 
opportunity to talk directly with Cabinet members. They talk 
about the issues that are close to their heart, and about the 
projects people in their area hold dear. They request and obtain 
relevant information on their government programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tours are true examples of democracy in action. Ministers 
go back to the grassroots to keep Canadians in remote areas 
informed and to listen to them, even groups who have never had a 
direct and personal access to their elected leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who could condemn, criticize or oppose such an initiative? 
Nobody, apart from the Nlob Quebecois. 
I would even say that the Bloc has a hard time doing it. Not 
being able to oppose the very commendable and positive 
initiative from the CIO, the Bloc members are looking for flaws. 
They claim that these ministerial tours are partisan. We all 
know, and all the people we have met also know, that it is not 
true. I would like to let some of the people we have met talk 
about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of a ministerial tour in his area, the president of 
the Trois-Rivières chamber of commerce, Jean Boutet, said, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We took this opportunity to talk to Paul Martin about the budget 
surpluses, the bank mergers, the state of the Canadian economy, 
the need for regional equalization and the good work he has done 
in the last years. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the budget, banks and the economy partisan issues? Of course 
not. Those are issues that Canadians everywhere in the country 
are highly interested in. But let us see more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Matapédia-Matane, the mayor of Matane, Maurice Gauthier, 
stated, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We discussed several issues, such as the port, the airport, the 
diamond development and new technologies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are those partisan issues? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec City, the editorial writer at <I>Le Soleil</I> wrote, and I 
quote: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the beginnings of this era of co-operation are promising and are 
spreading in the Quebec City area a wave of positivism that is 
welcome. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is clear that these tours are a means to 
communicate with Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us move now to the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, where the Bloc 
Quebecois House leader comes from. 
The mayor of Jonquière, Daniel Giguère, stated at the end of a 
ministerial visit, and again I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We really felt that the government wants to help Jonquière and 
the area. It was very constructive. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that being partisan? When the truth hurts, the Bloc members 
holler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are the Bloc members upset? Why are they demanding that the 
CIO be dismantled? They are terrified that Quebecers will find 
out that Canada is working well and that it is worth being part 
of it. Being short on substantive arguments about the value of 
and need for ministerial visits in Quebec, the Bloc members have 
attacked the contracting out process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here too, their accusations do not stand up to scrutiny. I 
repeat, all the CIO contracts have been granted in accordance 
with treasury board rules.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Better yet, I can assure the House that, since April 1, 1999, 
all contracts over $25,000 have been awarded to professionals 
who qualified through a bidding process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All calls for tenders were posted on the MERX electronic 
bulletin board, and competitions were held under the rules set 
out by the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a fit of partisanship that is typical of the Bloc Quebecois, 
other members of that party are screaming because certain 
contracts were awarded to people who share the government's 
political philosophy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to understand why the millions of Canadians who 
support this government could not or should not have access to 
government contracts. In my opinion, this would just deprive us 
of a large and precious pool of professional skills and 
expertise. Moreover, such an approach would create a highly 
discriminatory system that would go against our most fundamental 
values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, I understand that members of the Bloc Quebecois would 
prefer by far that these contracts be awarded only to 
sovereignists, but I have to tell them frankly that they are not 
being realistic. Even their head office, in Quebec City, cannot 
achieve such levels of so-called perfection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the meantime, the government team will continue to visit all 
the regions of Quebec. Moreover, thanks to the excellent 
services provided by the CIO, we will keep on spreading the good 
news that Canada works and that it is worth being part of this 
great country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, Canada is a great country and it is worth being part of it. 
I know Bloc Quebecois members are nervous and worried.  The 
Canada Information Office has become an essential, efficient tool 
against the goal of separating Quebec from Canada.  They want to 
see it dismantled.  I am telling my friends loud and clear that 
this will not happen, not now nor as long as there is a 
separatist party threatening to break up our great country. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that Quebecers appreciate— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> It is annoying listening to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:  </B>When it hurts, they react. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying that it is clear that with each passing day 
Quebecers find more reasons to belong to Canada.  They do not 
want to hear about referendums.  They no longer want to be at 
odds with each other.  They want their governments, all their 
governments, to work together calmly, hand in hand, in order to 
improve our quality of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Their desire to live in peace, harmony and prosperity is 
legitimate and is shared by Canadians in all regions of the 
country.  That is why I am proud of the constructive and 
positive work done by the team at the Canada Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what Bloc Quebecois members have said, the men and women 
working in the CIO are making an important contribution to our 
country. 
Daily, they are strengthening the ties between individual 
Canadians and the Government of Canada.  Daily, they are helping 
to build on Canadian unity and solidarity.  They deserve our 
respect and our encouragement.  That is why we are going to 
continue working together, calmly and with determination, in 
order to develop the potential of our great country, Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam speaker, after that 
great speech, I am tempted to ask the minister how much that 
speech cost us and who wrote it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office does not do anything itself. 
Everything is contracted out. I would not be surprised if the 
speech that the minister just read cost us $25,000 or 
$27,500—this is the scale involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the drafting of his speech was contracted out, could the 
minister table the contract in the House and assure us that it 
was awarded through a bidding process? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as the minister admits, the Canada Information Office is a 
tool to promote Canadian unity, why is it managed by the

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it because out of all the jobs the Prime Minister has given 
him, the minister omitted a very important one? Is it because he 
is the chief organizer of the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec 
that the CIO had to be at his service, so that he could do his 
job as the organizer in Quebec for his party? That is the real 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the CIO not under the authority of the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, if promoting Canadian unity is its 
only responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I thought I had explained 
at the beginning of my speech the reason why I was the minister 
responsible for the Canadian Information Office.  The member of 
the Bloc Quebecois, however, is so obsessed by his beliefs that 
he has not listened in the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of my speech I said that, in 1998, the Prime 
Minister created a cabinet communications committee of which I 
was made head, and he subsequently entrusted me with 
responsibility for the BIC since its mandate is to co-ordinate 
the communications of the Government of Canada, of all its 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I am the minister responsible for the BIC because I am the 
chair of the communications committee and not because I am the 
Minister of Public Works.  I believe, however, that this is a 
bit too complicated for the hon. member for Chambly to grasp. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay—Columbia, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I recall specifically when the Canada Information 
Office was set up originally under the heritage minister.  The 
reason this minister is now in charge of the Canada Information 
Office is that it was not managed at all well by the heritage 
minister and in fact the CIO was getting into some difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to state clearly and unequivocally that my party and I, 
along with the NDP and the Progressive Conservatives, share the 
same beliefs as this minister and the government.  Canada is the 
greatest nation in the world.  We must do everything we can 
possibly do to keep it fully intact.  I have some difficulty, 
though, with the way in which the CIO has conducted itself over 
its brief history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the CIO has never explained its involvement in the 
missing $4.5 million for Options Canada.  If that money were 
wrongly spent, if that money were put into a wrong place with 
respect to the referendum question in the province of Quebec, and 
if there were some malfeasance on the part of the government, I 
would suggest to the minister that it is in the interest of the 
people of Canada who are federalists for the government to come 
clean about the $4.5 million rather than continue to sweep and 
sweep and sweep it under the rug. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the difficulty the government has created with the 
Canada Information Office is that many of the contracts and much 
of the ongoing activity have been conducted in a way that does 
not befit what we are in Canada, which is a democracy.  In a 
democracy the people depend on the people in the Chamber to hold 
the government accountable for the affairs of the government and 
to be as transparent as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest in the strongest way possible to the minister that 
even if we can get him to clear up the history of the Canada 
Information Office, which I do not have a lot of hope for but I 
am asking for, from this point forward there must be proper 
transparency of the Canada Information Office.  The country needs 
openness and transparency because democracy cannot be true 
democracy without openness and transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B>  Madam Speaker, concerning the hon. 
member's question about Options Canada, BIC was not in existence 
at the time.  I think it was heritage, and the minister of 
heritage has said many times in the House that an audit was going 
on and the auditor general was involved.

CIO, as I said in the House this week, at the beginning of its 
creation the CIO was asked to deliver a mandate but it did not 
have the necessary tools among its civil servants, and it 
actually created a mess.  Therefore certain extensions were 
given. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once I took over the responsibility for CIO, since April 1, 1999 
every contract above $25,000 has had to be publicly tendered. 
Those contracts can be checked through access to information.  A 
full fiscal year is in place for every contract above $25,000 and 
that can be audited.  I have been assured by officials that is 
what took place.  My director was very clear in a written letter

part of plan B.  I would like the minister to tell me whether 
what the Canada Information Office is doing and the propaganda 
it is distributing is not merely part of plan B, part of the 
arsenal being used against Quebec sovereignty, against that 
eminently democratic project of ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a major insult to us when the member says that what we are 
planning is a threat to break up Canada and that it lacks 
legitimacy, since the Supreme Court of Canada itself has said 
that it was a legitimate project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enough then of this talk of threats by someone who is himself 
from Quebec and who knows that there are people in his riding, 
as there are elsewhere in Quebec, who believe sovereignty is a 
legitimate option that deserves to be presented and defended to 
Quebecers with all the democratic tools at our disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is not the Canada Information Office and everything it is doing 
quite simply one more component of plan B, which is aimed at 
blocking Quebecers' path to sovereignty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano:</B> Madam Speaker, I hope I will have the 
same time as the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I have always said that when Quebec City communicates, it 
informs.  When Ottawa communicates, it is propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in fiscal year 1999-2000, the Government of Quebec, 
through various departments, such as the departments of revenue, 
finance, treasury board and others, gave $96,000 to the Mouvement 
national des Québécois et Québécoises. 
That is legitimate.  I have always said that it was legitimate 
to promote separation.  Two referendums were held in Quebec and 
Quebecers said no.  Is this not democratic? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are they allowed to talk up their option while we are 
obliged to say nothing and not defend our options?  Where is 
democracy in all this?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is with a great deal of respect that I approach the 
debate this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office has a very interesting title. 
The word “Information” has some very interesting connotations 
because information is separate from facts. 
Facts are indisputable observations, the things that everyone 
would agree upon.  Information is not necessarily agreed upon. 
Information is often the taking of facts, interpreting them and 
applying them in certain ways to create a particular result that 
may influence other people to make decisions, to feel a certain 
way or to develop certain attitudes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is to that extent that I would like to read from the 
department's statement, the departmental overview, the mandate, 
the rules and responsibilities of the Canada Information 
Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the people who are watching this particular 
debate to pay particular attention to the words in the statement 
and compare them, if they have read the novel by George Orwell, 
to <I>1984</I>.  The statement reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office's (CIO) mandate is to improve 
communications between the Government of Canada and citizens. 
While individual departments and agencies communicate about 
activities within their areas of responsibility, the CIO is 
increasingly focused on communicating with citizens from a 
corporate perspective, representing the Government of Canada as a 
whole....Information on the government's overall direction, key 
priorities and the broad range of programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Based on public opinion and communications research, the CIO 
developed national and regionally responsive citizen-focused 
communications initiatives.  It also provides advice and support, 
in collaboration with the Privy Council Office, to the ad hoc 
Committee of Cabinet on Government Communications which was 
created in 1998 to improve the effectiveness of government 
communications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO's role and mandate has gradually evolved to the above. 
When it was created on July 9, 1996 through Order-in-Council 
1996-1066, its mandate reflected the Government's commitment to 
inform Canadians about their country, about each other, about the 
renewal of the federation and about the role of the Government of 
Canada.  This evolution from a largely unity focused mandate to 
one more focused on corporate communications was brought about in 
response to the Government's commitment to better communicate 
with citizens. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I went through those three paragraphs, how many of those who 
have read George Orwell's <I>1984</I> would say, that is like the 
information office that George Orwell imagined a long time ago, 
which was actually to create a particular impression or direction 
as to what should happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. minister just indicated, and it is reflected in a 
phrase in one of the above paragraphs, that it was primarily to 
bring about the unity of Canada.  I could not agree more with the 
minister.  I think we do need to have this country together.  One 
of the saddest experiences I have had in the House was to witness 
the operation of the members of the Bloc whose sole purpose is to 
destroy the unity of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing hurts me more than to think of breaking up the country 
that my grandfather chose as being the place where he wanted to 
live and where he wanted his children to get married and his 
grandchildren to live.  I am proud of this country.  I am so 
thankful that he chose to move out of Russia, come to Canada and 
set up his operation here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to keep the country united.  I love our uniqueness and 
our various cultural differences.  We are not all the same and I 
am happy about those differences. However this does not make one 
group better than another.  It does not mean that we should 
separate from one another.  We can learn from one another and 
live together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does that require information, it also requires an 
attitude, an attitude of patriotism, of transparency and of 
working together, and to be democratic about it.  We must also be 
accountable to one another.  We do not need nor do we want a 
propaganda machine that will do only one thing: promote a 
particular political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate does not say that it is the Liberal Party that is 
being promoted.  It says that the government's operations are to 
be communicated with the citizens.  To that degree it is good, 
but is it doing that?  That becomes the key question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has given us some assurances this morning, but I 
want to ask whether in fact those assurances are being observed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to get into another part of the department's own 
statement about the operation of the CIO. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read what it says on page 7 of the document that I am 
referring to.  It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO's activities are greatly influenced by the opinions and 
attitudes of the Canadian public.  What Canadians tell us in our 
surveys help shape our initiatives and the communications advice 
we provide to the government.  For instance, our research 
indicates that many Canadians believe the government is not 
providing them with enough information and a large majority 
believe that the government should place a high priority on 
providing information on how to access programs and services. 
Our research also tells us that Canadians possess relatively low 
levels of familiarity with government actions. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think about what has happened in the House in 
the last three months.  The Minister of HRDC has been singularly 
secretive about certain things.  It was not until a request was 
made by our critic, my colleague for Calgary—Nose Hill, that 
this be made public that in fact it became public.  We have seen 
a number of things.  We have had to dig and dig and push and pull 
to get the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We still do not have all the information.  If that is the issue, 
if this group found out that Canadians want more information, why 
is it not forthcoming?  I really question whether in fact the CIO 
is doing what it was supposed to be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overview goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Demographics also play an important role in determining our 
activities.  The CIO's communications strategies reflect Canada's 
increasingly diverse and pluralistic population and take into 
consideration factors such as regional differences, the aging 
population and varying levels of literacy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is indeed true.  Just a moment ago the minister referred to 
the increasing sophistication of technology; that people want 
more information and they want it faster.  With the complexity of 
the various issues, we need to recognize that complexity itself 
can be an impediment to clear communication.  It therefore has to 
be simplified so that people can understand it directly and 
accurately.  The key factor here is accuracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final sentence reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technological advances and new media are also having significant 
effects on how the Government of Canada communicates— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the case.  There are rumours now that the government is 
considering a secure channel.  There is a lot controversy around 
that particular channel.  How will the contract be awarded for 
that particular channel?   What are the specifications that will 
have to be met?  These things are not clear at this point. There 
are a lot of complications with that, and I am sure the hon. 
minister would be only too pleased to recognize this and take 
some action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really encourage the minister to ensure that the kind of 
things he does in that particular connection do not fall into the 
kind of criticism that we are offering to the CIO, in the way it 
is operating and particularly the advice it has given to the 
HRDC, if indeed it gave it some.  I think it probably did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the department's communications activities.  It 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2000-2001, the CIO will place much of its effort on the design 
and delivery of innovative, citizen-oriented, corporate 
communications products and initiatives. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is going to be citizen-oriented, we will have to see the 
evidence that it is citizen-oriented, that the primary purpose is 
to get the people and the government to talk together rather than 
the government talking to the people and telling them that this 
is what they had better believe and this is what they had better 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to have it the other way as well which says “We, the 
people, would like you, the government, to do this”.  I ask 
myself, I ask the hon. minister and I ask the Prime Minister, if 
this is the case, if they have been listening so carefully, if 
they want to be citizen-oriented, why is it then that we have not 
had a tax cut?   Why is it that we do not have a plan to pay down 
the debt? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over and over again I hear people asking when the government 
will start paying down the debt.  When is it going to have a plan 
to pay down the debt?  There is no plan.  The only plan it has is 
that if it has a little surplus, it will put it toward the debt. 
That is fine but that is not what we want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want a systematic and planned contribution that will say how 
much the debt is going to be reduced each year.  Unless we do 
that, the interest charges and the service charges for that debt 
will continue and we will get nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The health care budget alone would be covered by half of the 
service charges on the debt at the present time, and I am 
speaking about the federal contribution.  If we are going to be 
citizen-oriented, we must pay attention to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The paper goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>These corporate communications initiatives will be designed to 
reflect citizens' needs and interests for information— 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1130"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens want action.  They want information, that is true, 
but they want to know what we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Minister of Health going to do to fix the health 
care problem? We do not know.  He is not telling us.  When he 
goes to a meeting he says all kinds of beautiful things.  Not too 
long ago he was in Kelowna in my constituency and made a 
beautiful speech.  He said that we are going to enter into a 
partnership with a program with the Kelowna General Hospital. 
The doctors in the audience asked, “Where is the money?” It is 
easy to talk, but where is the action?  Very noble activities are 
being proposed here, but what are they really going to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“They will be based on the CIO's research and what it has 
learned from its practical experience to date”.  That has given 
us a whole lot of information.  Are they really going to do 
that?  It is going to be a major change. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The addition of regional communications co-ordinators will further 
enhance co-ordination and collaboration of government-wide 
communications at the regional and local level.  The CIO will 
also continue to play an important role in a variety of 
government-wide communications initiatives led by other departments 
and agencies.  For example, it is working closely with the 
Treasury Board Secretariat, the Privy Council Office, and Public 
Works and Government Services Canada on a revised government 
communications policy.  It is also collaborating with the Privy 
Council Office on the development and renewal of the government 
communications community. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is wonderful and it sounds so good.  I want to ask the 
minister whether he will have those kinds of statements that this 
is what they are going to do.  Will he present to parliament a 
report saying that these are the things the Canada Information 
Office actually achieved, that it did what was said it would do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things we need to do, but I want to move 
on to another section which has to do with sole source contracts. 
The hon. minister a moment ago said that as of April 1, 1999 
there have been no contracts awarded above $25,000 that were not 
tendered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have here the auditor's report dated November 1999.  This 
particular report is a rather strong indictment on the whole 
business of sole source contracting.  In fact, using advance 
contract award notices, the auditor general goes so far as to say 
that this has become a fifth way of granting contracts by the 
Government of Canada. He makes some rather strong statements.  In 
his introductory paragraph he says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principles of accessibility, competition, fairness to 
suppliers, transparency and best value lie at the core of 
government contracting policy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Good. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contracting regulations require that all contracts be let 
through a competitive process, with certain very narrowly defined 
exceptions.  When the contract is needed in an emergency, when 
the value is small, when it is not in the public interest to 
solicit bids (for example, if national security is involved) or 
when there is only one supplier who can do the work, the contract 
can be let without competition on what is called a sole-source 
basis.  Almost 90 percent of the 50 sole-source contracts we 
examined did not fall under any of the exceptions or did not have 
adequate evidence of doing so and hence ought to have been 
competitively tendered.  As in last year's audit of sole-source 
contracts for professional services, we concluded that the 
process of awarding most of the contracts audited in this year's 
sample would not pass the test of public scrutiny. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are very, very severe indictable statements. This refers 
not only to the CIO but goes right across a number of 
departments. I have the list of departments which were involved 
and they all came in for criticism:  the Department of National 
Defence, the Canadian International Development Agency, Industry 
Canada, the Department of Human Resources Development, and the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services. 
Ninety per cent. That is high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He goes on to become much more specific.  I want to refer 
specifically to several of these. 
I am reading from the auditor general's report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 11 percent of the 50 contracts we examined had a 
justification for sole-sourcing on file that complied with the 
conditions stipulated in the Government Contracts Regulations. 
Specifically, none of the contracts in our sample were for under 
$25,000.  None invoked the exceptions for pressing emergency or 
national interest.  The critical decision used to justify 
sole-sourcing in most of these contracts was the determination 
that the contractor was “unique”—that is, the only person or 
firm capable of performing the work. Managers are supposed to 
make this determination, justify it and document it before 
deciding to sole-source and before posting an ACAN, the advanced 
contract award notice.  However, in 89 percent of the 50 cases we 
examined, the uniqueness of the contractor was either not 
determined at all (that is, management was fully aware that the 
firm selected was not unique) or was unsupported in fact. 
</UL>
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1135"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is pretty serious stuff. I want to go to another paragraph: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, many more contracts than could be justified were 
awarded without competition—a situation that does not reflect 
the principle of open access to contracting opportunities with 
the federal government.  The awarding of these contracts would 
not withstand public scrutiny.  This situation also imposes 
significant opportunity costs on the contractor community at 
large, which is all too often unfairly denied access to potential 
business that it has a right to compete for. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on.  The Bloc made some very interesting observations. 
The sponsor of today's motion made some interesting statements 
about the fact that certain people's uniqueness was determined 
not by their qualifications or competence but rather by their 
political affiliation. It makes me think back to what the 
department said in its mandate and its role for the CIO.  It 
says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its media monitoring capacity and regional presence, the 
CIO will continue to track current and emerging trends, 
increasingly from a corporate perspective.  It will gather 
information in a timely and targeted manner to enable the 
government and the CIO to respond to citizens' information needs 
efficiently and effectively. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is beautiful.  All of Canada is involved.  Now watch the 
next sentence: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will continue to co-ordinate ministerial visits in Quebec, 
providing factual background information on the communities they 
visit as well as logistical and other support.  The CIO will also 
continue to produce a variety of information documents such as 
calendars of events to help the government in its communications 
efforts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Singled out is Quebec.  Why?  I do not know why.  One can 
surmise; one can speculate.  But there is no question about the 
positive position that has been taken that a region has been 
clearly identified and it has been carefully articulated that is 
what we will be concentrating on.  One of our focuses will be 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned that this country stay together and there is 
reason to concentrate on Quebec.  We want Quebec to feel welcome 
in Canada, but the rest of Canada wants to be welcome in Canada 
also. British Columbia wants to feel as much a part of Canada as 
Quebec, as Alberta, as Saskatchewan and all the other provinces. 
We want every citizen in Canada to be proud of being a Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not find I am sympathetic at all.  I find little sympathy 
in my mind and in my heart to identify one particular area and 
say that is where we will concentrate, and by implication suggest 
that we will not concentrate in the same way on the other parts 
of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish the CIO would have stated clearly that we will 
concentrate on all parts and all regions of Canada and not name 
one in particular and say that by implication it is special. We 
are unique and we are different.  We are not the same, but we are 
equal, and that is a significant issue.  None of us is better 
than another.

<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it seemed to 
me that my colleague from the Canadian Alliance near the end of 
his remarks said that this instrument of electoral organization, 
the CIO, operated only in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he not afraid, though, that one fine morning—at the moment we 
have a minister for electoral organization from the Liberal 
Party of Canada in Quebec, he is using the CIO in Quebec— 
but is it unimaginable that a Liberal Party of Canada organizer 
in Alberta, British Columbia or Saskatchewan might one day also 
use the CIO to unseat Alliance members in their ridings where 
they live?  Canadian unity is not an issue there and yet this is 
what the CIO does.  For the time being, it is doing it in 
Quebec—and this does not distress the member particularly—but the 
day it starts its activities in his riding is the day my 
colleague will perhaps change his tune. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, my question is as follows: is he not worried that the 
government will use its information for purely partisan 
purposes?  And when a party is mentioned, it is not necessarily 
the member's party.  I would like to know how he sees things. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, am I concerned?  Yes I 
am, very much so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member will recall, right at the beginning of my 
remarks I said that the CIO is becoming more of a propaganda 
machine in favour of the government party, rather than to do the 
broader thing, which is to direct the attention of Canadians to 
what is really happening. I tried to make it very clear that what 
we are talking about here is not necessarily facts, but about 
information which is designed to develop attitudes in a 
particular direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Am I concerned that this could be used for electoral purposes? 
You had better believe I am concerned about that.  By the same 
token, I also am not that naive to think that a government that 
is in power would not try to slant the information to shine the 
best possible light on its activities.  That is fair ball.  The 
Bloc does exactly the same thing. When it is used exclusively and 
where it is manipulated, that is where I take exception. There is 
some evidence that has happened and it could easily be used that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons I am very critical about the way in 
which the CIO operates.  It must be encouraged to become very 
balanced in its approach and do as I indicated in the last part 
of my remarks, which is to build a strong Canada where people are 
equal, where provinces are equal, and where we can unite under 
one flag.

the government listens.  We had a plan to reduce the deficit by 
3% of the GDP.  We eliminated the deficit and now there is a 
surplus.  Now the government has a difficulty. When it had a 
deficit it could tell everybody there was no money. Now that it 
has money everybody wants some. The government must balance it. 
Definitely we listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO communications division co-ordinates the government as a 
whole.  I remind my colleague that each department has its own 
responsibility in communications matters to communicate its 
policies and reports. I would like to reassure the hon. member 
that every year there will be a report and it will match what is 
now the system in parliament.  We have a three year plan and 
every year we compare our reports.

saying that Canada does not work.  I recall in 1995 they said the 
country was in bankruptcy, that Quebec should get out of Canada 
because it was in bankruptcy.  We are not in bankruptcy. We are 
one of the best industrial countries in the world.  We can look 
at economic growth and its results in terms of interest rates and 
inflation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As ministers from Quebec we said that we had to inform every 
region of the country of what Canada was doing.  That is what we 
are doing.  Ministers in other parts of the country decided to do 
it.  This was demanded of the CIO by the Quebec ministers. Since 
we wanted to go around the province we needed an organization 
that could do it.  We are different ministers with different 
responsibilities but we wanted to ensure there was a follow-up 
and that when questions were raised they got clear answers and 
solutions.  In the meantime we can be co-ordinated to know 
exactly what as a whole the Government of Canada is doing for its 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the Quebec ministerial tour.  If we would not have 
included it in the report, probably the member would have accused 
us of hiding it.  We are not hiding it.  We put it there because 
we wanted everyone to know.  I hope other regions of the country 
continue to inform Canadians because that is what it is all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
minister for saying that we listen to the people.  Indeed we do. 
I am sure the government has listened to the people to a degree. 
My point is that the government is not listening well enough. 
People are telling us very clearly that while there is a certain 
amount that will be paid down on the debt it is not enough. Taxes 
have not been cut the way they should have been cut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Liberals became the government they said they would 
cut the GST.  They did not.  They are still taking the $7 billion 
which are being contributed by people in Canada who earn $20,000 
or less.  Talk about greed.  The Prime Minister has said that 
ours is a party of greed.  I would like to turn that right around 
and say it is exactly the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to listen then we should listen to the whole 
story.  I commend the minister for the things he has done, but it 
is not enough by any stretch of the imagination.  The Minister of 
National Defence has not listened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is to be a co-ordinating function then let it be a 
co-ordinating function.  Let them listen to all the people.  Let 
the Department of National Defence, let the Minister of Health 
and let the Minister of Natural Resources hear what the situation 
is in British Columbia and in other parts of Canada.  Why is it 
that they will not respond to the people?  That is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all due respect, the minister may be trying but it is not 
enough.  It does not go far enough.  I am not sure that this is 
the best vehicle to use.  I am not at all convinced that is the 
case.  It may be but I need more evidence than what we have 
today.

will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the Canadian Alliance member if, instead of 
spending some $20 million through the CIO and several millions 
to organize the Canada Day celebrations—I have nothing against 
celebrating Canada Day in Quebec and against the fact that the 
government refuses to give the total budget for Canada Day 
celebrations across the country, because I am under the 
impression that it spends more in Quebec than elsewhere—it would 
not be more appropriate to invest that money in health, 
education and other services for which taxpayers have a real 
need?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt:</B>  Madam Speaker, the answer is that 
money can be spent better than it has been spent.  First, we 
clearly need to fix our health care system.   Second, we need to 
cut taxes.  Both those things must happen.  As to whether $20 
million should be spent on CIO, there is enough information out 
there to know that if the government did those things it would 
not have as big a communication problem as it has now. 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to say a few words about the motion before the 
House today.  I say at the outset the our party supports the idea 
of having a Canada Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we disagree with the Bloc motion that the office 
should be disbanded altogether.  There should be a Canada 
Information Office to help provide information about government 
programs across the country.  That is a legitimate role.  It is 
bit of a double standard for the Bloc to say that it should be 
closed entirely.  There are similar agencies in the province of 
Quebec that provide information about Quebec government programs 
to the population of that province.  That is where we stand as a 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the minister would agree that we have to make very sure 
and clear that this is a government information office for the 
Government of Canada and not for the Liberal Party or any other 
party.  That is a fine line that can sometimes be crossed.  It 
may not be by this minister or the next minister, but it could be 
the next minister or next party thereafter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there are government information offices in any democratic 
society it is always very sensitive that the role of the office 
be very clearly defined in terms of providing legitimate 
information and facts about government institutions, programs and 
policies to the population of a particular country and that it 
not cross the line into partisan politics.  Once that happens we 
all have problems in terms of the legitimacy of governments 
programs, government spending and the whole national unity cause, 
which is the most important aspect here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office was established after the 1995 
referendum, which was nearly a disaster.  It was very close 
indeed.  There was a feeling among many people including myself 
that there had to be a co-ordinating office for the Government of 
Canada to provide information, not just in Quebec but across the 
country, about federal institutions and federal programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe we should take a look at its mandate and make sure that 
issues are more clearly defined.  I think that is a legitimate 
question.  These things should always be reviewed.  Maybe we 
should look at the budget of $21 billion.  Perhaps it is not 
necessary today.  Perhaps it is a bit high. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I am told that amount would be enough to keep the 
CBC on air in the four Atlantic provinces, which is important to 
Canadians.  It is also enough money to keep many thousands of 
hospital beds open for many months in all parts of Canada.  That 
is extremely important to our citizens.  There are many other 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the outset, we need a Canadian information office. 
We need a co-ordinating body to provide information.  Most 
provinces do that.  Certainly the Government of Quebec does that. 
There is nothing fundamentally wrong with the idea, but this 
agency has to be scrutinized like any other agency of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some concerns about some of the activities undertaken by 
that office, for example, the monitoring of some activities of 
certain journalists, a lot of which is legitimate, in terms of 
keeping tabs on what certain journalists say about the important 
issues of federalism and national unity.  Sometimes it goes a bit 
overboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Edison Stewart is a very prominent reporter for the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>.  Many members of the House and I know him well.  He 
was monitored by the Canada Information Office because he had 
written pieces that were skeptical of the office in terms of its 
role, mandate and spending.  I do not think some of the things 
said about him were necessary work for the Canada Information 
Office. 
By the way, he is no longer an employee of the Toronto 
<I>Star</I>.  He has taken a job with the treasury board.  He is 
hardly a person who is not supportive of the overall institutions 
of federal government and the promotion of legitimate government 
policies in the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would watch those kinds of things in terms of not going 
overboard as has been done.  The Bloc has released the names of 
some journalists where there has probably been undue monitoring 
of people in the media and the press.  That being said, I think 
there is a legitimate role for the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1995 campaign the criticism was on the other side.  Many 
people were very critical of the Prime Minister and the federal 
government not being better prepared for the referendum, not 
having their ducks in order and not having the plan in place for 
that referendum.  That referendum was almost lost.  That is why 
we need an agency like this one which is a bit of a quarterback 
in terms of providing government information.  It must be 
stressed that it has to be government information, not propaganda 
for the political party in place.  That is a fine line. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also tell my Bloc Quebecois friends that, if I am not 
mistaken, there were Quebec government agencies doing the same 
thing in that province, there were agencies promoting government 
programs in Quebec. The same thing is done in my province of 
Saskatchewan and in every Canadian province. It is important to 
have an agency that tells people about the policies of the 
government, not those of the political party forming the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Saskatchewan, it is the NDP, and also in Manitoba and British 
Columbia. 
Here, it is the Liberal Party.  In the Province of Quebec, it is 
the Parti Quebecois.  It is important to have an agency that 
represents legitimate government interests, and not the partisan 
position of one political party or another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO was established after the 1995 referendum because we 
almost lost the country.  This was a referendum where the 
results were very close, split almost 50-50 between the yes and 
the no vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to remember that national unity is not just 
about information.  We must have a very strong country, and an 
economy that is very strong and very fair for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at the government right now, I see that it has cut 
too deeply into our social programs.  I am thinking in 
particular of medicare, which has been slashed by the Liberal 
government. 
The one big difference between this country and the United 
States lies in social programs such as medicare.  This is 
something that unifies the country from coast to coast.  It is 
very important.  Right now, we have a federal government that is 
only contributing 13, 14 or 15 cents out of every dollar spent 
on medicare throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very clearly how, years ago, Tommy Douglas, the 
leader of the federal NDP, as well as the premier of my province 
of Saskatchewan, established medicare.  In the 1960s—1966 or 
1967—medicare was introduced Canada-wide by Lester B. Pearson.  At 
that time, the federal government paid 50% of the cost of 
medicare in our country, and the provinces paid the other 50%. 
Now, the provinces are paying almost 85% or 87%, while the 
federal government is paying between 13% and 15%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the lack of confidence in our federal government—I am not 
talking about the Liberal Party here—the lack of confidence in 
our social programs, such as medicare, and the lack of 
confidence in our education system and many other things that 
are contributing to the lack of national unity.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In our country, we can now afford to rebuild our social safety 
net, to have the best health care system, the best social 
programs, the best transportation system and the best 
communications system in the world. We have the money to do all 
that. With a very strong economy, we also have the flexibility 
to reorganize the federation immediately. We can recognize 
Quebec as a distinct society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in favour of the Meech Lake accord and worked very hard on 
that proposal ten or twelve years ago. The current Prime 
Minister was against the Meech Lake accord. 
My friends remember vividly the role he played, ten or twelve 
year ago, with Clyde Wells and even with Mr. McKenna, who was 
the Premier of New Brunswick at that time. We saw the beginning 
of a rift during the Meech Lake discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this country, we still need to have an open mind and 
recognize Quebec as being different, unique and distinct. It is 
something we can celebrate everywhere in Canada. We also need 
some flexibility in our federation on the part of the other 
provinces, in another sense, and we need to recognize the right 
of aboriginal people to self-government. This is very important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can do all that since we have the money and we have a 
population that is diversified and open to new ideas. It is 
easier to have new ideas in a strong economy. 
It is easier to be generous when there is money in one's 
pockets.  It is easier to have new ideas when there is money in 
one's pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why national unity is not only about information on 
government, not only about having a new constitution, not only 
about such things but also about social programs like health 
insurance and a communications system such as CBC and 
Radio-Canada to unify this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have now, however, is a government that is in the 
process of slashing the budget of CBC and Radio-Canada.  The 
Liberal government has reduced their budget more than Brian 
Mulroney's Conservative government.  It may be a bit surprising 
to see a Liberal government doing this, to see that it is more 
conservative than the Conservatives, but such actions do not 
promote national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the CBC and Radio-Canada.  They are part of our national 
unity.  We need a good communications system in what has become 
the largest country in the world.  Now we are bigger, in terms 
of geography, than Russia.  In this country, when we talk of 
national unity, we need a public broadcasting system, a public 
communications system. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office is important, but it is only a 
small step toward national unity.  As I said in French, the one 
thing that really sets us apart as Canadians from Americans is 
the fact that we have good, progressive social programs in 
Canada.  I am talking about the national health care program, 
which is progressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of things that unite us.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at my friends in the Bloc Quebecois and I see many 
similarities between Quebec and western Canada, in terms of the 
co-operative movement, the credit unions and the caisses 
populaires.  I see many similarities in terms of community spirit 
and people working together.  I see many similarities in terms of 
the social democrats of the New Democratic Party in western 
Canada and social democrats in the province of Quebec.  If we 
could somehow organize and strengthen our similarities we could 
create a very strong and powerful country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often we concentrate on the negatives, on the things that 
divide us.  Too often we have politicians who practise the 
politics of division.  We see that particularly in this 
parliament.  Basically, we have five regional political parties, 
with Reform being the party of the three western provinces and 
the Conservative Party being the party of the Atlantic.  My party 
represents the west and the Atlantic.  The Liberal Party is 
basically the party of Ontario. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By definition, the Bloc Quebecois is the party of Quebec.  We 
are all divided. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We tend to speak for regional interests.  We could get rid of 
some of that.  We could change our electoral system and bring in 
a mix of proportional representation so that whatever party gets 
20% of the votes in the country would get roughly 20% of the 
seats.  That would foster national unity because it would force 
each party in the country to have a national vision of where it 
wanted to go.  A vote in Quebec for the Canadian Alliance would 
be as important as a vote in downtown Calgary.  It would be the 
same thing for the NDP, the Liberals, the Conservatives or the 
Bloc Quebecois.  It would force political parties to have a 
national vision.  We are one of only three countries in the world 
with more than eight million people which does not have some 
semblance of proportional representation in our electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Along with electoral reform, we could reform this place to make 
the role of members of parliament more meaningful.  We could 
strengthen the committees of the House and provide them with more 
independence.  We could have more free votes and fewer confidence 
votes.  We could take away power from the executive and the prime 
minister and restore power to parliament, where it belongs, to 
make this place more democratic and more accountable.  Those are 
the kinds of things that would foster national unity, a stronger 
country and a sense of nationalism and Canadian identity from one 
ocean to the second ocean to the third ocean, right across the 
country.  Those are the things that have to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, why should a prime minister have so much power that 
the prime minister by himself, and except for one brief exception 
it was always by himself, appoints not just cabinet ministers, 
but the heads of all agencies, crown corporations and supreme 
court justices without any kind of democratic vetting of those 
appointments and without any kind of democratic accounting by the 
relevant parliamentary committee?  That is too much power to 
focus in one person's hands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not even said a word about the Senate, which is probably 
the most important place of political patronage in the history of 
the country, where the prime minister appoints his or her friends 
every few months to an office where they can serve until they are 
75 years old without any democratic accountability or legitimacy 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole question of national unity is one which involves more 
than simply proper information about what the federal government 
is doing.  In fact, that is only a very small part of it.  It 
should involve constitutional change, electoral change and 
democratic change in terms of our institutions.  We should have a 
vision of an economy that is more equal and more just for each 
and every citizen; a vision of a country where the ordinary 
working family gets a more equal part of the national pie, where 
we have social programs that are fully funded, where unemployment 
insurance is fully funded, as well as health care, and where we 
have money for post-secondary education.  If we did those things 
we would do more to foster national unity than anything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look back on the heyday of national unity, which was really in 
the 1960s with the great celebration in Montreal of Expo '67.  We 
had prosperity.  We had great visions.  Social programs were 
being born.  The Canada pension plan was being born.  People were 
happy.  They were celebrating this country.  The Victoria Charter 
was introduced, which would radically change the country.  Six or 
seven provinces had agreed to become officially bilingual.  There 
was all kinds of movement in the country, with inspirational 
leadership from people like Tommy Douglas, Lester Pearson and Bob 
Stanfield, who were in this House, and premiers like Robarts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
great interest to the speech of the hon. member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle. I cannot help but find some incredible 
contradictions between what the member says and who he is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member waxes nostalgic when he talks about the Meech 
Lake accord. But is he not the one who, while at the Privy 
Council Office, between 1993 and 1997—when his voters apparently 
sent him to purgatory for a while—worked very closely with the 
real killers of the Meech Lake agreement on developing the 
current plan B? That is one contradiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a second contradiction. 
The member talks about democracy. Democracy is the backdrop for 
today's opposition motion. This motion is about democracy. When 
the government slashes the CBC's budgets, it does more than just 
that; it interferes in the day to day management of the CBC's 
activities. The Lester affair is the most recent example, but 
there were many others before. The government is beginning to 
control the information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1960, we have gone from tailored to ready-to-wear clothing 
and from restaurant to ready-to-eat, fast food. Now, they are 
working on the ready-to-think, and the member is involved in the 
process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is trying to manipulate the information in 
Canada. They talk about the greatest country in the world, about 
the greatest democracy; that is another contradiction in what 
the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle says. 
How should we interpret the member's position on Bill C-20? He 
talks about democracy, but this legislation will create an 
imbalance and arbitrarily set a majority for a future 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member aware that, when Ukraine decided to separate, the 
Russian government voted a law similar to Bill C-20 to prevent 
it from doing so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member, who had the opportunity to work in the 
Privy Council Office and who is familiar with plan B, to tell us 
if he worked on that plan. I would like to hear him on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not work on plan B, 
because I have been an MP since 1997 and I was an MP before 1993. 
I worked as a consultant for many people and organizations in 
the intervening years, but I had nothing to do with plan B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member spoke of the Meech Lake accord.  I was a supporter of 
Meech Lake, because I thought it was important to recognize 
Quebec as a distinct society, and the vast majority of Quebecers 
supported this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa signed the accord.  I 
remember very well when he signed it.  The Quebec National 
Assembly supported the Meech Lake accord and voted for it.  I 
remember that day very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the failure of the accord, through the fault not just of 
the current Prime Minister, but of Clyde Wells and many others, 
we went through a crisis, and then, we had the Charlottetown 
accord and another referendum.  I was a Meech Lake supporter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also referred to the CBC.  Our party is the only one in this

Canadian politics for so many years and has had the opportunity

important.  The reason for the CBC in the first place, many years 
ago, was to provide a linkage from coast to coast via a public 
broadcaster by which Canadians could get to know their country 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of its mandate was to provide regional broadcasting so that 
one region could hear about another region of the country.  That 
was a very important part of the mandate of the CBC originally. 
We could hear more about the Newfoundland fishery, or the 
prairies, what was happening to aboriginal people, the north, the 
province of Quebec and so on.  Those were all very important 
parts of the CBC mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of that is disappearing.  The federal government over the 
last number of years has made numerous cutbacks, which have put 
pressure on the CBC to make cutbacks and lay off people.  That is 
very unfortunate in terms of national unity.

do not know if he did it maliciously or because he is 
misinformed, but, at the beginning of his speech, the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle said that there was an information agency in 
Quebec. If this is the case, I would like the member to name 
that information agency, because I live in Quebec and I have 
never heard of such an agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Was he mistaken or was he referring to Communication-Québec? This 
is a government agency that is responsible for promoting all 
Quebec government programs and that was responsible for 
providing information on federal programs until the minister 
took that away from Communication-Québec. He decided to go 
through the CIO because it was easier to manipulate than 
Communication-Québec. I would like the member to correct what he 
said or to give me the name of the agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Mr. Speaker, maybe I was not clear enough. I 
said that, in all Canadian provinces, there are departmental 
agencies that provide information on government programs to the 
public. There may not be one agency that provides information on 
everything, but each department provides information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government is no different than any other provincial government. 
I know that because I have often seen information from the 
Government of Quebec in <I>La Presse</I>, <I>Le Droit</I> and other 
newspapers. It is perfectly normal for a government to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But I said in my speech that it is one thing to provide 
information on government programs, but quite another to provide 
information on the party in office.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise (West Nova, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my hon. colleague from Kings—Hants. I am 
pleased to speak to the motion put forward today condemning the 
government for using yet another federal agency, this time the 
Canada Information Office, to hand out lucrative, untendered 
government contracts to friends of the Liberal Party in exchange 
for support or donations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to start by reviewing some of the history behind 
the Canada Information Office, the forces behind its creation and 
its mandate.  I then want to examine some of the evidence that 
has been presented to the House in recent days showing that, 
contrary to treasury board policy, large contracts were given to 
individuals and companies without going to public tender. These 
individuals and companies, in turn, gave money and resources to 
the Liberal Party of Canada.  Finally, I want to link the 
questionable practices of the Canada Information Office with 
similar conduct of this government in other departments, such as 
HRDC and public works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will show that incidents at the Canada Information Office are 
not isolated, but part of a larger picture that shows 
consistently and convincingly that this government in its dying 
days has lost its moral compass and that this is a government 
which is corrupt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office was born out of the failure of the 
Prime Minister to deal with the 1995 Quebec referendum.  As 
members will recall, in the six months leading up to the 
referendum the Prime Minister's strategy for winning the vote was 
like so many other issues of vital concern to Canadians, and that 
was to do nothing.  Don't worry, be happy, the Prime Minister 
reassured us.  We all remember how the referendum turned out. 
The Prime Minister came within one-half of a per cent of 
destroying this great country founded by the Conservative Party 
and built through the hard work of four generations of Quebecers 
and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians were outraged at this great failure by the Liberal 
Prime Minister.  In the wake of his self-made disaster, the Prime 
Minister did what all good Liberals do when faced with public 
demand for action on an issue.  He created a new government 
program and threw millions of dollars at it.  Thus, the Canada 
Information Office was born. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did this not because it would provide some long term national 
unity benefit, but because Liberals always do what is good for 
the Liberal Party first, not what is good for the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an important distinction to be made here.  Unlike 
previous Conservative prime ministers, such as the Right Hon. Joe 
Clark, who always did what was best for the country first, this 
Prime Minister ignores the serious problems facing Canada by 
giving voters the perception of doing something constructive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the fine Liberal tradition of creating taxpayer funded 
bureaucratic solutions, on July 10, 1996 the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage announced that she was going to be the saviour of our 
country.  How was she going to save the country?  She would 
create this new government agency called the Canada Information 
Office. She would find $20 million to run it and solve all of our 
national unity problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister made the announcement, she could not say what 
kind of information the office would provide, how it would 
distribute the money and where its budget would come from.  She 
was also at a loss for words to explain why the Liberals were 
creating a new bureaucracy that would duplicate public 
information operations already in place.

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about everything the heritage minister announced that day 
was already being done by the federal government in other 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apparently it did not occur to the Liberal brain trust that 
public outrage following the 1995 referendum might be an 
indication that the current propaganda bureaucracy was 
ineffective and should be scrapped or replaced.  Of course not. 
It meant that the Liberals should spend even more taxpayer 
dollars on a brand new government agency.  Let me quote Toronto 
<I>Star</I> columnist Rosemary Speirs, who summed up the 
minister's announcement like this: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The journalists quickly realized that the Canadian heritage 
minister had only the vaguest notion of what this new $20 
million-a-year `non-partisan' agency is supposed to do.  She 
couldn't give examples, couldn't break down the budget, and when 
she finally called her press conference to a close, she left 
exasperation and puzzlement in her wake. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And so the Canada Information Office was born.  What happens 
when we have 50 government bureaucrats sitting around with no 
mandate except that they know they have $20 million a year which 
they must spend?  Is it within the realm of possibility that some 
of these millions of taxpayers' dollars might end up in the 
pockets of friends of the Liberal Party? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hard as it might be for us to believe it, it appears that is 
exactly what has happened.  Access to information documents 
released this week show that of the millions of dollars spent by 
the Canada Information Office each year, more than 20% of the 
contracts awarded by the office are given out without 
competition, including many that are worth more than the $25,000 
threshold set by treasury board to go out for public tender. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous two years $2.6 million was given to two 
businesses whose owners have in turn given substantially of their 
time and money to the Liberal Party of Canada.  More than $1.6 
million was handed to Communication et Strategie Inc. of Montreal 
in a joint contract with Groupe Cible between April 1, 1997 and 
December 31, 1999.  Groupe Cible is headed by Serge Paquette, a 
defeated Liberal Party candidate and a long time party organizer 
in Quebec.  This money was used to plan tours and handle media 
relations for Quebec ministers, a function normally done by the 
staff of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another beneficiary of the Canada Information Office was 
Tremblay Guittet Communications Inc. of Ottawa, a company owned 
in part by Michèle Tremblay, who was press secretary to former 
Liberal Prime Minister John Turner, and a long time supporter of 
the minister responsible for the Canada Information Office and 
the Quebec political minister.  Tremblay received an annual 
contract of $53,500 to advise the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services, which has been renewed every year since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other Liberals have also benefited from contracts given out by 
the Canada Information Office.  Richard Mongeau, through one of 
his companies, gave $15,000 to the Liberal Party.  In return he 
received $389,000 in legal and communications contracts.  He was 
handed $144,000 for advice he gave to the Canada Information 
Office in 1996-97 and was paid $160,000 to provide legal advice 
to the office in 1997 and 1998. On January 13 of this year he was 
appointed as a Quebec superior court justice.  That is not a bad 
return for a $15,000 investment.  The list goes on.  These 
revelations are shocking, but unfortunately they are not 
isolated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would only make one conclusion from the evidence we have 
examined today.  This is a corrupt government, rotten to its 
core.  Canadians would be well served if the Prime Minister were 
to call an election this fall so that voters could show this 
group the door and replace it with a government led by the Right 
Hon. Joe Clark, who is dedicated to solving public policy 
problems through honest means.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the hon. member should speak to his colleagues who are 
supporting these ministerial tours in Quebec so that we can 
inform Quebecers of these programs and the programs of the 
Government of Canada.  At the same time, we could receive 
information and advice from Quebecers so that we can have 
programs that they really need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Mark Muise:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is interesting to see the 
minister stand up and speak to things that we should be looking 
at.  There are many ways of strengthening Canada and its 
institutions.  One way we could strengthen the institutions is by 
ensuring, through proper funding and proper organization, that 
the CBC continues to represent its various regions, not just from 
a Toronto and central Canadian perspective, but from Atlantic 
Canada, Quebec, the west coast and the prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an institution that was the pride of Canada for so many 
years.  It showed Canada from various parts of the country.  What 
is happening to the CBC at this point is simply unacceptable.  It 
is an affront on the Canadian people.  It is an affront on what 
we have built in this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that we should keep in mind is that the CBC, 
by being broadcast only from a central region, does not show 
Canada to Canadians.  It shows Canadians what central Canada and 
Toronto see Canadians to be.  That is one of the ways the 
government could move ahead and make Canada better and its people 
more proud of who and what they are.

like to commend my hon. colleague from West Nova for his 
extremely timely and effective remarks about this very important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion today, which identifies the problems with the Canada 
Information Office, particularly in terms of evidence suggesting 
that the government is using the Canada Information Office as a 
means to direct lucrative contracts to appropriately placed 
Liberal Party supporters, either financial supporters or 
supporters in kind, is very disturbing given the degree to which 
the information being assembled and utilized by the Canada 
Information Office carries with it some very significant 
ramifications in terms of national unity.  Clearly, the Canada 
Information Office cannot be used as a Liberal trough from which 
supporters can drink and feed themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government is not a make work program.  The Liberals are prone 
to utilizing these agencies as make work programs for supporters, 
whether it is HRDC, CIDA or, in this case, the Canada Information 
Office. The government is clearly out of control.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In lieu of some general policy direction, a coherent and 
cohesive set of policies and the vision to lead Canada in the 
21st century, the government has focused and continues to focus, 
on an increasing level, on simply funnelling as much largesse to 
its supporters as possible.  It is displaying the classic signs 
of a government ready to be defeated.  At the time of the next 
federal election I think there will be a very sound message from 
across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last election there was a very sound message from 
Atlantic Canada.   We all know that in Canada some of the 
greatest shifts and some of the greatest revolutions begin in 
Atlantic Canada, and the last federal election was an indication 
of that.  We believe that in the next election Canadians all 
across Canada will follow the leadership demonstrated by Atlantic 
Canadians in the last election when they said that they were 
tired of a tired government and that they were ready for a new 
vision and a more ethical and visionary leadership at a very 
critical time in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's manipulation of information and manipulation of 
the media is not confined simply to the Canada Information 
Office.  The fact is that every government department has become 
pervasively focused on spin doctoring and media manipulation. 
There has never been a government as visionless and as focused on 
next week's polls as this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is so focused on next week's polls that it does 
not even try to provide policies and directions for the next 
century.  Unfortunately Canadians are going to pay a significant 
price for that in the next 20 or 30 years as they realize, and as 
the report last week from McGill University professors indicated, 
that the government ranks dead last of all the governments since 
the second world war in terms of economic performance and vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The McGill study also identified the government that ranked 
first.  The number one government in terms of economic 
performance and vision on economic issues since World War II was 
none other than that of the Progressive Conservative government 
of Brian Mulroney.  It must be terribly embarrassing to members 
opposite, in particular to the Prime Minister with his very thin 
skin and his inability and distrust of anyone who is even vaguely 
critical of him, to have to read in the newspapers and in the 
reports from erudite academics and economists that his government 
has been dead last. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of trying to manipulate information and manipulate the 
media, maybe his government should actually try to do something 
about that abysmal record and actually start trying to develop 
some of the same vision and long term focus that the previous 
government had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I referred to other departments and agencies within government 
that are also manipulating information and manipulating the media 
as much as possible and, most offensively, using taxpayers' money 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In February, at the time of the budget, the finance minister's 
speech, the speech that ultimately was provided and ended up as 
part of the budget document, the budget speech 2000, was 
different in several areas from the actual speech provided.  I 
have the <I>Hansard</I> here in front of me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reason to believe and sources to suggest that the 
reason the finance minister deviated significantly from his text 
and added several paragraphs that seemed almost incongruent with 
the rest of the text, was because of information coming from the 
media in terms of how the policies or the budget was being spun, 
what the focus was for the media, what policies the media was 
actually taking hold of and demonstrating a greater level of 
interest in and, alternatively, what policies the media was less 
interested in.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to our sources, the finance minister actually changed 
his speech for the House to try to focus more on what would get 
the greatest level of media hits that night.  He changed a 
document prepared by the finance department people for him to 
provide the budget speech.  He changed it directly to try to 
further manipulate the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government of spin doctors.  This is what we call 
focus group economics and poll driven policies.  The nation is 
suffering from a lack of vision and poll driven incrementalism. 
Canadians need bold, visionary, courageous leadership similar to 
the leadership of the previous government under the Progressive 
Conservatives and the leadership of Brian Mulroney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a government by polls, certainly not guided by 
principle.  I would suggest that the media plays an extremely 
important role in the democratic process in terms of showing that 
information is disseminated to the public in as clear and 
unbiased way as possible.  For the government to intentionally 
manipulate the media, either through the Canada Information 
Office or through other Byzantine and circuitous means as those 
that allegedly occurred with the finance minister, and probably 
every ministry opposite, really compromises our democratic 
framework within which the media plays such a very important 
role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that if the media realized the degree to which 
this government was playing the media collectively like a 
Stradivarius to try to spin its messages out and also minimize 
any negative political fallout, the media would be increasingly 
offended.  The journalistic integrity of the media is being 
challenged by a government that is certainly not interested in 
promoting the types of ethics that should be an integral part of 
any government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we are addressing the issue of the 
manipulation of information and the use of the Canada Information 
Office as a Liberal Party trough in the House.  It is also very 
important for us to recognize the degree to which spin doctoring 
and media manipulation has become routine for the government in 
every department and every ministry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is just the tip of the iceberg.  I hope all members, 
including backbenchers opposite in the Liberal government, would 
agree that this type of obvious manipulation needs to end and 
that the government needs to significantly improve its ethics in 
this regard.

He should have been here.  I have been here since 1984.  I lived

nine years Canadians had the good sense to throw them out of 
office.  They left the country in a terrible state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, the minister referred to 
what he called my courage in raising this matter.  I expect that 
he should also thank the previous government for having the 
courage to implement policies that were controversial, 
politically risky, but in fact enabled the government to reduce 
and eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are not simply my opinions.  <I>The Economist</I> magazine 
said that the credit for deficit reduction in Canada belonged to 
the previous government's structural reforms, including fee 
trade, the GST, and deregulation of financial services, 
transportation and energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am glad the hon. minister cited that he had been a member of 
the House since 1984 because he and his merry band of opposition 
members at that time were actively fighting and trying to thwart 
the attempts of the Conservative government to bring some level 
of economic vision into the Government of Canada.  He was 
fighting the GST. He was fighting free trade.  He was fighting 
the policies the Liberal government has embraced and utilized to 
eliminate the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the report of several McGill University professors and 
economists ranked the Liberal government as being dead last in 
economic performance since World War II and ranked the Mulroney 
government as being number one.  It cited several issues.  It 
cited the courageous government of Brian Mulroney that had the 
vision and energy to implement the policies Canada needed, even 
though there was significant political risk.  It also cited the 
blatant failure of the current Liberal government in losing nine 
cents of value in the Canadian dollar over the last seven years, 
nine cents in the share value of Canada.   Under the tenure of 
the Liberal government nine cents in the Canadian dollar have 
been lost.  This is disgraceful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also cited lagging productivity under this government.  Woody 
Allen once said that 80% of life is just showing up.  For this 
government and for the Prime Minister it is about 95%.  Canadians 
are tired of a government that is merely interested in just 
showing up.  They are tired of a caretaker government, a cruise 
control government, at a time of unprecedented global change in a 
hypercompetitive global environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the government to get off its collective duff and 
to do something to try to build a better Canada as we enter the 
21st century, not just simply sit back and take credit for the 
policy successes of the previous government while it 
hypocritically attacks that government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government, this minister and this Prime Minister opposite 
should be thanking Brian Mulroney and his government for the 
types of policies that enabled them to do nothing for seven years 
and look fairly good on paper despite that fact. The Canadian 
economy is actually doing fairly well despite their best efforts 
to have it do otherwise.

In this context, the Liberal Party of Canada put its plan B into 
action, which included the creation of the Canada Information 
Office, the “grab bag” propaganda and patronage agency that 
takes care of the Liberal government's buddies and where 
contracts are often awarded twice or three times.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially, the CIO was the responsibility of the heritage 
minister, but since June 1998 it has become the responsibility 
of the public works minister, who happens to be the chief 
organizer of the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this just a coincidence? I find it very hard to believe. The 
opportunity to crush the sovereignists is too good and the 
minister is certainly not holding back. In fact, when looking at 
the money that was given out, it becomes obvious that that money 
was given out mostly in Quebec, to incite us to change sides. 
When the proponents of a particular ideological option get to 
that point, it means they are desperate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, the CIO has a $20 million budget and 85 full time 
employees. I do not understand how the government can tell 
people that these 85 employees are not competent to do the work 
they were hired to do. Why is it saying that? Because it is 
contracting out work that could be done by CIO employees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take, for example, the case of Michèle Tremblay, who was awarded 
contracts in the amount of $53,000 from public works to advise 
the minister responsible for the CIO. During the same period 
she was awarded contracts from the CIO to organize visits by 
federal ministers and to write speeches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there are competent individuals within the CIO who could 
do that kind of work. Even the minister has on his own staff 
people who could do it. That is why we have political attachés 
and assistants. This is part of their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada, with its high-mindedness and infinite 
gratitude to those who have contributed to it, awards contracts 
and underestimates the ability of the people working for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During this time, communications and strategy obtained contracts 
as well for the ministers' visit to Quebec.  Could this overlap 
be an error by officials?  I strongly doubt it.  The Minister of 
Public Works told us earlier that the CIO is his responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was as well the case of Richard Mongeau, which is also 
interesting.  He was awarded contracts by the Canada Information 
Office as a legal adviser.  In the same period, he served as 
acting executive director of the information service, and his 
communications firm billed the CIO for these activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear, therefore, that improvisation is the watchword at 
the CIO and is the creation of the person in charge, namely the 
Minister of Public Works.  Despite what the Minister of Public 
Works said, a number of contracts were awarded without tender. 
Between June 1997 and March 1999, over 30 contracts worth over 
$25,000 were awarded this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Permit me to quote an article that appeared in <I>Le Devoir</I> on June 1, 
2000 under the byline of Manon Cornellier, who said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the present minister assumed his duties, 28 contracts have 
been awarded without call for tender, and some companies have 
benefited from this approach more than once.   They include the 
Groupe Cible, $27,000, Média Q, $37,500, Ekos Research 
Associates, $53,500, Muséobus, $27,750, Densan Consultants, 
$60,000— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And I could name even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might think we were back in the age of patronage under former 
premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau.  Small favours were numerous 
in exchange for a small contribution to party coffers.  The 
situation became totally ridiculous with Louis-Alexandre 
Taschereau even appointing his son to his office.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Tremblay Communications received a one million dollar grant 
after donating $2,000 to the Liberal Party of Canada between 1997 
and 1998. Groupaction, which received $46,000 worth of contracts, 
donated $6,000 to the Liberal Party of Canada during the same 
period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is more to this tragicomedy. Through access to 
information, the only way we can get information from this 
government, we learned that CIO has files on some reporters. 
After learning that the HRDC big brother had a longitudinal 
labour force file on 34 million Canadians, we now learn that an 
information office which was to disseminate propaganda for Canada 
also has that kind of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That reminds me of George Orwell's <I>1984</I>. I loved that book and 
I still consider it a masterpiece, though I hope very much that 
its content would remain in the realm of fiction. George Orwell 
was right however. Apparently, he was some sort of visionary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three months ago, I thought I had a right to some privacy but I 
now realize that the Canadian government has databases on things 
which are part of my private life. This is a serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Coming back to files on reporters, we learn that Pierre 
Maisonneuve has a tendency to be relatively neutral; that Vincent 
Marissal rarely makes editorial judgments; that the editorial 
team of <I>La Presse</I> is very critical toward the federal 
government, and there is more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the existence of such a file be justified? What is its 
purpose? Why should we have files on the ideological content of 
the media? Are we living under a dictatorship? I would like to 
get some explanation from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel even more concerned when I think that there could be 
similar files on intellectuals, artists, politicians and 
sovereignists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government violates the intellectual freedom of 
people and intrudes on our privacy. What has become of this 
government's sense of ethics? I find this situation unhealthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet the public works minister sees this as a simple press 
review, while the Prime Minister considers it is a compliment to 
journalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time flies and I will now conclude. I would simply like to 
remind our viewers that it is very important, from an ethical 
point of view, that the CIO be dismantled as soon as possible. 
This office is only concerned with handing out lucrative 
contracts to those close to the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the 20 million dollar budget would be better used 
in various programs that would be much more beneficial for 
Quebecers and Canadians. All of this propaganda and search for 
an identity is shameful. We all know that we are Quebecers and 
we do not need to hand out flags. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no longer any economic justification for Canada's 
existence. Let us look at its history. Canada was built solely 
on economic considerations. 
The railway was built to link the provinces at a time when trade 
flowed from east to west. Now that it flows from north to south 
and that protectionism has given way to free trade, the Canadian 
government is using culture to stir up national sentiment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I trust and hope that all my colleagues will vote for this 
motion. However, the Liberals will have to pay the price of 
their mismanagement in the next election, because Canadians will 
not accept being manipulated by a propaganda office.

Quebecois, which is part of our job as an opposition party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our job is to make the government accountable for its actions 
and the way it carries out its responsibilities. Our job is also 
to make the government accountable for how its spends taxpayers' 
money and the fees for services it collects from its citizens. 
The government must serve the people who voted it in and elected 
members of parliament such as us, in the Bloc Quebecois, so that 
we in the House control and monitor government activity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, we are going our duty today reasserting accusations 
against a government which in our view—and it is a view shared 
by a number of opposition members in this House—is mismanaging 
public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is using it for purely partisan ends to help friends of the 
regime, friends of a particular party, buddies who are getting 
rich thanks to said party which is looking out for them, giving 
them jobs and contracts, making things easy for them even though 
it does not need the services of these consultants. Civil 
servants who are paid to provide a public service cannot do their 
jobs because the work has been contracted out to friends of the 
regime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will never apologize for playing this role, for fulfilling 
our obligation to monitor, putting questions to the ministers and 
demanding answers from them, asking the citizens, when the time 
comes for them to elect new members of parliament, to punish the 
lack of answers, the government's failure to account for the way 
it spends taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond the numbers, the contracts and the identity of the people 
who benefited from these contracts, which were made public in the 
House, the propensity of the government to spend money on the so 
called “national unity” issue, on informing citizens about 
Canada, is part of a greater plan, plan B. This is what I want to 
talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite obviously, the activities of the Canada Information 
Office, established in 1996, a few months after the October 30 
1995 referendum, are part of a comprehensive plan aimed at 
countering sovereignty and the rise of the sovereignist feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan is aimed at countering a project which, as I was 
saying earlier, is legitimate and supported by Quebec political 
parties that have members elected at the national assembly and at 
the House of Commons. These parties are suggesting eminently 
democratic means for Quebec to attain sovereignty and believe 
such attainment of sovereignty must be done with the enlightened 
consent of Quebecers in a democratic framework and according to 
democratic rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Plan B, which includes this Canada Information Office and its 
activities, is specifically directed at countering that march of 
Quebecers on sovereignty. That is what is disturbing and shocking 
for Quebecers in general, not only for those who support the 
sovereignist option but also for those who, even though they 
choose Canada as an option for the future, are seeing to what 
extent public funds are squandered on the promotion of Canadian 
unity, which does not need public funds to be promoted in such a 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a sensible plan A competing with the plan sovereignist 
Quebecers have for Quebec, the debate might be held in more 
interesting and stimulating conditions for those Quebecers who 
have still not made up their mind and want to know what is the 
best option for the future of Quebec and its citizens. No, it 
seems there is now a need to resort to a Canada Information 
Office and to excessive amounts spent on all kinds of ludicrous 
contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned this morning as an example a contract to study the 
status of provincial legislation with regard to the constitution 
amending process.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has already been done by academics and constitutional 
experts. It has certainly been done by the Department of Justice 
as well as officials from the Privy Council, but it had to be 
redone by the Canada Information Office. No doubt this was done 
as well by the Council of Canadian Unity, in which this 
government also invests major amounts to promote Canadian unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An element of this plan B is the activities of the Canada 
Information Office. But the government does not stop there when 
it comes to plan B. It spends millions of dollars to promote 
identity through the flag, which must be shown in all public 
events where the government has invested money. It even wanted to 
have it displayed in the works of every Quebec writer who 
receives a federal grant from the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. Writers and publishers in Quebec forcefully opposed 
this, until the government withdrew its idea of imposing the 
Canadian flag in all books published in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government scares Quebecers with the issue of 
partition, with the idea that the Quebec territory should be 
divided in several parts, this is also part of a plan B that does 
not lead anywhere, since the support for sovereignty is stable 
and is even increasing these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Foreign Affairs, which was probably inspired 
by the architect of plan B, even offered a catechism to its 
diplomats to teach them how to answer sovereignists who are 
abroad to promote their democratic project all over the world. 
People abroad have the right to know that, in Quebec, there are 
some of us who support that option for Quebec's future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Plan B culminated with Bill C-20 on the so-called clarity. This 
is a bill that we reviewed here, in totally unacceptable 
conditions, conditions that violated the most elementary 
democratic practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The senators are now questioning the bill, because they too feel 
that it is absolutely unnecessary for the promotion of Canadian 
unity. On the contrary, it could hinder those who want to promote 
that unity. Bill C-20 also poses major constitutional problems 
and puts into question, as argued by the senators, the equality 
of the two houses of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not need big brother. The Minister of Human Resources 
Development finally realized that she should not keep a database 
on Quebecers and other Canadians. We do not need the BIC/CIO 
brother either. We do not need an office that will hold 
information about journalists and will probably have information 
on people like the Bloc Quebecois members in this House who 
promote sovereignty. We do not need an office that does this kind 
of work. Canadians do not have to pay for that and nor do 
Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through its propaganda disguised as information, the Liberal 
government will not succeed in winning Quebecers over, 
identifying them to or having them identify to the Canada that 
the Liberals want and are building. This is not how they will 
succeed in promoting Canada. This is not how they will contribute 
to a truly democratic debate on the future of Canada and Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an additional question for my colleague. The motion 
before us, by the Bloc Quebecois, expresses very clearly its wish 
to have the CIO dismantled. Could my colleague tell us how, why, 
and on what basis this office should be quickly dismantled? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the Prime Minister of Canada travelling the world 
over to say that we have the best country in the world, and 
spending $20 million to convince Canadians that what he says is 
true, I really have to wonder whether the government is out of 
touch with the grassroots. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal ministers came to my region with their great 
speeches. Where I come from, we are polite and when people come 
to visit, we welcome them with tact. So, they came. What did 
they do? They invited people who agreed with them. Unfortunately 
for them, they did not know we also wanted to be there. So we 
showed up. However, we noticed that as soon as they saw us, they 
no longer had anything to say. They did not say why they were 
there, which was to meet their political friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this amounts to taking Canadians for fools. Yet they too 
might want a piece of the pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Blueberry pie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Blueberry pie, even better. 
In my region, we have the finest blueberries of the whole world. 
I must say that I find the government's behaviour insulting. I 
ask my colleague to tell us why the CIO must be dismantled 
without delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Madam Speaker, I will answer that quickly. 
If there are good reasons to dismantle the Department of Human 
Resources Development because of the abuses there, there are even 
more reasons to dismantle the Canada Information Office, with the 
abuses we are revealing and will continue to reveal in the near 
future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives us an opportunity show that this government is using 
old methods, trying to reward the friends of the party, who 
contribute unlimited amounts to its coffers, with no thought for 
the public, which is paying these people, who then turn around 
and hand some of the money over to the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I would like to add something else, which 
concerns you.  One result of these tours organized by the Canada 
Information Office is that the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs can come to my riding and speak to community groups. Two 
weeks ago, he came to my riding of Beauharnois to meet with 
members of community groups.  He did not invite me.  He did not 
have the courtesy to invite the member who knows these community 
groups very well, who works with them all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he visited Saint-Lambert, he invited the member for 
Saint-Lambert.  He wanted her to be there when he spoke to 
community groups, at taxpayers' expense, at the expense of 
citizens, who were treated to a visit by the government. Through 
the work of the Canada Information Office, they saw the 
government investing in tours that gave ministers an opportunity 
to talk about the government's ideas for supporting community 
groups with a member such as you, but not with a member such as 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something very partisan about what this government is 
doing and about the manner in which it wishes to inform the 
public about its services.  It excludes Bloc Quebecois members 
when it comes to tours but includes Liberal Party members. There 
is something very unhealthy about the way this Liberal government 
delivers government services. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada (Brossard—La Prairie, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to take part in this extremely important debate, 
which goes to the very heart of one key challenge of the 
Government of Canada and indeed of all democratic governments on 
this planet, that of communicating with Canadians. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT40"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT40"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1315

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that context, I would like to briefly discuss this challenge 
and the role of the Canada Information Office, or CIO, in helping 
the government address it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, why is the government increasingly focussed on 
communications? There are many reasons. One of them is that it 
is important to all Canadians, which public opinion polls have 
shown convincingly. Not only are Canadians receptive to the 
information provided to them but they want more. Furthermore, it 
is the government's responsibility, and I insist on the word 
responsibility, to explain its policies and programs to 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us be practical. What good are the best programs and 
services if Canadians do not know about them or how to access 
them? It would be like a hockey coach who would prepare a 
wonderful game plan in his office with his assistants but who 
would forget to tell his players about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have the right to get this information. I repeat, they 
have the right. They want to be informed, which is totally 
legitimate. Therefore, the question is not whether we must 
provide the information. The question, and I was going to say the 
challenge, is to figure out how to get that information to them 
and make sure it is useful and relevant. As I was saying earlier, 
this is a challenge that is facing all the communications 
agencies in all the democracies throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are literally bombarded with a multitude of messages. We 
all know that. We just have to walk through the streets of 
Toronto, Montreal or Vancouver, or go to the movies, or watch 
television, or listen to the radio, or read the newspapers. Our 
senses are inundated with hundreds if not thousands of poster 
panels, advertisements and messages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be effective, the Government of Canada, or any other 
government for that matter, must compete. It must compete if it 
wants its communications to be useful, especially if it wants to 
reach all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can easily understand that the fragmentation of audiences 
makes this all the more difficult. The government can no longer 
mass communicate with a “one size fits all” approach. It must 
learn about the particular information needs of different 
segments of the population. It needs to know which methods work 
best to reach each of these segments, whether it be television, 
print, radio, direct mail, the Internet, etc. The government must 
learn how to harness new technology which offers new 
possibilities while at the same time creating a whole new set of 
challenges, imposing new ways of doing things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with the complexities of modern communications and a 
heightened expectation by citizens to be informed about and 
involved in the governing process, many democratic governments 
around the world and provincial governments here in Canada have 
reviewed their communications approaches or are in the process of 
doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in that context that the Government of Canada, which is no 
different from other democratic governments, has given a specific 
mandate to an ad hoc cabinet committee on government 
communications, which was struck two years ago. The mandate is 
extremely clear. The objective is to bring greater oversight to 
government communications and foster a more corporate, citizen 
focused approach. By corporate we mean communicating with one 
voice, that of the Government of Canada as a whole, as an entity.

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While individual departments communicate quite well about their 
respective programs and services, we need to communicate about 
the government's overall program, key priorities, and a wide 
array of programs and services. Canadians want this overall 
picture so they can assess whether they feel the government's 
agenda reflects their own needs and priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was in that spirit that the Canada Information Office was 
created in 1996 and has become one of the government's primary 
tools in listening to and speaking with Canadians. 
In that capacity, it provides corporate communications advice 
and support to the Government of Canada. It collaborates with 
other departments and agencies as well as with partners outside 
government, fostering innovation and the sharing of best 
communications practices. It develops communications products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, it develops citizens' guides to government programs 
and services. The CIO also undertakes public opinion research and 
media monitoring activities. 
These are essential corporate tools to help 
the government understand and respond more appropriately to the 
information needs of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministerial tours in Quebec are another tool used to 
communicate with citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> To do propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> It provides an opportunity to listen to 
their views, needs and concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Community-based outreach activities also provide a two-way flow 
of information to and from citizens. For instance, workshops on 
Y2K preparedness, the so-called Y2K bug, electronic commerce, and 
other topics were conducted last year in response to an expressed 
need for this kind of information. These are but two examples. I 
could go on with many more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about another area of activity of the CIO, the 
organization's support of government activities relating to 
national unity. I say this with great pride: National unity 
continues to be a key priority of this government, and as such, 
all departments and agencies have a role to play in that regard. 
Obviously, if the Canadian public does not know what its federal 
government is doing, it has every right to ask whether the 
Canadian federation is relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The value of our federation is rooted in feelings and 
sensitivity, but it is also an ideal to reach for. All of this 
should be expressed in initiatives and actions. The Canadian 
government has the responsibility to inform Canadians on these 
initiatives and actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO's role in this regard involves promoting the value of 
Canada by providing information to Canadians on what the country 
has to offer. It supports various projects that demonstrate how 
the government's programs and services are relevant to citizens 
and that encourage Canadians to exchange their ideas and 
experiences about the greatness of Canada. This too is about 
communicating, communicating the value of Canada, and therefore 
the importance of its unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is almost up I will have to cut my remarks short, 
but I am sure my colleagues opposite will give me a nice 
opportunity to develop more fully what I have to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would just like to give quickly a few examples. The 
1-800-O-Canada, another program— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry, but I have to 
interrupt the hon. member. The indication I have is that the hon. 
member wanted to make a 10 minute speech. If that is not right, 
the hon. member can go on for another 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, I was explaining that I 
would have liked a bit more time to talk about other CIO 
activities, and I thank you for giving me this opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO is a national organization, with projects and activities 
all across the country that benefit Canadians from every region.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I know very well that the comments of members opposite are not 
committed on record, but I find it quite disturbing that people who 
promote democracy would be trying to disrupt my right to speak by 
their constant commentaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information office is only one of several measures 
and organizations helping to demonstrate our commitment to 
improving communications with Canadians. I am coming now to the 
other examples to which I have briefly referred and which include 
the 1-800-O-Canada toll free information line launched last year, 
the redesign of the Canada website to make it more user friendly 
and the service Canada initiative which seeks to create single 
points of access for citizens across the country to information 
on Government of Canada programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office is an integral part of this 
overall effort to improve communications with Canadians. It has a 
duty, an obligation and a responsibility to take this on for all 
Canadians. The role and responsibility assumed by the Canadian 
government in this regard are not only a responsibility on the 
governmental action just because it gives us great pleasure to do 
it or because we feel like it, it is a matter of strong 
democratic values. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A government that does not communicate with it's population is a 
government that is failing in it's democratic duties. The CIO is 
one of the tools at our disposal to fulfil our democratic duty 
and responsibility to inform the Canadian population on what it 
is we are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO is doing such a good job that just last week, it 
received an award of excellence from a very credible organization 
known as the International Association of Business Communicators. 
This award was given to the CIO for a particular project, The 
Rural Guide, produced last year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Guide, featuring programs and services available to rural 
Canadians, was distributed to rural households across the 
country. It was the collaborative effort of 26 departments and 
agencies under the leadership of the Canada Information Office. 
That is the kind of collaboration that is innovative, productive 
and in the interests of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the International Association of Business 
Communicators recognized the merit of the CIO and awarded them 
this prize. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really looking forward to the questions that the members 
opposite will be asking me, because when I arrived here, before I 
spoke, I heard the member opposite talk about the CIO. He talked 
about everything. He talked about human resources. He talked 
about the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, in terms that 
were not very elegant or respectful for that matter. He talked 
about government administration. He talked about plan B. He 
talked about the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada: </B>They are so lacking in arguments, so 
obsessed by a totally indefensible option that they are taking 
advantage of a debate on an organization stemming from a 
profoundly democratic initiative to shoot down all that the 
government is doing. I am wondering to what extent it is not a 
normal process for an opposition party to oppose for the sake of 
opposing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ)</B>: Madam Speaker, I 
would like to ask a question of my colleague from Brossard—La 
Prairie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his speech, he moaned about not being listened to.  I 
hung on his every word and noted that our hon. colleague was not 
really familiar with the Canada Information Office.  I saw that 
he was totally disconnected from our reasons for wanting this 
office completely dismantled.

<A HREF="#LINKT42"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would take care if I were he, because the CIO may have 
personal information about him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for what he said concerning my colleague for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry, that colleague's words to all those in 
this House were elegantly delivered.  His comments on the CIO 
were elegantly and intelligently set out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it immensely regrettable that this hon. member should be 
telling us things that are not true.  He must be the only person 
who has not been reading the newspapers the past few weeks, I 
think.  He seems to be the only one who thinks he possesses the 
truth. 
All this has been in our newspapers.  Even the Minister of 
Public Works has admitted that contracts had been awarded, but 
now the hon. member is telling us the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him if he knows exactly what the CIO is, 
apart from the propaganda he has been dumping on us for the past 
20 minutes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, once again I see that when 
the party over there is talking about something, it is called 
information, but when I do, it is called propaganda.  It is 
always very interesting to see the imbalance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague over the way faults me for moaning.  I did 
not.  I merely pointed out that I kept getting interrupted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I picked up one extremely interesting thing in what my colleague 
just said, and it was repeated in the question.  It was the word 
dismantled.  It is remarkable that they want to dismantle the 
Canada Information Office, Human Resources Development Canada and 
Canada itself.  What we have here in this House is the 
dismantling party.  Quite remarkable, that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> As far as the contracts are concerned, 
because it is easy to make allegations without necessarily being 
able to support them, I would like to confirm for my colleague 
quite earnestly, as did the minister in his response in the 
House on several occasions in this regard, that all the 
contracts awarded in the context of the terms of reference of 
the CIO were awarded according to treasury board standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These standards are very similar to those found in each of the 
provinces of our country.  To criticize treasury board standards 
or their application is to move onto very slippery terrain, I 
would suggest, because these standards were established to 
ensure a certain transparency— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They are used for interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, I think before such comments 
are made, an effort should be made perhaps to not play the 
looking glass game. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would remind my colleague from Brossard—La Prairie that it is not 
my practice to refer to my colleagues, including himself, in 
disrespectful terms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in opposition to one another.  We hold divergent opinions 
on the future of Quebec and Canada.  I was pointing out that the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, the architect of plan B 
must indeed count on the Canada Information Office to implement 
his plan B. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one of the tools for plan B, which seeks to block the 
march of Quebecers toward sovereignty, but not with much success. 
In the weeks, the months and the years to come, we will see how 
this strategy used by the minister, the Prime Minister and all 
those who shared that vision, how that way of planning Canada's 
future, of imposing certain views about the future, will not 
produce the results anticipated by those who came up with that 
idea of a plan B, at the expense of plan A, which was based on 
reconciliation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The slippery slope, and I say this with all due respect for the 
member for Brossard—La Prairie, is the one used by the Canada 
Information Office, the one which consists in buying off people 
with contracts, in making friends by awarding contracts, in 
wooing them, in getting them to promote Canadian unity by 
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, and sometimes even 
millions of dollars. That is the slippery slope in democracy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By contrast, we sovereignists in Quebec cannot be criticized, 
because we have legislation respecting the financing of political 
parties whereby individuals and, more recently in our case, 
businesses can only contribute a maximum of $5,000 to help and 
support parties that promote sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell the hon. member for Brossard—La Prairie and all the 
Liberal members that the slippery slope, the dangerous thing to 
do is to use public funds for promotion and, indeed, propaganda. 
We are not afraid to say it and we will continue to show how the 
awarding of contracts is closely related to how those who get 
these contracts contribute money to the Liberal Party to campaign 
and stay in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this party will not remain in office for long with practices 
that show so little respect for the public. Canadians must be 
better represented here than they are by the Liberals, who want 
to help their friends and make this government one that helps its 
friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with great 
attention what my honorable colleague just said. I must say that 
I was surprised by the tone he used when he spoke of the Minister 
of Intergovernmental Affairs, because I know that it is not the 
tone he usually uses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely fascinating to hear the hon. member talk 
about propaganda whereas I just said, and he may not agree with 
me, that informing the public about government activities is an 
indispensable condition of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a government does not explain to the public what it is doing, 
it lacks openness. If a government does not explain to the public 
what it is doing, it is not providing people with the means to 
avail themselves of all the programs and services that are 
available to them. If a government does not explain to the public 
what it is doing, it prevents people from knowing what it is the 
government is doing with their tax money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, informing the public is a basic principle of 
democracy. I would like to know if members opposite agree or not 
with this principle. I would like to know if they think that any 
information coming from the government is necessarily propaganda, 
but when but when it is condemned by the opposition doing its job 
as the opposition, it becomes legitimate information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know where this double standard is coming from. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I would 
like to ask the hon. member a question. He asked where this 
double standard is coming from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, as he claims, the government must absolutely explain 
everything and inform the public about the achievements of the 
greatest government of the best country in the world, is it only 
Quebecers who do not understand and need to be informed? Why is 
all this information from the best and greatest government in 
the world targeting Quebec only, and why are nine provinces 
spared this propaganda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> Madam Speaker, if my hon. colleague had been 
kind enough to listen when I was speaking— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jacques Saada:</B> If he takes the time to read the official 
transcript of my speech, he will find that I gave many examples 
that apply to the country as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1-800 number is not for Quebec alone. The Y2K bug workshops 
were not for Quebec alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His question is warped and self-serving, and I condemn it for 
what it is.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague from Repentigny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise to speak to this motion, and to have the 
opportunity to shed some light on a few things. Of course, I 
appreciate the efforts made by the member who spoke before me to 
try to justify the government's approach, and try to explain why 
using taxpayers' money to its own ends, through the Canada 
Information Office, was a good thing. My hon. colleague did what 
he had to do, but his arguments were not very convincing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that not only the sovereignist party, but also the 
other opposition parties support the motion. 
Well, the New Democratic Party has decided to support the Canada 
Information Office.  The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle spoke for 
this party.  Unfortunately I must point out—and this somewhat 
weakens his argument and the position of the New Democrats—that 
this member's name can be found on a list of people who received 
grants from the Canada Information Office in 1997.  It is 
obviously hard to speak out against something from which one is 
benefiting personally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If indeed the New Democratic Party wants to associate itself 
with this propaganda tool known as the Canada Information Office, 
I would have thought that parliamentary ethics would have at 
least prompted one of the member's colleagues to take the floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier: </B>I am not in the habit of interrupting 
people when they speak and I would like to be able to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say that the Canada Information Office is the ideal 
place to spend money without worrying about the rules.  Most of 
the CIO's contracts go out untendered.  That is a fact.  It is 
not something I made up.  If it were, the members opposite would 
be on their feet immediately. During Oral Question Period, the 
government would have said “That is not true.  You are 
mistaken”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But no, there is no denying that most of the contracts awarded 
by the CIO, which were paid for by the public and which should 
normally go out to public tender, because that is the ethical way 
of spending taxpayers' money, were not put out to tender. That is 
a fact, not idle speculation.  That is a verifiable fact . 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point I would like to make is that not only were 
contracts awarded without calls for tender, but they were awarded 
primarily to Liberal Party buddies.  This also is a fact.  I 
challenge anyone on the other side of the House to put 
generalities aside and prove me wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a partial list of contracts awarded by the Canada 
Information Office: BCP, headed by John Parisella, the former 
executive assistant to Robert Bourassa, former Liberal Premier of 
Quebec, Administration Leduc et Leblanc, the famous firm where 
Judge Mongeau worked, an administrative office connected with a 
firm of lawyers, as is generally the case, but which did 
communications contracts.  We will come back to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like lawyers and respect them.  But as communications experts, 
they sometimes leave something to be desired. The list of 
contracts also includes the firm GPC, headed by Rémi Bujold, a 
former secretary of state of the Liberal government and a 
generous contributor to the Liberal Party.  And the list is 
growing. The paper and notes I have here refer throughout to 
people close to the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, contracts were awarded with public money and without tender, 
that is, contrary to the rules, contracts were given to good 
government buddies and contracts were given to firms whose 
connection to the mandate given them is not always obvious. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1345"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I mentioned Administration Leduc et Leblanc. An 
honourable judge has just been appointed by the government, a man 
who was at the same time the lawyer, the legal adviser, for the 
Canada Information Office, with an annual salary of $192,000. 
That is not exactly peanuts.  It is more than he is currently 
making as a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This same gentleman collected $40,000 worth of travel expenses 
in a year.  One would imagine he travelled up to Ottawa every 
morning and back to Montreal every evening, ate in the best 
restaurants, and managed to do errands in town between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also someone with a lot of communications contracts from 
the CIO.  We have checked it out. I challenge my friends over 
there to prove me wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have checked it out.  We called communications firms, because 
we have connections with some.  There are a lot involved in 
government work.  “Are you familiar with a communications firm 
called Administration Leduc et Leblanc?” we asked them.  Not a 
soul in Quebec, not a single person in communications, knows the 
communications firm Administration Leduc et Leblanc.  Not a 
single communications specialist in Quebec, in Montreal, knows 
this firm, but the Minister of Public Works did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Or at any rate, he knew Mr. Mongeau. Knew him so well that they 
appointed him to a judgeship, this Mr. Mongeau, who was on the 
Liberal Party's legal commission, a close buddy since way back, 
someone close to the seats of power.  On top of his $192,000 
annually as legal adviser to the Canada Information Office, on 
top of his $40,000 in travel expenses for that same year, he was 
doing communications.  He fixed up the commas and periods in the 
CIO's documents.  That is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Chambly asked the government a question “Is 
it normal to award a contract of <I>x</I> thousands of dollars to someone 
who will report back as follows: We have fixed up the commas, 
periods and spelling errors in this or that document?”  What is 
more, this will be over the signature of a lawyer who works for 
the Canada Information Office, who is a legal adviser to the 
RCMP, who had major civil cases going on at the same time, and 
who did $40,000 worth of travel in a year, at 38 cents a 
kilometre. 
The man worked 28 hours a day; there can be no other explanation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is not going overboard in using public funds for 
partisan purposes, what is it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fourth element. Not only does the CIO award contracts 
without going to tender, not only are these contracts awarded to 
buddies, not only are they awarded to people who do not have the 
skills to fulfil them, but the CIO creates files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thanks to the insight of the hon. member for Chambly, we have 
discovered that the CIO has created files in which we find the 
names of the most famous journalists on Parliament Hill. I was 
able to find out, because I am nosy and I admit it, which 
journalists are considered good or bad journalists by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was able to see that some journalists are considered harmless. 
They report the facts. They are objective. Others are good 
because they promote the views of the government on Quebec's 
sovereignty. They will probably get the government's press 
releases during the next referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are also bad journalists. They are those who do not 
accurately reflect the views of the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. They interrupt him. They sometimes use irony. All this 
information is on the CIO's files. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on that note, because I want to leave the floor 
to my colleague. We cannot accept that such an office continues 
to exist at the expense of the taxpayers, of our viewers.

cannot help but respond to the criticism of my hon. colleague 
from Regina—Qu'Appelle by the hon. member from the Bloc. It had 
to do with when he was not a member of parliament doing work 
representing the province he had lived in for years.  Having been 
here in parliament years before representing that province, my 
colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle could make a very good point of 
how westerners view Canada.  My colleague from the Bloc indicated 
a lucrative contract to be something less than $5,000, because 
the contract ended before the full year was up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally the government should be looking across Canada to get 
ideas from all regions as to what is better for Canada.  It 
should not be looking just to people within Quebec or Liberal 
supporters; ideally it should be looking to all areas of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should not question the credibility of my colleague or the 
position of the NDP.  There is no question that the New 
Democratic Party believes in Canada.  As westerners we have 
fought very hard to continue to have a Canada that is united from 
coast to coast to coast.  We are not like the Quebec separatists 
who say anybody who does not agree with the separatists or the 
Bloc are undemocratic, that if people do not agree with the Bloc 
then they are traitors to Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Westerners have learned to fight. We believe in Canada and we 
are not giving up on Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Madam Speaker, I do not wish to upset the 
hon. member, but I have no choice but to dot the <I>i</I>'s and cross 
the <I>t</I>'s, and to do it now.  I am going to explain something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not calling the member's credibility into question.  On the 
contrary.  He is very credible when he defends the CIO; he works 
for it. I will merely say that, unless the figures I got from the 
CIO are not accurate, this member was paid $7,200 for work done 
between November 10, 1996 and November 10, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the figures from the CIO.  They are clear and they 
cast doubt on the impartiality of someone who rises in the House 
and says on behalf of a supposedly puritan political party that 
they agree with the CIO.  I guess so, since he works for it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I want the hon. member to listen very clearly.  He 
referred to my name and said that I worked for the Canada 
Information Office.  That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Bloc Quebecois supplied me with was information from 
the freedom of information office.  At one time I did a small 
contract for it, before the last federal election.  If those 
members were to read their own information, they would see that 
it is marked with an asterisk and states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As some contracts are `as and when requested', the actual 
expenditure can be lower than the value of the contract. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was certainly the case in my situation.  I did nothing for 
that office after the writ was dropped on April 27, 1997.  I 
resent the implication that I did something after that and the 
absolute untruth that I am now doing some work for the Canada 
Information Office.  That is not true.  I expect the hon. member 
to get up and apologize to me for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  This would probably come under the heading 
of debate.  One member says one thing and another member says 
another.  You are both looking at the same set of facts and you

tremendous public display of remembrance, respect and gratitude 
for our Canadian war veterans with the recent repatriation of the 
Unknown Soldier, Canadians wonder why the government is doing so 
little to address gulf war sickness which plagues our Canadian 
troops today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A recent British report has clearly and positively recognized 
that the disease is real.  In addition, the Minister of National 
Defence recently stated publicly that the Canadian forces members 
who have loyally served their country in war zones must be fairly 
treated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently, military personnel who have the disease are being 
released under 3B, which is a release for medical reasons not 
attributed to the Canadian forces.  This means officers are being 
dismissed with no benefits.  I ask, is this treatment fair? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly urge the Liberal government to address gulf war 
sickness as other countries are now doing and provide the 
Canadian forces with fair and equitable treatment and access to 
benefits.

Mr. Speaker, how would you like a new pen pal to correspond with 
on the Internet?  Maybe an armed robber.  Or perhaps you would 
prefer a rapist or an American murderer waiting on death row.  It 
will be free to you and will only cost the convict $30 a year to 
post his photo and a brief and no doubt very sympathetic 
biography. The small fee even lets inmates post a short message, 
perhaps looking for legal advice, a delightful flirtation, or 
maybe even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prisoners get a birthday card, a holiday card and two 
newsletters a year so they just do not feel bad while serving 
their time for destroying somebody else's life and imposing a 
life sentence of pain on the victim's families and friends.  They 
can even get a T-shirt or a mouse pad emblazoned with the web 
site's logo.

department provides services to veterans hospitals, prisons, 
Indian reserves, the RCMP, and many other services.

men over 50 speak to their physicians about early testing with a

<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Air Canada's pilots are threatening 
to go on strike in just over a week.  Thanks to this government's 
mismanagement of the airline industry, this could leave thousands 
of Canadians stranded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government draft and have ready back-to-work 
legislation if thee pilots decide to walk? 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary explained this very well to 
the House yesterday.  Either we believe in the right to 
collective bargaining or we do not.  There is a process going on 
and they are negotiating.  This is not the time to tell them that 
we will take away their rights under the law.  If the Reform 
Party would like to take away the normal process, they should say 
so.  Yesterday the critics said that they believed in the 
bargaining process between the union and the company.  Let the 
process come to fruition.  We will decide, if there is a strike, 
not before. 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think it is a matter of trust.  We 
agree with collective bargaining, but this government has allowed 
a virtual monopoly on national airline routes.  This government 
has the responsibility and the obligation to ensure that 
travellers are not left stranded across the country.  They will 
be held hostage if this happens, and this government should wear 
the shame of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will this government not prepare draft back-to-work 
legislation so that it is ready if need be so the people will 
not be left stranded across the country? 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is a purely hypothetical question.  The 
parliamentary secretary explained very well the position of the 
government yesterday and she was backed by the critics of the 
Reform Party, who should have a little consultation with their 
leader at this moment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, maybe the government should have a 
little consultation with those people who will be left on the 
ground when pilots are on strike. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary can brag about the fact that this 
government is really looking after things well.  How about a few 
solutions?  How about acting on something?  What about a 90 day 
cooling off period for the workers?  How about final offer 
arbitration?  How about allowing foreign competition in the 
industry? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of just hoping for the best, will the government be 
prepared in the contingency that a strike happens next week? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if members opposite truly believed 
in the collective bargaining process they would let the 
collective bargaining process work.  They agreed yesterday that a 
negotiated settlement was the best settlement for all concerned. 
We are talking about things that are premature.  There will be a 
negotiated settlement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Hear, hear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  Perhaps the front benches 
could let us get on with our work. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is fine for government ministers 
who have access to a government plane when they need it, but a 
strike at Air Canada is a threat to the travel plans of thousands 
of Canadians.  Canadians want to know that when they show up at 
the airport this summer the pilots will be in the cockpit, not on 
the picket line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While everyone hopes for a negotiated settlement, is the 
government really prepared to see 85% of Canada's airline 
industry behind a picket line? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, members opposite are asking us to 
bargain in bad faith.  They are asking us to prejudge the 
collective bargaining process.  There is a process in place. 
There is a mediator who knows the file, who is prepared to sit 
down with both sides.  I urge the party opposite to let the 
collective bargaining process run its course.  We are in very 
delicate negotiations and this wild speculation is just 
jeopardizing those negotiations.

85% of passenger airline service in this country, its importance 
to the Canadian economy is undeniable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is well aware that this is only one of many labour 
disputes facing Air Canada and its employees.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Judi Longfield (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

<P><A NAME="LINK134"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, only 
42% of those who contribute to employment insurance are entitled 
to benefits, as we know.  This means 58% of contributors, 
primarily young people and women, are excluded.  The Quebec 
parental insurance program, which is much more generous, 
provides full access to all employees and to the self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the Prime Minister got to say to the thousands of young 
families that will be excluded from the Quebec program because 
of his old habit of seeing reality in confrontational terms? 
<P><A NAME="LINK135"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the program has been in existence a long time.  At the end of 
the year, on December 31, we will extend the period from six 
months to a year.  The program was announced in the February 
budget.  It is an extension of the program we had before, which 
had served the citizens of Canada well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Government of Quebec has other social problems to resolve 
and has the money to do so, so much the better.  Our program has 
been around for a long time, and, obviously, if it is a program 
the Bloc Quebecois wants to advance— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Laurier—Sainte-Marie. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
problem is that 58% of women and young people are excluded from 
his plan.  Self-employed workers are not covered by it either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of starting another fight, this time on the backs of 
families, why does he always dig in his heels with the 
Government of Quebec, which is trying many different ways to 
create an environment favourable to young families?  Why not 
negotiate in good faith rather than insist on hogging the 
spotlight to the detriment of young people and young families, 
in particular? 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
for a number of years, we offered to discuss this with them. 
Funny that they discover this problem after our program was 
announced.  During the two years before, their concerns were 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If they are concerned about the people the Bloc Quebecois leader 
mentions, they should look after them, and we will continue with 
the better program we have been developing for many years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
first chance he gets, the self-proclaimed champion of compassion 
finds nothing more to say to Quebec families than that there is 
no question of engaging in discussions with Quebec to facilitate 
implementation of the Quebec parental leave program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Prime Minister not understand that, unless he takes a 
significant step in favour of parental leave, all his fine words 
about compassion are nothing more than empty electioneering? 
<P><A NAME="LINK139"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
they are more than just fine words to those who will be getting 
the parental leave. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Starting December 31, 2000, parents will be getting 12 months 
instead of 6.  I believe this is a program which demonstrates 
very clearly this party's compassion for people who want to add 
to their family. 
<P><A NAME="LINK140"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
invite the Prime Minister to set aside his usual knee-jerk 
responses and to look at what the two governments can do to reach 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Prime Minister prepared to open up his mind a little to 
these new realities, which are intended to provide young families 
with complete access to parental leave, and will he commit to 
working with Quebec in order to finally settle this matter?

this was a good thing.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Minister of the Environment was asked 
why his government failed to table an annual report on Canada's 
water supply, as required by law since 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lo and behold, this morning he did table reports for 1997 and 
1998, but we are still waiting for reports for the last two

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell us why the first two reports were kept

<P><A NAME="LINK144"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for drawing attention to the 
fact that 20 hours after the request from his party leader I did 
table the two documents in the House for 1996-97 and 1997-98.  I 
hope he has had an opportunity to look at them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other reports will be tabled in the House when the material 
is ready, when they have been checked and when they have been 
translated.  I should add for his information that this does 
involve a lot of consultation with the provinces. 
<P><A NAME="LINK145"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Gruending (Saskatoon—Rosetown—Biggar, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is three years too late on the tabling, but it is 
not just about delayed water reports, it is also about delayed 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister wants action to protect Canadians' drinking 
water, but the Minister of the Environment says it is not his 
job.  He is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Environmental Protection Act gives him explicit 
powers to ensure that toxics like the E. coli at Walkerton are 
not released into the water supply.  This can be found at page

look.

Mr. Speaker, part II of the act to which the hon. member refers

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to recognize that there are provinces that have

Mr. Speaker, given that to date over $350 million has been pumped 
into the government's ineffective and expensive bureaucratic gun 
registry scheme, with estimates reaching $1 billion by 
completion, it is disheartening to hear that the government has 
now spent additional resources on a nationwide campaign in the 
hopes of getting up the dismal registration numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the minister please inform the House just how much money 
has been spent on this desperate ad campaign to cajole 
compliance, and is this new money that is being put into this 
scheme? 
<P><A NAME="LINK149"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, yet again the hon. member just 
does not get it.  Gun control is about public safety.  In fact, 
when we look at gun control, at what our licensing and 
registration program is doing, we are keeping guns out of the 
hands of those who should not have them.  We are saving lives in 
this country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK150"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when it comes to resources, it is our policing 
agencies that just do not get it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one in this House is opposed to gun control.  It is the 
registry scheme.  It is an important nuance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an openly expensive and discriminatory practice 
involving this registration scheme.  It is a cash grab.  It is 
meant to prevent criminals from attempting crime, but they are 
not going to participate in this registry.

overall violent crime rates have increased 2.2% since putting

HRDC has started to delay access requests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 40,000 Canadians have played by the rules and have put in

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Bonnie Brown (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

the database is being dismantled.  In the meantime, we have

We  do not go around making allegations without making sure that 
there is proper proof for those allegations.

Canada's largest refiners, is not only producing low sulphur 
gasoline for its own stations, but it is now distributing its 
product in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister wants to get the other refiners on board faster, 
then he should do what the automakers association, the refiners, 
health and environmental groups, and the Progressive Conservative 
Party want to do and that is to reduce the excise tax on low 
sulphur gasoline, thus reducing prices to consumers and 
protecting human health.  We did this with lead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Minister of the Environment not lower the taxes on 
low sulphur gasoline so we can protect the health of Canadians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I hesitate to give yet another lesson to the 
Conservative Party, but as I must, it is in fact the Minister of 
Finance who handles taxes and not the Minister of the 
Environment.  Perhaps this is lost on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, we are reducing the sulphur content of gasoline 
from the average of 360 parts per million to 30 parts per 
million.  I applaud Irving Oil for taking steps in advance of the 
regulations coming into force.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are winding down toward the end of the parliamentary 
calendar this spring and we have some important legislation that 
needs to be completed before we adjourn in the weeks to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the government House leader could tell us what kind 
of schedule he has for the rest of this week and for the 
remainder of next week, and if we plan to extend hours next week 
so we can accomplish some of the necessary legislation before the 
House adjourns. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is an agreement to 
continue to sit after 6.30 p.m. today to debate third reading of 
Bill S-10, the DNA bill, and Bill S-3, the tax convention.  I 
thank the House leaders of other parties for having agreed to 
this extension of hours.  We will likely have similar ones, and I 
will get to them in a minute, concerning other evenings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Friday, tomorrow, we will consider report stage of Bill C-19, 
the war crimes bill, and of Bill C-27, the parks bill.  I 
understand that there is disposition to deal with report stage of 
those two bills tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Monday, we will debate second reading of Bill C-33, the 
species at risk bill.  This would be followed by report stage and 
third reading of Bill C-5, the tourism bill, and Bill C-24, the 
GST technical bill.  If we have not completed those bills on 
Monday, I would seek consent to continue in the evening to try to 
move them forward.  I will be consulting with House leaders on 
that topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Tuesday, it is my intention to deal with report stage and 
third reading of Bill C-18, the impaired driving bill.  That 
would be followed by third reading of Bill C-19, the war crimes 
bill to be dealt with at report stage tomorrow, and Bill C-27, 
the parks bill at third reading, which is also at report stage 
tomorrow.  Again, if we have not completed that agenda, it would 
be my intention to seek the agreement of colleagues to continue 
that in the evening as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday, it is my intention to call report stage and third 
reading of Bill C-34, the grain transportation bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next Thursday shall be the final allotted day in the present 
supply period.  The House would probably have to sit, unless we 
collectively decide otherwise, until 10 p.m., which means that we 
would also sit in the evening on Thursday of next week.

</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK224">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Repentigny, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as my 
colleague from Roberval indicated to you, I am sharing my time 
with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to speak to the motion tabled today. 
Since we have heard speeches that were all over the map, I am 
going to take the liberty of rereading the motion in order to 
reorient the debate somewhat, as much for the government members 
as for the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard some exaggeration from the NDP, something that is 
fairly rare.  But with a motion like today's, they let loose a 
bit.  Subsequently, thanks to the member for Roberval, we 
understood why some NDP members were rather excited about our 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for having established 
the Canada Information Office, which gives lucrative contracts to 
those close to the government party for, among other things, the 
purpose of gathering, analysing and collating information about a 
large number of citizens, and that this House urge the government 
to close that Office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only potentially debatable word in this motion is the word 
“lucrative”.  To some, a $100,000 or $200,000 contract is 
perhaps not really lucrative.  Others need $1 million or $2 
million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the motion remains unchanged.  As we have clearly 
shown with facts and not opinions, thanks to a new creation that 
emerged after the near defeat of the federalist movement, the 
Canada Information Office was established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole issue deals with a much more serious question that 
Canadians could ask themselves. The basic question is: Where do 
our tax dollars go? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office is one answer. Here are a few 
examples of what the government is up to. The people of Canada 
can wonder where their money is going. We are not talking about 
federalists or sovereigntists here. We are not talking about 
separatists or about those who appreciate the “best country in 
the world”. We are talking about facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all have to agree that close to $1 billion is missing at 
Human Resources Development Canada. Ordinary Canadians, those who 
work so hard to make a living, are really at a loss to understand 
how the federal government could lose $1 billion so easily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are told that it is not $1 billion, but rather $152 and so 
on. However 22 investigations have been launched by the RCMP 
about HRDC. Most of these 22 investigations involve Shawinigan. 
This has nothing to do with a political party. It is a fact. 
There are 22 investigations. Nobody knows where the tax dollars 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A grant which first appeared in the riding of Rosemont 
disappeared, and then reappeared in the riding of Saint-Maurice. 
That is also a fact. Where did our tax dollars go? This is 
another question that could be asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another grant was given, again in a Liberal riding. This might 
be mere chance, if not a fact. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A grant was given to a textile company in the riding of 
Anjou—Rivière-des-Prairies. The company got a great idea. It 
changed its name, thus leading us to believe that jobs had been 
created. But in fact no jobs were created. Again, where is the 
taxpayers' money going? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After so many blunders at HRDC, the minister came up with a 
bright idea. She decided to hire a spin doctor. It cost $50,000 
to have someone tell the minister how to dress and how to answer 
questions. 
Later, after having wasted and lost taxpayers' money, this same 
department sent public servants for group relaxation therapy, 
because these people had been under some stress after having 
lost several million dollars worth of Canadian taxpayers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, as if it were not bad enough to have one department in hot 
water, another one found itself in an embarrassing situation. 
Usually it is the Department of National Defence, but not this 
time. It is the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, where 
hundreds of millions of dollars were paid to CINAR, a company 
run by friends of the government. There again—and this is not 
because we are nasty separatists—the RCMP launched an 
investigation. As this point, a total of 23 investigations have 
been launched. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Probably the government's intention is to get into the <I>Guinness 
Book of Records</I> as the government investigated the most times 
during its mandate in a supposedly democratic country.  This is a 
real problem for this government, but it will perhaps be worth it 
to have earned such a record, having had such a huge number of 
investigations into the mishandling of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has recently been learned that another department, one about 
which we had certain suspicions that have now been backed with 
concrete examples, the Department of Canadian Heritage, has sunk 
$7 million of Canadians' tax dollars into Scully's “Heritage 
Minutes” on RDI.  That this was done in an underhanded way is a 
proven fact.  Those “Heritage Minutes” swallowed up $7 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were merely to add up all these figures—and that is not 
even touching on the CIO—the total of the taxpayers' money that 
has gone to recognize the contribution of buddies, ex-candidates, 
candidates, ex-official agents, ex-workers, ex-Liberal MPs, would 
be $500 million, $600 million or $700 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not the ones who said, after the election in 1993, if my 
memory does not fail me, “Anyway, all Liberal Party candidates 
will end up with jobs afterward”.  It was a now-deceased senator 
from the Liberal Party who spoke this truth, which everyone 
suspected, but he came out and stated.  His soul is now with God. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was frank enough and honest enough to come out and say what 
everyone knew: all Liberal MPs, all defeated Liberal 
candidates—and there were many of them in Quebec—could count on 
a job afterward in gratitude for their efforts. 
A job was already a nice reward, but they are also getting 
government contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does one get government contracts?  We see John Parisella, 
who heads BCP and who got $20,000.  It is a very small contract, 
but it helps when one is starting up a business.  It is one more 
contract under administration.  BCP is not an SME; it is a fairly 
large company.  But a friend of the government gets a little 
something anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list of contracts includes Administration Leduc et Leblanc. 
The member for Chambly, who went over the file with a fine-tooth 
comb, put it very well.  Administration Leduc et Leblanc, a firm 
that contributed $15,000 to the Liberal Party of Canada in 1997 
and 1998, obtained a contract worth $85,000. GPC, headed by Rémi 
Bujold—the member for Roberval mentioned him earlier—a former 
secretary of state in the Liberal government, received a grant of 
$87,000 from the CIO.  But he was very generous with the Liberal 
Party and gave them $25,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers are fed up.  When we ask ourselves why—I see 
the government House leader, who has parliamentary procedure down 
to a fine art—when we see that the public has so little 
confidence, so little respect for politicians, this is the number 
one reason.  This is why people have nothing but contempt for all 
things political and do not trust politicians; they know only too 
well that money is wasted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government members say that they cannot be prevented from 
promoting the federal government, the Canadian government.  The 
government can promote government policies. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1515"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT63"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is a matter of promoting party policy and platform, this 
has to be done by the party with the money that was generously 
donated to it. They say they want to explain government 
policies; but how come only Quebecers do not understand them? 
Why is the Canada Information Office—which as far as I know is 
not called the Partisanship in Quebec Office—not informing all 
the Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are we a distinct society for the CIO? Maybe at the CIO they 
have understood that Quebec is a distinct society and that is 
why they are granting all CIO contracts to firms belonging to 
Liberal friends or former Liberal candidates, to people close to 
the Liberal Party, since it seems that contracts are given only 
to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I continue. Leroux and Associates, $23,000; Mr. Leroux has been 
nicknamed “the Deputy Minister of Heritage Canada” by a 
journalist in the National Capital. Everest Communications; that 
firm was also close to the Conservatives, but eventually they 
understood; when a political party is dying, you get closer to 
the other one. That firm got a $75,000 contract and quickly gave 
back $20,000 to the Liberal Party. How long is it going to last? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope everyone will understand— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member, but I have 
to give the floor to the hon. member for Chambly. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the famous CIO 
the member for Repentigny is talking about is probably the 
acronym for cronyism and influence office, or something of the 
sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this agency accountable to the public? Do we have details on 
this? Are those things secret?  Did the Auditor General of 
Canada examine the management and the administration of this 
agency?  In his recent reports, did the auditor general mention 
certain points that brought about the question the Bloc is 
asking today?  Are there some sources of mismanagement or undue 
influence or are we talking purely and simply about patronage 
and cronyism?  Really, we should call the agency the cronyism 
and influence office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Repentigny to elaborate a bit on the 
contracts that were awarded without going to tender.  To whom 
were these contracts awarded and why? 
It could be interesting for the House and particularly for the 
Speaker who is listening closely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau: </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Chambly for his question, and also for uncovering this patronage 
haven for the Bloc Quebecois caucus, and then, through the 
House, for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Public Accounts and the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs are currently 
considering a new process to make the allocation of funds to all 
federal departments more transparent. Unfortunately, and this is 
another tactic used by the federal government, when parallel 
agencies and offices like this one are created, they are not 
bound by the same financial audit standards that apply to other 
departments and that are monitored by the treasury board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Chambly is right when he says the creation of 
parallel offices and agencies like the Canada Customs and 
Revenue Agency and the millenium scholarship program is a way 
for small entities like the Council for Canadian Unity and the 
Bronfman Foundation to hide money from auditors and avoid 
federal accounting standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament can rest assured that, with these speeches 
and allotted days, the information will get to the people in the 
auditor general's office, who are doing an excellent job of 
making sure the taxpayers' money is well spent.

review or an audit of the funds spent by the Canada Information 
Office, or cronyism office for the friends of the Liberal Party 
of Canada. Members can be sure of that. Unfortunately, too 
often, those organizations are not subject to the same 
accountability standards as the official departments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today to speak to 
the Bloc motion.  I should like to read, as my colleague on the 
other side did, the motion so that everyone in the House is quite 
clear as to what it is: 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for having established 
the Canada Information Office, which gives lucrative contracts 
to those close to the government party for, among other things, 
the purpose of gathering, analysing and collating information 
about a large number of citizens, and that this House urge the 
government to close that Office. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before one can speak directly to the motion and determine 
whether or not it has any basis in fact, whether or not it has 
any utility for Canadians and for the good governance of Canada, 
one has to look at the context of the Canada Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I will be taking the full amount of time.  I rise 
today to speak about the achievements of the Canada Information 
Office.  In order to do so we need to briefly review the context 
against which they were realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the Government of Canada took steps to strengthen its 
capacity to communicate with Canadians from coast to coast to 
coast.  To strengthen its capacity to communicate with Canadians 
it gave the Canadian Information Office a mandate for delivering 
initiatives that reflected the corporate vision of the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specific, the CIO or the Canada Information Office has the 
mandate to improve communications between the Government of 
Canada and Canadians.  As I mentioned, that means Canadians from 
coast to coast to coast, including Canadians who live in Quebec, 
all the Quebec population, of which I am one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does this based on three broad objectives.  The first is to 
provide corporate communication, advice and support.  The second 
is to improve co-ordination of regional communications.  The 
third is to strengthen the operational capacity of the Government 
of Canada on such issues as national unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look first at how the Canada Information Office has been 
improving corporate communication.  It continued to survey 
Canadians to determine their concerns and their information 
needs.  The findings of these surveys have been released publicly 
over the past year.  Our surveys have come up with two important 
findings.  First, Canadians are not very aware of the programs 
and services of the Government of Canada.  Second, they want to 
know more about them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat for members of the opposition, particularly those 
who tabled the motion we are now discussing.  The first finding 
of the surveys was that Canadians are not very aware of the 
programs and services of the Government of Canada.  The second 
finding was that Canadians want to know more about the programs 
and services of the Canadian government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1525"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO through the various activities it undertakes is working 
to bridge the gap indicated in the findings of those surveys. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that Canadians have a right to information. We have 
an obligation to ensure that they know about the services 
available to them and their families and to take all necessary 
measures to ensure that they are informed about them. The Canada 
Information Office is one of these measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other products have been developed in this context. For 
instance, the CIO helped to produce a Guide to Government of 
Canada Programs and Services which was sent in June 1999 to 2.6 
million homes in rural and remote areas of the country. 
It was done in co-operation with Agriculture and Agri-food Canada. 
A total of 26 departments and agencies were involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The document was very much appreciated by those who received it. 
Half of them saved it, 68% thought it was informative, 78% found 
it easy to use and 56% agreed it helped to improve understanding 
of what the Government of Canada does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only that, 68% agreed that it was important for the 
Government of Canada to provide information on its programs and 
services to Canadians through direct mail brochures sent to 
their homes or business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of the guide, there were thousands of calls to the 
1-800-O-Canada number and thousands of hits on the Canada site. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO recently piloted the idea of a similar guide for urban 
Canadians. 
They were distributed in May and June to nearly 370,000 homes in 
Quebec City and Saskatoon. The early analysis is showing results 
similar to the rural guide. This pilot is another example of how 
the CIO is helping the Government of Canada inform Canadians 
about its programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also in 1999, the CIO successfully tested the idea of letting 
Canadians know about government services through ads in the 
weekly newspapers. The CIO will continue this campaign with 
improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first wave of ads focuses on concrete priorities such as 
finding a job. It also promotes the 1-800-O-Canada number, the 
Canada site, and Service Canada access centres. The ad is being 
inserted into 1,400 weekly newspapers and will run for three 
separate weeks during May and June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to CIO's second objective, improving regional 
communications, there have been great strides. The CIO is 
working with the federal regional councils to strengthen the 
government's on-the-ground capacity to communicate with Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We believe that it is essential that we become more aware of 
regional issues and be better able to communicate with Canadians 
in ways that work most effectively in their part of the country.

</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to strengthening our operational capacity, the 
Canada Information Office reaches out to inform Canadians in 
their own communities.  The partnership initiatives program 
supports local initiatives which inform citizens about government 
services which are relevant to them. In the past year for 
example, the CIO worked with other government departments and 
community partners to support 50 activities and projects of 
interest to communities, ranging from workshops on the Y2K bug, 
to a youth project on the elimination of racial discrimination, 
to a national conference of the community futures development 
corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every institution needs to communicate its overall vision. The 
Government of Canada is no exception.  Since receiving its new 
mandate in 1998, the Canada Information Office has been meeting 
its challenges with vitality and dynamism.  It is to be 
congratulated, in my view, for that achievement and for 
positioning itself as a key communications agency in a few short 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to mention a few other achievements of the Canada 
Information Office.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have already said, the office also helps better inform 
Canadians about their country. To this end, it contributes to 
many key events, such as the Canada Conference '99, which marked 
the 50th anniversary of Newfoundland's entry into Confederation. 
Who in the House cannot applaud such an activity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO, together with other federal agencies, organized and 
sponsored this conference which helped make better known this 
chapter in our history. Newfoundland's entry into Confederation 
was indeed an important chapter in our history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another activity was veterans week. The Canada Information 
Office, together with the Department of Veterans Affairs, 
prepared a promotion campaign for veterans week and the role 
played by Canada and its veterans during the first world war. 
What was the result of this activity? The media coverage of 
veterans week increased by 57% in 1998 as compared to 1997. One 
cannot say that this event was not a success. It is an event that 
was successful and that met the goals of the CIO's mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Related activities were held with the help of the CIO. These 
activities encouraged Canadians to co-operate with the government 
and other partners in order to promote understanding among 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are some examples: South Carleton High School created the 
website “Unity Peak”, this was the first school to be allowed 
to name one of the mountain peaks in the Lake Louise area of 
Alberta.  The office contributed to the creation of the website, 
which enabled the students of this school to tell everyone from 
sea to sea to sea about their trip up the mountain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another activity, “Chez Nous 1998”, was a series of television 
programs showing the lifestyles, activities and culture of 
Canada's francophones.  Francophones are, as we all know, found 
from sea to sea.  They are not just in the province of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The theme of the series was to show such things as Canadian 
history, current events and sports, and it showcased rising young 
francophone musicians.  Average audiences totalled around 
170,000.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there were the Y2K bug workshops, which I have already 
referred to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office set up Y2K bug workshops for heads of small 
businesses and professional corporations.  In post-workshop 
feedback, 95% of participants praised the appropriateness and 
quality of the tools and information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I want to return to the motion by the Bloc Quebecois, who 
allege that the Canada Information Office was created by the 
government solely for the purpose of awarding contracts to 
friends. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since its inception in 1996, the office has adjudicated all 
its contracts in keeping with treasury board policies. Let me 
repeat: since 1996, the office has adjudicated all of its 
contracts in keeping with treasury board policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, in 1999-2000 there were public calls for tender 
for all contracts over $25,000, in compliance with the directives 
of the minister responsible for the CIO.  Contracting out must 
meet two criteria: ability and deadlines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What, in reality, is the Bloc motion all about? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so clear that yet again the Bloc is out of step with 
Canadians, that the Bloc is out of step with Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see with the statistics, and I will repeat them, what 
Canadians think about the work BIC is doing.  With regard to the 
guide that was distributed to over 2.6 million homes in rural and 
remote regions, 68% of Canadians thought the guide was very 
useful.  Over half of them kept the guide.  Seventy-eight per 
cent found the guide was easy to consult.  Fifty-six per cent 
stated that the guide helped them to better understand what the 
Canadian government actually does. Sixty-eight per cent indicated 
that to them, to those Canadians who received the guide, it was 
important that this kind of promotion of the Canadian 
government's services and programs take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc is calling for censor of the government for having 
created the office and is calling for that office to be closed. 
Yet Canadians have said that the information the office actually 
produces is not only useful to them but needs to continue.  They 
said that the office is doing a good job in making sure Canadians 
are better informed about government programs and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet again, the Bloc is completely out of step with the majority 
of Quebecers and certainly with the majority of Canadians.  But 
then what else can one expect from the Bloc?  It is still 
advocating the division and breakup of Canada, notwithstanding 
that for years now the overwhelming majority of Quebecers have 
said they do not want another referendum.  They do not want to 
know about another referendum.  They do not want to hear about 
another referendum. They want both the federal government and the 
provincial government in Quebec to get on with the work of 
providing Canadians, particularly Quebecers, with a good quality 
of life and good services.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened very 
carefully to the comments by my hon. colleague across the way, 
who no doubt managed to convince herself of what she just said. 
This had to be a speech that was contracted out by the CIO to 
someone who wrote it and was probably paid handsomely to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member said that the CIO was the Canada Information 
Office, and that Canadians wanted to be informed. 
I do not deny a government must keep its citizens informed about 
its policies. But why is that, after the CIO was set up, the 
first decision that was made was a ministerial order exempting 
the office from the application of a number of provisions in the 
Public Service Employment Act and its regulations, especially 
with regard to hiring? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The office did not want to go through the normal public service 
channels to do its hiring. It wanted to hire people who espoused 
its doctrine, who were able to do its dirty work, and 
shamelessly compromise themselves, people like the infamous 
Serge Paquette and Richard Bélisle, who were both former Liberal 
candidates, one in the 1988 general election, the other in a 
provincial election. One of them was a political attaché to a 
Liberal MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask the hon. member, who is so concerned about keeping 
Canadians informed, if she informs them when she is invited to a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony with the minister in charge of the CIO? 
Does she inform the taxpayers present at the event that, when 
Mr. Paquette and Mr. Bélisle attend such events, they are paid 
$2,500 each, plus 38 cents a kilometre for travelling expenses? 
Does the Canada Information Office inform taxpayers about these 
things? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could she tell us why the CIO does not abide by the public 
service hiring regulations? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a member of the 
Standing Committee on Public Accounts. We receive weekly reports 
from the auditor general. I have been on this committee only 
since September 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have seen, some government agencies have enabling 
legislation excluding their employees from the public service. 
The CIO is not alone in that. I see nothing mysterious in that. I 
see nothing hidden or harmful in the fact that the CIO does not 
have to follow the hiring and promotion policies of the public 
service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, this is not at all what bothers the Bloc. The Bloc is 
irritated because the Canadian government found an effective way 
to provide information on what it does in Quebec, to make 
Quebecers understand what the Canadian government represents and 
how they can benefit from federal programs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the Bloc is irritated. For many years, even 
decades—although the Bloc did not exist then—those who want to 
break up Canada had a kind of monopoly on the information 
provided to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gave them the opportunity to paint for Quebecers a 
nightmarish picture of the Canadian government. It gave them the 
opportunity to make Quebecers believe that the Canadian 
government was robbing them of their money, that all Canadians 
except Quebecers were benefiting from the tax dollars that Quebec 
was sending to the Canadian government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, by communicating through the various departments, and 
also through agencies like the CIO, the Canadian government has 
found ways to make Quebecers aware of federal programs, to 
explain to them how they benefit from these programs, how their 
tax dollars are being spent and how these programs are to their 
advantage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This frightens the Bloc members. It frightens them because, when 
people understand what is going on, when they are faced with 
facts, and not with allegations, fantasy and fiction, they see 
through what is going on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (Secretary of State (International Financial 
Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, who 
has done so much for her electors, within the Liberal caucus or 
in parliament, and who has great visions for all Canadians, 
including Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member tell us more about the programs we have 
created for all Canadians and make a comparison between the 
efforts of the Canadian government, those of the Quebec 
government and of Ontario government, which has spent so much 
money to promote very partisan issues which are not beneficial to 
all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his question. I appreciate it very much, because it will 
allow me to elaborate a bit on the partisan advertising we have 
witnessed in Quebec, for decades, and during the two mandates of 
the Harris government in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is an example I have witnessed personally as a federal 
member of parliament from Quebec. Human Resources Development 
Canada contributes to literacy program for Canadians across the 
country. We know, as my hon. colleague does, that illiteracy is a 
serious problem in Canada. Despite the fact that Canada is a 
highly educated society, we still have a unacceptably high 
percentage of Canadians who are functionally illiterate. We live 
in a new economy based on technology and we are all aware of the 
necessity of having a highly educated population.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must create programs to help Canadians who have difficulty 
reading or who can read, but not well to understand somewhat 
complex documents. We must help these people to improve and 
increase their skills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, the federal government is an important contributor to 
this kind of program. In my riding, there are two organizations 
in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and two in Lachine. Before I entered 
politics, electors and residents in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce knew that 
their programs were funded by the federal government. In the 
other part, Lachine, people did not know it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, thanks to my efforts and those of CIO, everyone in my 
riding knows that the programs there are funded, at least in 
part, by the federal government.

<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to speak to the motion 
today, which is a Bloc motion to talk about the Canada 
Information Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that Bloc members have been hostile toward this 
exercise since its inception in 1998.  They saw it as a rather 
clumsy or transparent tool of the federal government to intervene 
in the debate about Quebec sovereignty, separation, whatever we 
want to call it.  They have attacked this office since day one 
for that reason.  They have seen it as an extension of the 
government using its spending power in Quebec to skew or 
influence the results of any future referendum.  That is the 
Bloc's concern in a nutshell. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose we could get into that debate.  The government 
contends that it has every right and responsibility to intervene 
in these debates and to get information out.  In one report a 
government member said that the purpose of the information office 
would be to correct what he called separatist lies spread in the 
provincial election.  Of course the separatists responded and 
called this a propaganda exercise for federalism.  The federal 
government retorted “We will defend the country.  We will defend 
the record of the government.  It is not participating in the 
provincial campaign; it is telling the truth”.  We have this big 
war about the good guys and the bad guys.  It depends upon one's 
point of view who the good guys are and who the bad guys are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not get into that.  Many speakers have done that in this 
debate.  They have their point of view and Canadians should 
listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to approach the debate from a little different 
angle, which is to have Canadians ask themselves whether an 
information ministry, so to speak, of the federal government is 
in our best interests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal member who just spoke talked about the fact that 
many people do not have the skills or ability to get information 
about issues or are not able to understand issues, and that it is 
up to government to help citizens get a better handle on issues, 
et cetera.  That is really the argument of “Does the end justify 
the means?”  In other words, almost anything government does can 
be justified.  Goodness knows, the Liberals are masters at 
putting a pretty face on some very disturbing exercises of 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is a very important one.  Do we want to have a 
ministry of the federal government which is devoted to 
information?

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other countries, of course, have a ministry of 
information.  Some people would say a ministry of government 
propaganda.  The point I am making is that there is the very 
clear potential for abuse in government having such a tool at its 
disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen abuse by these government ministries of 
information, these propaganda producing departments, in other 
countries.  I think many of us in the House from all parties 
would be very concerned and would decry the ability and the 
exercise of some governments having this control and proactivity 
in shaping the message that goes out to citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important principle in a democracy, because 
democracy means that the people rule.  However, people's 
decisions are only as good as the information they have.  I think 
we would all agree on that.  Therefore, the question becomes, how 
do we make sure that people have good information so they can 
make good decisions in a democracy?  The question then becomes, 
who has the best and most proper role in providing that 
information to citizens? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give an example using members of parliament.  Members of 
parliament can send out a mailing to every household in their 
riding four times a year.  These are called householders.  Many 
members send out these householders to every household in their 
riding several times a year, up to four if they wish.  I have 
read many of these householders, as I am sure, Mr. Speaker, you 
have done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have seen householders from members of parliament which are 
extremely objective, which give very objective and balanced 
information to constituents, saying “This is what is happening 
in parliament.  These are some of the pros and cons of some of 
the issues we are dealing with.  Opponents of the measure say 
this; proponents say that.  I invite you to take this information 
as citizens to be more informed about what is happening and about 
what debate is looking like in the House of Commons”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other householders are, shall we say, much less objective in 
presenting information to constituents.  I am not being partisan. 
I think that is true of householders from members of parliament 
from all parties.  Some are much more objective than others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in every case the constituents who receive this 
information have to place some reliance on it.  Some are more 
objective than others.  That is just the way life is.  That is a 
very critical issue in a democracy:  the ability of citizens to 
get balanced, objective views and perspectives on important 
issues of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office was quite roundly criticized at 
its inception.  One headline read:  “An office where spin is 
in”.  I do not think that very many Canadians want to be the 
victims of spin doctors.  All of us know that when information is 
provided there is generally some kind of bias or agenda or 
perspective behind it, but there is some desire to not be fed a 
line, to not be propagandised, and this office was not 
necessarily seen as being very objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another headline:  “Putting new shine on government 
line”.  Even the pundits had concerns as they watched the Canada 
Information Office being set up about just how objective the 
information would be and just what agenda would be pursued by the 
office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government, of course, had some positive reasons for putting 
this into place.  We have many departments of government. 
Most of those departments have their own communications 
department, secretariat or whatever it is called.  The human 
resources development department, for example, which I follow as 
a shadow critic, employs 150 to 180 communication specialists.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has argued that instead of 35 different 
ministries all trying to get their message out, that it would be 
better to have a central information department whereby 
government could speak with one voice.  It has said that this 
office would not be where policies are created but about how 
information about policies would be shaped and communicated; in 
other words, communication specialists.  That does make some 
sense.  We all know that co-ordination is important.  We all know 
that singing from the same song sheet is important for any 
organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question really is whether government is inclined to go past 
that sort of objective, efficient, effective co-ordination of 
message and into a deliberate attempt to use government muscle, 
government resources, government money and government clout to 
actually shape the thinking of the public in a way that is not 
appropriate.  It is very difficult to bring the right balance 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is fair to say that I have seen the present 
government become less careful about giving objective information 
to the public and more concerned about spin doctoring, about 
managing the message.  Again I point to my experiences with the 
HRDC department where it used to be that the department responded 
promptly and fully to all access requests.  However, after the 
boondoggle audit, that all changed.  Memos starting going out 
saying “Do not send anything out until it has been vetted at the 
top and our message has been shaped, the communications have been 
written, the storyline has been decided and then we will put that 
information out once we have decided how to manage that 
message”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think Canadians have a right to be very concerned about that 
approach to government communications.  There is a line between 
efficiency and effectiveness and a genuine desire to provide 
clear and accessible information about key issues to all 
Canadians and a desire of government to spin the message, to 
propagandize, to shape, shade and bend Canadians' thinking along 
lines which suit government purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate is important because it gives us an opportunity to 
explore the lines we want to draw in the government's ability to 
inform the public in an open, honest, helpful and public spirited 
way and the government's tendency, unfortunately, to want to use 
that ability to plant its own message and its own way of thinking 
into the public consciousness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to remember that this whole question is important 
because the resources of government are enormous.  If government 
decides to cross the line beyond good information and helping 
people know the facts, and giving people necessary facts in 
important matters to actually try to shape people's thinking and 
to spin doctor them—and some people use the word brainwash, 
which I think is a little strong—and move over to what we might 
call the dark side, it has a pile of resources available to do 
that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, as citizens, must think very long and carefully before we 
allow the resources of government to be used to shape our way of 
thinking in a way that we would think is inappropriate, 
dishonest, self-serving or politically tainted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think what the Bloc is saying in its motion is that it has a 
real fear that the Canada Information Office has been, and 
certainly could be, used for that purpose.  We might argue 
whether the Bloc comes to that argument with clean hands.  We 
might argue whether the public good that the federal government 
is trying to achieve with the Canada Information Office in the 
case of the sovereignty debate would outweigh the disadvantage of 
not having that kind information out.  We can get into all that 
but I think we need to be careful.  Once we set the juggernaut in 
motion, once we start down the slippery slope for all the good 
reasons, such as pride, national unity, patriotism and caring 
about our country, we will have created a tool that can easily be 
abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own conclusion, from being in the House now for over six 
year, is that there is a regrettable tendency on the part of the 
government to abuse that kind of power and abuse its opportunity 
to use its resources.  I do not say that gleefully.  I do not say 
that to be unkind to the government.  I am saying that honestly. 
That is my honest conclusion.  I do not believe that is always 
the case.  At times I think the government honestly does try to 
reach the objectives that Liberal members have talked about by 
giving good, efficient and effective information that Canadians 
need and desire.  However, I do think there is a tendency to 
stray over the line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the Bloc for giving us an opportunity to be very 
vigilant on that issue.  I would say that the role of government 
in gathering information and disseminating that information to 
Canadians should be very carefully monitored and even limited 
because it is the nature of power to corrupt and information is 
power.  People who control information have tremendous power and 
influence.  I do not think I need to give a lot of examples, but 
the information flow and the control and shaping of it places 
enormous power and potential for misuse into the hands of whoever 
has the resources to control it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this motion, we have to recognize that government has a 
legitimate role in providing information.  In fact, we have 
argued strenuously in the House that government is not meeting 
its obligation to provide information to citizens, particularly 
because it has now begun, in many cases, to flout the legal 
requirements of providing information through the Access to 
Information Act.  It is a different thing from providing 
documents and facts to moving in the direction of packaging that 
information and shaping it in a way that is very influential on 
the thinking of citizens and doing that without any checks and 
balances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we need to be very strong about open, honest, 
transparent and full disclosure in government. 
We also need to be very aware and vigilant.  We need to put 
proper and appropriate limits and checks and balances to curb the 
potential for abuse in the kind of government activities like the 
Canada Information Office.

give them the straight facts without the filter of provincial 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest we have done that on a very modest scale to the tune 
of about 60 cents per person across the country, both to collect 
their opinions and to impart information.  However, I warn the 
member opposite that she is courting the prime information 
dispenser of two former leaders, Mr. Mulroney, and Mr. Harris who 
is currently in Ontario.  Mr. Long, who is fighting for the 
leadership of the member's party, dispensed over $100 million 
before the 1999 election in Ontario.  That was pretty outrageous 
material that was not exactly not seen through a filter of 
political taint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Mr. Long democratically and fairly wins the leadership of her 
party, will the member put up or will she not and suggest that he 
cannot use $100 million of money either from that party opposite 
or from any party to dispense his venom to the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was pretty 
venomous.  What the member is pleased to call sucking and blowing 
is an honest attempt to reach a balance, not to simply condemn 
full sail the distribution of information.  On the other hand, we 
do not want to make it a completely open process with no checks 
and balances and no hesitation about the kind of resources that 
are available to one perspective in putting forward a message. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member rightly pointed out, our message during the last 
election campaign was that all Canadians should be engaged in the 
important debate about the future of our country, not just 
leaders from Quebec.  We made that very clear as part of our 
approach to government, and we will continue to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deplore the member's partisanship in talking about one of our 
leadership candidates and one of the provincial premiers. This is 
not only the pot calling the kettle black, but it illustrates my 
point perfectly.  The Liberal government is happy to spend 
millions of dollars a year on getting their side of the story 
out, but if other people want to spend money on getting their 
side of the story out suddenly they are evil and must be stopped. 
That is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that there has to be honesty and objectivity in 
putting forward information and a variety of perspectives need to 
be put forward, which is exactly the principle that we believe 
government should operate under.  The oversight of something like 
the Canada Information Office is absolutely critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there will be other voices in the debate and there should 
be.  If people want to support those voices coming forward with 
their own resources, then they are at liberty to do so.  I 
certainly would not support the hon. member's suggestion that we 
should muzzle other voices or prevent other voices from bringing 
their point of view forward.  I would remind the hon. member that 
this is a democracy and I am going to fight for it to stay that 
way.

ask my colleague from the Canadian Alliance if she does not find 
it strange that this information is targeted at Quebecers?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it because the government thinks that Quebecers are a bit 
slow that they need more information to find out the truth? Did 
the member notice in her area, in western Canada, whether these 
“Heritage Minutes” and all this information was broadcast as 
widely as in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is information, then all Canadians should be interested. 
But if only Quebecers are interested, it is not information any 
more, it is propaganda. Does my colleague from the alliance 
believe that this information is shared equally across the 
country for the benefit of all Canadians? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my friend from the Bloc 
has put me in an awkward position.  Although I completely reject 
his agenda of breaking up my country, I cannot help but agree 
with him that it is very odd and very troubling that the 
activities of this multimillion dollar information agency seem to 
be trained mostly on Quebec. That is a rather puzzling 
circumstance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say if federal propaganda or information were trained 
mostly on the province I come from, I would be a little upset 
too.  I can see the need for the federal government in such a key 
issue for our country as the unity of our country wanting to make 
sure there is information going out to citizens and that it 
fights for the unity of the country, just as the Bloc Quebecois 
and the Parti Quebecois are fighting for the separation of our 
country. However, I think there should be fairness and balance in 
the use of resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our party has said, that discourse or debate should involve 
all citizens right across the country.  It should not be a duking 
it out between the federal government and the separatists in 
Quebec because this does affect all of us.  That is what one of 
our ads said during the last election, that this is such an 
important debate we do not just want a few voices being heard, we 
want voices from right across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer my friend's question, I would say that if there is a 
clear perception or evidence of unfairness or imbalance, then 
that is a legitimate concern to raise.  I would also say that he 
must then be prepared to live by his own rules and also be 
committed to fairness, balance and honesty in the information he 
brings forward in the debate, as well as demanding it from other 
people who are participating.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Proulx (Hull—Aylmer, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, for some time 
now there has been a lot of talk about the Canada Information 
Office, the CIO. We have been seeing quite a disinformation 
campaign being conducted by the Bloc Quebecois, which is trying 
at all costs to discredit and distort the work done by the CIO, 
particularly as it relates to the organization of the Quebec 
ministerial tours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gives me great pleasure to rise today in the House to clear 
up a few matters, particularly in relation to the tours that the 
CIO has been organizing in the last few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I want to point out that the CIO's mandate is to assist 
in improving communications between the government of Canada and 
Canadian citizens. I would note in passing, with all due respect 
for the members opposite, that Quebecers have confirmed twice in 
fifteen years that they wish to remain Canadian citizens; 
accordingly, they have a right to expect that their government, 
the Government of Canada, will provide them with information 
about the programs and services that are available to them, and 
they are entitled to receive accurate information. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1620"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where the ministerial tours come in. This is a 
government initiative, prompted by the desire of Quebec 
ministers to ensure that Quebecers are better informed and by a 
willingness to listen to them and engage them in dialogue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communication is a two way street. The government must not only 
adopt approaches that will enable it to communicate better with 
the public, but it must also, to that end, adopt approaches that 
will enable it to listen to them, to talk with them, so that it 
can target its activities more effectively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the tour is. It is not a secret, it is not 
propaganda, it is not party politics. 
It is a vehicle of communication that has been designed to 
promote the exchange of information between citizens and their 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the tour provided a vehicle of 
communication that enabled 12 ministers and secretaries of state 
to visit 128 different cities in Quebec in 122 days, and to hold 
340 activities, meetings or visits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we get right down to it, it is not surprising that the 
members of the Bloc would be worried about this kind of 
initiative. It has been about ten years since they started using 
the Canadian parliamentary system and taxpayers' money to push a 
secessionist agenda that a majority of Quebecers reject. And to 
help them sell their option, the members opposite are spreading 
half-truths and disinformation. And now that we have ministers 
making an end run around them to set the record straight, it is 
only natural that they are nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, in fact, what makes the Bloc most nervous is not the fact 
that the government is outflanking them and correcting the 
falsehoods they are spreading. What makes them most nervous is 
that the Quebecers the ministers are meeting on the tour, the 
mayors and leaders of community organizations, the chambers of 
commerce, the organizers and decision makers in the regions, are 
all too happy to be able to talk things over with a minister or 
a secretary of state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They appreciate the opportunity this gives them to tell the 
ministers about their concerns and to get more information about 
the services and programs their government makes available to 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fact is reflected in an editorial published in <I>Le Soleil</I> on 
September 24, 1999, which stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The beginning of this new era of co-operation is promising, and 
conveys a welcome spirit of co-operation in the Quebec City 
region. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last November, following a meeting with the President of the 
Treasury Board, the mayor of Sainte-Agathe des Monts, Pierre 
Circé, who knows the member for Laurentides well, said, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is now more familiar with our situation here, and 
we learned more about the programs that are available. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is definitely something that would make the Bloquistes 
nervous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It makes them nervous because it is clear that this kind of 
initiative, and the positive responses it is receiving, help 
strengthen Canadian unity. 
In spite of what members of the opposition would have us believe, 
there is nothing partisan in the government of Canada 
coordinating an initiative aimed at better explaining the 
advantages of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, the ministers' tour in Quebec was financed with public funds 
and that is quite legitimate.  The tour is one of the numerous 
information services that the Government of Canada provides to 
its citizens.  It is a communication activity focused on a 
dialogue with local representatives, just as advertising 
campaigns, mass mailing or the 1-800-O-CANADA line are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government tour approach is not new. It is already 
well-known in Quebec, because it is an approach used by the 
Quebec government as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I cannot help but find it bizarre that Bloc members 
would call it information when the Quebec government goes on 
tour, but call it propaganda whenever Canada does the same 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As always, it is a double standard for our Bloc colleagues, and 
everybody knows why.  The Bloc Quebecois absolutely wants to 
prevent the Canadian government from having visibility in Quebec, 
from being present in Quebec and from listening to Quebecers. It 
wants to deny Quebecers the benefits of their country, Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, both levels of governments have the right and the duty 
to inform Quebecers.  Let me quote what my colleague, the 
president of the Privy Council and member for 
Saint-Laurent—Cartierville said during a recent symposium on the 
quiet revolution: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can and we must have two serious governments, each with its 
own perspective, two governments exposed to different influences 
and which...learn from each other and from the other 
governments of our federation....This way, we give ourselves 
the best development opportunities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should not be surprised that Bloc members would criticize a 
Canadian government initiative which will show Quebecers that it 
is possible to talk to each other and to work together, that the 
Quebec government does not have a monopoly on “dialogue” and 
“joint action” and that their government is there to serve them 
and provide them with services that are useful in their day to 
day life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a way, all this hustle and bustle we have seen over the last 
few days is sort of flattering:  it shows that the Government of 
Canada has found an effective and successful way to better 
communicate with the citizens of Quebec.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to commend my hon. 
colleague on his speech.  I believe it was his maiden speech in 
the House.  He did a marvellous job in adding to the debate. I 
know he will be a welcome participant in what we all do here. 
Congratulations to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only our party but I believe most Canadians believe in a 
united Canada, but they cannot support the use of taxpayers' 
dollars to manipulate information to achieve an agenda if it only 
serves the government agenda.  I think that is the difficulty. 
Canadians in Quebec as well as Canadians right across the country 
will be angry and they will have a right to be angry if the 
government is simply using taxpayers' money to manipulate an 
outcome for political reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information Canadians want to know is what the government is 
doing and how it is doing it.  We believe that the Government 
should be prepared to demonstrate to Canadians that the Canada 
Information Office is achieving positive objectives that most 
Canadians support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member propose any way to demonstrate to Canadians that 
the Canada Information Office would serve Canadian interests and 
not the Liberal Party's own agenda? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Proulx:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
congratulating me and at the same time giving me the opportunity 
to give her more information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to confirm that the Canada Information Office has also 
provided information to Canadians about their country by 
supporting key events such as the Canada Conference '99 to 
celebrate the 50th anniversary of Newfoundland joining Canada. 
The Canada Information Office worked with a number of federal 
government organizations to sponsor and assist in the 
co-ordination of Canada Conference '99 which helped create 
cross-Canada awareness of this historic anniversary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In partnership with Veterans Affairs Canada, the CIO developed a 
veterans week media promotion campaign to develop greater 
awareness of the contribution of Canada and its veterans during 
World War I.  Media coverage of veterans week in 1998 increased 
by 57% over the previous years.  There are other examples.

Bloc Quebecois is not the fact that the government party travels 
at the taxpayers' expense for so-called information purposes. 
What bothers us is that they are not providing information; they 
are handing out cheques for projects on which opposition members 
have worked. They show up in the riding just to hand out a 
cheque, and the information they have to give is so public that 
they forget to actually invite people.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were public information, why would the member representing

interested to hear the information government members have to 
give. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were real information, it should be public, transparent 
and clear. They should not be afraid to speak openly and 
publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Marcel Proulx:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think my colleague is mixing 
carrots with potatoes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When departments want to give good news, announce projects or 
give out cheques, they do so through their ministers or other 
ministers or members. When the CIO organizes tours for Quebec 
ministers, it is for a different kind of activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Information Office is there to better inform 
Canadians about government policies, priorities, programs and 
services. However, once again, when the Government of Quebec 
does it, it is called information, but when the Government of 
Canada does the same thing, my colleague calls it propaganda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not quite the same thing. The CIO provides information to 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I was advised that 
the member was sharing his time.  If that is the case, I will 
have enough time to make the statement before the member with 
whom the time is being shared gets back to her place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my duty pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House 
that the questions to be raised tonight at the time of 
adjournment are as follows:  the hon. member for Jonquière, 
Importation of Plutonium and the hon. member York North, 
Infrastructure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Mississauga Centre, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I should like to speak today to the whole concept of 
media monitoring which was raised by some of our speakers in the 
debate this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we really need to be reminded that we are living in the 
information age?  Every day we in the industrialized world take 
in a wide variety of information.  Over the last 20 years we have 
been witness to the continuous acceleration and improvement of 
information technology.  One need only think of the computer and 
the Internet which are part of the daily lives of so many 
Canadians and which make information increasingly and ever more 
quickly accessible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada alone we have four 24 hour television news channels: 
RDI, LCN, Newsworld and CTV News, which often provide live 
coverage of current events.  The information age has 
substantially changed the relationship between citizens and the 
government.  Elected officials are finding citizens to be 
increasingly well informed as most of them now have the benefit 
of sophisticated tools for finding out what their governments are 
doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public is paying attention.  We can never underestimate its 
interest in what we do here.  For example, on the new immigration 
bill that is being debated and has now gone to committee, droves 
of people have come into my office in Mississauga asking when it 
will be implemented, when the process will start and when new 
people can be sponsored under the new rules.  We can never 
underestimate citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The citizens of Canada want a say in the directions adopted by 
the government.  For this to be possible, there must be a 
dialogue between the government and its citizens.  Let us 
remember the commitment of the government in this regard.  The 
Government of Canada will demonstrate in its daily activities 
that it is listening to its citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Canada Information Office, the Quebec ministerial tours 
are a success precisely because their purpose is to communicate 
with citizens.  If they were out there simply to give one way 
information it would be a useless endeavour, but they are there 
to listen, and listening is equally as important as giving out 
information.  The ministers meet with and listen to the concerns 
of mayors, presidents of chambers of commerce, and volunteer and 
community workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the Bloc living on the same planet as the rest of us?  I must 
confess that I find it incredible that the Bloc should be 
surprised that the Government of Canada, like all governments 
serious about establishing a fruitful dialogue with their 
citizens, engages in media monitoring events in the news which in 
French is called suivi médiatique. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living in a world of information, and that is reality. It 
is a very palpable reality for governments which have to be able 
to keep abreast of the latest news developments so they can 
manage public affairs properly.  When we get down to it, what is 
media monitoring? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will disappoint the Bloc but I have no secrets to reveal on 
the subject.  The CIO carries out reviews of the print and 
electronic media and of analyses of current events, very similar 
to the <I>Quorum</I> which we get in the lobbies every day.  The 
Government of Canada needs these reviews to be appropriately 
informed to make the decisions that are necessary.  Not to be 
thus equipped would be irresponsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All members of the House know that the people who come into our 
constituency offices, often to complain about something, are not 
representative samples of what the Canadian public is thinking. 
If we just depended on those who come into our offices and those 
that we choose to listen to, we would have a very slanted view of 
the world, indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Bloc describes the CIO's media monitoring as secret 
surveillance, or says that it keeps personal information records 
on journalists, no one takes them very seriously, not even the 
journalists who are being greatly underestimated.  If the 
journalists believed for one minute this was happening, there 
would be a massive hue and cry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to quote Ms. Manon Cornellier, a journalist with 
<I>Le Devoir</I>, who stated recently: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is common practice for departments and organizations to 
analyze media content and particularly the trends of their 
editorial pages. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is therefore surprised to learn that the CIO has analyzed 
the editorial evolution of the <I>Gazette</I>.  No one is 
surprised.  These documents the Bloc keeps talking about are 
nothing more than a failed attempt to create something out of 
nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be perfectly clear.  There exists no personal records at 
the CIO, neither on journalists nor on anyone else.  The 
documents in question date back to more than three years ago. 
They are simple media analyses that contain absolutely no secret 
or personal information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These analyses turned out to be of very little use and the CIO 
does not prepare them any more.  Using loaded words to try and 
instil fear in the hope of winning a few political points is 
becoming rather more typical of the Bloc.  Though it is true it 
does need some points at the moment, there is always the double 
standard: what is good for one is not good for the other; what is 
good for the PQ government is not good for the Government of 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </B>Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. What the member of the government party is 
doing right now is unacceptable. She is making unfounded 
accusations against members of the Bloc Quebecois and I just 
cannot accept that. I would ask her to withdraw her remarks. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  This is debate. Very 
often positions are taken on either side of the House which other 
members find offensive but are certainly in keeping with debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I invite the hon. member for Jonquière at the time available for 
questions and comments to put her question directly to the member 
for Mississauga Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  I learned a long time ago in local 
politics that we have to develop thick skins.  If the member does 
not want to hear our opinions, she should not have suggested this 
subject as a debate point for the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister responsible for the CIO recently asked the 
following question in the House: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that, according to the Bloc, when the Government of 
Quebec communicates with its citizens it is called information 
but when the Government of Canada communicates with its citizens, 
especially those in Quebec, it suddenly becomes propaganda? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Bloc to attack the CIO because it feels its media 
monitoring is an irresponsible expenditure of public money is 
incredible, coming from an opposition party that uses federal and 
Commons public funding to promote the separation of Quebec from 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every department, every government, federal and provincial, and 
especially the head office in Quebec City, conducts media 
monitoring.  One must be really trying to create a crisis where 
there is none if one would have people believe it is incredible 
and unacceptable for the Government of Canada to adopt and use 
the enhanced communication media that are a reflection and tools 
of our times.

covers all subjects related to the institutional communications 
of the Government of Canada.  Obviously all departments, whether 
it be justice, environment, or citizenship and immigration, have 
their own media monitoring unit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The added value of the CIO's media room is that it shares with 
the other departments media coverage of a general nature, which 
allows those departments to better manage their own mandates 
while incorporating an overview of the issues.  They are relevant 
to the Government of Canada.  It is self-evident that horizontal 
communication is an asset which helps make the government's 
message coherent to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add that I came through a very long career, a 
very different career path.  Each time I ended up in a spot in 
life, technology was always a half step ahead of me.  I find it 
phenomenal in the House the excellent job done with <I>Quorum</I> 
and all the information provided by each department on what the 
public in Canada is thinking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I believe that the government is very responsive to 
the Canadian public.  We use the tools available.  We do not use 
propaganda.  We share information.  We correct propaganda.  We 
make sure that every citizen in every community across the 
country has access to all government services, understands 
government services, understands their rights and are able to 
access them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very proud of the CIO.  I am very proud of the minister who 
is in charge of it.  He is doing an extremely efficient job.  I 
mildly resent the fact that we wasted a whole day talking about 
this motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the hon. member and her arrogance reflects 
an inferiority complex. That is all there is to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said that members of the Bloc are nervous, but we are not. 
The hon. member said it about 20 times: we are very calm. Things 
are going very well for the Bloc, whether the hon. members 
opposite like it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a minister comes to my riding of Matapédia—Matane, I am 
glad if he or she comes to give us information, but the fact is 
that what they give is not information. As my colleague said, 
when they do come, ministers meet with mayors and members of the 
chambers of commerce, who are extraordinary people, I agree. But 
why do they never meet with seasonal workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do they not talk about employment insurance, which I call 
misery insurance? People in my area are almost starving to death. 
In the Gaspé peninsula, there are 10,000 or 15,000 people who 
want the minister to visit. But nobody ever comes. The unemployed 
are not important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important for the Liberals is to misinform the people, 
not to find solutions. If they were honest, they would have come 
to announce the cuts in the transfers to provinces. They would 
have said “We will cut <I>x</I> millions of dollars in health care and so 
many billion dollars in other areas”. But they did not come to 
announce it. They should have come to give us the information. 
Why did they not come at that time to give the information they 
say they are giving today? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should like to 
address the first part of the question which was to do with 
seasonal workers and the EI changes.  EI changes came in well 
before the last election.  It is a three or four year review 
program.  I must point out that the member's concerns, as well as 
the concerns of the Atlantic province MPs on this side of the 
House, are being very seriously entertained by the department. If 
modifications are required, I am sure they will be addressed in 
due time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as making announcements on transfer payments, when we 
came into power in 1993 after a disastrous Tory government we cut 
every department.  It was very clear in the second budget we 
brought in that the cuts were being done across the country in 
every department, including transfers to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We made very clear that the reason we needed CIO was that those 
transfers were interpreted by the people in the member's party to 
the people in Quebec to be that they were being punished somehow 
and the Government of Canada was deserting them.

the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was democratically elected by the people, and I represent 100 
opposite question the competence and the actions of the Bloc 
Quebecois members. We pay taxes and income tax to the Government 
of Canada and we have the right to come and sit in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand how the member, who is a parliamentary 
secretary, can say such things. I find it disappointing coming 
from her.  I have always held her in high esteem, and I do not understand 
why she is trying to make Canadians and Quebecers believe that 
there is nothing to hide. There is, because contracts have be 
given to buddies without going to tender. I would like her to 
respond to my comments. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am also offended, as 
the member for Jonquière is offended at my aspersions on her 
character.  I am offended that her whole party is trying to break 
up my country.  I am offended that they are questioning the 
integrity of my minister.  I am offended that they are 
questioning the integrity of the information that the CIO puts 
out.  I am also offended that many of them take many of the 
dollars we allocate to their ridings and they do not even say 
thank you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too am offended, and I am directing my remarks directly at the 
member.

<P><A NAME="LINK239"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin (Sherbrooke, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise to speak to a very current issue.  The Bloc, naturally, 
in recent days has mentioned a number of disturbing matters, so 
disturbing that two of us will explain them to you and give you 
more details.  I will share my time with the member for Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was saying, therefore, that this is a current matter, which 
follows more or less in the footsteps of that of the Human 
Resources Development Canada.   There had been criticism of the 
big brother aspect of this department's megafile.  It was 
apparently dismantled at the request of tens of thousands of 
people wanting to see their file to find out just what was in it. 
In order to avoid the issue, the government said “We will 
dismantle this immense data base and answer all requests on the 
information the department has on individuals”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Make no mistake.  It was dismantled.  So all the information 
that existed previously will not be available.  Only partial 
information will be available.  This is like what is happening 
with the CIO, a big brother of another sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot more behind the information we have on the 
contracts given to friends.  It will be information especially 
that the government will be looking for, perhaps not directly 
from individuals, but from a nation, that is, a complete analysis 
of all information, values and behaviours to discover how to 
deliver a message that will slip, often insidiously, into the 
heads of all Quebecers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It only made sense that we would present a motion on this 
opposition day. There are probably thousands of people who just 
joined us, so I will read the motion again, so that these people 
can understand clearly. The motions reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for having established 
the Canada Information Office, which gives lucrative contracts 
to those close to the government party for, among other things, 
the purpose of gathering, analysing and collating information 
about a large number of citizens— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, of course, we are alluding to the journalists, but earlier 
I referred to the behaviour of the whole Quebec society. 
The motion ends with the following: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—and that this House urge the government to close that Office. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is essentially asking for the closure of the 
CIO, because that office serves as an agency for the Liberal 
Party of Canada, because it engages in shameless cronyism and 
because, four years after being established, the CIO remains a 
catch-all service that awards all sorts of contracts to help 
define its mission and its organizational structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to relate two experiences that happened to me in my last 
months on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts. 
I wrote twice to the auditor general to ask him to evaluate the 
CIO, to shed light on its activities, to look at its performance 
and to examine its operations. Had that been done, we would have 
been in a position to validate all that we are saying today 
about the awarding of contracts and about all the information 
that the government is gathering on the Quebec people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, my request was rejected at the public accounts 
committee, and we were not able to have the evaluation done 
before the end of the CIO's mandate, on March 31, 2000. Such an 
evaluation would have been very interesting and it is likely 
that we could not decently have renewed the CIO's mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second experience came on May 4, when the Minister of Public 
Works came to testify before the Standing Committee on Natural 
Resources and Government Operations. 
I will quote what he said “The Canada Information Office has a 
special mandate to communicate from a corporate perspective 
representing the Government of Canada as a whole”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This short sentence does have one quality. He probably did not 
realize this, but he did demonstrate quite a lot of 
transparency. When he says “to communicate from a corporate 
perspective”, what does corporate mean? A corporation is free to 
provide contracts to whomever it wants and whenever it wants. It 
is for profit. It sells a product. What product does the CIO 
want to sell Quebecers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also said to us “I'm pleased to inform you that it 
has made progress on a number of fronts in helping the 
Government of Canada communicate more effectively with 
Canadians”. 
Communication is a two way street. There is a transmitter and a 
receiver, but I think the CIO receiver is much more sensitive 
and voluminous than the transmitter toward the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was also saying “To communicate better with Canadians, 
federal departments need to know what strategies and activities 
have worked best”, to be able to use them in the years to come, 
in future government actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO has virtually become a huge communications, marketing 
and image business. It is an image maker.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That about sums up what the Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services told us when he appeared before the Standing 
Committee on Natural Resources and Government Operations. 
Naturally, we had an opportunity to ask all sorts of other 
questions, but as usual we got no answers.  Communication 
presupposes a two-way street but with the government it is all 
one way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to know how much time I have remaining, Mr. 
Speaker, because there are some important points I do not want to 
forget.  I think that I could have managed it all.  As I have two 
minutes left I will jump almost to the end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members on both sides spoke about information and propaganda. 
They had trouble making a distinction.  It is not all that 
complicated.  In response to a question I asked him, the Minister 
of Public Works and Government Services talked about visibility 
and publicity.  When information becomes publicity involving such 
large amounts—in the case of the CIO, we are talking about $20 
million—what are the publicity budgets for all departments as a 
whole? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When such substantial sums are involved, tens, even hundreds of 
millions of dollars in publicity all over the place, primarily in 
Quebec, then it becomes apparent that this is no longer 
publicity, no longer information or communication, but 
propaganda, for example, “action exerted on opinion to bring it around 
to certain political or social ideas, to support a policy, a 
government, a representative”.  <I>Le Petit Robert</I> goes on to say 
“propaganda from a political party, election propaganda, 
instrument or means of propaganda”, in other words, everything 
we saw in the contracts: speeches, newspapers, movies, 
television. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore not difficult to make a distinction between 
information, communication, publicity and propaganda. I think 
that we have everything here to help us see the difference and 
say that what this government is engaged in, through the CIO, is 
nothing other than propaganda. 
<P><A NAME="LINK240"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my colleague had 
no choice but to deny us the opportunity to hear the last part 
of his remarks for lack of time, but I would be very much 
interested in hearing the tail end of the remarks he did not 
finish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member take a few minutes to convey the message 
he could not deliver fully? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin: </B>Mr. Speaker, let me go back to what I was 
saying. I touched on this issue very briefly earlier. When the 
public works minister appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Natural Resources and Government Operations, I gave him an 
example from my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An organization had asked Canada Economic Development for a 
significant grant in order to hold a special and grandiose 
event. Following an economic feasibility study and analysis, CED 
rejected that request. The organization then went to the public 
works minister, asked for the same amount of money, and 
automatically got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the minister “When you give grants to various 
organizations, do you take the economic feasibility and 
viability of the project into consideration?” His answer was 
“This is not about economy, but about government visibility. 
This is a publicity contract”. And this contract was awarded 
without considering the economic viability of the event, which 
suffered tremendous losses in the first year, was held a second 
year, and again suffered big losses.

<A HREF="#LINKT84"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were flags everywhere and the word Canada could be seen 
everywhere. For the minister, what matters is visibility and 
publicity. Why visibility? The opposite word says it all, 
invisibility. Why does he spend money to be seen? Because he is 
completely invisible when it comes to helping the unemployed, 
health and education. Since he has to be visible somehow, this 
is the way he has chosen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were many questions we could have asked the minister on 
that memorable day but once again it turned out to be a day of 
unanswered questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the CIO give its financial support to the Fédération 
des femmes du Québec for the walk of 2000? Does Status of Women 
of Canada not have the financial resources for its women support 
program? Is that the responsibility of the CIO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that Createc Plus was awarded a contract for printing 
anti-smoking material? Is that not the responsibility of the 
Minister of Health, considering what he is doing right now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did GPC Canada, and Rémi Bujold, receive $46,000 to do 
economic analysis? Should that not be the role of the Finance 
Minister? Why is it the CIO? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did Productions Les Arts receive $20,000 for an exchange 
between francophone communities in Alberta and Quebec? Is that 
not the responsibility of the Council for Canadian Unity? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that another company received $20,000 for planning 
tours by the Canadian team of gold medallists? Does the 
Secretary of State for Amateur Sport not have funding available 
for that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did Conseils et Vérification Canada receive $55,000 for the 
seminars of 2000 in Laval and Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu? Is that its 
responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CIO interferes in areas that do not come under its 
responsibility at all. Why? Visibility is used to conceal the 
government's lack of performance, the invisibility of its 
performance and its inability to fulfil the needs of Quebecers 
and of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for the benefit of 
the citizens of my riding who are doing me the honour of being 
in the public gallery today and whom I am pleased to greet, and 
for the benefit of the other citizens in my riding and in all 
other ridings in Quebec and Canada, I would like to explain what 
we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today is a supply day and on this supply day, the Bloc Quebecois 
put forward for debate the following motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for having established 
the Canada Information Office, which gives lucrative contracts 
to those close to the government party for, among other things, 
the purpose of gathering, analysing and collating information 
about a large number of citizens, and that this House urge the 
government to close that Office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is essentially asking that the CIO or the 
Canada Information Office be closed. Why? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Canada Information Office is being used as an agency 
of the Liberal Party of Canada. Because the Canada Information 
Office shamelessly engages in cronyism and because, since its 
creation four years ago, the CIO has always been a “grab bag” 
agency and it has signed countless contracts to help it define 
its role and its mandate.

<A HREF="#LINKT85"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>After four years, the CIO still does not know what it should be 
doing. And if it does not know what it should be doing, why are we 
giving it money? Is this wasted money? We are giving $20 million 
a year to this agency that hired 83 people without complying 
with the normal hiring rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want is quite simple, it is transparency. We are telling 
the government that if it wants a propaganda agency for Canadian 
federalism, it should create one but it should say so publicly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reminds me of certain drivers. 
Is there anything more frustrating then when the car up ahead 
signals a right turn, but abruptly makes a left turn? This is 
most irritating and even dangerous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the government is doing now. It says that the CIO 
is an agency that deals with information. If we follow the CIO, 
we would expect it to turn toward information. But, to our great 
surprise, the CIO makes a right turn instead of a left turn, as 
expected. The right side is the propaganda side. This is 
surprising, irritating and dangerous. 
It is a very powerful instrument that can be used to manipulate 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the CIO is transparent and wants to provide information to 
all citizens, why does it not spend the same kind of money in 
other Canadian provinces? Why is it concentrating its 
information and propaganda budgets in Quebec? Is it because the 
CIO thinks that Quebecers are not very bright, that they are 
deaf, that one must explain things to them more often, for a 
longer time so that they can understand the message? Is it 
because other Canadians are not interested in the country? Is it 
because the information that the government has to give out is 
not of general interest? Is it because the people of British 
Columbia should not receive the same message as Quebecers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is about the provision of information, then the same information 
should be provided everywhere using the same means. 
If Quebecers are likely to be interested in what is happening in 
the Rockies, why would the people from the Rockies not be 
interested in what is happening in Quebec? Did the CIO think 
about marking the 20th anniversary of the first referendum in 
Quebec? No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet, it spent tens of thousands of dollars to celebrate the 50th 
anniversary of one of the maritime provinces. It informs and 
brings attention to important events. That was such an event. 
Strangely, the CIO was established following a referendum that 
the government almost lost in 1995. The CIO was created in 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the beginning, that seemed to be normal, as the CIO reported 
to the Department of Canadian Heritage. We were told “The role 
of Canadian Heritage is propaganda, informing all citizens”. We 
found it almost normal. 
In 1998, however, all of a sudden, the government decided to 
take the CIO away from Heritage Canada and give it to the 
Department of Public Works.  The Minister of Public Works told 
us this week that it was reasonable for the CIO to be his 
responsibility, since served as an instrument to build Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was going to use the CIO to build Canada so 
it moved it.  At the same time, however, Public Works Canada 
hands out contracts for publicity and all sorts of contracts for 
propaganda.  My colleague from Sherbrooke gave a few examples of 
this earlier, and I want to mention another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everest, a company that received a $75,000 contract, had 
contributed $20,000, a coincidence, to the Liberal Party 
election campaign in 1997 and 1998, and one of its managers, 
Claude Lacroix, headed the Liberal Party's communications 
campaign in 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another distressing coincidence involves Le Groupe Action, which 
received a contract for $46,000. 
Le Groupe Action has its offices at the same premises as 
Everest. Le Groupe Action contributed $60,000 to the Liberal 
Party in 1997-98. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all this transparency, I would like the government to explain 
how Le Groupe Action, which received a $46,000 contract, was so 
grateful as to return $60,000 to the coffers of the Liberal 
Party election fund.  It got $46,000 and it gave $60,000.  It 
must have got something somewhere else.  I do not know any 
company that is generous to the point of giving a political 
party more money than it got.  Something is unclear in all this. 
What other money did the company receive for it to be so 
generous with the government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want transparency.  The ministers tour under the auspices of 
the CIO and visit our ridings. 
It was mentioned earlier that they had made 122 visits.  When 
they come to our ridings to inform people, I am happy with their 
coming to inform people, but when one informs people, one 
informs everyone.  They should not target an audience they have 
a cheque for under a grant program that would have benefited 
this audience in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ministers circulate, meet a small group of 10 or 15 persons 
represented by the chamber of commerce and certain mayors.  The 
mayors are very well informed.  The chambers of commerce are the 
best informed organizations in our communities.  They do not 
have the greatest need for information.  The people do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let the government come then and tell the people why they cut 
billions in health care, as my colleague from Matapédia—Matane 
said. Why did the government, which created surpluses for itself, soon 
to be worth $25 billion, in the employment insurance fund by 
dipping into the pockets of the unemployed, not come and tell 
the people about that?  This is interesting and useful 
information, because it enables taxpayers to judge the actions 
of the government.  This is the role of information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you seem nervous. Has my time run out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> Unfortunately it has.

<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Parrish (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have some very simple questions for the member for Joliette. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed recently in the newspapers there was a glorious 
announcement in <I>L'Expression</I> that the member opposite 
accorded $251,270 for HRDC programs for student jobs in his 
riding.  I am wondering if he takes similar offence to the HRDC 
money that is going into his riding to create jobs for students 
as he does to the BIC money that is going to assist events that 
people would like to conduct in his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question I would like to ask, and I do not mind in all 
the areas if the response is there, but when the funds go in for 
BIC projects, do they display a Liberal logo on the event, or do 
they display the Canada word mark?  I just wondered if that was 
different in Quebec.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Laurin:</B> Mr. Speaker, when subsidies or money are handed 
out to some of my constituents, I am not shy to say it. I hold a 
press conference or send a press release, and it is mentioned in 
all the newspapers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell my constituents “You were right to take advantage of 
this or that program.” I do not tell them that they owe their 
funding to the Liberal government or their member of parliament. 
I say “The money comes from your tax dollars. It is yours. I am 
only here to serve you, to try to help you apply to the program 
and get some of the money.” I do not seize the opportunity to 
engage in propaganda but that is what the Liberals do and that is 
why we are so hard on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals wants to use the CIO to engage in propaganda, 
they should be blunt about it and not hide the fact. That has 
always been the trademark of the Liberal government: it is so 
open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we told the heritage minister at midday today that the 
government had agreed to spend $5 million to celebrate Canada Day 
in the province of Quebec in the year 2000, she did not deny it. 
But when she was asked how much money the government was 
spending for those celebrations in the rest of the country, she 
declined to answer. That is not what openness is all about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the CIO is a transparent information tool, do we then need to 
ask her how many millions of dollars will be spent in the other 
provinces of Canada?  If the minister refuses to reply, there 
are grounds for suspecting that the $5 million will likely be 
the largest amount earmarked for celebrating Canada Day, and it 
will go to Quebec. Do Quebecers have a greater need to celebrate 
Canada Day than other Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are other Canadians not sufficiently proud of their country, 
“the finest country in the world” as the Prime Minister tells 
us?  Are they not proud enough to benefit from certain amounts 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage might allocate to them in 
order to properly celebrate their national holiday, the birthday 
of their country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why this secrecy?  It is simple. 
It is because they want to imply that it is a totally natural 
thing for Quebecers to wish to celebrate July 1, Canada Day. 
They want to make a show by using the money to buy banners 
instead of using it to let people express themselves. They are 
going to use it on things, things that will provide visibility 
and speak on behalf of people, trying to pass them off as great 
Canadian federalists.  That is the intention, so let them come 
out and say so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not hiding the fact that we are sovereignists.  We say so 
to anyone.  We have been coming to Ottawa for the past seven 
years just to say so.  It is no secret. We say “Here we are, we 
are sovereignists”. We will tell it to everyone.  We are 
prepared to go to the other provinces of Canada to explain our 
position.  Unfortunately the CIO does not organize tours for 
us. The CIO does not give us any budget for that, whereas the 
ministers have a budget funded by the CIO.  We are forced to pay 
for such things out of our office operating budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the intention is to provide everyone with honest information, 
then why not use this money to benefit all members of this 
House, regardless of party affiliation?  That would be honesty, 
that would be transparency.  This not being the case, we are 
calling for this propaganda office to be closed and we will be 
vociferous in our demands.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to take part in this debate, although my tone will be different 
from that of my colleague, who has an exceptional voice. He must 
surely be a mighty tenor. Since I do not have a lot of time, I 
will get on with my remarks.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am extremely pleased that my party decided to use this 
opposition day to deal with the CIO. It is strange that this 
body would be called the Canada Information Office. What drew 
our attention, even though we are aware of the CIO's existence 
and we know that it carries on certain activities, is the desire 
to hide the funding provided to this office. What was behind it 
all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not want us to know that the “Heritage 
Minutes” produced by Robert-Guy Scully were funded by the CIO. 
This means that the government knew that the role of the Canada 
Information Office was not to provide information and that if it 
admitted that a journalist was getting funding from the CIO for 
its programs, that journalist would not be able to claim to be 
one for very long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that today Robert-Guy Scully said that he was no 
longer a journalist. He decided to say so today, but some would 
say that he stopped being one some time ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That attempt to hide the use made of funds allocated for 
propaganda compelled us to search—and we are not done with our 
research—to find out to what extent the Canada Information Office 
is an unacceptable institution. I strongly support today's 
opposition motion, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That this House condemn the government for having established 
the Canada Information Office, which gives lucrative contracts 
to those close to the government party for, among other things, 
the purpose of gathering, analysing and collating information 
about a large number of citizens, and that this House urge the 
government to close that Office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the government must close the CIO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add a few more arguments to the strong arguments 
put forward by my colleagues. I heard the members opposite say 
“But is it not normal to inform Canadians?” The departments 
inform Canadians.  They all have budgets for that.  The Privy 
Council exists and we know that it is quietly doing studies and 
surveys of Canadians and that it is keeping the government 
informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large number of agencies which deal at arm's length with the 
government are also ways of giving publicity to Canada.  I will 
give an example.  The various regional economic development 
agencies throughout the country, with names like the Atlantic 
Canada Opportunities Agency, or the Western Economic 
Diversification Agency, have continued to keep their names. In 
Quebec, the Federal Office of Regional Development for Quebec 
became—and I want members to listen carefully—Economic Development 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is rather odd, because the government agency that deals 
with economic development in Canada—we will get back to this some 
other time—or comes under the economic development department, 
instead of retaining a name with a connection with Quebec is now 
called Economic Development Canada. This is the only agency to 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elsewhere, it is the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency or 
the Western Economic Diversification Agency, but in Quebec and 
only there, it is called Economic Development Canada.  How much 
did it cost to change the letterhead, the publicity, the signs, 
and so forth?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could do a study just of the period since this government has 
been in office, to count the number of “Canada's” written in 
large letters everywhere, including just across the Portage 
bridge in Hull. Then there was Via Rail's colour change and the 
addition of “Canada” and then the flag.  I could mention others, 
because there are many such agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Business Development Bank of Canada doing?  It has a 
publication that it sends out to all businesses in Canada, and 
there are 700,000 of them.  How many copies of this publication 
are printed? It promotes Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are countless information and propaganda tools in Canada. 
There is something a bit special in seeing to what extent they 
have to put the mention “Canada” and the flag everywhere. The 
means are huge, nobody can question that. What was that CIO 
established for, as I have to remind the House, shortly after 
the 1995 referendum that we came close to win? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a tool that, as we found out, was not informing Canadians 
but informing the government about Canadians and Quebecers in 
particular. This week, thanks to the co-operation of people who 
wanted it to be known, we found out there were files on 
journalists. We were told that that practise had been given up 
for a year. But go and look for yourself. Files were kept on 
journalists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This practise alone shows the true nature of that so-called 
information office. Some claim that analyzing journalistic 
practises for government departments is innocent. No, it is not. 
When we know how much the journalistic profession in Canada has 
deteriorated, when we know how much journalists are often 
unprotected where they work, when we know how much that 
situation can give rise to self-censorship, when we know how much 
that can influence journalists who want to be hired or have 
their contract renewed because they are casual employees, that 
alone is extremely serious. This is serious and clearly this 
qualifies the kind of information that so-called Canada 
Information Office wants to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why then create the CIO when we have all those sources of 
information? There is another explanation besides the type of 
information they want to do. There is also the fact that they no 
doubt wanted to appeal more widely and more easily to private 
firms and thus, as was abundantly shown, to favour friends of 
the regime. 
That is how they were described in an editorial from the daily 
<I>Le Devoir</I>, using an expression that is well known in Quebec. We 
learned what “friends of the regime” meant under the Duplessis 
administration. One could say that the Duplessis administration 
has come back, but in Ottawa. Those who were most scornful about 
the Duplessis administration should worry about what is going on 
right now in this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the so-called information is intended for Quebecers 
should not make them less aware of it. Instead of focussing 
energies, resources and millions of dollars on trying to 
understand why, while they are quiet right now, an increasing 
number of Quebecers are convinced that the only solution for 
them is to organize themselves in order to control their future, 
the government should shut down the CIO.

Bill C-214, an act to provide for the participation of the House

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to continue my speech on Bill C-214, an act to provide 
for the participation of the House of Commons when treaties are 
concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it a little strange that my colleague from 
Beauharnois—Salaberry had to introduce a bill on this issue. It 
seems to me that this is so obvious that we should not even need 
to bring the subject up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Major social changes are occurring worldwide. With the huge 
opportunities that are provided by the development of technology 
and transportation, our planet is getting smaller. Distances are 
increasingly shorter, so that trade, cultural and political 
exchanges among countries are increasingly a common occurrence. 
This phenomenon has social and political impacts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most people call this phenomenon the globalization of economies. 
This globalization necessarily leads to more treaties between 
countries. The increase in the number of treaties must be 
further examined at the parliamentary level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, the government can sign treaties without consulting the 
House. So what are we doing here, as parliamentarians, since 
international treaties are becoming increasingly important? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time I spoke on this bill, I talked about what happened 
with the multilateral investment agreement, which was being 
negotiated secretly at the OECD. At some point during 
negotiations, someone leaked the document on the Internet. When 
groups of citizens around the world looked at the contents of 
the negotiations, they quickly opposed this project. 
Pockets of dissent developed all over the world, aimed at 
thwarting the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing that I wonder about: what would the role of 
parliamentarians have been in this?  Why are members of 
parliament elected?  Is it merely to enact national legislation? 
In a world that is becoming more and more international, a 
world where there are increasing numbers of treaties, it has 
become absolutely essential for the good of my fellow citizens 
that I be familiar with the contents of such treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the example of one very important treaty of the past 
decade, it is possible under NAFTA for companies to bring a suit 
against government.  This has happened in connection with an 
environmental rule, when the government had passed legislation 
banning MMT, for the protection of the public.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A company that risked losing a market brought a suit against the 
Canadian government, and thus against the Canadian people, since 
the elected representatives of the people had passed an 
environmental regulation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that the bill we are looking at today lies at the 
heart of the reflection on democracy that must take place.  This 
is a matter very dear to my heart.  Moreover, I have tried to 
raise it in a highly visible manner, if I may put it that way. 
All of this issue of political power, the power of elected 
representatives, and the fact that it seems to be being whittled 
away at, is dear to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This week, moreover, in the <I>Hill Times</I>, a government MP spoke of 
how greatly over-centralized power was within this parliament. 
Is it the MPs who make the decisions, or is it the PMO?  I 
believe that the 301 members of the House must be consulted. 
These members represent the interests of their fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of international agreements on our fellow citizens is 
increasing.  As proof of this, in my riding this week I had the 
case of emu breeders who will not be eligible for a 
reimbursement program because of an international World Trade 
Organization agreement.  I refer to these cases merely as very 
concrete examples of the fact that the impact of international 
agreements on populations is increasing.  Who represents that 
population?  In my opinion, the members of parliament. 
It should not be only the Prime Minister with a few ministers 
who  sign these international treaties without any prior debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation presented by the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry is extremely relevant in these times of 
globalization. This is only the beginning. There are many other 
issues that should be debated with regard to the role of members 
of parliament in a context of globalization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will eventually have to hold a debate—which I am in favour 
of—about the social impacts of globalization and also about who 
will determine the direction that globalization should take. As 
we know, more and more people are demonstrating everywhere in 
the world; they are not necessarily opposed to globalization but 
to the direction globalization is taking, and I am one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think a broad debate must be held about that. 
A major part of that debate relates to the whole issue of world 
governance or world co-ordination, call it what we may, or reform 
of current international forums which sorely lack for democratic 
legitimacy, in my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the same thing for the G-20 group chaired by the Minister 
of Finance of Canada. What legitimacy does he have in his 
actions when he goes on the international stage? Not only do 
they not consult members of parliament, they do not consult the 
population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, where is democracy? Does it boil down to an 
election every four years to choose a government and a Prime 
Minister and a few ministers who will go on the international 
stage? I think there is a lack of democracy here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Denis Coderre:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With all due respect for the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Jean, I do 
not think opposition members are the only ones who can consult 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As government members, our role when we meet with 
the people is to remind them that we are the government of the 
whole country and to express our viewpoint. We also consult the 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot overlook what my 
colleague has just said. A year ago, I tabled a petition signed 
by 50,000 people asking the House to set up a parliamentary 
committee to elaborate a process whereby the civil society would 
be consulted on the huge issue of globalization, a matter of 
real concern in this country and throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I am told that the government is consulting the people. I 
have serious doubts about that and I think the government is 
trying to muddle the issues by making these assertions. 
Unfortunately, my time has run out. We have only seen the tip of 
the iceberg. I do want to congratulate my hon. colleague, 
because it is at least a step in the right direction.

from the Bloc for bringing forth this private member's bill for 
debate, Bill C-214, the Treaties Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to just briefly outline what we are discussing here today 
in the context of this debate because members may not have been 
able to pick it up from some of the commentary that has been 
made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill provides that all important international treaties 
must be tabled in the House of Commons for approval by resolution 
and that no treaty may be ratified unless so approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill goes on to define an “important treaty” as:  any 
treaty whose implementation requires legislative action by 
parliament; vests the government with new powers; imposes a new 
tax; imposes new financial obligations on Canada; affects the 
boundaries or transfers the territory of any part of Canada; 
calls for the imposition of economic or military sanctions 
against another country; affects trade or investment or Canada's 
place in the world economy; or involves participation in 
international institutions, including any transfer of 
jurisdiction to international institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also provides that every international treaty shall be 
tabled for 21 sitting days prior to ratification, along with an 
explanatory memorandum, including a summary, implications for 
Canada, new obligations undertaken, estimated expenditures to be 
incurred, proposed conditions for denunciation or withdrawal and 
a record of the consultations undertaken in Canada with 
non-governmental parties, an indication of any legislation 
required for implementation, and of existing legislation that 
requires amendment, and also, the provinces must be consulted in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill provides for greater efforts to inform the public about 
what the treaties contain through publication in the Canadian 
<I>Gazette</I> and on the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin my response to this bill by saying, yes, this is 
good and it is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From what I have witnessed over the last seven years since I was 
elected a member of parliament, the government's approach to 
international agreements and conferences has been of major 
concern to me.  The Parliament of Canada has not been consulted. 
The government does most of these negotiations and conferences 
behind closed doors with no meaningful public input.  This 
concerns me a great deal because it does in fact affect everyone 
in this great country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament, and in fact all Canadians, should be informed of the 
positions Canada takes at international conferences.  The ideas 
and policies that our delegates promote at international symposia 
or meetings should be debated in parliament and approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>United Nations conferences, such as the Beijing conference, the 
Kyoto conference and the conference we had in Brazil on the 
environment, are all examples of conferences held where the 
majority of Canadians did not agree with the policies that were 
advocated.  This is most serious when these policies are approved 
by the UN and Canada signs on, we are then obligated to comply 
without these being debated or passed in parliament in a 
democratic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the democratic process in this country can be 
circumvented.  Certain groups within the country can twist the 
arm of government, can get on some of these delegations that go 
there, promote policies that most Canadians would not agree with, 
get those approved or negotiated internationally, the government 
signs on and then it comes back and says that we have to put 
these in force in our country.  This is deplorable.  This gives 
democracy a bad name because we are not allowed to properly 
debate these things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am of the opinion that the wording in Bill C-214 does not 
quite go far enough.  I do not think it adequately protects 
Canadians.  For example, the wording is that the provinces should 
be consulted, but it does not ensure that consultation will be 
done in a meaningful way, nor does it say that the opinion of the 
provinces that has been expressed would have any impact on any of 
the agreements or the position Canada takes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had a lot of experience with Bill C-68 and the gun 
control issue.  The consultation the government claimed it had 
with the provinces was totally inadequate.  We now have six 
provinces and two territories taking the federal government to 
court. The case is presently before the supreme court. If this 
had been an adequate and meaningful consultation process, of 
course that would not be the case.  We probably would not even 
have the present legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last time parliament put forward a treaty of an 
international nature for ratification was the auto pact.  Guess 
when that was.  Back in 1966.  NAFTA was signed without 
consulting the provinces in a meaningful way.  International 
affairs have a huge impact on Canadian affairs.  Why are we not 
allowed to debate the issues that come forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I was elected a member of parliament in October 1993 the 
government has signed 470 international treaties and has ratified 
295 treaties.  And they have not come before parliament in any 
meaningful way; 470 international treaties in the period from 
1993 to 1999. Most of us have never seen these treaties and know 
almost nothing about them. It is difficult to access copies of 
the text of the agreements. It is difficult for us to even find 
out what positions the government is advocating at some of these 
conferences. The essence of democracy is that we have this 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our neighbours to the south, the Americans, are not in the same 
situation.  Their international agreements must be ratified by 
their elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our international agreements are negotiated and signed behind 
closed doors.  We often do not even know who is doing the 
negotiating.  Groups of non-governmental organizations are 
hand-picked by the government.  Groups of bureaucrats and others 
who make up these agreements are not accountable to the people of 
Canada through their elected representatives.  We sometimes find 
out about them when they are leaked to reporters.  We often never 
find out what is in these agreements or what has been agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We presently have a situation in the Sudan where the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs maintains policies that would not allow most 
Canadians to sleep at night if they knew about them.  Genocide in 
southern Sudan is a terrible tragedy and the position of our 
government is not acceptable to most Canadians I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have the right to be told what is going on and to be 
consulted on our positions internationally.  What assurance do we 
have that the positions advocated by our government are the best 
possible positions?  In the last election the MAI agreement was 
an issue.  Most Canadian people did not even know what it was all 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Democracy is not something to be feared, but it is a protection 
for our leaders. People would take more of an interest in the 
affairs of our nation if they were allowed to participate. 
People often complain about the apathy in Canada.  Why is that? 
It is because we do not have proper democracy.  The people of 
Canada do not feel they have a say in what is going on here in 
Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time is also important.  The Liberals often ram legislation 
through the House without adequate debate. This leads to cynicism 
and a lack of interest in democracy.  We need to have adequate 
time to debate things.  That is what this bill would address in a 
meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transparency, democracy and accountability need to be improved 
in government.  This bill is a step in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are some of the things the government could do? One example 
is parliament must be able to examine the impact these foreign 
agreements would have on the family.  The Canadian Alliance has a 
policy that it examines all these things to see what impact they 
will have on the family, the basic building block of society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that could happen is that the Senate, which should 
be elected, could perform a very meaningful role in this area. 
The provinces could elect the senators. They would represent the 
interests of those provinces and could spend a lot of time 
looking at these agreements to see their impact, whether they are 
good or bad.  They could represent the position of Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by reading our policy in regard to treaty 
negotiations.  Our blue book states that parliament should be 
asked to approve all agreements or declarations before they are 
ratified as Canadian positions.  This was designed to enable 
parliament to have some role in ensuring that Canadian interests 
are being properly represented before treaties are signed, and to 
give MPs a check on unaccountable officials and NGOs at 
international negotiations. Indeed the blue book demands that the 
identity of and proposed position to be taken by all officials, 
NGOs and individuals speaking for Canada at the international or 
United Nations conferences be fully disclosed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is 
with pleasure that I rise to speak to Bill C-214.  I commend the 
member for Beauharnois—Salaberry for his work on this private 
member's legislation.  It is definitely a step in the right 
direction.  We need more openness and transparency in the treaty 
negotiation and ratification process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 12 years or so trade has become an increasingly 
important political and economic issue in Canada.  As our trade 
and treaty process evolves, it is necessary that our domestic 
engagement policies with subnational governments involve the 
provincial and I would assert municipal governments. They need to 
be consulted and involved in discussing the impact of treaties 
and in discussions and engagement of members of parliament and 
senators, all parliamentarians.  It is critically important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this legislation the hon. member would move Canada to 
something more similar to the Australian model for treaty 
negotiation.  I had the opportunity to have dinner with Alexander 
Downer, Australia's foreign affairs minister, about two years 
ago.  I used that opportunity to discuss with him the success of 
the Australian model for treaty negotiation. That has been by and 
large a successful experiment. We can move with a significant 
level of confidence in supporting the direction of this 
legislation because of the Australian example which has been well 
received and successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to consult with the provincial and territorial 
governments more seriously on these issues.  On the MAI there was 
very little consultation or discussion with subnational 
governments in Canada.  If there were discussions, they were 
typically between federal and provincial bureaucrats as opposed 
to being between ministers or members of federal and provincial 
governments.  It is essential that the elected members have a 
role both provincially and federally in terms of the discussions 
and the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national interest analysis is essential.  We need to ensure 
the impact of treaties is considered not just nationally but also 
subnationally on the provincial, territorial and indeed municipal 
governments.  Many of the treaties that are signed have a 
significant impact on the provincial and municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear that our support of this legislation is in no 
way an indication of our fear of trade or our opposition to trade 
or a change in our policy relative to trade.  This type of 
transparent engagement process actually indicates our degree of 
support for trade.  We recognize the importance of trade in the 
Canadian economy and the increasing level of importance that 
trade will play in the coming decades.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As such, it is important that our domestic policies evolve 
appropriately in terms of the democratic process of engagement 
which needs to grow commensurate with the increased level of 
sophistication of our treaty negotiation process externally. It 
is essential that this happen.  It is important that this occur 
partly because of some of the misinformation and mistruths about 
trade agreements that are utilized by anti-trade individuals and 
organizations, for example with the MAI or previous to that the 
free trade agreement and NAFTA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Solid information and a solid process of engagement and 
discussion will help to eliminate a lot of the incorrect and 
sensationalist arguments against these treaties.  It is critical 
that we make policies and processes transparent such that those 
often incorrect analyses and arguments are exposed for the frauds 
that they are in a lot of cases.  I see this very positively. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend the hon. member for his work in this area.  Our party 
will be supporting this legislation.  It is a step in the right 
direction and may be an important step forward for Canada. I 
would hope that we would have the same success here as the 
Australian model has had in that country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-214, 
introduced by my colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry, whom I 
salute, is of great importance to this House, which is why I 
want to speak to it today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An act to provide for the participation of the House of Commons 
when treaties are concluded, this bill would fill the democratic 
void in Canada, when it comes to negotiating and concluding 
treaties with our partners from other countries in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been taking part in the work of the Standing Committee on 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade for nearly seven years. 
This is the committee where a few members from all parties study 
legislation to implement important international treaties to 
which Canada wishes to become a party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are significant differences between 
implementation legislation passed by parliament and what my 
colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry is proposing. In other 
words, when Canada intends to ratify a treaty, it introduces a 
bill in the House to implement that treaty in Canada and to give 
effect to the obligations stemming from that treaty. However, 
and this is where the problem lies, the public has never heard 
about that treaty and its contents, not have members of 
parliament, even. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we enter the 21st century, it is rather sad to see that 
international treaties, which will often have an impact on the 
life of people, cannot be subjected to public scrutiny 
beforehand. 
The overall objective of Bill C-214 is to allow for greater 
transparency so that people and their elected representatives 
can participate fully and democratically at each stage of the 
ratification of international treaties Canada intends to 
negotiate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 has four specific objectives on which I would like to 
comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is to table treaties the government has signed so that 
the people and their elected representatives can have access to 
all the information pertaining to that treaty and know its 
scope. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1800"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all remember the reactions negotiations on the multilateral 
agreement on investment, or MAI, gave rise to and the general 
disapproval of the agreement in the civil society and in some 
countries. We also remember how difficult it was for the former 
international trade minister to answer questions from opposition 
members in the House because everything was being done behind 
closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the systematic tabling of all important treaties to be 
published in the <I>Canada Gazette</I> and in the<I> Canada Treaty Series</I> 
or posted on the government Internet site, we would avoid this 
dysfunction of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-214 is really an exercise in openness and democratization. 
The publication and distribution of treaties are the second part 
in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, Bill C-214 provides that treaties will be submitted to 
Parliament before ratification. I pointed out before that the 
members of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade are participating in the study of the treaty 
implementation bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should know that, at that stage, there is absolutely no 
debate on the content of treaties, their different parts, their 
impact on the life of Canadians, their institutions, and the 
relations between citizens and the government that could be 
affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Implementation bills simply make our legislation consistent with 
our treaty obligations. 
We are a very long way from a process that would give the 
treaties greater legitimacy by permitting parliamentarians to 
vet all of them before their ratification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government would have had an extraordinary opportunity to 
show its open-mindedness, the fact that it is the "best country 
in the world", had it proposed this bill.  We had an example 
very recently in which parliamentarians could have expressed 
their opinion on the content of the Rome statute of the 
International Criminal Court concerning genocide, crimes against 
humanity and war crimes.  This would have been a great victory 
for parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, in a context of globalization, as my colleague from 
Lac-Saint-Jean pointed out so well, in which many decisions 
affecting us are made at the international level and are beyond 
our reach, parliamentary democracy obliges MPs to not abdicate 
any of their responsibilities in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary approval of treaties as proposed by Bill C-214 
would include a debate of their content and in no way limits the 
government's manoeuvring room in negotiating and concluding 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the fourth objective of the bill on treaties, as the 
short title provides, is to involve the provinces in the 
negotiation of treaties that come under their constitutional 
jurisdiction, thus obliging the federal government to consult 
them.  Bill C-214 also proposes the conclusion of an agreement to 
formalize this requirement for consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would therefore have hoped such a bill that attempts to 
democratize the ratification of treaties and honour the spirit 
and letter of the Constitution would receive the unanimous 
support of all parliamentarians.  Unfortunately, this was not 
the case.  One after another, the Liberal members speaking on 
this private members' bill opposed its passage at second 
reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an attitude is hard to understand and totally indefensible. 
How can the Liberal members oppose making the treaty 
ratification process more transparent and democratic?  Why are 
the Liberal members refusing to honour Canada's Constitution, 
which nevertheless defines provincial jurisdictions?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
may have given us part of the answer to explain such behaviour 
when he commented, on December 1, on the refusal of the U.S. 
Senate to ratify the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
He said, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This show of disunity by our American neighbours is a clear 
illustration of what happens when sterile party politics find 
their way into the conduct of a country's foreign affairs. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that these same sterile party politics, to use the 
words of the Liberal parliamentary secretary, explain the 
Liberals partisan refusal to support Bill C-214? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any case, it is certainly not the arguments put forward by 
the Liberal members in this House that justify their stubborn 
refusal. Since the debates began, they have relied on false 
pretences only to try to justify their opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allow me to say a few words on the importance of getting the 
provinces involved in the negotiation and ratification of 
treaties that fall under their constitutional jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of Bill C-214 seeks to recognize what is 
familiarly known in Quebec as the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine. 
It is, regardless of what Liberal members may say, a simple 
recognition of the provinces' prerogative at the international 
level when it comes to areas that fall under their jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Former Quebec minister Paul Gérin-Lajoie popularized that 
doctrine in the sixties. For the benefit of members opposite, 
Paul Gérin-Lajoie belongs to the Liberal political family and is 
not an advocate of Quebec sovereignty. He is, however, an honest 
man respectful of the fundamental law of the land, the Canadian 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I want to congratulate and thank all the members 
from the four opposition parties who rose in support of this 
bill. They all had the insight and the democratic reflex that 
are so sorely lacking on the other side of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Marlene Jennings (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will talk about one part only of the bill presented 
by the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry. That part is not the 
most crystal clear one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is recognized in Canadian constitutional law, and has been 
for the past sixty years, that the power to conclude treaties 
rests exclusively with the federal government. However, hidden 
among the proposals put forward by the hon. member for 
Beauharnois—Salaberry is one that asks the members of this House 
to recognize that provinces have the power to conclude treaties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That power of the provinces to conclude treaties simply does not 
exist.  And a change of this scale to the Canadian 
constitutional order requires far more than merely a debate in 
this House:  it requires profound, lasting changes to our 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised by that.  It is true to the culture and the 
behavior of the Bloc to try to do indirectly what cannot be done 
directly, that is to nullify the Canadian constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian constitutional law clearly establishes that the 
negotiation and ratification of a treaty is strictly within the 
purview of the federal executive branch. I should not have to 
teach that to the member for Beauharnois—Salaberry who is a 
professor of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if a treaty requires changes to current laws or the 
enactment of new ones, parliamentarians need to take action and 
we have done so several times.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If parliamentarians do not legislate, the federal executive is 
not in a position to ratify such a treaty, as it cannot 
reasonably conclude that it could be implemented.  Therefore the 
international commitment made by Canada under such a treaty 
could not be fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that specific point, I would ask the other members of the 
opposition—and I am not talking about the Bloc members because I 
do not expect them to recant their decision in the interest of 
clarity—to review their position, because if they support this 
bill, they will be changing the constitutional law that has 
existed in Canada for more than 60 years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
respond to my colleague and to give her a short lesson in 
international law and Canadian constitutional law, we know there 
are several federal states in the world, Swiss cantons or German 
Länders, which are not sovereign states and which can conclude 
international treaties, as provided by the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We interpret our constitution. It is Mr. Gérin-Lajoie, a liberal 
and a federalist, as my colleague from Laval Centre said 
earlier, who promoted the Gérin-Lajoie doctrine whereby Quebec 
could conclude treaties within its areas of jurisdiction. I 
remind the hon. member that all successive Quebec governments, 
whether of the Liberal Party or the Parti Quebecois, maintained 
that this Gérin-Lajoie doctrine should prevail and that Quebec 
could conclude international treaties within its areas of 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing this debate, I want to thank members of the House who 
took part in the debate on Bill C-214. I appreciate and count on 
the support of oppositions members who have fully realized that 
this bill is aimed at democratizing the process of conclusion of 
treaties, at circulating treaties concluded by Canada but not 
properly circulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even today, people will not be able to find the text of a 
Canadian treaty on the Government of Canada site, which is 
totally inappropriate, since they will find on sites of other 
countries, such as the United States and France, treaties they 
have concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of this bill is therefore to ensure that parliament 
participates when treaties are concluded by approving the most 
important treaties, and that there is an obligation on the 
government to disseminate its treaties by tabling them in the 
House, or by publishing them either on an electronic site, in 
the <I>Canada Gazette</I>, or in the <I>Canada Treaty Series</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, this is essential because this parliament is 
lagging somewhat behind other parliaments in the world, such as 
those of Australia, New Zealand or the United Kingdom.  These 
parliaments have, in recent years, amended their procedure and 
allowed members to debate treaties, which, as the member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean pointed out, are taking on increasing importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted objections from the government side resulting from a 
desire not to acknowledge that the royal prerogative with 
respect to the conclusion of treaties should be shared between 
the federal and provincial governments in application and 
respect of the federal principle.  They also thought that this 
bill would have the effect of unduly limiting the prerogatives 
and discretion of the government with respect to the conclusion 
of treaties.  That is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>References to a republican system such as that of the United 
States ignore the development of practices in Commonwealth 
countries, where parliament is finally being given a voice when 
it comes to concluding treaties.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>IMPORTATION OF PLUTONIUM 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on May 29 
in the House, I raised the issue of the importation of MOX 
plutonium into Canada. Unfortunately, the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources sidestepped my 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, I mentioned that 161 municipalities and MRCs in Quebec 
had written to the Minister of the Environment asking him to 
drop his plan to import plutonium. The parliamentary secretary 
said just the opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 24, the Montreal urban community commission on the 
environment rejected the plan. In its recommendation to the city 
executive council, it recommended: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the Council ask the Government of Canada to drop the plan 
for eliminating American and Russian military grade plutonium in 
Canadian CANDU reactors, as well as the research project to that 
effect by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited and, consequently, to 
accept no more samples of MOX fuel. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>No recommendation could be clearer. Moreover, 161 municipalities 
and MRCs in Quebec are making the same request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue that I am raising today is not whether there is a 
danger with such importation. 
My request is totally justified because, whenever MOX is burned 
in Candu reactors, more than 50% of the initial plutonium mass 
persists in the form of waste and that waste has a chemical mean 
life of 24,000 years.  We must not forget that, at this time, 
more than 23 million kilograms of uranium are stored in Canada 
and that there is no permanent solution to dispose of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public must know that in February 1998, a panel chaired by 
Blair Seaborn presented a report, one of the recommendations of 
which was as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any plan for the permanent storage of nuclear fuel waste in 
Canada should aim to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>1) ensure that the public has an 
appropriate level of knowledge of and control over nuclear fuel 
waste management in Canada and that such management is in 
keeping with changing public priorities particularly in light of 
the dread factor about nuclear issue and: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2) achieve informed and collective acceptance at every stage 
of development. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It added, and I am still quoting: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public participation must be incorporated in a comprehensive and 
credible manner throughout future steps.  This implies that the 
public must accept the plan before it is implemented.

dictatorial attitude of the government.

mixed oxide, or MOX, fuel test project, which is, I point out, 
just a fuel test, is part of an international non-proliferation 
initiative to find a safe and secure manner to render surplus 
American and Russian weapons grade plutonium inaccessible for 
future use in nuclear weapons.  The plutonium that is declared 
surplus by the U.S. and Russia already exists and will continue 
to present a real proliferation danger until it can be reduced to 
a form that cannot be readily used for weapons purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The use of MOX fuel in a nuclear reactor is one of the methods 
by which the plutonium can be effectively rendered inaccessible 
for weapons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has agreed in principle to consider the use of MOX fuel 
as part of its contribution to international disarmament 
initiatives.  The Government of Canada believes that Canadians 
share a common desire to create a safe and secure world for 
future generations and are prepared to take appropriate action 
provided that public health and safety and the environment are 
not compromised in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the future import of MOX fuel test samples from 
Russia to Canada, I want to assure the House now that the 
shipment will comply with all Canadian legal and regulatory 
requirements.  The shipment must comply with the Nuclear Safety 
and Control Act, the Transportation of Dangerous Goods Act, the 
transportation packaging of radioactive materials regulations, 
and International requirements under the International Marine 
Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, as 
well as standards set by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The MOX test sample shipments are safe.  The trace amount of 
radiation is so small that it poses no significant risk to 
health, safety or the environment.  The fuel is in a stable, 
solid, ceramic form inside a sealed zirconium alloy element and 
transported in a container, as I stated earlier, that meets 
Canadian and international standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not soluble and cannot spill, ignite or explode.  It is 
not a powder that can be inhaled.  The transport of the fuel 
samples is subject to all requirements of Canada's regulatory 
system which fully protect public health and safety and the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must stress that undertaking this test does not oblige Canada 
to agree to the large scale use of MOX fuel in Candu power plants 
in the future.  Should any such program be proposed at some point 
in the future, stringent conditions will apply, including full 
public participation prior to entering into the program.

House leader for allowing me to go first.  I told him I would be 
very brief and I will because my party supports the bill.  We had 
a good debate at second reading and in committee, and appreciate 
that it has now come forward.  We also like the fact that the

DNA data bank on an annual basis and that parliament will review 
the operations of the data bank every five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support the bill because it is a good step in utilizing a

the police and the military authorities to solve crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often DNA is solely viewed as a tool to convict, but it 
also exonerates the innocent.  I think that is so important.  We

samples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In just taking a short period of time, we want to say that we

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak in support of Bill S-10 which amends the National 
Defence Act, the DNA Identification Act and the Criminal Code. 
This bill builds on the national DNA data bank, legislation 
passed by this House in 1998 which created the DNA Identification 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members of the House will recall, the DNA Identification 
Act establishes a national DNA data bank that will contain DNA 
profiles from both crime scenes and people who are convicted of 
serious and violent offences.  Each time a new DNA profile is 
entered into the data bank, a search will be made to find a match 
in the system to help police identify suspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA profiles stored in the national wide data bank will provide 
the police with valuable information that will also speed up 
criminal investigations.  It will also offer hope to victims' 
families that long outstanding crimes may be solved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of having a national DNA data bank are well 
recognized by the police community and the Canadian public.  It 
will be a landmark public safety tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overall purpose of Bill S-10 is simple and twofold: to 
establish a more complete data bank by including the DNA profiles 
from offenders convicted in the military justice system; and, to 
make sure that the legislation can be effectively implemented. 
Bill S-10 makes simple and straightforward refinements to the 
data bank legislation to ensure its smooth implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories support the bill because it 
clearly responds to the practical issues that they have 
identified.  It is now up to us to give Bill S-10 our full 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased by the momentum that is building up to implement 
this landmark investigative tool.  Plans are well under way. The 
RCMP has established a special unit to run the data bank. 
Regulations in support of the DNA Identification Act have been 
drafted and published.  Law enforcement officials across the 
country are actively engaged in preparations to implement the 
data bank by June 30.  A federal and provincial working group is 
finalizing guidelines to assist prosecutors in applying the law 
uniformly across the country, and police are being trained on 
sample collection procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have made great strides in ensuring that Canadian police have 
this modern technology available to them.  All sectors of the 
criminal justice system have come together on this initiative to 
ensure that the national DNA data bank can soon become a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interests of all Canadians, indeed for public safety, I 
encourage all members of the House—and I gather all members are 
supporting this—to support Bill S-10 so that we can proceed as 
planned to get this much needed public safety tool off the 
ground.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will authorize military judges to issue DNA warrants 
to take bodily substances for the purpose of deriving the DNA 
profile of the military suspected or convicted of designated 
offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 is an addition to the existing legislation providing 
similar authorities to be exercised by a provincial court judge 
under the Criminal Code to allow the taking of bodily substances 
for DNA analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill, a military judge will be able to order the 
taking of bodily substances in cases of offences under the 
Criminal Code and specific military offences like striking a 
superior officer or striking a subordinate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA profiles of the military will be included in the DNA bank 
just as those of civilians. This bank will also include the 
profiles of human cells found at the scene of a crime, and they 
will be compared to the profile of suspected or convicted 
offenders. Thus, it will be possible to find the criminal as 
quickly as possible and with great accuracy. The Canadian DNA 
bank should be operational by the end of June, as mentioned a 
moment ago by the parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is not the first country enacting legislation to take 
bodily substances for DNA analysis and create a bank of DNA 
profiles. The United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Belgium 
already have legislation authorizing the taking and storing of 
DNA data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some American States have also enacted such legislation. 
The French are presently studying legislation to authorize the 
taking and storing of such data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me describe briefly the overriding legislation in these 
countries and compare it with the legislation that will soon 
come into force in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Kingdom pioneered in this regard when it passed 
legislation to authorize the taking of bodily substances and the 
storing of the DNA profiles derived from them. The United 
Kingdom DNA data bank has been operational since April 1995 and 
it is operated by the Forensic Science Service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to the Canadian legislation, where a police officer 
must obtain a warrant from a judge for the taking of bodily 
substances, the British legislation empowers police officers to 
make the decision as to whether to take a sample from suspects. 
The police officer must obtain the consent of the person before 
taking an “intimate” sample of substances. “Intimate” refers to 
a sample of blood, sperm or urine, a dental impression or a 
sample from a bodily orifice other than the mouth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The police officer does not have to obtain the consent of the 
person before taking a “non intimate” sample. Such a sample 
could be a fingernail clipping, a sample from the mouth or from 
any other part of the body, or a foot impression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These samples are taken from anyone suspected of having 
committed a criminal act. Under the British legislation, a 
criminal act includes all crimes, with violence or not, which 
are punishable by a term of imprisonment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian legislation is very different. 
In Canada, a judge will be able to order offenders suspected of 
a designated offence to provide samples of bodily substances. 
Whenever someone is convicted of an offence, the Canadian 
parliament has decided that giving samples of bodily substances 
will be mandatory but only in the case of the most severe 
crimes, such as sexual assault, murder and other such crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the case of summary convictions for lesser offences, 
a Canadian judge will have the authority to order the taking of 
samples of bodily substances if he is convinced that the 
infringement on the offender's privacy is not excessive compared 
to public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the United Kingdom, bodily substances are used to prove or 
disprove the involvement of a person in a specific offence.  It 
is possible to keep the data in a data bank when the person is 
convicted of the offence. 
The data are destroyed whenever the suspect is acquitted or 
dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The United Kingdom goes further than Canada and other countries 
where there is a legislation on the taking of bodily substances. 
A British policeman can collect a non intimate specimen on a 
person accused of an offence even if that specimen is not 
related to the crime committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that case, the specimen is not collected to prove or disprove 
the involvement of the person in the offence but simply because 
the person is accused and that it may be possible to link that 
individual to other offences.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the British law regulating the taking of DNA samples was 
passed, the United Kingdom systematically conducted DNA analyses 
among the population in order to find the authors of crimes. 
Indeed, in the Pitchford case, in order to solve the rape and 
murder of two teenage girls, the police had taken over 3,600 DNA 
samples from men in the area where the crimes had been 
committed. After the case was solved, the police used the 3,600 
samples to establish cross-references with other crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious that the British justice system gives more power 
to the police and puts less emphasis on civil liberties. 
Canadian law is less permissive and states clearly under which 
circumstances the police can take a sample. I believe our DNA 
legislation strikes the right balance between the need to find 
and punish the guilty party and individual freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the Dutroux tragedy, Belgium passed legislation 
dealing with tidentification through DNA analysis within its 
criminal justice system. This legislation is similar to ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the Belgian penal code was adapted to allow the 
analysis of human cells found at a crime scene and to allow the 
taking of DNA samples from individuals suspected of being 
involved in a crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And then, two databanks were set up. The first one consists of a 
crime scene index containing DNA profiles derived from bodily 
substances found on the crime scenes. The other one is the 
convicted offenders index containing DNA profiles obtained from 
convicted offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Belgian national institute of forensic sciences and 
criminology manages the genetic index. This state institution 
also has the mandate to carry out expert analyses on samples 
collected at the scene, to do research and development in the 
DNA field and to oversee the training and regulation of 
technical and scientific police services. It also deals with the 
laboratory for the technical and scientific police services and 
the reference laboratory for forensic sciences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have also found some information about the legislation in 
force in the Netherlands. It stipulates that suspects in a 
serious crime have to provide samples of bodily substances for 
forensic purposes. 
That country is the only one to allow the accused to request an 
independent second assessment by a laboratory other than the 
national criminal justice laboratory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the United States have carried out DNA analyses in more 
than 24,000 cases since 1986, they still do not have a DNA 
databank. In fact, most of the American States have legislation 
providing for the collection and analysis of samples of bodily 
substances. Pursuant to these acts, samples are taken from 
persons convicted of serious crimes like sexual assaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DNA samples are sent to the state forensic laboratory where they 
are entered in a registry and stored in the state DNA databank. 
Various DNA data are stored in different databanks across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The FBI recently initiated a movement to create a national DNA 
data bank which would group together all the data recorded in 
each state. Studies are being implemented to check the 
feasibility of the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On April 4, 2000, France introduced a piece of legislation to 
create a national data bank of gene prints and imprints. This 
national automated data bank would centralize the gene prints 
found on the scene of a crime as well as the gene imprints of 
inmates. A judge at trial will be able to order a comparison 
between the gene prints in the national data bank and the DNA 
profile of an individual under investigation for an offence 
punishable by imprisonment. In principle, that national 
automated data bank of gene imprints should be operational by 
the end of May of this year.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Science today makes it possible to determine, from a tiny amount 
of bodily substances, an individual's DNA profile. This has 
allowed many police agencies around the world to resolve vicious 
crimes for which no culprit had yet been found. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of the sure benefits of genetics for criminal justice, 
I feel continued caution is in order with regard to potential 
manipulation of genetic information. That is why passing 
legislation entails, in my opinion, many benefits both for 
fighting efficiently against crime and for protecting 
justiciables against potential abuses from the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, the passing of an act provides a framework for the 
power of seizure exercised by police officers. 
Then, its passage permits conservation of genetic information in 
a single location, thus making the search for the perpetrator 
more effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, passage of a law makes it possible to sanction 
individuals who would use the law for purposes other than those 
it was intended for.  Despite all these advantages, few 
countries have complete legislation governing the sampling, 
conservation and use of bodily substances obtained for forensic 
analyses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, like the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands, 
will have proper legislation permitting the collection and 
conservation of genetic information.  As we have seen, there are 
significant differences between Canada's legislation and the 
others'.  Bill S-10, at issue here, improves a number of measures 
passed by the House of Commons in this area and will give the 
law its own particular cachet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, let us mention that Bill S-10 gives military judges the 
same powers as provincial court justices in the collection of 
bodily substances.  It appears that Canada will be the only 
country to subject the military to the same regime as civilians. 
The Bloc Quebecois sees no reason to exclude the military from 
the application of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-10 provides that DNA profiles and substances taken must be 
used only to apply the law, to the exclusion of all other 
unauthorized uses.  Offences and sentences are provided in the 
law for those who fail to comply with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to my information, Canada is the only country, besides 
Belgium, to provide for protection against the abuse of genetic 
information. 
These provisions are very important and the Bloc Quebecois fully 
supports them. They meet the concerns expressed by Canada's 
privacy commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the privacy commissioner had reservations about the 
creation of a DNA data bank and the way that information might 
be used. While recognizing the usefulness of that technique, the 
commissioner was opposed to letting the state develop a DNA 
public registry. The information contained in the DNA data bank 
should not, according to the commissioner, be used to determine 
other characteristics that can be genetically related, such as 
one's personality, or be used for medical research. Bill S-10 
provides protection against such practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP will administer the DNA data bank, which should be in 
operation by the end of June of this year. 
The Solicitor General of Canada announced that the RCMP will 
receive $18 million to operate this data bank. If properly 
administered by the RCMP, this tool will allow the police to 
quickly and accurately solve many crimes. By using DNA profiles 
during their investigations, police officers will save time and 
money, which can be reallocated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The newspapers recently revealed that the RCMP was not properly 
managed by its senior officers. Moreover, in his report released 
last April, the auditor general reported that the RCMP had a 
major backlog with regard to the DNA analyses that are currently 
authorized. According to the auditor general's report, the RCMP 
laboratories take an average of 82 days to do a preliminary DNA 
analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That work should only take two days. The average time for a 
complete analysis is 101 days. 
These timeframes far exceed the recommendation made by Justice 
Campbell, who conducted the investigation in the Bernardo case 
and who recommended a 30 day turnaround time for DNA analysis. 
The RCMP takes a total of 183 days to do a DNA analysis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The RCMP will have to establish its priorities, because the 
success of the national DNA data bank depends on it. Given this 
disturbing information concerning the management of the RCMP, 
the Bloc Quebecois will carefully scrutinize its activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The annual report to be submitted to parliament by the 
commissioner of the RCMP responsible for administrating the DNA 
data bank will allow to determine whether the functioning and 
the administration of the DNA data bank respond to people's 
expectations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This obligation on the part of the commissioner to submit an 
annual report is an addition in Bill S-10, since the current 
legislation provides for a Senate or a House committee, or a 
joint committee, to examine the implementation of the 
legislation in the five years following its coming into effect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not believe this change was essential. However, in the 
light of huge management problems within the RCMP, I think an 
annual report is not too much to ask, to allow parliamentarians 
to examine the work of the RCMP in this field. I believe a five 
year period is too long and might have jeopardized the 
functioning of the DNA data bank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Available data concerning the performance of the British DNA 
data bank can be used to assess the performance of the RCMP. 
In fact, in 1995, during the implementation of the DNA databank 
in the United Kingdom, the 43 police services of that country 
provided over 94,000 samples taken from people and over 2,500 
samples gathered at crime scenes. Almost 1,000 samples were used 
to provide sufficient DNA evidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 196 cases, police officers were able to cross-reference the 
samples with the DNA profiles stored in the national DNA 
databank. The United Kingdom authorities found these preliminary 
results very encouraging, since the DNA databank had just been 
set up. With these 1,000 samples gathered at the crime scenes, 
the identification rate was 19.2%, a lot better than with the 
fingerprints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of April 10, 2000, the British databank had been in existence 
for five years. Since its creation, it has gathered some 750,000 
profiles of suspects and over 73,000 samples of substances found 
at the crime scenes. In five years, the United Kingdom has 
linked 68,000 suspects to crimes thanks to the DNA databank. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports Bill S-10 and the creation of a DNA 
databank, but given the RCMP's current problems, we will want to 
ensure that the money for this project is spent appropriately.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> Madam

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank my hon. friend and colleague from Nova Scotia, 
the member for Sydney—Victoria, for allowing me to pre-empt his

for a very titillating speech.  I know he takes a great deal of 
pride in bills and his knowledge of the technical aspect of bills 
such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been said, these amendments pertain to the National 
Defence Act and the DNA Identification Act, as well as the 
criminal code.  Obviously, there is very much a spirit of 
non-partisan support for the bill and its practical implications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was once told by a good friend and colleague in Nova Scotia, 
Kenneth Fiske, who is a lawyer, that when appearing before the 
court of appeal a person should be brief, be concise and be gone. 
That is what I intend to do with this speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to include the genetic profiles of 
offenders, which will allow law enforcement officials to collect 
genetic fingerprints, which are very much useful in the 
investigation of serious crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is set up to mirror existing legislation which came 
before the House in recent times.  It is there to enhance and 
equalize the system with regard to the military and ensure that 
those who are involved in serious offences involving violence 
will be held to equal account.  As well, it provides that the 
evidence, which is necessary to prosecute and hold individuals to 
account, be available to the military.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation, in essence, helps to achieve that goal and 
helps to bring about equality and fairness in the military 
justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent years the courts have seen many high profile 
convictions, such as that of Paul Bernardo, and the eventual

demonstrates the usefulness of this latest tool of law 
enforcement in the protection of Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that it is used for both inculpatory and exculpatory 
evidence, which is an important nuance to understand.  It 
enhances the accuracy and the truth of our justice system.

on individual privacy rights, is a very good piece of 
legislation.  It has been brought about by the hard work of 
individuals in this House, as well as those in the other place. 
It is very interesting and telling that it was brought forward as 
a Senate bill, and I commend and applaud the efforts of those in 
the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have recently spoken with regard to the tragically flawed 
conviction of Stephen Truscott.  If DNA had been available in 
1959 there is certainly reason to believe that it is quite 
possible his conviction could have been avoided.  He would have 
been exonerated and spared a very horrible fate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the similar types of injustices suffered by Marshall, 
Milgaard and Morin may likely have been spared with the timely 
use of DNA evidence.  Therefore, we should do everything possible 
to expedite its implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This could be a very powerful legislative tool in the conduct of 
criminal investigations.  My friend and colleague from 
Sydney—Victoria, who is a defence lawyer, would be quick to 
agree that it could often avoid a case even appearing before the 
courts. If there is evidence that exonerates, the prosecution may 
decide in its wisdom not to proceed.  Or, if there is evidence 
which categorically places the individual at the scene of the 
crime, it may result in an earlier guilty plea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Warrants for the taking of DNA samples provide a safeguard on 
the evidence that exists and meet some of the privacy concerns 
that were raised during the course of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should be noted that the data bank itself, according to the 
government, will be operational by June 2000.  We are into that 
month and we have had no word yet as to whether the government 
will fulfil that commitment.  We have seen it in the past with 
health reform.  We have seen it with the youth criminal justice 
act and environment legislation.  Many times Canadians are led to 
believe that they will get a piece of legislation or a program, 
and sadly that does not come to fruition until months and 
sometimes years pass.  Because of the importance of this type of 
bill and this very useful tool for criminal investigations, we 
are hoping that this will be the exception to the Liberal record 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can only hope that the federal government will come through 
with adequate funding as well.  We have known all along that this 
would very much enhance the present CPIC system and would allow 
police to be armed with the DNA strand and evidence which could 
be used to both convict and exonerate, and they are very much in 
need of a system that will accommodate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know from earlier reports that the CPIC system, which would 
house this information, is at a point in its history where it is 
about to collapse.  Money has been allotted for that.  There was 
an announcement of $115 million for the data bank.  At the same 
time, RCMP experts have estimated that they would need double 
that amount, $280 million for the data bank, for it to be really 
state of the art for the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that the reactions of the Liberals, when it comes to 
problems and cries for help from people like the law enforcement 
community, are nowhere near their rhetoric in terms of delivery. 
Law enforcement has been given short shrift in the past.  We hope 
that will not be repeated.  We are encouraged that this bill will 
certainly move in that direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill came about as a result of Senate hearings.  It began 
back in 1998 with a report that was drafted to amend the National 
Defence Act and it was meant to reform the military justice 
system.  The defence minister, I believe, was enlightened by this 
report, which contained a great deal of useful information in 
this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For cases of sexual offence involving members of the military, 
the RCMP would not have had the jurisdiction they needed to do 
the job of taking and storing DNA samples. 
This bill, in essence, reacts to that perverse anomaly in the law 
and is very much, as I said earlier, about backfilling that 
inadequacy in the current legislation.  The report of the 
committee was very useful and pointed out some of these 
inaccuracies and injustices under the current system.

<A HREF="#LINKT107"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report also recommended that the federal government 
strengthen legislation concerning the administration of the bank 
itself and the security of that information, along with the 
ability and necessity of strict monitoring to ensure that there 
was a process whereby that information was not released into 
other government agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know from the past number of weeks that this is very 
much a concern when it comes to cross-referencing Canadians' 
information.  Again, this government has had a very dismal record 
to defend in recent weeks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commissioner of the RCMP would have final authority to make 
a report on the DNA data bank and he is required under law to 
make an annual report to parliament.  We see this as a good 
safeguard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This type of legislation is very much a technical and 
time-sensitive type of justice strategy that we are very 
encouraged will enhance the ability of our law enforcement agents 
to do their very important and sometimes under-recognized work in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this bill the DNA profiles of offenders subject to the 
code of service discipline who are convicted of serious and 
violent offences will be included in the national data bank, 
which again will allow for greater cross-referencing to solve, in 
many instances, unsolved crimes in the country.  This is very 
much on par with the entire purpose of the DNA data bank and 
provides a standard of evidence that should be applied equally 
for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This new bill provides provisions that are included in the 
National Defence Act.  It very much mirrors the existing 
legislation in our criminal code.  It is there to contain a list 
of designated offences that would apply when it comes to the use 
of DNA.  Again, it is the mirror image of what we see in the 
criminal code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In cases of primary offences, it is mandatory for samples to be 
taken at the time of conviction, except in exceptional 
circumstances.  This was an issue that was hotly debated at the 
justice committee in the Commons.  It was one on which there was 
a great deal of disappointment in the law enforcement community, 
which was pushing for the legislation to very much reflect the 
same type of evidence gathering that exists for fingerprints, and 
that is that the officers would have at their discretion the 
ability to take DNA at the time of arrest when reasonable and 
probable grounds, the other standard that is always applied, 
existed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an important point to note that they would be permitted to 
gather that evidence at the earliest possible point to prevent 
individuals being released on bail, knowing that they have 
outstanding offences or have been involved in other criminal 
activity that, upon the taking of the DNA at the time of 
conviction, would very much link them to those outstanding 
crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that is a bit of an antiquated way of explaining it, but 
it would be very crucial for the Canadian Police Association, for 
example, to have this guarantee, which unfortunately did not come 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For secondary offences, it is not the case that there would be 
mandatory convictions for a sample to be taken, so there is some 
solace to be taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill S-10 the list of scheduled offences limits the 
situations in which DNA samples can be taken and now applies to 
members of the military who have been convicted of those same 
said offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within five years after the act comes into effect there will be 
an opportunity to review it.  We feel that is consistent with 
transparency.  I mention transparency because this government 
does not really possess a strong record on transparency and 
openness, irrespective of what was said in the red book.  Sadly, 
that is a book in which Canadians cannot put a lot of faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a clear statement in the DNA profiles and samples that 
come from those convicted of crimes that establishes DNA profiles 
that can be used and held and cross-referenced for future 
investigations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The implementation of this bill will enable police officers to 
be more effective in gathering evidence and using it to obtain 
convictions where justified and also address some of the backlog 
of cases where DNA evidence could be used to exonerate those who 
are awaiting trial. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation is a positive move.  I see it as a very 
powerful tool with important implications and repercussions for 
our justice system and for society generally.  The provisions of 
the bill will ensure greater respect for the privacy of Canadians 
by setting clearer guidelines for the use of DNA by the police, 
the courts and others in our justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party unequivocally supports this 
bill as it will help bring our society closer to achieving a 
sense of public safety.  Anything that moves our justice system 
in that direction is something that we in the House certainly 
embrace. 
<P><A NAME="LINK267"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
with respect to the comments of my colleague from 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, I too know Butch Fiske.  He gave 
me the same advice just before an appeal.  He was brief and 
concise; I was longer and I won.  I think it is good advice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party will be supporting this legislation. It 
is good legislation and we welcome it.  As has been said, it 
mirrors the legislation that was introduced in the House dealing 
with the DNA identification data bank in the civil courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that many witnesses came before the 
justice committee and gave of their time and their ideas to help 
us craft the right legislation.  When that is done properly we 
see what happens, a government bill that is supported by the 
Canadian Alliance, the Conservatives, the NDP and the Bloc. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough spoke about 
how he and certain police associations hoped that the legislation 
would go further in terms of allowing the taking of DNA at the 
time of arrest.  I appreciate that.  When we craft laws, and this 
law is important for public safety, we always have to balance 
what we know to be fundamental rights.  The difference between 
taking DNA samples and taking a fingerprint is the difference 
between taking bodily fluids and taking a photograph. That is the 
way the courts have viewed it and I think that is the way 
ethicists have looked at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was one of the individuals who raised these issues at the 
justice committee.  We sought opinions from some retired supreme 
court justices.  They concurred that it would be detrimental to 
the legislation to allow the taking of DNA samples at the time of 
arrest.  Nobody in the House wanted to craft a bill that would 
not withstand a legal challenge.  From my way of thinking it was 
better to get a piece of sound legislation passed as quickly as 
possible that would provide for public safety and give the police 
the tools they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A great deal has been said in the House about this legislation. 
It provides the military with the same tools that the civilian 
police force have.  Because the RCMP would not have jurisdiction 
in the taking of the samples, it extends powers to the military 
courts and it extends the power to issue the warrants to the 
military justices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is consensus on the bill. The NDP will be supporting this 
important piece of legislation. It uses today's technology in a 
way to prevent crime and also to determine the guilt or innocence 
of an individual.  It is interesting that the bill comes on the 
day when the Minister of Justice talked about enhancing support 
mechanisms for investigation of wrongfully convicted individuals. 
DNA will form an important part of that in the same way that it 
provides a useful tool for those who have committed a crime in 
determining their guilt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We always have to bear in mind the presumption of innocence. DNA 
is but a tool in the same way that fingerprints are and other 
evidence is in determining the construction of a case against an 
accused. 
We always have to bear in mind at the beginning that the accused 
is presumed innocent and this is but one investigative tool, 
albeit an important one.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX CONVENTIONS IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1999 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK269">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill S-3, an act to 
implement an agreement, conventions and protocols between Canada 
and Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Algeria, Bulgaria, Portugal, Uzbekistan, 
Jordan, Japan and Luxembourg for the avoidance of double taxation 
and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to taxes on 
income, as reported (without amendment) from the committee.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When shall the bill be read the third time?  By leave, now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<A NAME="LINK270">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK271"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
the bill be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK272"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak today at third reading of Bill S-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation implements nine tax treaties.  All of them are 
important to Canada's trade and investment with the countries 
involved and to the elimination of double taxation for businesses 
and individuals with operations and investments in those 
countries.  Among these treaties are seven new ones that have 
been concluded with Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Algeria, Bulgaria, 
Portugal, Uzbekistan and Jordan.  Bill S-3 also amends Canada's 
tax treaty with Japan and replaces our existing convention with 
Luxembourg. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These treaties were designed with two primary objectives in 
mind—the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal 
evasion with respect to taxes on income. The potential for double 
taxation arises when a taxpayer resides in one country and earns 
income in another. Without a tax treaty, both countries can tax 
this income. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tax treaties are therefore essential in helping to ensure that 
income is not taxed twice.  This can be achieved in several ways. 
The most important method requires the country of residence to 
either exempt the income from tax or give credit for the tax paid 
to the source country under a tax treaty.  Another is to allocate 
taxation rights between a taxpayer's country of residence and the 
source country of the income.  One of the ways of achieving this 
is for tax treaties to provide for reciprocal rate reductions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaties contained in Bill S-3 meet this objective through 
reduced withholding taxes for individuals and businesses. 
Withholding taxes, as hon. members know, are the taxes that 
countries usually impose on income paid to non-residents.  Let me 
provide some examples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaty with Kyrgyzstan limits the maximum withholding tax on 
dividends and interest to 15% and to 10% on royalties.  Some 
exemptions exist for interest and royalties on copyrights, 
computer software, patents and know-how. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The convention with Lebanon provides for a maximum 5% 
withholding tax on dividends paid to a company controlling at 
least 10% of the voting power in the company paying the 
dividends, and 15% in all other cases. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Copyright, computer software, patent and know-how royalties will 
be taxed at 5%; other royalties as well as interest at 10%. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could cite the other treaties with Algeria, Bulgaria, 
Portugal, Uzbekistan, Jordan, Luxembourg and Japan, but the bill 
lays out the measures very clearly.  They are in a similar 
fashion to the one I cited earlier so I will not belabour the 
House with that information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss in my remarks if I did not mention the second 
main objective of tax treaties, the prevention of fiscal evasion. 
The treaties contained in this bill encourage the exchange of 
information between revenue authorities to prevent tax evasion or 
tax avoidance.  Sharing information helps revenue authorities in 
both countries identify and act on cases of tax evasion or 
avoidance. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one remaining issue I want to highlight before closing, 
and that is the taxpayer migration rules as proposed by the 
Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Amendments to the Income Tax Act will be introduced under 
separate legislation with respect to Canada's right to tax 
emigrants on gains that accrue while they are in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, Canada has been negotiating its tax treaties 
to ensure that double taxation will not happen when emigrants' 
pre-departure gains are taxed.  However, this provision is 
included in only four of the treaties covered in the bill, the 
ones with Luxembourg, Portugal, Lebanon and Jordan.  I will 
explain why. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The treaties with Uzbekistan, Bulgaria, Algeria and Kyrgyzstan 
were all negotiated before the new rules were announced.  Because 
of this, there is a provision in the proposed taxpayer migration 
rules for Canada to give a unilateral foreign tax credit to 
emigrants until the year 2007.  This time frame guarantees that 
there will be no double taxation of pre-departure gains before 
these treaties have been negotiated to take the new rules into 
account.  Japan has asked to review taxpayer migration in future 
negotiations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I want to assure hon. members that the tax treaties 
contained in this bill only hold positive benefits for Canadian 
businesses and individuals with operations and investments in 
these countries. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that our exports now account for over 40% of Canada's 
annual GDP is testament to the importance of tax treaties to 
both international trade and to Canada's domestic economic 
performance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once these treaties come into force, the number of tax treaties 
Canada has in place with other countries will increase to 75. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore urge all hon. members to pass this legislation 
without delay.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to Bill S-3, an act to implement an 
agreement, conventions and protocols between Canada and 
Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Algeria, Bulgaria, Portugal, Uzbekistan, 
Jordan, Japan and Luxembourg for the avoidance of double 
taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to 
taxes on income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees with this bill, especially since the 
bill is inspired by relatively standard models developed by the 
OECD. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1915"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT112"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT112"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1915

<A HREF="#LINKT111"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite said that such protocols have been signed 
with 75 countries.  I think that is wonderful but some of these 
countries have old protocols of agreement that are deplorable 
because they do not prevent fiscal evasion, which is the second 
objective of the bill.  This is very important.  We must not 
lose sight of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain corporations have head offices outside Canada and pay 
practically no taxes on income. When these Canadian companies 
bring their money back into Canada, the law tells them that they 
have already paid taxes in the country where they do business. 
The money is therefore allowed into Canada without any taxes on 
income. 
There are many companies operating abroad who are paying little 
or no income tax there and, when they bring their money into 
Canada, they do not pay a cent in taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give an example that members will understand. 
There are three countries with whom we have duly signed 
conventions—old models, relics—and they are Liberia, Bermuda and 
Barbados.  These are tax havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Liberia, there are no income taxes.  A company doing business 
in Liberia with a head office there pays one amount, $350 US a 
year.  Whether its profits are $100, $1,000 or in the billions, 
it pays income taxes of only $350 US. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take another example: Bermuda.  Under an agreement with 
Canada, companies will pay no income taxes until 2016. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Barbados, companies are subject to decreasing local taxation. 
In other words, the more money one makes, the less income tax 
one pays. The maximum tax rate is 2.5 % and the minimum rate is 
1%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do I mention these examples? Because the Minister of Finance 
owns Canada Steamship Lines. I have in front of me the 
organization chart of Canada Steamship Lines, which I would be 
willing to table in the House. I see that all the subsidiary 
companies are located in Bermuda, in Lebanon or in Barbados. 
There is practically no company any more that has its head 
office in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does it mean? That Canada Steamship Lines, with its head 
office in Bermuda and its subsidiary in Lebanon, pays almost no 
income tax. Profits are imported into Canada. Here we tell them 
“Since you already paid income tax in the countries where you 
are doing business, you do not have to pay any here”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see that Canada has such a great need of money to invest 
in health care and give back to the provinces in social 
transfers, I think the tens of millions of dollars that our 
Minister of Finance is saving through his company, Canada 
Steamship Lines, would really be welcome in the consolidated 
revenue fund. You and I, Madam Speaker, with only a simple T4, 
are paying a lot of income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I wish to point out that the Bloc Quebecois supports 
Bill S-3, because it complies with the model proposed by the 
OECD.  The Bloc Quebecois does, however, beg the government to 
do some serious housecleaning of all the old tax conventions it 
has signed with certain countries, especially those that are tax 
havens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> Pursuant to the order 
adopted earlier today, the motion for third reading of Bill S-3 is 
deemed to have been put and carried on division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Bill read the third time and passed)
