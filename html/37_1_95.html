	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before commenting on specific measures, I would like to
					 highlight this government's commitment to the fight against terrorism. This
					 bill represents an important component of the federal government's
					 comprehensive strategy to strengthen national security.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The horrific terrorist acts of September 11 created
					 suffering, fear and uncertainty. These events challenged Canadians' sense of
					 safety and security and it is this that we must address as our first
					 priority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism seeks to undermine the rule of law and human
					 rights. Terrorism seeks to undermine our values and way of life. Terrorism
					 tries to turn one community against another, religion against religion, and
					 race against race. Terrorism seeks all these things but it will achieve none of
					 them, not here in Canada. This government has been clear but it is worth
					 repeating over and over again: this is not a war against any one group or
					 ethnicity but a war against terrorism.</p>


	<A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The measures contained in this bill target persons and
					 activities that undermine the security and welfare of Canadians. Our efforts
					 are directed against terrorist acts, not against the members of a specific
					 community, ethnicity, or religion. Diversity is one of Canada's greatest
					 strengths and we are taking measures to protect it.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are marshalling our resources against the forces of
					 terror while still maintaining our commitment to the enduring values of
					 democracy. Striking the proper balance has always been the challenge of
					 democratic governments. This has never been more true than it is today. We are
					 protecting our values and defining the threat that terrorism poses to free and
					 civilized nations everywhere. These values receive an important part of their
					 legal expression in the charter of rights and freedoms. We will protect the
					 very thing that terrorism seeks to disrupt, namely, maintaining the balance
					 between an open and just society and a safe and secure one.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 is one element of the Government of Canada's
					 comprehensive action plan on Canadian security, a plan whose objectives are to
					 stop terrorists from getting into Canada and protect Canadian citizens from
					 terrorist acts, to bring forward tools to identify, prosecute, convict and
					 punish terrorists, to keep our borders secure and to work with the
					 international community to bring terrorists to justice and address the root
					 causes of hatred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In developing this legislation we have paid close
					 attention to what other democratic countries are doing in their fight against
					 terrorism. It is important that we act in a way that is consistent with the
					 approach of other democratic nations and in conformity with international
					 law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world changed on September 11 in a way that changed
					 our collective sense of safety and security. Reviewing our legal framework was
					 one component of a more thorough review undertaken by the federal government to
					 strengthen our national security. Be assured that all democratic nations have
					 undertaken a similar re-examination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have much to be proud of and much to protect.
					 This bill strikes a balance between our desire to maintain the values of
					 freedom and individual rights and our collective determination to protect our
					 citizens.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians can rest assured that we kept in mind the
					 rights and freedoms guaranteed in the charter when drafting our
					 proposals.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill reaffirms the equal right of every citizen of
					 whatever religion, race or ethnic origin to enjoy the security, protections and
					 liberties shared by all Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the criminal code would allow the courts
					 to order the deletion of publicly available hate propaganda from computer
					 systems such as an Internet site. Those who post material will be provided the
					 opportunity to convince the court that the material is not hate propaganda. The
					 provision would apply to hate propaganda that is located on Canadian computer
					 systems regardless of where the owner of the material is located or whether he
					 or she can be identified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, criminal code amendments would create a new
					 offence of mischief, motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on religion,
					 race, colour, national or ethnic origin, committed against a place of religious
					 worship or associated religious property.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Canadian Human Rights Act will be
					 amended to clarify that communication of hate messages using new technology,
					 such as the Internet, constitutes a discriminatory practice. While such
					 communication is already interpreted to be discriminatory, these amendments
					 will add certainty and clarity to the law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to describe the approach we have
					 developed in Bill C-36. The proposed legislative package focuses on three
					 elements. Bill C-36 targets terrorist activity and those who would carry out or
					 support such activity. The three main objectives of the new measures are as
					 follows: first, to suppress the very existence of terrorist groups; second, to
					 provide new investigative tools; and, third, to provide a tougher sentencing
					 regime to incapacitate terrorists and terrorist groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill seeks to identify, dismantle, prosecute and
					 punish terrorist activity. Bill C-36 includes criminal code amendments to
					 ratify the remaining two United Nations conventions and protocols related to
					 terrorism. The suppression of terrorist financing convention concerns the
					 freezing of terrorist property. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would prohibit dealing in any property of an
					 individual involved in terrorist activities and it would prohibit making
					 available funds and financial means or services to terrorists. These measures
					 would allow a federal court judge to order the seizure and forfeiture of
					 property used in or related to terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The suppression of terrorist bombings convention
					 contains provisions relating to the targeting of public places, government or
					 infrastructure facilities or transportation systems with explosives or other
					 lethal devices including chemical or biological agents. The term explosive or
					 other lethal device is defined broadly to include toxic chemicals, biological
					 agents and radioactive substances. Ratification of these two conventions would
					 reflect Canada's commitment to work together with the international
					 community.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let there be no doubt. Whether we are in North America
					 or somewhere else in the world, terrorism represents a global threat, the force
					 of which reverberated in the cities of New York and Washington on September 11.
					 We shall take all legitimate means necessary to undermine the forces of
					 terrorism. We must without hesitation work with our neighbours and with our
					 allies to ensure that those who seek to terrorize the innocent and support
					 terrorists understand that we will cut off their money. We will find them and
					 we will punish them for their acts of violence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation before the House would provide a
					 definition of terrorist activity for the first time. This definition is
					 critical, as many of the legal implications under the bill are tied to the
					 concept of terrorist activity. The first element of the definition outlines the
					 offences that are established in the 12 international conventions related to
					 terrorism, all of which we have signed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equally important, however, is a general definition
					 that refers to acts or omissions undertaken for political, religious or
					 ideological purposes and which are intended to intimidate the public, force
					 governments to act and cause serious harm. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have carefully restricted the definition to make it
					 clear that property damage and disruption of an essential service are not in
					 and of themselves sufficient to constitute a terrorist activity. The action
					 taken must also endanger lives or cause serious risks to the health and safety
					 of the public. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an important issue about which some of my
					 colleagues have expressed concern. To respond to their concerns let me assure
					 the House and all Canadians that this definition shall in no way include
					 legitimate forms of political dissent. It would not impinge upon the lawful
					 activities of legitimate political groups or lobby organizations. In addition,
					 the legislation would permit the designation of groups whose activities meet
					 the definition of terrorist activity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will speak now to the issue of new offences as laid
					 out in the legislation and as targeted to acts of terrorism. Comprehensive new
					 terrorism offences under the criminal code have been created. These include
					 offences relating to participating in, facilitating or instructing terrorist
					 activity and harbouring others who carry out terrorist activity.</p>


	<A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These offences would criminalize a full range of
					 activities related to terrorism. For example, a person who helps to train
					 another person in an otherwise legal activity such as flying an aircraft would
					 commit a crime if the trainer knew it would help the other person carry out a
					 terrorist activity. This would be the case regardless of whether the trainer
					 knew when, where or how the terrorist activity might be carried out.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new offences related to direction of or instruction
					 in terrorist activity would allow us to go after the leaders of terrorist
					 organizations. The most severe penalties, up to life imprisonment, are attached
					 to these offences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken about the effort demonstrated in the bill
					 to maintain a balance between a firm commitment to eradicate terrorism and the
					 protection of civil liberties for all Canadians. There are safeguards built
					 into these new terrorism offences throughout the bill. Notably the required
					 proof includes specific intent or actual knowledge in relation to the
					 prohibited conduct.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are all aware that the lifeblood of terrorist
					 organizations is money. Bill C-36 proposes new measures under the criminal code
					 to combat the financing of terrorism. It includes measures related to the
					 seizure, restraint and forfeiture of terrorist property. The new measures
					 related to financing would allow us to effectively go after the heart of
					 terrorist financing networks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it would be an offence to collect or
					 provide cash knowing that it would be used to facilitate or carry out an
					 offence that constitutes terrorist activity. It would be an offence to provide
					 financial services knowing that they would be used to facilitate or carry out
					 terrorist activity or to benefit a terrorist group. Persons in the financial
					 services industry who knowingly engage in transactions related to terrorism
					 could find themselves charged criminally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures are also subject to safeguards including
					 substantive and procedural requirements governing seizure, restraint and
					 forfeiture. Third party interests including those of the innocent families of
					 those involved would be protected.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should like to turn now to the element of the bill
					 that would provide for preventive arrest as a way of assisting law enforcement
					 officers to disrupt terrorism acts. The September 11 events heightened our
					 awareness of the highly sophisticated nature of terrorist activity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophisticated communications, modified organizational
					 structures and an ability to evade traditional investigative methods require us
					 to examine what other tools may be available to help security and enforcement
					 officers carry out their investigations. The preventive arrest is one such
					 tool.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an officer believes on reasonable grounds that a
					 serious terrorist offence is about to take place and suspects that the arrest
					 of a particular person would prevent it, then that person can be detained and
					 brought before a judge. These measures would only be available under strictly
					 defined conditions and would be subject to numerous procedural safeguards.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The consent of the attorney general would be required
					 as a prerequisite, save for emergency circumstances. The person would be
					 brought before a provincial court judge within 24 hours or as soon as possible,
					 and a maximum further period in detention of 48 hours would be possible if a
					 judge so orders.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of bringing the person before the court is
					 for the court to consider whether conditions should be imposed upon the
					 person's movements and associations. The court may impose such conditions or
					 may release the person without conditions. If the person refuses to accept
					 conditions the court may commit him or her to prison for up to 12
					 months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also amends the proceeds of crime or money
					 laundering legislation. Fintrac's mandate would be expanded to gather, analyze
					 and disclose information on terrorist money laundering. The safeguards built
					 into the Fintrac process would be maintained.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charities registration act would be enacted as part
					 of the bill to allow for the denial or removal of charitable status from
					 organizations that provide resources directly or indirectly to terrorists. This
					 would be subject to both ministerial and judicial review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 would also provide for investigative hearings
					 under the criminal code. These hearings would permit the gathering of evidence
					 in investigations of terrorism offences prior to the laying of charges. There
					 is an existing procedure under the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters
					 Act that allows us to do this for other countries, but there is nothing
					 comparable for our own investigations. The United States has investigative
					 grand juries that perform a similar function.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This investigative hearing would not be a trial of an
					 offence. Evidence given could not be used afterward in criminal proceedings
					 against the person. The right to counsel would apply, as would the rights of
					 privilege and other rights of non-disclosure under the law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also amend the Canadian Security
					 Intelligence Service Act to clarify its mandate and enable it to investigate
					 threats to Canada, including those arising from religious or ideological
					 objectives in addition to political causes that it now covers. As we have seen,
					 terrorists may be driven by motives other than the purely political.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would amend the National Defence Act to
					 continue and clarify the mandate of the Communications Security Establishment,
					 CSE, to collect foreign communications. The CSE's functions of collecting
					 foreign intelligence and of protecting Government of Canada communications
					 systems are particularly important in the context of action against
					 sophisticated terrorist networks that use computers and satellite telephone
					 systems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subject to strict conditions the bill would empower the
					 Minster of National Defence to authorize interceptions in limited
					 circumstances. Safeguards to ensure the privacy of Canadians are built into the
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other provisions of the bill include the updating and
					 refinement of the Official Secrets Act. This act would be renamed the security
					 of information act and would better address national security concerns.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The amendments cover threats of espionage by foreign
					 powers and by terrorist groups, espionage against Canada's national security,
					 defence, international relations and economic interests. They also address the
					 intimidation and coercion of any émigré community in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Evidence Act would be amended to allow for
					 better protection of sensitive information during legal proceedings. One of the
					 key reasons we need this improved protection is to be able to assure our allies
					 that sensitive information they provide to us can be protected from
					 release.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Access to Information Act, the Privacy Act and
					 Personal Information Protection Act would be amended to allow the Attorney
					 General of Canada to issue certificates prohibiting disclosure of information
					 for the purpose of protecting national security, national defence or
					 international relations. This would be consistent with Canada Evidence Act
					 provisions respecting the protection of such information in court
					 proceedings.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say a few words about the sentencing regime.
					 The bill would implement an aggressive sentencing and parole regime for
					 terrorism offences including a maximum of life imprisonment for many offences
					 and restricted parole eligibility. Those who instruct anyone to carry out a
					 terrorist activity would be subject to a maximum of life imprisonment.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the criminal code would stipulate that
					 sentences imposed for terrorist offences are to be served consecutively to any
					 other offence imposed relating to the same activity or event.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the main elements of our legislative
					 proposals. Legislation alone is not the complete answer to the security
					 challenge we are facing. Rather, it is one element of the government's plan to
					 deal effectively with terrorists and those who support them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent on us to ensure that our laws meet our
					 present day needs. As such, this package includes a three year parliamentary
					 review clause because we acknowledge the fact that our needs may change in the
					 weeks, months and years ahead.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today I want to reassure Canadians that their
					 government has listened to them and acknowledged their desire for action. It is
					 responding with a legislative package that I believe meets their expectations
					 not only in relation to combating terrorism but in its commitment to protecting
					 individual rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our world changed dramatically on September 11 but not
					 in the manner that the terrorists who planned and carried out the horrific
					 attacks had hoped. They aimed to frighten us, disrupt our lives and force us to
					 question our most basic democratic values of freedom and liberty. They did not
					 succeed. Our commitment to democracy is stronger than ever. Together all
					 Canadians are committed to increasing public security while maintaining our
					 core values.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 represents an appropriate legislative balance
					 to reflect Canadian values. Though our allies may have designed different
					 legislative means to suit their legislative and constitutional frameworks, we
					 nevertheless share a collective goal: to provide our citizens with security for
					 themselves, their families and their communities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome review of the legislation by the House. I
					 encourage all members to participate in the review and to support passage of
					 the legislation.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I thank the minister for her comments. I
					 am pleased to take part in the debate today regarding the long anticipated
					 anti-terrorism legislation. I am pleased to see the new found enthusiasm of
					 members on the Liberal benches to fight terrorism. After years of inaction and
					 denial the light finally went on over there, especially in view of the
					 circumstances of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill being tabled today is an important step
					 forward and reflects many of the issues the Canadian Alliance has been raising
					 over the past years. The bill echoes many recommendations made by Canadian
					 Alliance members of parliament, including the identification of terrorist
					 organizations, the ratification of international obligations to suppress
					 terrorist bombings, and banning fundraising activities that support
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As recently as September 18 our party introduced a
					 supply motion putting forth a number of the same elements Bill C-36 introduces.
					 The motion unfortunately was voted down as the government accused the Canadian
					 Alliance of playing politics or trying to score political points. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disappointing that the government has chosen to
					 disparage the opposition for raising legitimate security concerns, not only in
					 the past month but over the past number of years. It is even more disappointing
					 that the government has forced Canadians to wait so long before finally
					 introducing the same measures it previously disparaged.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom has had strict laws banning
					 terrorist fundraising and other terrorist activity for a year and a half, and
					 the United States has had such laws in place for a number of years. However
					 Canada has not taken any legislative action in this area until now. It appears
					 that government members have finally acknowledged the gravity of the situation
					 now that the tragedy of September 11 has forced them into action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although some positive and necessary measures are being
					 announced in the proposed legislation, in the days and weeks to come members of
					 the Canadian Alliance will be urging the minister to take further steps to
					 improve the provisions of the bill. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One issue that needs to be raised and debated is the
					 failure of the government to ban membership in organizations that are clearly
					 identified as terrorist organizations. If the purpose of an organization is to
					 engage in terrorist activities, what possible justification can there be for
					 permitting individuals to continue to belong to the organization?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government has argued in the past that such
					 a provision might be considered unconstitutional. However, making it illegal to
					 participate in a group proven to be a terrorist organization is a reasonable
					 limit on freedom of association and other freedoms in the charter. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the primary, if not the sole, purpose of such an
					 association is to commit illegal terrorist acts, the safety and security of all
					 citizens may reasonably supersede the individual rights of the persons
					 participating in the organizations or conspiring to commit the acts. If the
					 courts do not believe our citizens are deserving of this protection they should
					 tell us so, but the government should have the courage to include that in the
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrary to the suggestions found in justice department
					 publications, the provision would not make participation in a terrorist
					 organization illegal unless it could be proven that a person had the intention
					 to facilitate illegal actions for the organization. This is the same misleading
					 characterization that was in the government's previous organized crime
					 legislation. People need to understand that the provisions make clear the
					 additional responsibilities a prosecutor would need to demonstrate in a court
					 of law. </p>


	<A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is that the bill does nothing to
					 address Canada's new status as a haven for terrorists seeking to flee the
					 consequences of their crimes in other countries. The Canadian Alliance has
					 called on the government to put in place laws to ensure terrorists are
					 extradited promptly and without reservation to countries that respect the rule
					 of law. However the bill fails to address this serious concern. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court of Canada's United States v Burns
					 decision of February 15, 2001, created a safe haven in Canada for violent
					 criminals, including international terrorists, regardless of nationality, who
					 come to Canada to escape lawful punishment in the United States or any other
					 democratic country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-terrorism and effective death penalty act of
					 1996, passed by the United States congress, makes terrorism a federal crime
					 punishable by death. Any suspected terrorist who travels from the United States
					 to Canada to escape prosecution may therefore not be extradited unless
					 assurances are given by the U.S. that the person would not face the death
					 penalty. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is troubling that if the criminals involved in the
					 New York City or Washington attacks made their way to Canada to avoid
					 prosecution the Canadian government would be prohibited from extraditing them
					 pursuant to United States v Burns unless there were undefined exceptional
					 circumstances. These circumstances are required by the court, so the law
					 becomes the policy playground of unelected judges who define such circumstances
					 on a case by case basis. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are not simply the comments of members of
					 Canadian Alliance or opposition members. In a related case last February, the
					 day after I stood in the House and said the United States v Burns case was
					 creating a safe haven for terrorists in Canada and the Minister of Justice
					 stood and denied it, her own lawyers on behalf of herself and the Minister of
					 Immigration expressed their concern to the supreme court in precisely the same
					 words. They said its decision could create a safe haven for terrorists.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They cited the case of Suresh and Ahani, suspected
					 terrorists from Sri Lanka and Iran respectively who have claimed refugee status
					 in Canada and are using charter rights to appeal against deportation. Canadian
					 Alliance members have asked the minister to reopen the Suresh arguments. The
					 Supreme Court of Canada has not yet delivered its judgment but the minister is
					 entitled in exceptional circumstances to request that the case be opened.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the events of September 11, these are clearly
					 exceptional circumstances. The Minister of Justice has refused to ask the
					 Supreme Court of Canada to reopen the Suresh case. Accordingly it is unlikely
					 that she will be able to extradite foreign terrorists after the court makes its
					 ruling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In extradition and deportation cases Canadian laws must
					 ensure that terrorists are expelled from Canada promptly and without
					 reservation to face the consequences of their acts. I would ask the minister to
					 reconsider adding such provisions to the legislation. Canadians require legal
					 certainty, not vague assurances by the minister or unelected judges. The
					 security of Canadians is too important to be the policy plaything of unelected
					 judges.</p>


	<A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another worrisome issue is that the bill fails to deny
					 parole to terrorists convicted of multiple murders. Under the anti-terrorism
					 bill sentences would be served consecutively for a number of offences. However
					 sentences of life imprisonment are excluded. In other words, if a terrorist
					 commits murder he or she would be eligible for parole yet for lesser offences
					 the sentences must be served consecutively. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In light of the fact that terrorists attempt to
					 indiscriminately kill and take as many lives as possible, it is self-evident
					 that those who kill in this fashion should never be released from custody. A
					 second opportunity to participate in a mass murder should never be provided,
					 and certainly not provided by the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern I draw to the attention of the minister
					 is the joint prosecutorial authority afforded by the legislation. It is clear
					 that both the provincial attorney general and the federal attorney general may
					 initiate prosecutions under the legislation. However I submit that in view of
					 the international scope of terrorism prosecutions should remain in the hands of
					 the federal attorney general. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree there should be co-operation with the
					 provincial attorneys general, but the scope of these investigations and the
					 involvement of CSIS and the RCMP require federal direction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My real fear is that this provision was included simply
					 to download financial responsibility to the provinces and to allow the federal
					 minister of justice to escape political heat whenever she or he did not want to
					 take authority for a prosecution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen before where the federal government
					 downloads responsibilities after passing a law. The burden of the prosecution
					 and the financial cost associated with those laws then remain on the province.
					 This legislation is a matter of national security. It should be dealt with by
					 the federal attorney general and resourced through parliament.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Canadians have serious and legitimate concerns
					 that civil liberties may be sacrificed in the government's attempt to quash
					 terrorist activity. Regardless of the gravity of the security threats facing
					 our country all citizens must be assured of legal protection from the arbitrary
					 exercise of state power. That is why it is so important that the legislation
					 clearly spells out the rights of police and security agencies. We want to
					 provide police and security agents with this authority but not on any terms.
					 The terms must be carefully and clearly delineated in the
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want to see evidence that the federal
					 government is taking strong and effective legislative measures to improve
					 national security. I do not think these measures need be at the expense of
					 personal freedoms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is raising and will continue to raise
					 civil liberty concerns in the course of this debate and beyond. The preventive
					 arrest and the investigative hearings provisions of the bill will surely come
					 under charter scrutiny. The new power of preventive arrest would allow a peace
					 officer to arrest a suspected terrorist if there were reasonable grounds to
					 suspect that the person was about to commit a terrorist activity. The section
					 on investigative hearings would compel material witnesses to disclose
					 information relating to terrorism to a judge even without a formal
					 trial.</p>


	<A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that both these measures are reasonable,
					 especially in the context of the investigative hearings where there is
					 protection from self-incrimination. However, the due process that is imported
					 into the investigative hearings may in fact prevent the timely disclosure of
					 information necessary for action against pending or imminent terror
					 activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to balance those due process concerns with the
					 ability of our authorities to get timely information. In view of the fact that
					 there are no penal consequences as a result of the investigative hearing both
					 processes could be sped up because there are no criminal consequences to that
					 and we need to bear that in mind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the amendments to the criminal code regarding
					 hate crimes are also of concern. For example, under the bill courts may order
					 an Internet provider to delete an item from the computer system if it were
					 deemed hate propaganda. The courts may also order the custodian of the computer
					 system to provide any information relating to the whereabouts of the person who
					 created the hate propaganda.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increased abilities of our police and security
					 agencies also need to be carefully considered. It is important to remember that
					 our laws dealing with national security have not kept up with advances in
					 technology in terms of proposed changes to laws governing wiretapping
					 procedures. Criteria for obtaining warrants and electronic surveillance orders
					 to monitor terrorist activity should have been streamlined and modernized years
					 ago. Our frontline workers need to be able to respond to the virtually
					 unlimited resources, funds and technology of terrorist
					 organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy can be made in the context of organized
					 crime. It seems that terrorist organizations and organized crime have unlimited
					 funds. Our police and other security agencies do not. As my colleague pointed
					 out yesterday in question period, the government seems to put its priority on
					 registering the shotguns of duck hunters rather than providing our security
					 services with those resources. Spending $100 million a year on registering the
					 shotguns of duck hunters for no bona fide criminal activity is an absolute
					 disgrace. If the government wants to find money to prevent crime, let it do so
					 by abolishing this very ill conceived national long gun registry.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern is the very close bureaucratic
					 relationship between our federal police, the RCMP, and the solicitor general.
					 If we are giving police this broad power and if it is justified under the
					 charter in order to accomplish these security needs, then we have to take steps
					 to divide that close relationship between the solicitor general and the
					 commissioner of the RCMP. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner of the RCMP is a deputy minister in
					 his own department. It is wrong for a national police force to have that kind
					 of relationship with the minister. There needs to be protection so that the
					 police work is separate from the political work or the possibility of political
					 interference in that police work.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleagues in the NDP have raised the issue that the
					 legislation may suppress bona fide political dissent. That too is a legitimate
					 concern. One of the ways to address that issue is not by diluting the
					 legislation, but by putting a proper reporting system in place so that the
					 heads of the RCMP or other security agencies do not report to the solicitor
					 general but to an independent committee of the House made up of non-partisan
					 members of the House or members from both sides of the House. This is a very
					 important step that we can take in order to ensure that police powers are
					 properly used. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unprecedented terrorist attacks of September 11
					 will certainly influence the courts' rulings on security matters. We must allow
					 the courts to do their work after we have considered and passed this
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of Justice said, the courts read
					 newspapers, so they know what is going on. It is too bad the minister could not
					 have supplemented that knowledge by expanding the arguments against Suresh. The
					 minister missed a golden opportunity in these exceptional circumstances to make
					 a clear stand against terrorism by indicating very clearly the arguments that
					 need to be made to the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the course of the past month the Canadian Alliance
					 has drawn attention to the fact that although Canada signed the international
					 convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism almost two years
					 ago, it has not ratified the convention because the federal government failed
					 to put into place the necessary legislation to stop terrorist fundraising.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that the legislation has been introduced, it
					 appears that the justice minister was less than frank with the House and
					 Canadians when she implied in the House in response to questioning that she
					 could seize money under subsection 3(2) of the United Nations Act. This section
					 has been amended by new legislation on goods, wares or merchandise; in the very
					 section that she said would allow her to seize those assets, including money,
					 those words have been deleted and replaced with the word property.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the minister implied that this section, as it
					 was then, gave her the authority to seize assets, the Canadian Alliance
					 consistently said that the government did not have the legislative authority to
					 do so. It is now clear that this is in fact the case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is unfortunate that ministers of the crown would
					 spend their time in question period being vague and less than frank in order to
					 make up for legislative and policy failures, however, I welcome the new
					 provisions that would allow the government to ratify the UN convention and to
					 take this long needed action to suppress the essential financial resources
					 needed by terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a number of amendments to other acts in the
					 bill, including the Official Secrets Act, the Canada Evidence Act, the Proceeds
					 of Crime (Money Laundering) Act, the National Defence Act and many others. We
					 must be diligent in ensuring that all amendments to these acts strike the
					 appropriate balance between national security and the right of the public to be
					 informed of government business. The leader of the PC/DR coalition has been
					 especially vigilant in respect of this disclosure. He has mentioned it in
					 various questions and other statements, as have other members of the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the amendments to the Access to Information Act
					 are troubling. For example, the bill would allow the attorney general to
					 prohibit the disclosure of information for the purpose of protecting
					 international relations, national security or defence. This sweeping provision
					 could potentially restrict the information available to Canadians to a great
					 extent. Information about the deficiencies of the Sea King helicopters may not
					 have been revealed if the attorney general could have used the blanket
					 prohibition of protecting national security to prevent such information from
					 being released.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill should not be a cover to allow the government
					 to continue to evade its security responsibilities as it has done over the last
					 number of years. These types of amendments to the Access to Information Act
					 need to be very carefully considered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government also claims that the bill clarifies the
					 mandate of the Communications Security Establishment. Currently the CSE is a
					 government agency that provides guidance in the area of information technology.
					 However the mandate extended to the CSE in the bill gives considerable legal
					 authority to the agency. For example clause 102 of the bill allows the Minister
					 of National Defence to authorize the CSE to intercept private communications
					 for the sole purpose of obtaining foreign intelligence. This amendment to the
					 National Defence Act is a major shift of the responsibilities of the CSE and
					 should not pass through the House without due consideration of its
					 implications.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the same lines I also have concerns about
					 amendments to the Official Secrets Act. Secrecy legislation is primarily
					 designed to protect the security of the state from espionage. However, the
					 broad wording of Canada's Official Secrets Act means that it may be used to
					 sanction the unauthorized release of almost any information held by
					 government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be mindful of this when considering any
					 amendments to the act. In view of the answers we have heard provided to the
					 House by ministers of the crown, for example the solicitor general, matters
					 that routinely are given to members of the press in the United States by the
					 American government are denied access here in the House. The minister simply
					 stands and says that it is a matter of national security and cannot be
					 disclosed. If the minister is taking that position on the basis of the existing
					 act, we can imagine what the minister would do with enhanced powers. We need to
					 clarify the powers that the ministers may have in denying Canadians the right
					 to information that does not undermine national security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last but perhaps most important concern I would
					 like to raise today is the matter of resources. The legislation, as good as it
					 is in its various aspects, will be of little value if the Liberal government
					 does not provide adequate resources to our frontline forces in the fight
					 against terrorism. The government consistently says it gives a certain amount
					 of money over a number of years, but when we divide that money over those
					 number of years and subtract the money that has been taken out of the security
					 budget and look at what actual money is going to frontline police and security
					 services, we realize that the money certainly is less than adequate. Again I
					 only need make reference to the kinds of boondoggles into which the government
					 has been willing to put money, like registering the shotguns of duck
					 hunters.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United States passed legislation in 1996 that
					 requires the government to commit resources to support a wide range of security
					 measures. The Canadian bill has no such requirement. It is the responsibility
					 of the government to provide adequate resources to our frontline police and
					 security agencies in the fight against terrorism. Without this support Canadian
					 security cannot be assured.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has taken some important steps. Although
					 we will be considering the provisions of the bill very carefully, it is
					 imperative that the legislation move forward as quickly as possible. I
					 therefore thank members of the House for the increase in the number of hours
					 for debate to raise concerns and move the matter along.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians are entitled to live in peace and
					 security. While the government has finally moved to respond in a meaningful way
					 to the threat of worldwide terrorism, much remains to be done. Members of the
					 Canadian Alliance, the opposition, are committed to working with the government
					 to ensure that the steps necessary to achieve peace and security in Canada are
					 accomplished.</p>

					 (Saint-Bruno--Saint-Hubert, BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, as we all know we have been asking the
					 minister to introduce legislation that will allow Canada to fulfill its
					 international commitments in the fight against terrorism for some time
					 now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore understandable that since the events of
					 September 11 we have been looking forward to this bill on terrorism. Now that
					 we have it, the question is whether or not it lives up to our expectations.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we can only applaud the fact that the minister
					 has finally introduced legislation that truly outlaws activities that finance
					 terrorism. Whether it be for organized crime or terrorists, money is the
					 lifeblood of war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By starving an organization of its sources of
					 financing, we greatly reduce its striking power. Furthermore, by adding seizure
					 and freezing of assets, we can begin to take seriously the government's claim
					 that it wants to wage war against terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, from part 6 on, the bill contains, word
					 for word, Bill C-16, the bill on funding charitable organizations. What we
					 thought we could call the late lamented Bill C-16, has risen from the tomb.
					 Apart from a few cosmetic changes, it is to be found in Bill C-36 almost in its
					 entirety.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April 30 I summarized Bill C-16 in the following
					 terms: suspicion, discretionary power, enigmatic proof, and lack of control.
					 Six months later, I have no choice but to reiterate these same comments about
					 part 6 of this bill on terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not deny that it is appropriate to protect the
					 integrity of the charities registration system by preventing their use as a
					 cover for terrorist organizations. What we dispute is the way the government
					 wants to go about achieving its ends.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This spring we criticized the fact that it went against
					 too many principles of justice for it to pass royal assent. To let this happen
					 would constitute a dangerous precedent in terms of the violation of procedural
					 guarantees. However, yesterday the minister slipped the same bill, give or take
					 a comma, under our nose. Worse yet, the inquisitional procedure established by
					 Bill C-16 now applies to a body that wants its name removed from the list of
					 organizations involved in terrorist activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now under the bill before us the governor in council
					 will be able to establish by regulation a list containing the name of any
					 entity that might be associated with terrorist activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean, exactly? In both cases, the entity
					 and the charity appear before a judge who can reach a decision from evidence
					 submitted in camera and without the party or parties being present.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In even clearer terms, let us suppose that a charity
					 loses its charitable status following the signing of a certificate by the
					 solicitor general or the Minister of National Revenue. The organization will be
					 allowed to ask the judge to quash the certificate. However, it is possible that
					 the judge will base his decision on information that the organization will
					 never have access to. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for a group that wants to see its name
					 struck from the list of organizations associated with terrorist activities.
					 That group will have to go before a judge, who will determine whether or not to
					 remove the group's name from the list. However, this could take place without
					 the applicant ever knowing why his name first appeared on such a
					 list.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By violating such fundamental and elementary rules of
					 evidence as the disclosure of evidence, the government is ignoring the
					 contradictory nature of our judicial system. All the more worrisome is the fact
					 that the evidence adduced will be based on information provided primarily by
					 CSIS. Knowing the practices used by CSIS and its difficulties in striking a
					 fair balance between national security and rights and freedoms, this might be
					 cause for concern. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With such provisions, we can legitimately ask two
					 questions. Either the information is not circulating between ministers or else
					 the government has simply decided to turn a deaf ear to the representations
					 made by countless witnesses who appeared before the Standing Committee on
					 Finance when it reviewed Bill C-16, which at the time was sponsored by the
					 solicitor general. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it is hard to imagine that the Minister of
					 Justice was not informed of what went on during the proceedings of that
					 committee, the only plausible assumption is the second one. Considering all
					 that went on with the young offenders bill, could this be a habit with the
					 minister?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same vein, during the first sitting of the
					 Standing Committee on Finance, which took place on May 16, the solicitor
					 general and the Minister of National Revenue tried to explain to us why Bill
					 C-16 did not include the definition of the term terrorist. The solicitor
					 general said, and I quote: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He went on to say:</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the Minister of National Revenue, he specified

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet, to cite just two examples, the U.K. terrorism act
					 and the French penal code have successfully done what these two ministers felt
					 was impossible at the time they were defending Bill C-16 before the committee.
					 The British legislation reads as follows: </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the French penal code, terrorism is defined as
					 follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Certain criminal offences are
						  considered terrorism when the acts are intentionally linked to an individual or
						  group whose purpose is to cause a serious disruption of public order through
						  intimidation or terror.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is followed by a list of the criminal offences
					 considered acts of terrorism. I will spare members that, however. We can see
					 that there has been a sort of attempt in Bill C-36 to define the terms
					 terrorist activity, terrorist group and terrorism offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering that the term was virtually undefinable,
					 according to the two ministers, one might well think that the Minister of
					 Justice has done nothing to simplify things. Bill C-36, instead of providing a
					 definition along the French or British lines that states right off what is
					 involved forces us to constantly jump from one reference to another, and we
					 have almost forgotten what we were looking for by the time we get to the end of
					 the chain of searches. Fortunately the basic content is there, but the form
					 needs more work. In actual fact, there is no definition of terrorism, just
					 definitions for act, action or omission. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, as we have been seeing for some time now,
					 law enforcement officials are demanding a considerable increase in their
					 powers, but must the powers of the various government bodies responsible for
					 security be increased in order to mount an effective campaign against
					 terrorism? Well might one wonder. In the October 6 issue of <i>La Presse</i>,
					 journalist Yves Boisvert wrote:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Nothing useful will be accomplished
						  without effective information services and an intelligent police
						  community.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What constitutes an effective information service? One
					 thing is certain, that is, it is certainly not by keeping tabs on groups such
					 as Amnesty International, Greenpeace, the Anglican Church, the United Church
					 and the Raging Grannies that we are going to dismantle a major terrorist
					 network. Yet considering that some fifty or so organizations and approximately
					 350 individuals are already being watched closely by CSIS as part of its
					 anti-terrorist program, there is no lack of genuine terrorist threats. We may
					 therefore conclude that if the resources and energies were concentrated in the
					 right place, part of the problem would resolve itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, in order to be intelligent, must the
					 police be authorized to commit criminal offences as provided for in the
					 organized crime legislation? By placing above the law those who are supposed to
					 enforce it, such measures can only succeed in institutionalizing crime within
					 law enforcement agencies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must we also bend the rules of evidence in order to
					 compensate for deficiencies or errors in a case before the courts? Since a
					 police investigation can have a tremendous impact on an accused, the work of
					 law enforcement officers must be guided by rules imposing maximum
					 rigour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not lose sight of the fact that the primary
					 mission of police officials is to protect public safety. This is not some
					 contest to make a maximum number of arrests leading to charges, particularly if
					 these charges are the result of bungled investigations. Not only will the
					 public not be better protected, but in fact it will be even more vulnerable to
					 possible abuses of authority. This would be to replace one threat with another.
					 If such guiding rules are limited, there is a good chance that corners will be
					 cut.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-24 opened a door that will be very difficult to
					 close and its long term impact could be catastrophic. By allowing a peace
					 officer to detain a person following an arrest without a warrant, Bill C-36
					 just opens another door. If there are sceptics, just think of what happened
					 during the October crisis with the War Measures Act: there were hundreds of
					 arbitrary arrests and heavy handed searches without warrants, undoubtedly the
					 worst case of abuse of power ever known in Quebec.</p>


	<A NAME="T1115"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1115"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1120"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1115)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fine to introduce anti-terrorism legislation, but
					 let us not forget that this is merely a legislative tool that cannot be
					 effective in and of itself. The best legislation in the world is useless if
					 there are not competent people with a good head to implement it and ensure
					 compliance with it. This includes police authorities, intelligence services and
					 customs officers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of customs officers, there is still a lot
					 of work to do to change their approach, which remains much more focused on
					 alcohol and cigarette purchases. I made a quick trip to the United States after
					 the September 11 events and when I came back to the Canadian border, the only
					 reflex of the customs officer was to ask me what I had bought that
					 day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This speaks volumes about the concerns of those who
					 normally should be the first line of defence of our national
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of possible abuse, the minister is also
					 grabbing relatively extraordinary powers, since her bill gives the attorney
					 general the authority to unilaterally suspend in a totally arbitrary fashion
					 the application of the Access to Information Act, through powers usually
					 reserved for the commissioner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again, this type of political interference is a
					 cause for concern, particularly since the government has been severely
					 criticized recently, both here and elsewhere, for its policy of silence.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the amendments to the Firearms Act, we
					 see that the governor in council can exempt any category of non-residents from
					 the provisions of this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to information received yesterday morning
					 from departmental staff, the amendments to the Firearms Act would apply solely
					 to air marshals responsible for ensuring on board security on international
					 flights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this is the objective the minister had in mind, it
					 would be worth her while to say so clearly in her bill. Given the circumstances
					 behind the creation of Bill C-36 and the government's policy of being reactive
					 rather than proactive, we understand that this bill was drafted hastily. We
					 hope, therefore, that we can count on the minister's co-operation when the time
					 comes to propose the necessary amendments to fill in the gaps.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the urgency of the situation, the government must
					 not be allowed to use the crisis situation as a pretext for sneaking its bill
					 through. At any rate, the damage is already done, and the situation could
					 hardly be worse, considering the state of psychosis that reigns just about
					 everywhere </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to equip ourselves with such a significant
					 tool, such a restrictive and invasive one as an anti-terrorist bill, then we
					 might as well take the time required to make sure we have the best legislative
					 framework possible. The committee stage must not be glossed over. We are
					 certain that many people will want to be heard and we cannot afford to not take
					 advantage of the valuable contribution of their expertise. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one more point we feel it is important to
					 raise. At present, the bill specifies that a thorough examination of its
					 provisions and application must be carried out within three years of its
					 enactment. At this point, we feel it would be wise to reduce that three year
					 deadline to one year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering the fact that these are exceptional
					 circumstances and that we are presently debating measures that are equally
					 exceptional, we cannot afford to wait three years before reassessing this
					 legislative framework that is taking us into uncharted territory. We must
					 prevent any opportunities for mistakes and a shorter review period is the best
					 way to make adjustments if the circumstances so require.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To close, as the Prime Minister so wisely stated, we
					 must be vigilant and prudent in order to avoid repeating the mistakes of the
					 past.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to mistakes of the past, we have no doubt
					 that the Prime Minister knows what he is talking about, since he was a minister
					 in the Trudeau cabinet during the October crisis of 1970. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no magic bullet when it comes to terrorism, as
					 I have already said. At first glance Bill C-36 appears harsh and invasive.
					 However, it would be inappropriate to remain passive in circumstances such as
					 these. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically we will have to take the necessary time to
					 ensure that this bill will allow us to fight terrorism effectively while
					 minimizing the inconveniences to citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, we must be sure that Bill C-36 will do more
					 good than harm.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to
					 address Bill C-36 and to put on the record the concerns of the New Democratic
					 Party.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to begin by saying a few words about the context
					 in which we are having this debate. Obviously the context is set primarily by
					 the events of September 11 and the need that follows from those events for
					 Canada to consider whether or not its current legal regime is adequate to
					 prevent terrorist activity here in Canada or prevent Canada from being used as
					 a place where terrorist activity in other countries can be financed or in other
					 ways supported.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This drive for new and better anti-terrorism
					 legislation is driven by the legitimate concerns and the legitimate fear that
					 have arisen out of September 11. It arises also out of the motion passed at the
					 United Nations subsequent to September 11 which calls on all nations of the
					 world to implement anti-terrorist legislation and to implement UN conventions
					 with respect to the prevention of terrorism within 90 days. The government is
					 moving to do that. That is a good thing and something which we welcome
					 regardless of what particular concerns we might have about the legislation that
					 is now before us. That is part of the context, i.e., September 11. However, we
					 are not doing this in isolation. Unfortunately we also are considering this
					 legislation in the context of the last few years here in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean by that is the events that happened, for
					 instance, at the APEC meeting and subsequently in Quebec City. They are on the
					 minds of many people. The government might say that is an entirely different
					 thing. The question is whether or not the bill is designed in such a way to
					 make sure that the kind of protest activities that took place in Vancouver at
					 the APEC meeting, in Windsor at the OAS meeting and in Quebec City at the FTAA
					 meeting will be treated differently from the kind of activity which is
					 addressed in this particular legislation. That is one of the concerns we bring
					 to the table, because we know that it is a concern out there within a certain
					 constituency in the Canadian public. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, all of this is really a question of trust.
					 It is really a question of not what the legislation says and not what the
					 government says, but whether or not Canadians trust that the spirit and the
					 letter of the law will be followed and not in some way or another abused. That
					 is really what is at stake here. No amount of citing the relevant clauses of
					 the bill and saying that something cannot happen will do. If people believe out
					 of their own experience or from reading or learning about the experiences of
					 others that either the government or the police have an inclination in some
					 circumstances to abuse powers and to treat as unlawful that which is lawful,
					 then they find themselves in a position of not being able to give the kind of
					 approval they would otherwise probably like to give. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Canadians feel there are things that need to be
					 done, particularly in the parts of the bill that have to do with the
					 ratification and implementation of the UN conventions. That is not something
					 that anyone is taking any issue with at all. There are other things in the bill
					 that are more problematic and which need to be further discussed, explored and
					 explained in committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to hear from Canadians who have concerns about
					 particular aspects of the bill. We want to have a good process in committee
					 where time is taken to hear from these Canadians so they can put their concerns
					 on the record and so that we might even be able to amend the legislation, if
					 necessary, if that is the will of the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to deal with the issue of trust. The
					 definition of a terrorist activity, not the one that comes out of the UN
					 conventions but the one which the government has put into the bill, in section
					 83.01 states: </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are the clauses having to do with death or
					 serious bodily harm, endangering a person's life or causing a serious risk to
					 the health or safety of the public or any segment of the public.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first reading one might be tempted to think that
					 pretty well covers it because the government has said that as long as it has to
					 do with lawful advocacy, protest, dissent or stoppage of work and does not
					 involve these other terrible things then everything is fine. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are a couple of problems I would like to
					 explore further in committee. I am not making a final judgment on the
					 particular clause. For example, it does raise the question of what is lawful
					 advocacy, protest, dissent or stoppage of work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it were clear as to what was lawful and what was
					 not, then there would not be a problem. However there is such a thing as an
					 unlawful stoppage of work or an illegal strike. The law is now able to deal
					 with them, but it would be a legitimate concern that illegal stoppages of work
					 might somehow fall under the ambit of this if other criteria were met. These
					 are the kinds of things I hope to ask the minister and others about in
					 committee. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is lawful? Lawful sounds good but a lot of young
					 people thought they were engaged in lawful protest in Quebec City way beyond
					 the perimeter and not challenging the wall or engaging in any property damage
					 or anything like that. They were just sitting around, talking to each other,
					 when all of a sudden they were tear gassed, fired upon with rubber bullets and
					 treated as if they were doing something unlawful.</p>


	<A NAME="T1135"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1135"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1140"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1135)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This comes back to trust and I think it is regrettable.
					 I would prefer that we were dealing with anti-terrorism legislation in a
					 context of trust where all Canadians could feel they did not have a government
					 that was careless about their civil liberties and right to lawful protest.
					 Instead we are unfortunately not just dealing with the context of September 11,
					 which should be the overriding concern, but the backdrop for this in the minds
					 of a lot of Canadians is APEC and Quebec City.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing the government has to do is persuade those
					 Canadians who have scepticism arising out of those experiences that this is
					 entirely different and that this would not be used to harass legitimate
					 protestors or get in the way of legitimate protests.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That brings me to the next concern that my party has
					 which deals with the notion of preventive arrest. It is just a concern at this
					 point. We know that in certain circumstances over the last few years certain
					 people who were known to be participating in protests were all of a sudden
					 charged with something, detained, and were not able to be at the protest. I
					 will not mention any names but this is a known fact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister said in her speech, and it is stated in
					 the legislation, that the preventive arrest issue is not arrest without warrant
					 forever and ever. The person would have to appear before a judge after 24 hours
					 and could be detained for another 48 hours. It is only a judge who can order
					 further detention and then only if the person is unwilling to meet the
					 conditions laid down by the judge. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand all of that. That does not mean to say
					 that in the wrong hands this could not be used as a way to harass people who
					 were planning on attending certain events and suddenly find themselves the
					 object of this provision.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know the minister said the legislation is not
					 intended for that sort of thing at all, and I hope it is not. I even believe
					 that it is not in the minister's mind. I am trying to convey the spirit of
					 scepticism that exists among a great many people arising out of the experiences
					 over the last few years. There would not be any more need to trump up charges
					 against anybody because this provision in Bill C-36 could be used.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another concern I have was raised by the member for
					 Provencher. It deals with the use of the phrase anything damaging to
					 “international relations” as a reason for non-disclosure when it pertains to
					 information made available in the context of various investigations, hearings
					 or determinations by the government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Provencher said that this was a very
					 broad category. Almost anything could be construed as damaging international
					 relations. We experienced this in the past when the government felt obliged to
					 uncritically accept the views of other governments with respect to activity
					 happening in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember controversies some years ago when the Sikh
					 community in Canada found itself at odds with the government because it was
					 taking the view of the government of India as the uncritical truth about what
					 was happening there or the uncritical truth about what was happening within
					 that community here. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as we have communities in Canada that are
					 concerned about struggles and conflicts in other countries, there will
					 inevitably be a divergence of opinion in many circumstances between what people
					 here believe and what the government there believes. It does not mean that
					 either of them are particularly malevolent in this respect. It is just a fact
					 of life that there will be a divergence of opinion.</p>


	<A NAME="T1140"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1140"><!-- Hour: 11--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1140)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this could possibly suggest is that for any
					 disclosure of information that would be found unacceptable or unfriendly to a
					 foreign government with which Canada wanted to maintain good relations, we
					 could not disclose it in the context that the bill is describing. That is
					 another concern which we will have to explore at committee because the views of
					 other governments are not always pristine, balanced or objective, or certainly
					 they may be different from views held in Canada either by a particular group of
					 Canadians or by Canadians in general.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been much said about preserving the balance
					 between liberty and security. We must not just respect Canadian values in this
					 regard. We need to respect Canadian values as set out in the Canadian Charter
					 of Rights and Freedoms. The government claims that it has done this. We will
					 want to hear evidence about this in committee and perhaps debate among
					 ourselves whether this bill meets that challenge.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fairness to the government and to the charter, the
					 charter has already had its effect on this legislation. My understanding is
					 that the bill does not go as far as the British anti-terrorism legislation.
					 This is because we have a Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Britain
					 does not. That may well be the reason for the difference. For example,
					 intellectual support for terrorist groups or causes associated with terrorism,
					 or even membership in certain organizations, is not proscribed by in Bill
					 C-36.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The charter has already done its work in changing what
					 might otherwise have been brought before us by the government. It is still
					 legitimate to ask whether or not what we have before us is not so much charter
					 proof but whether it corresponds to what the charter demands of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest to the government that it consider whether or
					 not the bill should be referred to the Supreme Court of Canada at the same time
					 as it is being debated and studied in the House of Commons and pre-studied in
					 the Senate. As we know, the Senate will begin to study the bill at the same
					 time as the House is seized of it, which is an unusual procedure, but it is
					 being done so that the bill can be passed expeditiously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would the government not consider referring the
					 bill to the Supreme Court of Canada for an urgent judgment, not at its leisure
					 but within the same framework of time as the House is dealing with the bill? If
					 the House can deal with it and the Senate can deal with it, surely the supreme
					 court could deal with it. Then we would not need this debate about whether or
					 not the legislation meets the requirements of the charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another matter I would like to raise and which I hope
					 we will be able to consider in committee has to do with the whole question of
					 whether or not certain aspects of the bill should be sunsetted. The bill
					 provides for a parliamentary review after three years. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We live in extraordinary circumstances. It might be
					 advisable to consider that what seems acceptable today to the government, to a
					 majority of the House or perhaps to everyone ultimately, might not seem
					 acceptable or necessary in a year or two.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, because I have seen these parliamentary
					 reviews before and they tend not to mean very much, there might be some need to
					 consider looking at a sunset clause instead of having a parliamentary
					 review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, we need to consider the whole matter of
					 resources, because all of this will be for naught if we do not give the
					 agencies charged with these responsibilities the resources they need. In that
					 respect we have to redress the damage that has been done to the public sector
					 in so many ways by the government ever since it took office in 1993.</p>

					 turn comes to make remarks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mentioned the problem of protests and worried about
					 whether the legislation applied to proper protest movements, labour marches and
					 that kind of thing. I wonder, does he think the legislation should apply to
					 protest movements where violence is planned, where it is deliberate?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think APEC is a good example, but Quebec is a
					 good example of where protesters actually deliberately organized assaults on
					 the police lines, if you will, and there was a deliberate planned intention to

	Madam Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his very

					 take care of any flaws that would have become evident after a couple of years
					 in operation. I am glad he made that point.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at this, does the hon. member have any
					 specific examples that he has seen in the past in his lengthy parliamentary
					 experience where by this sort of clause has been used effectively? Could he

					 legislation?</p>

				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am not sure to which clause the member
					 is referring. I am not sure whether he is referring to the clause in the bill
					 having to do with parliamentary review or whether he is referring to a clause
					 that is not yet in the bill having to do with sunsetting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In either case, clauses having to do with parliamentary
					 review are ultimately upheld. That is to say the review takes place. Sometimes
					 it does not take place on time. Sometimes there are good reasons for that
					 because the committee that needs to do the review might be seized with
					 something more important or whatever. Sometimes it does not take place because
					 the government is not particularly interested in that happening right away so
					 it is delayed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is only a parliamentary review when a
					 committee makes recommendations. Again, as is the case in our system, the
					 government is not required to respond to whatever the parliamentary review
					 comes up with. A committee could look at it and say that it is not working,
					 that it has turned out to be an overreaction or that it has led to curtailment
					 of freedoms that we did not intend, et cetera. Yet nothing happens because
					 there is no obligation on the part of the government to implement whatever
					 recommendations come out of a parliamentary review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The advantage of a sunset clause would be that the
					 government would be obliged to reintroduce the legislation. Therefore it would
					 be forced, if you like, to use the opportunity if it wanted to, to take certain
					 things out, to amend certain things, or for that matter to add to the
					 legislation. That seems to me to be the advantage of a sunset clause over a
					 parliamentary review clause.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would indicate at the outset that members of the
					 Progressive Conservative/Democratic Representative Caucus Coalition are
					 generally supportive of this legislation and enthusiastically supportive of the
					 need to bring about changes in our internal security measures and the way in
					 which we deal with terrorism in this country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I begin my remarks by saying that this debate has taken
					 a very constructive tone. It has been representative of the recognition by all
					 members of the House of the desire on the part of Canadians to plug some of the
					 legislative gaps that exist to address the issue of terrorism head on. I think
					 in fairness that this legislation is an attempt to do just that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ideally in every sense we would like to see laser
					 guided precision when we deal with issues such as this, of public security. I
					 hope that my remarks will be indicative of a genuine desire to improve and
					 buttress this legislation in some way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is encouraging to see that the government has taken
					 decisive action. Following September 11 there was a public need, a very anxious
					 nervousness that direction and leadership be displayed by the government. After
					 one month this legislation is here. In fairness I believe that it is a good
					 bill. It is a bill that attempts in a broad way in an omnibus form to address
					 some of the holes that are there and which have been exploited by international
					 terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some shortcomings. There is room for
					 improvement. In particular this legislation needs to be given greater detail.
					 The legislation needs to be put under the microscope and the lamp not only by
					 members of parliament but by those who will be affected. As the minister
					 herself indicated in her remarks, this is not the be all and the end all. There
					 is going to be a need for further legislative changes in the areas of
					 immigration, border security, economics and trade and customs and excise. All
					 of these areas have been affected in a profound way by this horrific event
					 which was the pinnacle, in our generation, of aggression brought to bear in
					 North America. It is a time for measured and introspective action but action
					 nonetheless. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elements of this legislation that will improve upon our
					 internal security measures include the announcement that police will be able to
					 carry out preventive arrests, that is, arrests of individuals without charge
					 under strong suspicion of activity related to terrorism. There is a subtle but
					 important change in that bar, that standard that is to be applied by CSIS
					 agents which is now afforded to the RCMP. That is to say they can arrest on
					 reasonable suspicion as opposed to reasonable grounds. It is of such importance
					 when dealing with terrorism that police should be afforded that
					 standard.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would argue there is more that can be done. The issue
					 of preventative arrest is something that is going to cause a lot of jitters and
					 nervousness among the communities. There are safeguards in place which we are
					 quick to acknowledge. The individuals brought to justice must appear before a
					 judge within 24 hours. They can be detained a further 48 hours, bringing it to
					 a total of 72 hours in custody. Yet they must have this appearance before a
					 judge and there must be reasons given. During that time in custody it is good
					 to see it enunciated that they will be able to afford themselves charter
					 rights, that is, right to counsel, right to disclosure, reasons for being held
					 in custody. All of those traditional rights will still apply and those
					 safeguards should apply.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This type of pre-emptive strike on the part of police
					 officers is a response to the seriousness and the grave implications that can
					 flow from terrorist activity. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use and implementation of investigative hearings is
					 an important step that we find in Bill C-36. The police can take a person into
					 custody and deduce information and question a person with respect to terrorist
					 activity. The person appears before a judge and is required to answer
					 questions. The individual cannot be forced to incriminate himself or herself
					 but may be forced at least to respond to questions about his or her
					 activities.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How compromised would their individual rights be? That
					 remains to be seen. The return to a power that used to exist in Canada and
					 still exists in the United States, for example the process of grand juries,
					 would be an interesting experiment but one upon which we must embark in our
					 efforts to deal with terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Increasing the powers of the Communications Security
					 Establishment is an important step. Currently the CSE is only allowed to
					 monitor communications outside Canada. Under this legislation CSE would require
					 only the authorization of the Minister of Justice before monitoring discussions
					 between a foreigner and someone in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to monitoring, Bill C-36 would allow police
					 to obtain one year surveillance warrants for suspected terrorists. While
					 benchmarks and criteria would need to be met, police would have an increased
					 and expanded ability to monitor and conduct surveillance on communications that
					 relate to terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently police can perform this type of surveillance
					 for only 60 days. The efforts of the bill to expand that ability are important.
					 It also makes an effort to streamline and expedite the ability to get warrants
					 and wiretaps. The current process is extremely onerous and is an impediment to
					 the ability of police to monitor criminal activity. There is a need to expand
					 this in the general context of police work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have liked the bill to set out a clear
					 definition of terrorism as we have seen in the United Kingdom, however, I
					 commend the government for including a definition of terrorist activity. This
					 was taken from many sources. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am told there are 190 definitions of terrorism in
					 legislation around the world. Bill C-36 defines terrorist activity as action
					 taken for a political, religious or ideological purpose that threatens the
					 public or national security by killing, seriously harming or endangering a
					 person, causing property damage likely to injure people, or disrupting an
					 essential service or facility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition does not state that terrorist activity
					 does not involve lawful activity such as protests and strikes. There is
					 therefore concern, as has been mentioned by my colleague from
					 Winnipeg--Transcona and others in the debate, that legitimate political protest
					 might fall under a rather broad umbrella.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 is defined in such a way that judges applying
					 common sense criteria would not find that legitimate forms of protest or
					 activities deemed counter to the government would fall under this ambit.
					 However, even before this legislation came into being there was a politicized
					 element to protests such as those we witnessed in Quebec City.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When students in bandanas and ripped jeans who carry
					 signs are cracked down on by police in a violent and forceful way it causes
					 concern, almost paranoia, in the minds of many. We must be cognizant of that.
					 We must also be cognizant, as was mentioned by the Alliance critic, of the
					 political interference or politicization of RCMP and security measures. We know
					 that the Prime Minister's surrogate son, Jean Carle, involved himself far too
					 heavily in police activity in Vancouver. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a serious concern. It was examined by a judge,
					 Judge Hughes, who came out with strong recommendations and repudiations
					 regarding the RCMP. We cannot ignore such politicization. As was suggested, it
					 calls for a greater firewall between the solicitor general and the commissioner
					 of the RCMP to prevent the guiding hand of the PMO from playing a role in the
					 way security is carried out. Governments sometimes have a vested interest in
					 suppressing that type of activity, as we have seen at the APEC
					 inquiry.</p>


	<A NAME="T1200"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1200"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1200)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would support a list of terrorist organizations and
					 individuals being put together on the recommendation of the solicitor general
					 and an order in council. This would be a legitimate attempt to identify those
					 who have participated in fundraising or any activity that could be connected to
					 terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a list available to be shared among security
					 services would be an important step toward controlling and, it is hoped,
					 preventing action on the part of those enumerated. It would allow for
					 legislative tracking. It would allow for cross-references with various
					 organizations including CSIS, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration,
					 Interpol and other international partners in our security services attempts to
					 curtail terrorist activities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There would be safeguards. Groups that appear on the
					 list could appeal. They could appeal to the solicitor general and the list
					 would be reviewed every two years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more substantive measures in the bill entail
					 changes to the criminal code and the creation of new offences. The criminal
					 code offences would deal with instructing or soliciting support for a person to
					 carry out a terrorist act. Maximum penalties of life imprisonment would be
					 attached to such activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all being done against the backdrop of the
					 horrific events that occurred in the United States on September 11 in various
					 locations including New York City and Washington. With such life altering and
					 life taking implications these criminal code offences take on a poignant
					 meaning. Knowingly facilitating the activities of a terrorist group would be
					 punishable by 14 years. Harbouring a terrorist would be punishable by 10 years.
					 Fundraising for or participating in a terrorist group would be punishable by 10
					 years.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There will be heated debate over the practical
					 implications of Bill C-36. Further definition of what it means to participate
					 may be required. However let us keep it in the proper context. The legislation
					 does not go as far as that of the United Kingdom where even passive support for
					 a terrorist organization can result in criminal charges.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 would allow for and encourage the freezing
					 and seizing of assets of terrorists and their supporters. That is a welcome and
					 necessary step. As has been noted numerous times, assets are the lifeblood that
					 keeps terrorist organizations alive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know they are here in Canada. CSIS has produced a
					 list that clearly identifies 50 terrorist cells operating in the country and
					 350 individuals who are involved in the cells. They are here and they are
					 active. Cutting off their lifeblood of financial assets and resources is one
					 important step in eventually eliminating, curtailing and capturing those who
					 engage in terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing consecutive sentences is a welcome step but
					 it does not address another shortcoming in the criminal code: the anomaly that
					 allows mass murderers to avail themselves of early release. Through provisions
					 of the criminal code they can avail themselves of statutory release. This is
					 one of the ridiculous anomalies that exist in our criminal code. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 would change sentencing provisions to make
					 terrorists ineligible for release until they have served half their sentences,
					 but they could still avail themselves of early release provisions that exist
					 under the National Parole Act and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.
					 There will be further discussion and examination of this at the committee.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone who exhibits such a blatant lack of respect for
					 human life is unlikely to avail themselves of rehabilitation. For that reason I
					 am encouraged by the harsh sentences outlined in Bill C-36. However the parole
					 eligibility may lessen and blunt the instrument of justice in this regard. At
					 the very least there must be a clear and unequivocal statement of denunciation
					 when it comes to terrorist activity.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the anticipated fallout or backlash against
					 Bill C-36 from groups concerned about civil liberties is addressed in the
					 substance of the bill. It calls for the strengthening of laws against hate
					 crimes by punishing the destruction of churches or mosques with sentences of up
					 to 10 years. It would also take steps to make it easier to remove hate
					 propaganda from the Internet. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concerns have been raised about this by Internet
					 service providers, particularly smaller ones who make legitimate efforts to
					 monitor their systems. In many instances service providers do not have the
					 capability or resources to fully complete that task yet they are good corporate
					 citizens. They are concerned that criminal liability will attach to them
					 because they are providers or facilitators of the communication of hate
					 propaganda. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless I endorse the attempt to dissuade anyone
					 from facilitating, aiding or abetting the distribution of hate propaganda. In
					 this heated and extremely troubling time there has been a backlash against
					 certain communities. It is encouraging that the legislation includes provisions
					 to prevent people from lashing out at religious organizations and followers of
					 the Muslim faith who are often the antithesis of those who engage in violence
					 or terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill's amendments regarding the Official Secrets
					 Act are meant to counter espionage by taking into account new computer
					 technologies and the need to fight intelligence gathering activities by foreign
					 powers and terrorist groups. This is a recognition that the means of
					 communication have changed substantially. We need to update ourselves and use
					 new methodologies to monitor new forms of communication. That is what Bill C-36
					 would allow the law enforcement community to do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would also amend the Canada Evidence Act to
					 protect information obtained by foreign intelligence agencies when used in
					 Canadian courts. It would amend the Firearms Act to allow air marshals, mainly
					 from the United States, to fly into Canada. These amendments are a clear common
					 sense recognition that the world we live in has changed substantially and that
					 we need to accommodate changes that have taken place in countries like the
					 United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage all members to support these provisions.
					 Members of the coalition will be reviewing Bill C-36 at the committee level and
					 supporting the majority of them. The bill's provisions would allow police, CSIS
					 and others that provide security to develop a more effective methodology for
					 combating terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My greatest concern, which has been expressed numerous
					 times, is about the resource allocation that would be required to implement
					 these changes. The bill's provisions for new powers of arrest, investigative
					 techniques, investigative hearings and use of warrants would all require
					 additional resources and training. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada
					 has referred to $250 million in new resources. When that is spread out over
					 time and we allow for the bureaucratic assistance that goes with law
					 enforcement, the actual impact on person power and frontline policing will be
					 fairly minimal when one considers the task. We will be pressing the government
					 for more specifics in that regard. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are concerns about the bill's powers of arrest
					 and detention. Those matters will be pressed at the committee level and further
					 meat will be put on the bones with respect to details. If the legislation is
					 enacted it will be up for review in three years. A sunset clause of greater
					 duration may be necessary.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, earlier I put a question to the member for
					 Winnipeg--Transcona and I do not think I expressed it very well so I would like
					 to try it again.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection 83.01(b) defines terrorist activity. It
					 clearly and explicitly would include the kind of violent protest that we saw in
					 Quebec City, the throwing of Molotov cocktails there, as well as whenever
					 leaders from across the world meet at World Trade Organization conferences and
					 there are attacks on police and barriers with the use of violence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the hon. member feel that parliament should
					 endorse this as a definition of terrorist activity in the ambit of this
					 legislation? Is this something we want the bill to catch?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I know my learned colleague has a
					 longstanding interest in human rights and protecting the public when it comes
					 to access to information. Yes, I believe this legislation would very much
					 envelope acts of violence and where the requisite mental element exists for
					 actions that are intended to clearly put people's lives in danger.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government in its wisdom has brought forward a bill
					 that is sufficiently broad to include that activity. Whether it is someone from
					 another country perpetrating an act of violence of the magnitude that we saw on
					 September 11, or whether it is an individual who purposely prepares a weapon or
					 a bomb or engages in a dangerous act, that in my view is terrorism. It is a
					 threat to public security and it has to be dealt with in the harshest and most
					 just but swiftest fashion. I agree that this definition would encompass that
					 type of activity.</p>

					 should be re-examined and put through the rigours of a re-examination in four
					 to five years or basically the life of this government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As demonstrated by the events of September 11, things

					 say that they could not improve in the future with some hope and optimism. To
					 that end, if we are living in a safer, gentler world in years to come there may

					 this heightened sense of awareness of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There should be a sunset clause, particularly for some

	Mr. Speaker, I agree that currently our committee
					 process is somewhat flawed and there is a need to re-examine it. In the short
					 term we will not be able to reconstruct our committees in a way that will
					 address the concerns my colleague raised.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we are dealing with a very specific
					 legislative response to a terrorist act and there is a need to fill legislative
					 gaps. The committee structure could have been expanded to envelope some of the
					 more critical elements of terrorism including immigration and the concerns
					 around border security. All these issues unfortunately will not be touched upon
					 in the current legislation but I suspect there will be future
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned about public knowledge of the bill. It
					 is not currently available on the Internet. The information commissioner does
					 not have a copy. I am sure my friend opposite would share those concerns.
					 Members of the public will have to be given a certain amount of information so
					 that they may digest the impact of the bill, both good and bad. Committees do
					 not always allow for that to happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Committees will be televised in this instance which
					 will provide Canadians with a greater opportunity to see the details of the
					 legislation. We will have to re-examine how these committees work in the future
					 because they have been abused by the government. They have been controlled to a
					 far larger extent than they should be. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individual members, both on the government and the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the themes that keeps coming up is the possible

					 interference. We saw that at APEC. It was clearly identified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation is aimed more at specific acts of

					 to violence themselves. Violence will not solve any problem in this instance.
					 However, when an individual goes out and deliberately engages in dangerous acts
					 such as throwing a firebomb or carrying a weapon, that type of activity should
					 be and is covered by the legislation. I am hoping it will be implemented in a
					 reasonable fashion.</p>

					 (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the
					 member for Parkdale--High Park. I want to begin by saying that I echo the
					 comments made by my colleague opposite. I believe that the time for tolerance
					 of violent protest is at an end because violent protest is a type of terrorist
					 activity. It is designed to intimidate and to disrupt the democratic process.
					 However, I would stress in the same context that we would not want the
					 legislation to interfere with rightful dissent and peaceful protest and I do
					 not believe it does.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to echo the idea of a sunset clause.
					 What is contained in the legislation is so profound, so important and so
					 contrary to the way Canadians would like to see themselves and yet so terribly
					 necessary in the context of international terrorist threats. I hope the
					 government will seriously consider, instead of a statutory review, a sunset
					 clause perhaps after five years, not counting an election year. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that a committee will never examine the
					 issues contained in the legislation in the kind of depth that parliament should
					 examine it. I hope the government will seriously consider that
					 prospect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government may have to separate out from the
					 legislation as a consequence the clauses dealing with the statutory creation of
					 the Communications Security Establishment, and rightly so, because the
					 Communications Security Establishment is a very important institution that
					 pertains to national security and is little known and understood in this
					 country. It ought to be subject to a separate debate in the House. That is
					 something that I would like the government to consider.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important, something that concerns me very
					 specifically, and I sound the alarm, is clause 87 which would change the Access
					 to Information Act. There are other clauses such as clause 103 and clause 104
					 which would change the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents
					 Act and the Privacy Act. These clauses give the Attorney General of Canada the
					 right to issue certificates that prohibit the disclosure of information
					 pertaining to international relations, national defence or security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see the rationale for that. There is certain
					 information in times of crisis that one would want to protect, but the trouble
					 with clause 87 is that it makes an exclusion instead of an exemption from the
					 Access to Information Act. The clauses amend section 69 of the Access to
					 Information Act by adding a further section, section 69.1.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 69 of the Access to Information Act excludes
					 cabinet confidences. It provides for the release of cabinet documents after 20
					 years. By adding section 69.1 after section 69 there is no 20 year release
					 date. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, what happens is that the Attorney
					 General of Canada would be able to exclude information from public view forever
					 with no review, no outside ombudsman or court. No one can see what it is doing.
					 One might argue that since this pertains to international relations and
					 national defence there could be a case made that there are secrets in those two
					 areas that should be kept indefinitely, however not security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 87 enables the government to withhold
					 information pertaining to security issues forever. Mr. Speaker, that is
					 terribly dangerous. That is the excuse that has been used by dictatorships
					 throughout history and around the world. We are talking about police
					 information being withheld forever.</p>


	<A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, we cannot have that. I hope the government
					 will seriously reconsider what it is doing by this particular clause 87 and the
					 ones relating to the other two pieces of legislation. This cannot be. I am sure
					 it is an oversight on the part of the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out, Mr. Speaker, that the Access to
					 Information Act does provide exemptions for security issues and for
					 international relations. An exemption enables a review by the access to
					 information commissioner and by a federal court, which in the interests of
					 democracy I think is a much better situation, but the Access to Information Act
					 is still flawed because these exemptions also withhold information
					 indefinitely. At least there is a review by the courts, but nevertheless, the
					 information can be held under the current legislation indefinitely. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One change I would like to see to the Access to
					 Information Act, which could be put in this legislation, would be that security
					 information, international relations information, defence information, should
					 have some automatic release review, a timeline of, say, 30 years or even 50
					 years. The point is that when we are dealing with the need for government to
					 act in secret, certainly in the public interest when it is acting in secret, we
					 must make sure in a democracy that there is a time for disclosure. Under the
					 current Access to Information Act with an exemption there is no time for
					 disclosure. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation makes the situation even worse because
					 an exclusion makes it impossible for any kind of oversight or review. So, Mr.
					 Speaker, I do hope the government will review its position on that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other areas of the legislation that interest
					 me that I would like to see a little bit more on, such as requiring charities
					 and non-profit organizations to be financially transparent. It is one thing to
					 put up penalties for fundraising for terrorism, but we have to have the
					 mechanisms to see actually how funds are moving. We can see it in a casino.
					 There are mechanisms to track how casinos use money. We cannot see how money is
					 used in charities and especially non-profit organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, charities have to send in a financial
					 information return to Revenue Canada, which is a very incomplete document and
					 anyone can fill it out, but at least it is some kind of information for the
					 public, but when a non-profit organization sends its financial information
					 return to Revenue Canada, it is not a public document. Consequently, there is
					 no transparency whatsoever for a non-profit organization.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The difficulty with this legislation is while it has
					 provisions for lifting the charity registration status, a charity that is
					 raising money for abusive purposes, not just terrorist activity but for
					 laundering money or for organized crime, can just move on to become a
					 non-profit organization and have a higher level of secrecy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are some things that I think should be
					 reviewed by the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also point out, just to go the full circle, the
					 legislation would appear to capture the special interest groups that promote
					 violent activity, like some of the animal rights organizations. I think we will
					 probably hear from them in the course of this debate.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the
					 government's anti-terrorism plan as outlined in Bill C-36, the new
					 anti-terrorism act. The main purpose of the bill is to give us better tools to
					 address and better protect ourselves from terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Minister of Justice noted this morning in the
					 House of Commons, the new legislation contains the following measures: first,
					 measures to identify, prosecute, convict and punish terrorists; second,
					 measures to provide new investigative tools to allow enforcement in national
					 security agencies to better undertake their work; and third, measures to ensure
					 that Canadian values of respect and fairness are preserved and the root causes
					 of hatred are addressed through stronger laws against hate crimes and
					 propaganda. It is these last measures I wish to address today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the apocalyptic events of September 11 the
					 Government of Canada has been firm in its resolve to stand by the values of
					 tolerance, respect and equality. I would like to take this opportunity to
					 remind members of what the Prime Minister said in the House on September 17. He
					 said “Today more than ever we must affirm the fundamental values of every race,
					 every colour, every religion and every ethnic origin”. The Prime Minister also
					 noted on that day that we will not give into temptation in a rush to increase
					 security, to undermine the values that we cherish and which have made Canada a
					 beacon of hope, freedom and tolerance to the world. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember that our plan to fight the
					 rise of terrorism in the world must include action to fight against the rise of
					 intolerance in our midst. Expressions of hate have no place in Canadian
					 society. They undermine the very fundamental values of respect, equality and
					 security and cause damage to a multicultural, tolerant and law-abiding society.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last night the Prime Minister reminded us once again
					 that Canada is a land of immigrants, a place where people from almost every
					 nation and faith on earth have come to find freedom, respect, harmony and a
					 brighter future. Therefore as part of its anti-terrorism act the Government of
					 Canada is proposing changes that address the root causes of hatred, reaffirm
					 Canadian values and ensure that Canada's renowned respect for justice and
					 diversity is reinforced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These measures would include the following: first,
					 amendments to the criminal code that would allow the courts to order the
					 deletion of publicly available hate propaganda from computer systems; second,
					 amendments to the criminal code which would create a new offence of mischief
					 motivated by bias, prejudice or hate committed against a place of religious
					 worship or associated religious property; and third, amendments to be made to
					 the Canadian Human Rights Act to extend the prohibition against hate messages
					 beyond telephone messages to include all communications technologies. I will
					 continue to elaborate on these measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to remember that Canada, along with
					 other like-minded countries, has embarked upon a war against terrorists and
					 terrorism. Unfortunately, because recent acts of terrorism are associated with
					 people of a certain faith, some regrettably and wrongfully view it as a
					 religious war. Osama bin Laden himself, in his pre-taped message the day after
					 the United States attacks, actually called upon the Muslim world. He is the one
					 who is inciting that hatred. More unfortunately, here in Canada some Canadians
					 of Muslim faith have been made the targets of the anger Canadians are feeling
					 against those whom they feel are responsible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time as we take measures to protect
					 ourselves from terrorist activities, we want to ensure that Canadians of any
					 origin do not become a target for hatred. We want to make sure that everyone in
					 the country in all circumstances will continue to enjoy the rights guaranteed
					 by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In this context the right to
					 freedom of religion guaranteed by section 2(a) of the charter takes on
					 particular importance. The criminal code already protects any group
					 distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic origin from statements of
					 hatred directed against them.</p>


	<A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it is an aggravating factor for sentencing
					 purposes when an offence is motivated by hatred. The Canadian Human Rights Act
					 already protects any person from repeat communications by means of
					 telecommunications of any matter that is likely to expose that person to hatred
					 or contempt by reason of this person being identified on the basis of a
					 prohibited ground of discrimination.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I previously noted that the bill includes additional
					 measures to better protect from hatred those who have become vulnerable because
					 they belong to a group distinguished by factors such as race, religion or
					 ethnic origin. The bill would create the offence of mischief motivated by
					 hatred in relation to places of religious worship or objects associated with
					 religious worship found in such a place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The harm done by a mischief against a religious
					 property goes far beyond the physical damage to the property. The greatest harm
					 comes from the message of hatred that is conveyed by the mischief. Such
					 mischief would create fear among worshippers of a specific religion and divert
					 them from the practise of their religion. It is because we recognize these far
					 reaching implications that we want to create an offence of mischief that is
					 related to the purpose of the property damage, regardless of the value of that
					 property.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The offence of mischief in relation to religious
					 property would be a very serious offence. It would be subject to a maximum
					 penalty of 10 years when prosecuted on indictment or 18 months when prosecuted
					 on summary conviction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the government is proposing two provisions
					 that respond to the fact that the Internet is now an easily available and
					 efficient means of communication of hatred. The Canadian Human Rights Act would
					 be amended to clarify that communicating by computer hate messages against a
					 person identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination is a
					 discriminatory practice. In addition to any other penalty, persons found
					 responsible for these messages could be required to cease and desist from this
					 practice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal code would be amended to authorize the
					 court to order deletion of publicly available online hate propaganda when it is
					 stored on a server that is within the jurisdiction of the court. This procedure
					 is independent from prosecution. It would allow the material to be deleted in
					 cases where the person who posted it is unknown or is outside the country. The
					 person who posted the material would be given an opportunity to be heard before
					 the judge would decide to order deletion of the material. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal code already provides for the seizure and
					 forfeiture of copies held for sale or distribution of any publication found by
					 the court to be hate propaganda. This procedure would parallel in the
					 cyberworld a procedure that is available in the material world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Protecting minorities from discrimination and hatred is
					 a value that is well established in Canadian law. For more than 30 years the
					 criminal code has protected from hatred identifiable groups, which are defined
					 as any group distinguished by colour, race, religion or ethnic origin. The
					 communication of statements in a public place inciting hatred against an
					 identifiable group is an offence when it is likely to lead to a breach of the
					 peace. The communication of statements other than in private conversations that
					 wilfully promote hatred against an identifiable group is also an offence.
					 Advocating or promoting genocide, whether in public or in private, is an
					 offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently we have made it an aggravating factor for
					 sentencing purposes when there is evidence that the commission of an offence is
					 motivated by bias, prejudice or hate based on factors such as race, national or
					 ethnic origin, language, colour or religion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For almost 20 years the Canadian Charter of Rights and
					 Freedoms has protected our fundamental liberties and provided for equal
					 protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination based on factors
					 including race, national or ethnic origin, colour or religion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Human Rights Act, which applies to the
					 private sector under federal jurisdiction, prohibits discrimination based on
					 factors that include race, national or ethnic origin or religion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, it is important that we have the legislative
					 means to defend ourselves against terrorists, but it is also equally important
					 that we do that without discriminating against Canadians of minority religion
					 or ethnic origin.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise today to participate in the debate
					 on Bill C-36. As I mentioned in the House a number of weeks ago, this debate
					 should have taken place months ago. Although we commend the government for
					 bringing the legislation forward to parliament, we wonder why the government
					 waited such a long time and why it took such an alarming wake up call to
					 mobilize the government into bringing forth these necessary legislative
					 initiatives to immediately ensure the security and safety of Canadians and of
					 our nation, Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note I quote an article appearing in
					 yesterday's Toronto <i>Star</i> by James Travers. He said: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>As the federal government begins to
						  tear down walls protecting terrorists operating in Canada, it has some dirty
						  little secrets of its own to hide. For years, the Prime Minister's cabinet has
						  been receiving increasingly worrisome reports that this country is a prime and
						  easy target...The evidence is overwhelming that the federal Liberals knew a lot
						  and did very little. In confidential yearly cabinet briefings, in dozens of
						  documents sent to specific government departments and even in some public
						  statements, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) repeatedly warned
						  that Canada, along with the U.S. is among the world's pre-eminent terrorist
						  targets. Those threats were documented in CSIS reports that government sources
						  say became noticeably more specific--and frightening--after 1996. Following a
						  surge in refugees, the intelligence agency identified a lengthening list of
						  organizations and 350 individuals active here...In fact, the federal government
						  should have recognized the threat to this country as far back as June 23, 1985,
						  when Air India Flight 182 was bombed killing 329 passengers and crew. Until the
						  attacks on New York and Washington, that was the most deadly terrorist attack
						  in modern Western history. Now the federal government is desperately trying to
						  respond by bringing forward legislation and introducing security measures that
						  for years have been relegated to the bottom of the agenda. It clearly hopes
						  that the current flurry of activity will somehow mask years of
						  inaction.</small></td>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 18 during our supply day the Canadian
					 Alliance called upon the Liberal government to bring forward anti-terrorist
					 legislation. Within that legislation we asked that there be a provision for the
					 naming of all known international terrorist organizations operating in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance it would appear that Bill C-36 falls
					 short of that recommendation. Subclause 83.05(1) provides for the establishment
					 of a list on which:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>--the
						  Governor in Council may place any entity if, on the recommendation of the
						  Solicitor General, the Governor in Council is satisfied that there are
						  reasonable grounds to believe that (a) the entity has carried out, attempted to
						  carry out, participated in or facilitated a terrorist activity; or (b) the
						  entity is acting on behalf of, at the direction of or in association with an
						  entity referred to in paragraph (a).</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not see anywhere in the legislation authorization
					 for the publication of that list unless I am missing something in the bill,
					 although under subclause 83.05(7) there is authorization for the solicitor
					 general to publish in <i>The Canada Gazette</i> notice of any person no longer
					 a listed entity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Publication of the names of those who are known
					 terrorists or who have terrorist connections would effectively warn lending
					 institutions and others not to do business with those individuals or
					 groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also point out the use of the word may as opposed to
					 the word shall in subsection 83.05(1).</p>


	<A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the word shall effectively there is no
					 obligation for the establishment of a list. Bill C-36 provides discretionary
					 power to the governor in council to set up a list. Furthermore, under clause
					 83.05 there is to be a review of the list two years after the establishment and
					 every two years thereafter to listen and to determine whether there are still
					 reasonable grounds for an entity to be listed. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is the government contemplating delisting a
					 terrorist who, according to the definition carried out, attempted to carry out,
					 participated in or facilitated a terrorism activity? Why has the government
					 suggested the absurd notion that criminal records should not follow a person
					 through life? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In criminal law now we can have a pardon after a number
					 of years. After perhaps five years a person can apply for a pardon, but a
					 terrorist could be delisted after two years after carrying out such atrocious
					 acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 makes participating in, facilitating,
					 instructing and harbouring terrorist groups an indictable offence for which a
					 person is liable to imprisonment for variable maximum terms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I fully support and commend the government for
					 finally proscribing these activities, as it is obligated to do under the UN
					 convention, I would hope it is receptive to amending this section of Bill C-36
					 to provide for minimum sentences. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without a prescribed minimum sentence a person arrested
					 and convicted for knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity could receive a
					 conditional sentence. Clearly the magnitude of any and all forms of terrorist
					 activity warrants a stiff period of incarceration. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to sentencing I would also hope the
					 government is willing to amend clause 83.26 of Bill C-36 to allow for
					 consecutive life sentences. It is absolutely abhorrent to think that a person
					 convicted of a terrorist act in which there were multiple deaths is eligible
					 for parole after 15 years because the Liberal government has repeatedly failed
					 to eliminate section 745 of the criminal code which unjustifiably grants
					 killers a chance at early release.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again at first glance there appear to be no provisions
					 within Bill C-36 allowing for the deportation of alien terrorists. The United
					 States anti-terrorist legislation, which I would like to point out was
					 introduced within eight days of the September 11 attack on America, makes
					 membership in terrorist organizations reason for exclusion from that country.
					 Furthermore, it permits the deportation of aliens if sentenced to more than
					 five years in prison. I would highly recommend that the Canadian government
					 follow suit. In the next couple of weeks as Bill C-36 is moved through
					 committee and as we take a look at it in greater depth, I am sure other
					 omissions will become apparent. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before closing, I encourage the Minister of Justice to
					 stand firm in her resolve to balance the rights of Canadians with their
					 security. I know in the next week the Canadian Bar Association and others may
					 challenge Bill C-36 as going too far and unnecessarily restricting civil
					 liberties. However, the time has come when we must determine whether or not the
					 right of many to be safe and secure justifies an infringement of some basic
					 individual rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A poll conducted between October 2 and 4 by the
					 <i>Globe and Mail</i>, CTV and Ipsos-Reid revealed that 80% of those surveyed
					 were willing to surrender some freedom in exchange for tighter security. A high
					 percentage of respondents would support submitting themselves to providing
					 fingerprints for a national identity card which they would be required to carry
					 at all times and show on request to police or security officials. Fewer, but
					 still a majority, would support letting police stop them at random and search
					 their vehicles without reasonable suspicion that they had committed an
					 offence.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge the minister not to abdicate her responsibility

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for splitting his
					 time. It makes it possible for me to speak earlier in the day rather than
					 later. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the government is taking the right step by
					 moving in the direction of introducing Bill C-36. However, as my colleague
					 asked so clearly, why did it take so long? I also recognize that the bill was
					 probably put together very quickly on very short notice. Apparently people
					 seemed to think there was no need to do anything like this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have legislation that is omnibus in nature and
					 covers a variety of other acts that are to be amended by this bill. Perhaps
					 some of the safeguards that need to be included in the bill have not been
					 thought of or have not been adequately dealt with. I will focus on a couple of
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to a particular phrase that the hon. minister
					 stated in her address to the House earlier this day. It had to do with dealing
					 with the root causes of hatred. Perhaps the issue here is not so much hatred as
					 it is fear.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens in terrorist operations is that terrorists
					 use fear as their weapon. It is one thing to destroy property or to destroy
					 human lives, but hatred is a motivator, as I think we all know and have
					 experienced. It gets the adrenaline flowing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the game of hockey adrenaline can really run high.
					 People do not really hate the opposition, but by golly they sure get boiled up
					 every once in a while and sometimes perhaps there is an element of that. When a
					 player can strike fear into and intimidate the opposite team member, the team
					 member will avoid the other player. Damage does not have to be done because the
					 fear is debilitating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is happening in our country right now is that we
					 are not acting as perhaps we ought to do. The threat of terrorists is to
					 intimidate to the point where it incapacitates the individual. That is a much
					 more subtle effect than simply destroying someone, because it affects everyone.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is one thing to take down two towers in the centre
					 of New York City. It had a terrible effect. We feel very sympathetic to the
					 families involved. However it is affecting all of us. It is affecting our
					 celebrations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Saturday I was at a wedding ceremony where candles
					 had been ordered to be part of the table setting. They were delayed and got
					 there an hour before the reception was to take place. Why? They had been
					 ordered six months ago. They had been held up because of the September 11
					 events in New York City.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every one of us is affected. It does not bother some a
					 great deal, but others are fearful. There are people, for example, today who
					 refuse to get on an airline because of the fear of what will happen to them and
					 whether it is safe to travel. That is the fear I am talking about. That is the
					 effect it has on our economy. I suggest we really look at the effectiveness of
					 terrorist acts at striking fear into the hearts of individuals, rendering them
					 almost incapacitated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will move on to another point. The definition of a
					 terrorist act causes me some concern. I do not think I have time to read
					 everything, but I will refer to the overall section referring to an act that is
					 committed:</p>


	<p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. minister took great pains this morning to
					 emphasize this, so I would like to ask the members as well as the committee
					 members who will meet to discuss the bill to consider the example of what
					 happened in Vancouver when the transit system was incapacitated by a strike for
					 more than six months. It was not the express intention of the union or the
					 group of people that brought about the strike to cause severe difficulty, but
					 the strike did so and it was not unknown that it did.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the intention is the issue but the result is
					 immaterial, I think that to separate them is perhaps misleading. Not only must
					 we intend to do something bad, but if we do something bad whether we intended
					 to or not the act itself becomes a bad one. It is not that this is not what
					 should be done in the act. The caveat here, what ought to be so strong, is that
					 it does not mislead the public and allow certain freedoms to be exercised at
					 the expense of others.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the balance side of this position is the intrusion,
					 if you will, by the power of the state through its police officers and other
					 peace officers to, on the suspicion or belief that a terrorist act is about to
					 be committed, charge and detain someone without particular evidence in place,
					 to simply put someone aside because it is believed that person will be doing
					 something such as intimidating people or destroying property. In some cases it
					 would be correct and I think the police should have that power, but there ought
					 to be clear safeguards as to what kinds of things would support that belief
					 that someone might engage in such activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some things in the bill that ought to be
					 fixed. I do not want the minister to go away from this thinking we are totally
					 opposed to the bill. We are not and I certainly am not, but we ought to be very
					 careful about civil liberties and at the same time not open the door to certain
					 other opportunities that might cause us other difficulties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the time I have left, I would like to make one
					 more point with regard to the operation of CIDA. This morning a column in the
					 <i>National Post</i> written by Diane Francis makes a very interesting case.
					 She asks the question: Should CIDA, a taxpayer funded organization, support
					 organizations like Minga, which is operating in Colombia?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not quite clear. I certainly do not know the
					 details of what is going on there, but the implication of this column is that
					 it is not clear whether Minga is aiding and abetting the operation or the
					 function of three groups: the National Liberation Army, the Revolutionary Armed
					 Force of Colombia or the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Minga is in fact doing that, then it actually is in
					 collaboration with organizations that have been put on the list of terrorist
					 organizations by the United States of America. If she is right we ought to take
					 a very careful and serious look at it. I know the bill suggests that we should
					 not fund any terrorist organizations and I am sure the Government of Canada
					 would never think of doing that, but it could be that unless there is a clear
					 and careful audit of how moneys like those from CIDA, for example, are spent
					 and applied such moneys might find their way into organizations such as
					 these.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really would ask this question and I would ask the
					 minister to ask the Minister of Finance and the minister in charge of CIDA to
					 look at where the money is going, how it is being applied and whether it in
					 fact finds its way indirectly to terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, I would like to suggest that the committee
					 look very carefully at this legislation and that we in parliament support the
					 principle of the legislation, surely, but let us look at the details in such a
					 way as to look after our civil liberties and deal with the real
					 issues.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the member
					 for London--Fanshawe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to speak about our national response, as
					 embodied in the bill, to the events of September 11. In particular I want to
					 talk about parts 1 through 5 as presented in Bill C-36 because I think
					 Canadians expected, wanted and are supporting a toughening, a codification or a
					 creation of a number of new offences that come as a result of a closer
					 examination of terrorist activity in the world. The world is becoming a much
					 more sophisticated place and the means of creating terrorism and chaos in our
					 society, as we have seen, is happening in new and previously unimagined
					 ways.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From that perspective I think Canadians would support
					 us on parts 1 to 5 and at the same time would expect us to move in tandem with
					 other countries, particularly the G-8 and under the banner of the United
					 Nations, which collectively are moving to eradicate those who would create
					 chaos and who in fact are terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would refer to four objectives of the bill,
					 particularly in parts 1 through 5, the criminal provisions of the bill. Those
					 objectives include stopping terrorists from getting into Canada and protecting
					 Canadians from terrorist acts. One is a corollary of the other. Of course to do
					 that police and other security forces need the tools to identify, to prosecute
					 and above all to punish those who would commit these acts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objective would be to prevent the Canada-U.S.
					 border from being held hostage by terrorists and impacting on the Canadian
					 economy. As someone who represents a border community, I can say that what
					 occurred on September 11 has had a very direct impact, and not only on our
					 regional, provincial and national economies, but it has had a very tangible
					 result in terms of lines at the border in both directions, outbound and
					 inbound.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the fourth objective is to work with the
					 international community to bring terrorists to justice and, most important, to
					 address the root causes of such hatred and venom as expressed by these
					 people.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there is great support from the Canadian public
					 for the bill, which would define and designate the terrorist groups and their
					 activities. We would make it an offence to knowingly participate or facilitate
					 the activities of terrorist groups. We would make it an offence to knowingly
					 harbour or hide terrorists. We would create tougher sentences for terrorist
					 offences and tougher parole provisions for terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting off financial support and making that a
					 criminal offence is a very important part of this. Of course as I said at the
					 outset, moving in tandem with other UN signatories to certain provisions and
					 conventions is very important. It is very important that it not be a unilateral
					 action on the part of Canada but in fact a collective action of many
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again I will say that I think the public knows and
					 expects that we have to make it easier in certain very specific conditions for
					 authorities, those being police forces, the local forces or RCMP or CSIS or
					 whatever, to collect the kind of evidence that is necessary. It is necessary to
					 have electronic surveillance. It is necessary in certain very limited cases to
					 compel disclosure of information that may be held by people. It is also
					 necessary to amend the Canada Evidence Act so that we can collect information
					 and not disclose it in a public forum that would be detrimental to the
					 country.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians are fully supportive of all of those
					 provisions. I also think the bill contains an excellent provision, the three
					 year review provision, because we are caught in the middle of a whole series of
					 events which assume a particular state of mind both nationally and
					 internationally. We do not know the nature, the extent or the duration of this
					 matter, so we have enacted laws which are fitting and proper under the current
					 circumstances. At the same time the three year review allows us to consider the
					 effect of these laws and the conditions in three years' time so that we may
					 determine then whether these laws are enough, too much or not enough. It is
					 very important that laws be considered in a timeframe, both current and short
					 term, but not entrenched forever. In that respect I know that Canadians are
					 quite supportive of this, that they expect it and support it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I would now like to talk about is what is referred
					 to as part 6 of the bill because we have heard a great deal of talk about
					 balancing rights, a lot of talk about the charter and a lot of talk about rules
					 of natural justice. I want to point out that part 6 is not about criminal law
					 but civil law. It is about, in this international year of the volunteer, those
					 people who have another element to them, that is, they wish to help others,
					 whether in this country or in other countries. It is about the provision of
					 charitable acts by people in this country to those both in and out of this
					 country. Let us be clear about part 6. It is not about criminal law. It is
					 about civil law and it is about charities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have heard a great deal of talk about the rules of
					 natural justice, one of which is this one: Who is my accuser, who is making an
					 accusation against me, what is being said specifically against me and do I have
					 the right to question and to meet that person making the accusation? I point
					 out to members present that part 6 was before the House prior to the summer
					 recess. At that time it was called Bill C-16. It was referred to a committee of
					 the House after first reading. I would point out, far be it from me to say,
					 that it was widely rejected by that committee. It was not a question of one
					 party rejecting it. It was a question of everyone on that committee being
					 disturbed by it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some excellent points were made before that committee
					 in terms of what part 6 is about, so as the bill proceeds from the House to the
					 justice committee I would invite the committee to revisit what was said about
					 part 6. All Canadians will support parts 1 to 5, but I think part 6 has some
					 disturbing elements, the principal point being that when one examines that
					 provision one sees that nobody would know who is making the accusation, what
					 specifically is being said or in fact who is saying it. It would be fed through
					 the sieve called CSIS, which would then provide a summary of perhaps what was
					 said, or more properly, of what the allegations were, but little or no
					 detail.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would have dire consequences for those people in
					 this country with a long tradition of helping others, and this is international
					 year of the volunteer. Part 6 does not meet that fundamental rule of the rules
					 of natural justice, that is, who is making the accusation, what is being said
					 and do I have the right to meet that person and question them? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would also point out that part 6 of this law
					 imposes an absolute liability on a charity.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has nothing to do with anyone's intention. One can
					 imagine some very innocent occurrences where people believe they are doing the
					 right thing when in fact, through misfortune or lack of attention, the money is
					 diverted to somebody who has less than honourable intentions quite innocently
					 by those paying it. Effectively, the result under part 6 would be the end of
					 that charitable cause. That is unfortunate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the bill goes to committee, I would ask that the
					 members pay very close attention to part 6 and all the provisions thereof.

	Mr. Speaker, as my hon. friend opposite is a lawyer,
					 does he think there is anything in the bill which would tarnish our bill of
					 rights? Is it possible that the individual rights of society could supersede
					 the safety and protection of the entire nation?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am really concerned about the latter. Do our

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, in many respects we are moving into
					 uncharted waters. These are exceptional times. Certainly the objective of the
					 bill is the security and safety of our country and of individuals
					 therein.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member will know that there are portions of the
					 bill which in another time were never contemplated because it was deemed there
					 was never any need for such types of laws. In terms of the criminal law, the
					 events of September 11 have certainly turned the tide so that the rights of the
					 collective, the safety of the collective and the safety of the nation are being
					 brought forward and will supersede.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I would refer to the section where a
					 person might be, for all intents and purposes, arrested without charges and
					 held for 24 hours prior to being taken before a judge. If we were to suggest
					 that to be the case, six weeks ago people would have said that we could not do
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if we look at it in terms of the events and of
					 the public mood, the public opinion and the culture of the world today, that is
					 not seen in light of those horrendous acts of September 11 as being an
					 unreasonable provision for public safety and protection. In that respect, where
					 otherwise criminal law parts 1 to 5 are applicable, the public is
					 there.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to think that judges do not live in a
					 vacuum. They are quite aware of the climate, although it could be argued that
					 sometimes they are not. However, certainly because of the greater beliefs,
					 fears and apprehension of people today, judges would see this as a reasonable
					 provision for public safety.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from across the way

					 deterrent values, or at least the potential deterrent values, built into this
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of the new classifications for criminal
					 terrorist activities or advising others to commit terrorist activities, now
					 bring with them the potential for life imprisonment in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my colleague believe that this type of deterrent
					 would be successful with terrorists who clearly have shown in the past no
					 appreciation for the value of human life? In particular, we might need to look
					 at legislation that would more speedily extradite and/or deport individuals
					 back to their countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many people would view life imprisonment in Canada's
					 prisons as a step up from what they are used to in their home countries.
					 Therefore, I am a little concerned whether the deterrents would provide the
					 effect for which we are looking.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, that is a very interesting question. The
					 corollary is that if we had previously apprehended the 19 who commandeered
					 those planes and killed those hundreds of people and said that we were
					 returning them to their country of origin, that would not have been a
					 deterrent, as I see it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we say to people who are capable of overriding
					 the very natural instinct to live and survive by committing mass suicide among
					 themselves? There is an element in all of this that is relative and that is
					 that any kind of punishment, whether it is in Canada or in some other country,
					 is of no consequence to them whatsoever. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill aims not only to address those who commit the
					 acts but also those who support the network people. Obviously the 19 did not
					 act as a collective of 19 or as 19 solo acts. There was some cohesion to that
					 group which meant there were support operatives either in the United States or,
					 as has been suggested, in Europe. It is to get at those people who are the real
					 threat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do we do with people who are willing to commit
					 suicide? No number of threats of any kind will prevent that.</p>

					 to the Minister for International Trade, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague from Sarnia--Lambton
					 gave us a pretty good explanation of this legislation. I enjoyed listening to
					 his comments. I am pleased to join the debate today on Bill C-36, which will
					 put the government's anti-terrorism plan into place.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite clearly the bill is aimed at terrorist
					 organizations and it seeks to strengthen the investigation, prosecution and
					 prevention of terrorist activities at home and abroad. The bill has two primary
					 objectives: to stop terrorists from getting into Canada and to protect
					 Canadians from terrorist acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has been fortunate to have a very peaceful
					 history, unlike our neighbour to the south. September 11 is one more horrible
					 example of that, but it has probably made Canadians question if we will
					 continue to have a peaceful history without threat. We know now that Canada is
					 in a position of being threatened. Our safety and security as a nation and as
					 individual citizens of this nation have been threatened. It is important that
					 the bill be in place to help protect Canadians from any possible terrorist
					 acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill brings forward the tools necessary to
					 identify, prosecute, convict and punish terrorists. As my colleague from
					 Sarnia--Lambton noted, the bill seeks to prevent the Canada-U.S. border from
					 being held hostage or under threat by terrorists, which would have a very
					 deleterious effect on the Canadian economy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I have been working with the Minister for
					 International Trade, this brings home much more clearly the importance of the
					 Canadian--American border in our trading relationship. We see that nowhere more
					 clearly than in southwestern Ontario.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my home community of London, Ontario, people
					 regularly cross the American border either at Sarnia Port Huron or
					 Windsor-Detroit. It is as simple as going to see a ball game or a hockey game
					 and returning that same evening. Thousands of people cross the border daily to
					 go to work. There is also an enormous amount of trade across those two border
					 points.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to reflect on the fact that the twoway trade
					 between Canada and the United States now stands at $1.4 billion every day of
					 the year. We need to reflect on the fact that there are some 250 million
					 crossings at the border by individuals, be it for recreational purpose or
					 work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important the legislation be in place to
					 restore the confidence that has been somewhat shaken in Canadians and
					 Americans. They want to continue to live in a society that has been free and
					 open. The openness of our border is a good example of that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is very important that all these steps be
					 taken to re-establish the confidence that we normally have had between our two
					 countries, where individuals can travel and move safely across the borders and
					 where business can continue in an unhindered way. The statistics I just
					 mentioned show the enormity of this two way trade. Something like 87% of our
					 exports go to the United States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill creates a situation whereby Canada will be
					 working with the international community to bring terrorists to justice and to
					 address the root causes of such hatred. In that regard I want to put forward a
					 suggestion for the minister's consideration and I intend to take this up with
					 her individually.</p>


	<A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suggestion comes from leaders in my own community,
					 particularly Muslim leaders in London, Ontario, who consistently condemn the
					 terrorist attacks of September 11. They have proposed the idea that perhaps
					 Canada is an ideal country to host an international forum on terrorism. Perhaps
					 we are the perfect country to say that we should, as an international
					 community, gather and discuss the terrorist threat and discuss very basic
					 questions like who is a terrorist and what is the proper definition of a
					 terrorist. There have been some very famous people in history who have been
					 considered terrorists. Nelson Mandela was considered a terrorist in his own
					 country and he went on to lead his nation. He is obviously one of the
					 outstanding individuals in history in recent times. This suggestion has some
					 merit. Perhaps Canada would be well advised to take a lead in looking at the
					 whole issue of terrorism and working with our international partners. I am
					 happy to put that suggestion on the record and I will pursue it individually
					 with the appropriate persons.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed anti-terrorism act includes measures to
					 identify, prosecute, convict and punish terrorists. These include: defining and
					 designating terrorist groups and activities to make it easier to prosecute
					 terrorists and those who support them; making it an offence to knowingly
					 participate in or contribute to or facilitate the activities of terrorist
					 groups or to instruct anyone in how to do any of those activities; making it an
					 offence to knowingly harbour a terrorist; creating tougher sentences and parole
					 provisions for terrorist offences; cutting off the financial support of
					 terrorist groups; making it an offence to knowingly collect funds for or
					 contribute funds to any such group. It would also ratify the two UN
					 anti-terrorism conventions, the international convention for the suppression of
					 the financing of terrorism and the international convention for the suppression
					 of terrorist bombings, as well as the safety of United Nations and associated
					 personnel convention. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe Canadians overwhelmingly support the
					 legislation and the need for it. Some valid concerns have been raised.
					 Certainly they have been raised with me, about the fact that we do not slip in
					 a draconian series of measures that would somehow infringe unnecessarily on our
					 rights as individuals. I think the bill strikes the proper balance between the
					 need to fight terrorism and the need to protect of our civil liberties.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has several safeguards which I will mention
					 briefly. There will be a parliamentary review of the anti-terrorism legislation
					 in three years. As the Prime Minister noted in his speech last night, the
					 minister is committed to requesting and supporting such a review sooner if it
					 is deemed to be warranted. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly defining provisions so that they are targeted
					 at terrorists and terrorist groups would allow obviously legitimate political
					 activism and protest which are so much a part of our democracy and which we
					 witness every day outside on the steps and the lawns of parliament. I am very
					 proud as a Canadian that I see those groups. I do not see them as a nuisance.
					 They are here demonstrating peacefully about causes that are important to them.
					 They cover everything from an individual priest here day after day expressing
					 his strong pro-life views to groups like the Falun Gong. They have been out
					 there recently demonstrating about activities they feel are discriminating
					 against them in China. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that we have this balance and that
					 the safeguards are there. They are important and good safeguards. The burden of
					 proof, the onus, is on the state, as it should be. In other words an individual
					 would still be innocent until proven guilty even if he or she is accused of a
					 terrorist activity. That is fundamental to our democracy. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other safeguards built into the legislation
					 that I do not have time to enumerate right now. Suffice it to say that I think
					 the bill is very important. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that my constituents overwhelmingly support the

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great interest to the
					 remarks of the member opposite.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the context in which we now find ourselves, it is
					 not easy to criticize such a bill, but my duty as a parliamentarian does compel
					 me to point out that the only acts of terrorism I have ever known in my entire
					 life in Canada were committed by the RCMP. They burned barns. An RCMP officer
					 had a bomb explode in his hands on the steps of the Steinberg family residence.
					 I recall this incident, which took place in 1970. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Law enforcement officers running wild are very
					 dangerous. While full of good intentions, this bill fails totally to provide a
					 control mechanism or structure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just days ago, we received some 150 recommendations
					 from the Canadian Police Association. If we were to grant their request, you
					 and I both, Mr. Speaker, would be stuck in some holding tank, in a glass
					 enclosure, and stripped of our individual freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that it is the nature of police work to
					 exercise control over just about anything that moves. Policing, we are told, is
					 a necessary evil, but parliamentarians must not be too easily swayed by these
					 kinds of claims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill to combat terrorism lacks controls. It is
					 permanent. Yes, it is up for review in three years. Does the member not think
					 that when those three years are up it should be extended by a vote in
					 parliament rather than continuing in force forever, as long as parliament has
					 not recalled it? I would recommend the opposite approach. This is a very
					 dangerous bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even in its wildest dreams, the Canadian Police
					 Association never dared hope it would be given so many powers in a single
					 document as it would be with this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the member not see a certain threat to individual
					 freedoms in this, despite the good intentions?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am absolutely dumbfounded to hear any
					 member of parliament, but particularly one from the province of Quebec, tell me
					 that he has no recollection of terrorist activities in Canada except for those
					 of the RCMP. That is absolutely incredible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would suggest that the hon. member talk to the family
					 of the Hon. Pierre Laporte and hear what their views are about the absolutely
					 incredible statement he just made. I cannot believe it. I will not go into a
					 full explanation of the 1970 FLQ crisis and the murder of Pierre Laporte. I do
					 not need to do that, although I certainly could. I am afraid I would probably
					 become quite annoyed if I did that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to answer the hon. member's question. He is
					 proposing a built-in sunset clause or a clause that would automatically cause
					 the bill to no longer be in effect at the end of three years. I do not think
					 that is a very good idea at all. It is unnecessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, the Parliament of Canada, which the hon.
					 member was elected to and is a part of, can achieve that in any number of other
					 ways that are already in existence. The bill can be revoked.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister in his speech last night very
					 clearly indicated that although the bill calls for a parliamentary review
					 automatically at three years, the government is open to a review sooner if it
					 is deemed wise by parliament to do that. There is no intention of having some
					 never ending bill that cannot be reviewed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite the hon. member to come over and have a
					 discussion. I will tell him the rest of the story about the FLQ crisis which he
					 conveniently ignored.</p>

					 (Berthier--Montcalm, BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I think that parliament has before it, as
					 we often say, an exceedingly important bill. I really think it is the most
					 important bill the House of Commons will pass. This bill responds to an event
					 that occurred on September 11 and to much more than that as well. The bill, the
					 way it is drafted at the moment, goes perhaps a bit too far.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me explain. If there is one thing we must make sure
					 of it is that the House does not improvise in passing the bill, not with a bill
					 like this one. We must take time to examine every angle of the bill. As many
					 people as possible and the experts must be consulted in order to produce a law
					 that meets our objective of fighting terrorism effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacks on New York and Washington must certainly
					 not change anything in the way we live and do things in Canada, but neither,
					 given that the laws are passed here, must anything be changed in Quebec's
					 approach either. To succeed in getting us to change and alter our practices
					 would be the supreme victory for the terrorists. They would know we are afraid
					 and would change the way we live and deprive our fellow citizens of their
					 freedoms in exchange for security on paper. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our reactions and attitudes we must look primarily
					 for balance between heightened security measures and the need to keep freedom
					 in the central and vital space it occupies in our society. We must protect
					 ourselves, but we must also be aware of the fact that liberty will always be
					 fragile whatever we do and whatever legislation we may pass in this House so
					 long as there are men and women prepared to die for a cause and through hatred.
					 No legislation will be able to stop them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can, however, have legislation that will enable us
					 to prevent attacks such as the those that have recently taken place. We can
					 have a bill that will help us gather information on terrorists, on the people
					 we really want to target with such a piece of legislation, but caution is
					 required.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not have just any old law to stop such people.
					 Legislation is needed, but not at the expense of our collective and individual
					 rights and freedoms. Sacrificing our freedom would in fact be capitulation,
					 because freedom is, more than anything else, what defines life in a democracy.
					 The choices we will be making are not, therefore, only choices for security,
					 they are choices for society. Such choices, informed choices, cannot be made
					 overnight. A sense of balance must inform our analysis of Bill C-36.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the present time, looked at as a whole I believe the
					 bill's purpose is laudable. The bill as a whole will be applied in conjunction
					 with other existing Canadian statutes. The criminal code will continue to
					 apply, as will the anti-gang legislation. Hon. members will recall that Bill
					 C-24, now in the other place awaiting royal assent, enables police officers to
					 commit illegal acts. </p>


	<A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the anti-gang legislation and this bill, Bill
					 C-36, which amends over 20 Canadian statutes and a series of regulations, the
					 powers of the police force appear out of balance with the liberties we
					 enjoy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know it is not mentioned in the bill, but at some
					 point the police, thanks to the anti-gang legislation, will be able to commit
					 illegal acts under the law and perhaps break it. This was certainly not the
					 government's aim, but we must not lose sight of the fact that these two laws
					 apply concurrently. Neither blocks the other.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By allowing a police officer to act illegally under
					 Bill C-24, we cannot be sure he will not use this part of the act to do things
					 that are illegal under Bill C-36. Yet he would be justified in doing so for
					 purposes of national security. Is this just rhetoric on my part? I hope
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think it is rhetoric to say that because it is
					 important to watch what is going on and to try to produce the best legislation.
					 I think this is what the people of Canada and Quebec expect of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A look at the federal government's anti-terrorism plan
					 and its objectives reveals four major objectives. There is no reason to oppose
					 them. Perhaps the way it goes about achieving them in the legislation gives us
					 the right, in a country like ours, to question them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first objective is to prevent terrorists from
					 entering Canada and to protect Canadians against acts of terrorism. I have no
					 problem with this objective. I would certainly not defend the terrorists or say
					 that their rights were protected under the Canadian Charter of Rights and
					 Freedoms. I was saying on the subject of gangsterism and organized crime, that
					 it is not true the charter exists to protect them. I say the same thing about
					 terrorists. However, the rights and freedoms honest people enjoy at the moment
					 must not be denied them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second objective involves providing the tools to
					 identify terrorists, bring them to justice, sentence them and punish them. This
					 needs no explanation and there is no doubt that we support this
					 objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third objective is to prevent the Canada-U.S.
					 border from being taken hostage by terrorists, which would have repercussions
					 on the Canadian economy. That is obvious. Moreover, this is not the first time
					 the Bloc Quebecois has questioned the work being done by customs officials on
					 the borders of Canada and Quebec.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as money laundering is concerned, for at least
					 five or six years now the Bloc Quebecois has been saying over and over that the
					 borders between Canada and the United States are as full of holes as a sieve
					 and that Canada enjoys the wonderful international reputation of being a
					 country where money laundering is easy and where there may be the least
					 monitoring of this. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that this is being corrected. I know that we
					 have not been a voice crying out unheard in the wilderness for those five or
					 six years. I know that the government has amended some laws in response to
					 overtures by the Bloc Quebecois. I know that as far as Bill C-36 is concerned
					 the criminal code is also being amended, with a far more specific objective:
					 terrorist groups. This is a good thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not, however, think that the wake up call of the
					 events of September 11 was necessary for this to happen. Actions could have
					 been taken back when we started talking about the situation, back when we began
					 to address the problem represented by Canadian customs and the Canada-U.S.
					 border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final objective is to work with the international
					 community to bring terrorists to justice and address the root causes of their
					 hatred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see that these are four praiseworthy objectives.
					 On that basis one could not be opposed to a bill to implement provisions to
					 attain those objectives. </p>


	<A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the questions that arise have to do with the
					 text we have before us. The bill is more than 170 pages in length and contains
					 dozens, even hundreds, of amended sections and expanded definitions regarding
					 the threat to national security among other things. There are increased powers
					 conferred to some members of the cabinet. The Minister of Justice, the
					 Solicitor General of Canada and the Minister of National Defence would all have
					 increased powers when it comes to electronic surveillance, for example. They
					 would be able to decide if an individual will be monitored. It is the minister
					 who would be responsible for the final decision. Have they gone too far? That
					 is a tough question.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are we asking enough tough questions? I hope that the
					 Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, and I emphasize the words human
					 rights, will do just that in a calm manner with all the time it needs and that
					 this bill will be carefully examined. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canada had pursued these four objectives by
					 ratifying international treaties that it has already signed, by making them
					 law, then in all probability I would not be standing here right now giving a 20
					 minute speech on this subject. In order to attain its four objectives, the
					 government included two conventions in this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first one is the international convention for the
					 suppression of the financing of terrorism. It freezes terrorists' assets by
					 preventing the use of assets belonging to a person who is involved in terrorist
					 activities and in preventing the provision of property and financial or other
					 related services to terrorists. These measures enable a Federal Court judge to
					 order the freezing or seizure of property used to support terrorist
					 activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the convention that had been signed but never
					 had force of law in Canada. This convention is included in Bill
					 C-36.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to achieve the objectives I outlined earlier,
					 there is no problem with this approach and I applaud the government on this.
					 Indeed, the government should have done this before September 11. This was its
					 responsibility. It failed when it came to implementing the international
					 convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frankly, I imagine that the Canadian Security
					 Intelligence Service knew before September 11 that there were people raising
					 funds for terrorism in Canada. I certainly hope it knew. If it did not, I have
					 my doubts about the effectiveness of the Canadian Security Intelligence
					 Service. If it did, why was it waiting to tell somebody? If it did pass the
					 information along, why did the solicitor general or the Minister of Justice do
					 nothing when a convention had been signed to that effect? There is a problem
					 somewhere.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other convention is the international convention
					 for the suppression of terrorist bombings. This convention contains provisions
					 on the targeting of places of public use, government facilities, infrastructure
					 and transportation systems for attacks using explosives or other lethal
					 devices, including chemical or biological agents. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, I hope that the Canadian Security
					 Intelligence Service was on some sort of trail in Canada while groups were on
					 Canadian soil and had certain similar objectives. It is perhaps not as clear as
					 in the first convention, but I hope that CSIS, with the millions of dollars,
					 close to a billion, which it regularly receives to manage its affairs, had a
					 good idea of what was going on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two conventions are therefore implemented by Bill
					 C-36. Once again we have no problem with this.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is one point about which we have some legitimate
					 concerns and I think that anyone interested in individual and collective rights
					 and freedoms must share those concerns.</p>


	<A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large number of sections in the criminal code are
					 amended and many new ones are added to deal with terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I invite hon. members to read the definition of
					 terrorist activity; it is not a simple definition. It refers to ten conventions
					 that Canada signed and implemented over the years. It is a definition that
					 makes reference to other sections, to international conventions, to a large
					 number of possibilities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism as such is not defined, just like the federal
					 government refused to define the notion of criminal activity--</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> Gangsterism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur:</b> Yes, gangsterism. The
					 bill defines terrorist activity by referring to conventions. About terrorism or
					 terrorist activity it says that it is as an act committed for “a political,
					 religious or ideological purpose”, which threatens the public and national
					 security because it “is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to a
					 person”, “to endanger a person's life”, “to cause substantial property damage”,
					 and might “cause serious bodily harm” as a result of “serious interference with
					 or serious disruption of an essential service, facility or system”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is just one part of the definition. I did not
					 mention the ten conventions that make reference to certain definitions of what
					 may constitute a terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the part of the definition that I mentioned
					 deserves a closer look. More than ten or fifteen minutes are necessary before
					 adopting this clause. Experts are required, and no one in this House has the
					 expertise to really be able to say whether or not this is going too far.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be members who have some expertise, but it is
					 tinted by the party line of their political formations, and that includes
					 myself, so outside experts are required to take a hard look at these
					 definitions and tell us if we are right to be concerned about a possible
					 violation of certain freedoms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could discuss this issue for a long time. I could
					 talk about such a bill for hours, but since time is always a consideration I
					 will deal with the core of the issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point that raises concerns is the whole
					 question of electronic surveillance. Under the criminal code it is possible to
					 use electronic surveillance by obtaining a warrant if surveillance is carried
					 out for a specific time period, but the person being monitored must
					 subsequently be informed of the fact. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now all of this has been turned upside down. The
					 monitoring period has been extended. The minister now has direct input. It will
					 all be very vague. The way it will really operate is unclear. We do not know
					 what limits there will be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When more powers are granted to the police, as is the
					 case here, whether it be preventive arrests, arrests without a warrant, or the
					 Attorney General of Canada suspending the Access to Information Act whenever he
					 pleases if he believes that national security is threatened and there is no one
					 to oversee what he is doing, no one to question the minister's decision, this
					 is of concern to me. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that this law would not be reviewed for three
					 years is also cause for concern in my opinion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why does the minister, and this is the question I asked
					 her yesterday in the House, not promise to have this law reviewed or make it
					 possible to have this law reviewed by the Standing Committee on Justice and
					 Human Rights after one year? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With everything that is happening on the national and
					 international scene, I am convinced that following its adoption Bill C-36 will

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with a great deal of interest
					 to the speech of my friend and colleague, the hon. member for
					 Berthier--Montcalm. I believe that the Minister of Justice, the government
					 opposite and all the members of this House should pay attention to what he
					 said. We can only recognize his professionalism in reviewing the young
					 offenders bill, the anti-gang legislation and the other bills introduced by the
					 Minister of Justice. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our justice critic is concerned, as are an increasing
					 number of people, by the haste surrounding the tabling of this bill. Yes, there
					 is some urgency in this context of real terrorism, but there are also
					 considerations relating to this bill that deserve our attention. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to ask the hon. member for
					 Berthier--Montcalm if, in his opinion it could be risky to pass this bill
					 quickly. The government is saying it is a matter of days and hours. Should we
					 take time to consult experts to make sure that this bill is everything we want
					 it to be?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, this is a very important matter and I
					 believe that in such a matter, improvisation, fear, haste and rushed action are
					 all ill-advised. We must take the time to examine this extraordinary bill. I
					 believe that a bill of its kind is rarely passed in a parliament such as
					 ours.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is first and foremost is that we must not
					 improvise. We must pass a piece of legislation that attempts to maintain a
					 degree of balance between national security and individual and collective
					 rights and freedoms. The drawbacks must be addressed. As the bill is worded at
					 this time, I believe that these run contrary to certain rights and freedoms.
					 Our sights must be readjusted. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does please me, and at the same time reassures me,
					 is that yesterday the Prime Minister said that the committee would examine this
					 question and listen to what people have to say and that it will be empowered to
					 amend those clauses which go too far or involve goals the government is not
					 interested in attaining. For instance, one or more of the definitions contained
					 in the bill might affect the labour movement and those taking part in illegal
					 walkouts. I do not believe that the objective of this bill is to consider them
					 as terrorist groups. All that needs doing is to review the definition and
					 perhaps tighten it up a bit, bringing it more in line with the objective, which
					 is to combat terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not something that can be done overnight.
					 Pushing the bill through at full speed is not the way to do it. We must take
					 our time. Time is something we have here in this House, as well as in the
					 Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, to examine this bill along with
					 specialists and people who are used to working with the charter of rights and
					 freedoms and similar legislation. We will then be able to shape legislation
					 that is more acceptable and that particular strikes a balance between national
					 security and individual and collective rights and freedoms. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, dystonia is a neurological disorder that
					 can disable its victims with painful and involuntary muscle spasms. Sadly the
					 cause of dystonia remains a mystery. This little known disease often goes
					 undiagnosed in patients causing them deep psychological distress, emotional
					 withdrawal and isolation from the rest of society.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately the families and friends of those who
					 suffer from this devastating disorder have formed the Dystonia Medical Research
					 Foundation. The purpose of the foundation is to create a greater awareness of
					 dystonia, to discover the cause of the disease and to eventually find a
					 cure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In support of this dedicated group, I ask my colleagues
					 in the House to join me in proclaiming the week of October 14 to 21 to be
					 National Dystonia Awareness Week. During this time we call upon all Canadians
					 to learn more about dystonia, how to recognize its symptoms and how to treat
					 those who suffer from the disorder. The more we understand about dystonia, the
					 closer we are to the cure.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two children have endured a great deal of

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His ideas, which are now widely embraced, were in 1995

					 with him.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In government, despite extreme and sometimes violent

					 refreshing that a leader would keep his word. In 1999 he was rewarded for this
					 with a new mandate.</p>

					 Canada committed themselves to cutting by half the number of hungry people by
					 2015. This November governments, NGOs and other international agencies will
					 meet to review the progress made and consider ways to accelerate efforts to
					 reach this goal.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, October 16 is the 20th anniversary of
					 Canada Post. While Canadians give Canada Post a passing grade in general, it
					 gets a big fat F for failure when it comes to its treatment of its rural route
					 mail couriers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These couriers are the only group of workers in the
					 country who are specifically barred from any of the basic rights that all
					 employees are guaranteed in Canada. Subsection 13(5) of the Canada Post
					 Corporation Act denies rural route mail couriers the right to vacations,
					 statutory holidays, pensions, employment insurance, Canada pension plan, health
					 and safety legislation, or the right to free collective bargaining that all
					 Canadians enjoy under the charter.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should mark the 20th anniversary of Canada Post by
					 fixing this historic injustice once and for all. The government should delete
					 subsection 13(5) of the act and give these hardworking Canadians the rights
					 that all Canadian workers enjoy.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to
					 pay tribute to Judge Michael Sheehan, who yesterday received the Maurice
					 Champagne rights and freedoms award from the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de
					 Montréal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devastated by the death of his son, this courageous and
					 very wise father decided to become involved by being there to listen to the
					 distress of others and making a remarkable contribution to suicide prevention
					 efforts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he speaks, Judge Sheehan reminds us that human
					 life is what we hold most dear and that in fact people contemplating suicide do
					 not want to die but just end their suffering.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This suffering is on the increase. Every day in Quebec
					 there are 250 suicide attempts, five of which are fatal. In 1999, 316 women and
					 over 1,200 men lost their life in this tragic manner.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Judge Sheehan's contribution to the prevention of
					 suicide in Quebec is, of course, invaluable but his message is inspiring as
					 well and helps to demystify this sad reality.</p>

					 engaging communities in a variety of activities and dialogues around violence
					 and its prevention. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year 33,600 children, youth and adults
					 participated in hundreds of these activities at over 300 schools in 600
					 communities. With the publicity it received the message of the YWCA's Week
					 Without Violence reached over five million Canadians. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As one of the largest and oldest women's service
					 organizations in Canada, the YWCA is Canada's largest provider of shelters to
					 women and children. It has been its longstanding commitment to bring an end to
					 all forms of violence. I thus encourage all Canadians and parliamentarians to
					 play their part in ensuring that the Week Without Violence will last all year

					 Initiative by announcing stable, ongoing funding of $7 million
					 annually.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to federal leadership and with the help of a
					 national network of devoted partners, we are working to reduce the incidence
					 and mortality of breast cancer and to improve the quality of life of women

					 (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, on October 4 the Minister of Transport
					 appeared before the transport committee. In the course of his opening
					 presentation he referred to a ministerial directive he had written requesting
					 that cockpit doors of Canadian aircraft be locked for the duration of the
					 flight.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I advised him I had flown on Canadian aircraft since
					 the time the directive had apparently been written and had seen cockpit doors
					 open on several occasions. The minister's response to that was that “On the
					 question of cockpit doors, I have to say that if you have been on flights where
					 this is the case, you have an obligation as a member of parliament to report
					 that to me or my officials, the date, the time”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further asked the minister if he would be willing to
					 table any ministerial directives issued to the department on airport security
					 since September 11. His response to this request was as follows, that “Most
					 government documents are available under access to information. If we can make
					 them available to you, we will”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is not acceptable. On one hand the minister is
					 stating that I have an obligation as a member of parliament to report any
					 observations I make that contravene his directives. On the other hand he is
					 advising me that I would have to rely on access to information to find out what
					 that directive is. This is not unlike the situation that occurred in the case
					 of Bill C-36 which is now before the House. The government provided information
					 to the media before providing that same information to MPs. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of the minister's departmental directives,
					 he states that we need to report observed breaches of his directives without
					 ever having been informed by the government of their existence. In such cases
					 we are to rely on material acquired from access to information, and if we are,
					 how are we to know that the material even exists to ask for or what we are
					 supposed to ask for? Does the minister expect us to rely on reports in the
					 media, which is how we got our initial information on Bill C-36?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I submit that the minister, by creating directives
					 which he then claims MPs have an obligation to be in compliance with and by not
					 providing those directives to MPs, has caused a breach of parliamentary
					 privilege in that he has created an obligation for specific performance by MPs
					 and then prevented MPs from fulfilling that obligation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask that this be remedied by requiring the Minister
					 of Transport to table all ministerial directives issued to his department on
					 airport security since September 11.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I have just become aware of this so-called
					 question of privilege from my colleague from Kootenay--Boundary--Okanagan. He
					 is misplaced by raising this as a question of privilege. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that in committee at the time he offered the
					 fact, in response to the discussion about cockpit doors being ordered closed
					 pursuant to regulation under the Aeronautics Act, that he had many occasions
					 where pilots were not obeying us. I said to him that he had an obligation, as
					 did any citizen, when they saw the law transgressed or if they suspected the
					 law was being transgressed, to report it to the appropriate authorities. I
					 would think that he should not contest that. That particular directive was well
					 publicized.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told the hon. member that we would make information
					 available to him, as we do for committees in general. However, if he requires
					 items that go beyond the scope of a particular discussion in a committee, he is
					 free to use the access to information remedy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He is mixing apples and oranges. He is somehow saying
					 that his privileges have been infringed upon. I would say that he is not
					 discharging his privileges if he does not come forward and give evidence, give
					 flight numbers, give the time and the locations of these planes because the
					 allegation is that he has been sitting on aircraft when the law is being
					 broken.</p>

	It is hard to know how there could be a supplementary

					 have heard the two sides and I had real difficulty in even allowing this. This
					 is clearly a dispute between members about what happened in a committee. In my
					 view the matter should be dealt with in the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member has a disagreement with the minister, I
					 suggest he get the committee to call the minister back. The minister can attend
					 with any documents that might need to be tabled and they could be tabled there.
					 He can answer questions from the member and could indeed suggest remedies to
					 the member for dealing with these matters, if there is a dispute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not one in my opinion that involves the
					 privileges of the member or of members of the House as defined in the works on
					 this subject, including Maingot's description of privilege in the House and the
					 description contained in Marleau and Montpetit.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view this is an inappropriate place for this
					 matter to be raised. It is a matter that was raised originally in committee.
					 The dispute arose out of committee proceedings and the matter ought to be
					 settled in the committee and not here. I invite the hon. member to do
					 so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to get into an argument. By having
					 allowed the matter to go this far, we have obvious disputes as to the facts and
					 what happened in committee and what should happen between one side and another.
					 I am not prepared to continue to go on with this because I know the hon. member

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member is referring to the
					 review of this legislation that was authorized, we agreed to review the
					 legislation and anything to do with its enforcement to see if it was properly
					 implemented.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not the first time that the Bloc Quebecois asks
					 for a provision to be added so that the legislation is subject to an automatic
					 review. I cannot seem to remember what bills exactly we were dealing with, but
					 at the justice committee, we oftentimes consider such bills. Unfortunately, I
					 have no examples that come to mind right now, but I certainly could provide
					 some to the member. Members of the justice committee are often asked to
					 consider such issues and we frequently ask for these pieces of legislation to
					 be reviewed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have before the House is an extraordinary and
					 lengthy measure that gives new powers to police officers, as I said earlier,
					 including the authority to arrest people without a warrant and to proceed with
					 preventive detention.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During question period, my hon. colleague from
					 Saint-Hubert talked about the new powers granted to the Minister of Justice and
					 Attorney General of Canada concerning the enforcement of the Access to
					 Information Act. There is a whole panoply of exceptional powers being granted
					 to the Solicitor General of Canada, the Minister of Justice and the Minister of
					 National Defence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since this is extraordinary legislation, a very special
					 bill, the Bloc Quebecois is asking for a yearly review and wants the bill to
					 have only a three year life expectancy. If, after three years, it is deemed
					 necessary to renew it, parliament would again get to vote on this
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a very exceptional set of circumstances for
					 which we need to take exceptional measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the government truly intends to pass extraordinary
					 legislation to balance national security and individual and collective rights
					 and freedoms, if that is what the government really wants, then it should
					 recognize that we are right and amend the bill accordingly.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I think we all agree in the House, and my
					 colleague will say once again that we are in an exceptional situation that the
					 House has never had to deal with before.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorism is new to us. We have to deal with it, but we
					 must also be sure that the laws we pass here do not infringe rights and
					 freedoms. The public must also be protected. We do not simply want to say “We
					 are going to arrest everyone for any reason whatsoever”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is important that we review this bill and make
					 sure we really need it at certain times. We do not know what will happen in the
					 next year.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does my colleague not think that it would be
					 preferable, according to events, for us to return to the House and review,
					 improve or change certain provisions contained in this bill?</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it goes without saying that, as the member
					 for Berthier--Montcalm, I would support any act that seeks to improve national
					 security, public security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we must not go overboard and let people use this
					 bill, whose goals are good and laudable under the circumstances, distort its
					 application and engage in abuse.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said this morning, we must not only look at Bill
					 C-36. We must examine it, but with the existing criminal code, with the
					 existing federal legislation. We must also look at it while keeping in mind the
					 eventual implementation of Bill C-24, which is in the Senate and which is
					 waiting for royal assent.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that Bill C-24, the anti-gang
					 legislation, allows police officers to commit acts that would be considered
					 illegal under any act passed by parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Bill C-24 was passed in the House, there was no
					 anti-terrorism bill on the horizon. Now we have one. We must look at the bill
					 in its entirety and understand that police officers have increased powers under
					 the organized crime legislation and the anti-terrorism act. All this put
					 together could lead to abuse. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation should be reviewed every year and a
					 three year cut-off date should be set. After three years, this act would become
					 obsolete. It would no longer be in effect, unless parliament brought it back,
					 debated it and passed it again.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time. Given that I
					 have a very short period of time, I simply want to frame two or three quick
					 arguments by way of advice to the committee that will consider the bill.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As everyone has gone to some lengths to point out,
					 these are difficult times.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to start by congratulating all the public
					 servants who have worked so hard to make the very necessary adjustments quickly
					 to provide us with increased security and protection as we sort out what is
					 going on in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate the staff at the justice
					 department. This huge bill amends more than 23 other bills. It deals with some
					 of the most sensitive issues in our body of law, issues that affect our
					 individual, personal and civil rights. It is not easy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to congratulate the members of the cabinet.
					 It has been little more than a month since the events took place. They got all
					 this work done and produced a bill that is, on a very preliminary reading,
					 quite fair and balanced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have concerns about some of it which I will speak
					 to in a minute, but it was remarkably more balanced than I had feared when I
					 first heard they were coming forward with a bill of this magnitude.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is an old saying that there are
					 two things children should never see: the making of law and the making of
					 sausages. Justice done in haste can carry within it some very big problems. To
					 try to put through a bill of this size, which deals with so many important
					 rights of individuals, raises cause for at least wonder and concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Prime Minister in this instance. I
					 listened with great care to his speech last night. I was particularly taken
					 both last night and today with not just his willingness but with his
					 instructions to and urging of the justice committee. He said:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>But we all recognize that the
						  legislation has, of necessity, been prepared quickly. Therefore, the role of
						  the justice committee of this House in scrutinizing the bill will be of
						  particular importance. It must examine the bill through the lens, not only of
						  public safety, but also of individual rights.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his history in protecting human rights, I thank
					 him for handing that responsibility over to the committee because I am sure it
					 will do a good job. It will give us some time hopefully to reflect on some of
					 these issues. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really want to frame three arguments here.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By and large the bill does a very good job. It brings
					 into force a couple of United Nations conventions that we had not yet ratified.
					 I would recommend to everyone in the House that they read the speech of our
					 colleague from Mount Royal who went through the 12 conventions in some detail
					 and talked about Canada's leadership role in this area. It is an important
					 opportunity for us to share with the rest of the world some of the expertise
					 and feelings we have developed here.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the issues regarding the changes to
					 investigatory powers could be better understood as modernizing the body of
					 tools that the police have available to them. In fact, the communication
					 technologies have changed rapidly over the last couple of decades. Some of the
					 instruments the police have to do investigations simply have not kept
					 up.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a recognition that there needs to be more work
					 done in this area and I believe we will see a more extensive review. This one
					 was done quickly to deal with those most egregious or difficult areas in terms
					 of mobile wiretapping to allow them to take advantage of the various
					 technologies or to interact with some of the newer technologies to track people
					 or to confirm their suspicions of terrorist acts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can broadly support that, but given the rapid changes
					 in technology we need a more thorough review of this. I hope the minister will
					 reinforce our intention to proceed with it, even though we have passed some of
					 these articles of the law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second area is a more difficult one. Anyone who has
					 dealt with privacy or access legislation knows that there are certain
					 categories of information that not only are secret, but the very existence of
					 them needs to be denied.</p>


	<A NAME="T1530"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1530"><!-- Hour: 3--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1545"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1515"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1530)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<A NAME="Int-56978"></A><a HREF="#Int-57043"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-56939"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>

	It is a funny conundrum in a free and open society. One
					 of the simplest examples, and we went through this when we looked at freedom of
					 information relative to organized crime, is that if we had the right to ask a
					 question not about the substance of an investigation, but about the very
					 existence of an investigation, that could be enough to alert criminals to
					 something of which they were not formerly aware.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case some of the secrecy provisions are around
					 information to be received from other countries. It is a necessary provision.
					 The U.S. or any other country will not share with us information that has been
					 uncovered by their systems if they feel that information may be leaked. However
					 it is necessary to have comprehensive arrangements to track down terrorists
					 worldwide. It raises questions though when things are done in darkness and are
					 absent from public review.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a question, which I rather agreed with, about
					 the need to establish third party review. It can be done in secrecy. Judges can
					 be sworn. However there needs to be a mechanism. This is a fundamental
					 question: Who watches the watchers? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our jobs in this Chamber is to ensure that
					 people's rights are protected. If we cannot for legitimate reasons, and I would
					 say this is only when there is legitimacy to the secrecy, we still need to have
					 an oversight mechanism that is empowered.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases there is evidence of that, there is
					 reference to the courts and we have a lot of opportunities to get a third party
					 involved. However it is not quite as clear in the areas of the Official Secrets
					 Act and some of that information. The committee should have a look at
					 that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final thing of which I want to speak is the thing
					 that worries me the most. Perhaps I should not say worries me, but I would like
					 to offer it as a solution to the problem. The problem is we are in an
					 extraordinary time. There is a lot of need to act quickly to address this but
					 we do not know how we will feel about this in two or three years. We do not
					 know how effective it will be. We have made some fairly sweeping changes and
					 they will have an impact on the body of rights that we exercise, so we should
					 consider sunsetting certain clauses of the act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By that I mean not just reviewing, I mean certain
					 clauses of the act should cease to be in effect by a given date, and I have a
					 recommendation on that, unless the House re-debates and re-passes
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a provision we use in Canada very often and
					 I would not normally argue for it except for two things. The mechanism that we
					 use is one of parliamentary review. We have 32 acts outstanding right now that
					 contain review clauses. The trouble is we do not necessarily get around to it
					 in a timely way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I note there is a three year review for the Corrections
					 and Conditional Release Act. The bill came into effect in 1992. The
					 subcommittee was established to review the act in November of 1998 and to
					 review it again in February of 1999. We have not been very good at following up
					 on these reviews. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, reviews sometimes carry within them the sense
					 that we will just look at it and tinker with it. When it is something as
					 fundamental as our individual rights, they deserve more fulsome debate at a
					 time when we are not immediately under the pressure of the anthrax, or the
					 terrorist attacks or everything else that is going on in this environment.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can support the passage of the bill, subject to the
					 review and advice from the justice committee, but I would recommend that we do
					 as the U.S. house did when it put a sunset clause that had an interesting kind
					 of additional version to it. I would not sunset the whole bill. I would sunset
					 only certain clauses in it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. sunsetted it for three years. It said that
					 those sections would cease to have effect on December 31, 2004, but it gave an
					 out clause. It said to the president in that case, and we would say it to our
					 Minister of Justice or the Prime Minister, that if it were indicated that the
					 sections were required for national security they would remain in force for two
					 additional years. That would buy a little time if there were concern about this
					 thing failing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that would work here. It is critical that when
					 we get more distant from these events that we re-debate and re-pass these
					 provisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to share a bit of information from
					 Canadians. Canadians are quite worried about what has been going on, as one
					 would expect, and there has been a fair bit of surveying. Ipsos-Reid just did a
					 lengthy survey on what people would be prepared to accept. This was within 10
					 days of the events in New York City. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question asked was: “Do you agree or disagree with
					 the statement, I would be prepared to see our police and security services get
					 more powers to fight terrorism, even if it means they might tap my phone, open
					 my mail or read my personal e-mail?” At that time, 10 days after those events,
					 only 50% of Canadians agreed with that; 53% in the weighted sample. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they were asked “Would you be willing to give up
					 some of your civil liberties?” Again there was an ambiguity about that.
					 </p>

	Mr. Speaker, in relation to the member's proposals
					 regarding sunset clauses, it seems to me that there has been a bit of consensus
					 emerging in the House. We now have members from the Alliance, the Tories, the
					 New Democrats and several Liberals who have spoken in favour of sunset clauses,
					 and I think this outline is particularly interesting.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some systemic differences between the
					 Canadian and American legislative systems. In the American system the president
					 functions separately from the congress, whereas in the Canada the Prime
					 Minister functions within the House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, would a review that takes place or an extension
					 that requires a vote of the House not seem to the member to be superior?
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, could he be a little more specific about which
					 sections of the law he thinks should be included in the sunset
					 clause?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-56949"></A><a HREF="#Int-56952"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-56947"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Reg Alcock:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is difficult for me to be terribly
					 specific. Frankly, it is a huge bill which I just received yesterday and I am
					 not a lawyer. It references 23 separate acts and does not necessarily give the
					 text of them. It is a huge piece of work, and I thank God every day I am not a
					 lawyer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I do have a lot of faith, quiet frankly, in the
					 justice committee. I served on it for a while. I know a good portion of the
					 membership. They are smart as can be. They will give this real review. On the
					 government side, there has been an indication that the government is prepared
					 to accept the advice from the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member makes a good point about the difference in
					 the two systems, although I think the committee, if challenged, can find a
					 Canadian solution to that. The proposal is really simple: sunset it for a
					 specific date.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunset is better than review because it forces us
					 to debate it rather than simply have it done in committee, then table a report
					 saying that it is okay. I would sooner have the House engaged in it, as it
					 should be on issues of individual rights. However, it gives an out clause
					 because we do not know what will happen in three years from now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was suggested to me that if we get all these
					 security services ramped up and it has the potential of ending in three years,
					 about half way through people may start getting nervous about whether they have
					 these powers or not. Therefore, give the authorities one extension and at the
					 end of that, it is either reviewed and passed or it is gone. I think that is
					 reasonable.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not do that for all acts. Reviews are a
					 legitimate mechanism when we are talking about economic and commercial acts.

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, unlike many of the debates that we have in
					 this place, this is an issue that Canadians are fairly seized with. The number
					 one question that most Canadians would ask is: How will this affect me? Will
					 this bill give broad sweeping police powers to the state and interfere in my
					 everyday activity, or is this a bill that will provide safety and security for
					 me and my family?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that we discuss this bill in the
					 context of both of those questions. Bill C-36 is in fact an anti-terrorist
					 bill. It is not an anti-immigrant bill, anti-refugee bill, anti-Muslim bill,
					 anti-Afghani bill, anti-Pakistani bill, or anti any of those things because if
					 it were it would truly be anti-Canadian. Unfortunately the debate around this
					 entire issue is in some quarters, mostly the media, focused on this
					 aspect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many times in this place when my
					 friends opposite and I have disagreed, sparred and had vociferous debates.
					 However this is a time when parliamentarians an all sides of the House have
					 shown that their number one concern is for the safety of Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition and the
					 other leaders of the opposition, even the leader of the NDP. Even though we may
					 not agree with her particular position on this matter, there is a constituency
					 within Canada that shares her viewpoint. This democratic place called
					 parliament is the place where those kinds of countering viewpoints need to be
					 put forward.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am interested in some of the suggestions made by the
					 previous speaker regarding sunsetting. There is a section of the bill that
					 requires it to be revisited and redebated in three years time. Whether it is an
					 automatic review in three years or a cancellation of certain policies, unless
					 they are reaffirmed in this place they are all issues that can be fairly and
					 effectively dealt with in committee. They are technical aspects as to whether
					 or not certain search and seizure aspects of the law should be continued or
					 discontinued. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should there be a wiretap that lasts one year instead
					 of 90 days? Should there be intrusive abilities to monitor situations within
					 this country, abilities that we would probably not have supported on September
					 10 of this year?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11 we have had to look at life through
					 a different prism. Canadians are frightened and justifiably so. However, what
					 concerns me is some of the hysteria that has literally thrown gasoline on an
					 open flame. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I refer to recent allegations in the media last week
					 which said that 50 refugees from Afghanistan and Pakistan had been allowed into
					 the country without any security checks whatsoever. I can say that the
					 switchboard, if we want to call it that, in my constituency office lit up.
					 People were concerned and outraged as to how this could happen. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I too was concerned as to how we would allow someone
					 in, particularly today but at any time in our history, without a reasonable
					 security check and so I investigated. What did I find? I found that there was
					 not one refugee from Afghanistan or Pakistan. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that given day at Pearson airport there were indeed
					 29 people who applied for refugee status, which is not an unusual occurrence.
					 The largest volume of refugees come through Pearson airport. Each and every one
					 of those people was fingerprinted, photographed, checked through CSIS and
					 cross-checked through the RCMP. No one was allowed to enter the country without
					 a security check.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will not be critical of anyone in particular in this
					 case. However some members have said that when refugees come to this country
					 and are a security risk or a flight risk, meaning they will not turn up for
					 their hearing, then they should be detained. They are detained if those
					 determinations are made.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can take anyone who wants to go to a number of motels
					 in the Brampton-Mississauga community that have been acquired as detention
					 centres by the federal government to see families languishing. If there is a
					 problem in our refugee system, and there is, it is in the length of time it
					 takes to process the applications to provide a fair hearing. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that Bill C-11, which will be before the
					 House after it passes through the Senate, would help in that regard because it
					 would allow single person panels instead of the three people needed to hold the
					 hearings now. That should triple the number of hearings and should speed up the
					 process dramatically. That is a case of human rights that need not interfere
					 with this bill or any bill that targets anti-terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wholeheartedly support Bill C-36. It is a response
					 that our government has put forward in a timely, thoughtful and well researched
					 way which says to Canadians that the government will fight terrorism with its
					 friends in America, Great Britain and around the world. We will stand united as
					 members of NATO as we have in other conflicts in the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A clause was invoked as part of our agreement with NATO
					 known as article 5. Article 5 states that when a member of NATO is attacked all
					 members are attacked. It is an all for one clause. If any Canadian falls
					 through the cracks of discrimination in our zealous attempt to fight terrorism,
					 the attack on that individual Canadian citizen is an attack on all of us. I
					 caution that it can and does happen. </p>

	Let me share with the House the experience of a
					 gentleman by the name of Mohamed Abdel-Aziz Attiah who was an engineer on
					 contract with AECL at Chalk River. He was a Canadian citizen for 27 years. He
					 is married to a Canadian citizen and has four children born in Canada. He moved
					 from Mississauga to work at the Chalk River facility.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was interviewed recently by CSIS and the RCMP for 90
					 minutes after which there were no charges, but because his name was Mohamed
					 Abdel-Aziz Attiah they remained suspicious. They were concerned about security.
					 There were no charges laid against the individual but after he went out for
					 lunch and arrived back at the facility that he had worked at for some time, and
					 at which he was being offered a permanent position, he found that his security
					 card had been cancelled with no explanation and no reason. Today he languishes
					 without a job, without an income and with a wife and four children, trying to
					 understand.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it because of his name and heritage that he was
					 fired? He asks what he did wrong. They trusted him before September 11. He
					 wants to know why they do not trust him now. Is it because his name is
					 Mohamed?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know no one in this place would support that, yet it
					 is a current case. It is an unjust case and in passing an anti-terrorism bill
					 we must ensure that people like Mohamed and others are not discriminated
					 against. This is not McCarthyism in the 1950s. It is clearly a united attack
					 against terrorism that can come in any nationality, any skin colour and from
					 anywhere in the world, even right here in Canada.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, before asking a question I wish to advise
					 the House that October 30 is prostate cancer blood testing day. The speech by
					 the hon. member was quite interesting because he mentioned the case that was
					 widely reported in the newspapers of refugee claimants who were released at
					 Pearson airport, supposedly without proper background checks. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a bit puzzled because he claimed that none of them
					 were released without the proper CSIS checks, fingerprints and so on. Yet
					 immigration officials told me that it takes up to 12 months to check the
					 fingerprints that are taken at the point of entry when refugees come into the
					 country. The Ottawa <i>Sun </i>reported on Tuesday, October 9:</p>

</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immigration officers said they were released without
					 proper checks. Frontline officers said the claimants, some of whom were Afghani
					 and Pakistani nationals with no identification, arrived at Pearson on European
					 flights hours after the attacks began. From where did the member get his
					 information that they were not released without proper checks?</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the member wants to make this into a partisan issue

	Mr. Speaker, I agree with the hon. member and it is not

					 problem. We all realize that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is not correct is that they are not all

					 speech.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the position of the minister and the
					 government is that our main concern is the actual activity as opposed to the
					 membership. However it is an issue that should be raised in committee and
					 should be discussed. There could possibly be an amendment. I do not think it is
					 an unreasonable suggestion. We should hear both sides of that
					 argument</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I say to the hon. member that the primary
					 purpose of the legislation is to identify, prosecute, convict and punish
					 terrorists. The key word is identify. I think the hon. member would agree with
					 me that we want to make sure we are identifying the proper people who are in
					 fact engaging in terrorist activities and not make mistakes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should not go running off in the wrong direction
					 that will cause hardship to people like the gentleman whose example I quoted,
					 and others who are fearful and afraid to even speak up on this kind of issue
					 because this is not the time to do anything but rattle the sabre and stand
					 strong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members should make no mistake that any suggestion that
					 people's rights must be protected within this great land is not a suggestion
					 that we should in any way weaken our attack on terrorism. We must stand
					 together with our allies. We will do so and the bill goes a long way toward
					 helping out in that direction.</p>

					 Opposition, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to advise you that I will be
					 sharing my time with the member for Langley--Abbotsford. Yesterday I rose in
					 the House to congratulate the government for doing the right thing in
					 committing Canadian troops to join the coalition in the military effort in
					 Afghanistan. Today I rise again to congratulate the government for doing the
					 right thing in bringing forth comprehensive anti-terrorism legislation which
					 will address some of the concerns that need to be addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation being proposed does in some ways appear
					 to be similar to the United Kingdom terrorism act legislation of 2000 and is
					 comparable to U.S. legislation, but it is still lacking in some very important
					 areas which must be addressed.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For over one month we have been asking the government
					 to introduce anti-terrorism legislation and today we are pleased that the
					 government is taking action.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official opposition was calling for a clear
					 Canadian commitment to provide military support to the United States and for
					 anti-terrorism legislation a long time before September 11. I am not saying
					 that out of any sense of partisanship. I point out that it is the duty of the
					 official opposition to point to areas where we feel the government is not
					 moving strongly, quickly or adequately enough and to encourage the government
					 to take action.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precious time in the war against terrorism would not
					 have been lost had the measures that we asked for been in place on September
					 11. The most important role of government is to act as the guardian of the
					 public, particularly in times of great national and international crises such
					 as we faced since September 11. It is the role of the official opposition to be
					 a guard of the guardian. It is the role we played and will continue to play as
					 far as our national response to the threat of terrorism goes and how it
					 unfolds.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 18, a week after the horrific terrorist
					 attacks on the United States, the official opposition brought forward a motion
					 which compiled a comprehensive list of those items we had been focusing on for
					 some time previous to September 11. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We called for the naming of all known international
					 terrorist organizations that were operating in Canada, a complete ban on
					 fundraising activities in support of terrorism, the seizure of assets belonging
					 to terrorists or terrorist organizations, the immediate ratification of the
					 international convention for the suppression of financing of terrorism, the
					 creation of specific crimes for engaging in terrorist training and terrorist
					 activity in Canada or inciting terrorist acts abroad from Canada, the prompt
					 extradition of foreign nationals who were charged with acts of terrorism even
					 if the charges were capital offences, and the detention on the deportation to
					 the country of origin of any people illegally in Canada or failed claimants who
					 may have been linked to terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a war on terrorism there are many things that should
					 be done but there are a few things that absolutely must be done. If the purpose
					 of the legislation is to have a wall, to block the flow of terrorism and
					 terrorist activity, the wall is of little use if it is of strong concrete in
					 some places but has gaping holes in others. It is the holes in the wall that we
					 need to address.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elements being brought forward by the government do
					 not deal with the issue of detention and deportation of failed claimants. It
					 does not deal with that issue at all, and I suggest that it is a huge and
					 gaping hole.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hope to have the opportunity, when the bill is
					 reviewed by the Standing Committee on Justice, to improve this anti-terrorism
					 legislation.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These areas must be addressed. The bill would allow the
					 government to create a list of known terrorist organizations. We have been
					 asking for this for a long time. We named the Federation of Associations of
					 Canadian Tamils, or FACT, from the government list as a front group for the
					 terrorist Tamil tigers, an identification which had been made not by us but by
					 CSIS, as well as the U.S. state department and the government's own justice and
					 immigration department lawyers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took the government's identification of that group
					 as a dangerous group and were accused by the government and its members of
					 smearing innocent Tamil Canadians. That is absolutely far from the truth and
					 that unreasonable part of debate should not be entertained in the House.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The items we are dealing with here are too important to
					 lower ourselves to that kind of accusation. What the government apparently did
					 not want to acknowledge is that Tamil Canadians are among the victims of the
					 Tamil tigers. They have been tricked, cajoled and bullied into supporting
					 terrorist activities through supporting front groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the bill allows the government to list terrorist
					 groups and their front organizations, it does nothing specifically to prohibit
					 membership in those organizations. It only allows for criminal prosecution
					 where individuals actually perform terrorist acts or other crimes related to
					 terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is possible under the legislation the government is
					 suggesting that al-Qaeda, which is clearly known to be a vicious terrorist
					 organization responsible for the vicious slaughter of thousands of people,
					 could be named as a terrorist organization. Its members across Canada could
					 stand and freely wave and proclaim the al-Qaeda flag. That should not be the
					 case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the United States and in Great Britain it would be
					 enough, if it were proved that an individual was a member of a type of
					 organization like that, to allow members of security forces to arrest and
					 detain that person.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to remember we are talking about groups of
					 people whose sole reason for existence is death, destruction, terror and
					 destabilization. It would be useful to prosecutors to have available a lesser
					 charge of membership in a terrorist organization like that to bring suspected
					 terrorists into custody. It is very necessary legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another weakness of the bill is that it continues a
					 policy which has been roundly criticized by many of the government's own
					 members, especially the member from Mississauga. It is something that we call
					 volume discounts for mass murder.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians, including members on the government side of
					 the House, are appalled that multiple murderers cannot be convicted to
					 consecutive life sentences, in effect keeping them in jail for life. We heard
					 ministers on the other side of the House state that life means life in terms of
					 how the government applies the law. It does not. That is simply not a fact.
					 After 25 years a mass murderer is eligible for release and parole. We can
					 produce a list of people already in that category walking the streets of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crimes of terrorism are deliberately aimed at the death
					 and destruction of people. We believe judges must have the option of convicting
					 terrorists to consecutive life sentences without any possibility of parole.
					 That should be absolute.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third weakness is that the bill, unlike the
					 comparable U.S. legislation, does nothing to ensure security from people
					 arriving on our shores from other countries who may be linked to terrorist
					 activities. Canada has a reputation, quite properly, of welcoming people who
					 want to come to Canada, who believe in freedom and democracy, who want to live
					 here, raise their families, and pursue their hopes and dreams.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our arms are open and have been to those types of
					 people, but we also have a reputation of being somewhat of a haven and a magnet
					 to people who want to come here who do not appreciate freedom and who want to
					 take away and destroy the freedoms that others enjoy. We need to shed that
					 reputation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We ask for legislation that will give immigration
					 officers and judges the power to detain claimants who arrive in Canada without
					 documentation or where there is reasonable suspicion of involvement with
					 terrorism or organized crime. Detention should be permissible until claimants
					 are able to prove that they are who they say they are and are not a security
					 risk. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens in the United Kingdom. It happens in the
					 United States. It happens in Australia. It happens in other freedom loving
					 democracies. It should happen here. It is another gaping hole in the legal wall
					 the government is trying to build, a wall that is concrete in some places but
					 has holes in it that will not stop the flow of the worst type of terrorist
					 activity. These holes attract the bottom feeders of society, the terrorists
					 themselves to whom I refer. They will find the holes, and the holes must be
					 closed and closed firmly.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, we note that the legislation does nothing to
					 improve procedures for extraditing suspected terrorists to other jurisdictions.
					 Because of the supreme court decision in Burns v Rafay it may prove practically
					 impossible to deport a terrorist to a country, for instance the United States.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would include people who have possibly
					 masterminded the atrocity in New York City, with the deaths of thousands,
					 coming to Canada. This does not allow them to be deported just because the
					 sanctions for their crime are different from the sanctions that we would have
					 here. That is inappropriate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to address these issues and we need to provide
					 the resources. The minister talked about $250 million and $64 million for law
					 enforcement. On the one hand that might sound impressive until we realize that
					 the amount of money the federal Liberals are saying should be available is
					 actually one-tenth of what they have spent on a faulty system of registering
					 the shotguns of duck hunters. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The priorities are wrong, which is another reason we
					 need a budget in place. There must be a budget. This country should not be
					 known as a country that is now going into two years without a budget. We need
					 that in place so that we can help the government move from areas of wasteful
					 spending and low priority spending to the areas of high priority spending that
					 really matter to Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are the thoughts and principles that we will be
					 taking forward as we address our concerns about the bill. We need to ensure
					 that Canada is a place which invites those who love freedom, peace and
					 democracy but slams the door firmly on those who do not.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. Leader of the Opposition referred

					 not visited the offices of FACT or even spoke to the people at FACT.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to lay on the table a couple of facts
					 regarding FACT. I notice the member sitting beside him is also sharing his
					 leader's vision. FACT is a coalition of Canadian citizens. It is located in my

					 riding.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four words I am sure that leader and his
					 party will certainly embrace today. Those words are celebrate, accept, respect
					 and embrace. We celebrate our differences in Canada. We accept our neighbours
					 as equals. We respect the people who are coming into our country and most of
					 all we embrace them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfortunate fact is that opposition party did not
					 use those words. It certainly did not demonstrate that when its leader came to
					 the community and put a lot of my constituents' children at risk with its
					 rhetoric last year and the way it is continuing. I am ashamed to hear the same
					 rhetoric today. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My question is for the Leader of the Opposition. When
					 was the last time he first and foremost went to speak to the individuals at
					 FACT? When was the last time he visited the offices of FACT? When was the last
					 time he spoke to the Tamils in my constituency after what their children were
					 put through because of his party's rhetoric?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am ashamed of the way the opposition is going. Does
					 the hon. Leader of the Opposition really care about those children? Does he
					 accept, celebrate, respect and embrace those children? Certainly
					 not.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I think the folks at home should listen
					 very carefully. It is interesting to see how those individuals across the way
					 start to detract from the main issue of terrorism and some of the problems that
					 are not even addressed in the terrorism legislation and degrade the discussion
					 by something that they are doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to address some facts of which these individuals
					 across the way are probably not aware. I am the only individual in the House
					 who has actually been an intervener in as many as maybe eight or nine
					 deportations of criminals from this country. I will go through seven cases for
					 those at home and those listening in the House. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not terrorists but they very well could have
					 been terrorists. The same applies to terrorists except that the rules I am
					 about to go through are not being changed as far as the government is
					 concerned. I will go through this case by case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end I would like the government to ask itself if
					 it is really addressing the real problems inherent in our system as far as
					 criminals are concerned, whether they be criminals moving from north or south
					 of our border, whether they be terrorists in the definition of terrorist today
					 or whether they be people who should not be in our country for whatever
					 reason.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to give a brief description of it because I do
					 not enough time. I want to briefly talk about an individual from El Salvador
					 who came into our country, raped a woman and had nine or ten extra convictions
					 while here. He raped a second woman. That lady agreed to stay the charges if he
					 were deported. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government then escorted and deported the person to
					 El Salvador. It was while the lady was getting gas for her car in my community
					 that she found out he was back in the country within six months claiming
					 refugee status. We have physically deported somebody. He came back into the
					 country and was given a refugee hearing. It took me two years to get rid of
					 this fellow again. He knew it was a haven here. He knew he could stay and would
					 have stayed had I not been an intervener in that case. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This condition still exists today, whether a person is
					 a terrorist or any other kind of criminal. That condition has not been changed
					 by any legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me describe another case of an individual from
					 Laos. He was involved in a murder. He went to prison. He applied for refugee
					 status while in prison and after a one hour hearing it was granted. It took me
					 two years as an intervener to get this fellow deported. He would have stayed
					 here had I not been an intervener. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could have been a terrorist. He was a murderer, not
					 a terrorist. The condition still exists today where a terrorist can be in a
					 prison in Canada, apply for refugee status and receive it while in
					 prison.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me describe another case of an individual who came
					 in on a visitor's visa. This is the same thing that a terrorist can do,
					 although this fellow was not a terrorist. He was charged with assault almost
					 immediately. When he heard I was after him for deportation he was advised to
					 apply for refugee status. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He applied for refugee status. I applied as an
					 intervener. As all refugee applicants can do, he applied through the refugee
					 board to exclude me from the hearing. I had to fight that and I won. Just
					 before we had him ordered deported, he abandoned his claim. Everything stopped
					 and he disappeared. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About eight months later I found out he was applying
					 for refugee status for a second time in Calgary. I went to Calgary and applied
					 as an intervener. He kicked me out. I applied to fight that and won for a
					 second time. This time we won the case. His refugee claim is disallowed.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told the refugee board to hold him because he was a
					 jumper, that he would leave, that he would disappear in Canada. It would not do
					 it. He has disappeared and we hear he is in Winnipeg now waiting to apply
					 again. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This happens today whether the individual is a
					 terrorist, a murderer or a rapist. It does not matter. Those are the kinds of
					 issues that are not being addressed in the House. Those are the issues that the
					 Americans are concerned about. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speaking about the Americans, I just had a case of an
					 individual from Cuba. He came into Canada. He hooked up with a young, 15 year
					 old kid. The parents came to me and wanted me to do something. I went after
					 him. He applied for refugee status. In the refugee hearing, after he excluded
					 me and I won the right to stay in the hearing again, I was passed a document
					 that said he was wanted in the United States. He had been there for four years.
					 He was not a refugee from Cuba. He was a refugee from prosecution in the United
					 States.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guy could have been a terrorist. If he were a
					 terrorist the same rules apply today as they did then. I told the police and
					 the refugee board to hold this fellow, that he was a skipper, that he jumps. He
					 jumped from the United States to avoid prosecution. They would not do it. He is
					 gone with the kid. I hear he is in Edmonton. This is the identical rule under
					 which a terrorist would operate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an individual in prison in my community who
					 has been deported from this country over 20 times. One has to work at that.
					 That is a problem. He is an American.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a call a couple of weeks ago from fellow who said
					 he was from Oklahoma and was in my community. He wanted me to pay for a few
					 nights at the Travelodge. He said he was a refugee from Oklahoma. I said there
					 is no such thing as a refugee from Oklahoma. He told me he was avoiding
					 political persecution. I asked what were the charges. He is not avoiding
					 political persecution. He is avoiding prosecution. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These individuals in the United States will move to
					 Canada as a terrorist would under the same rules and apply for refugee status.
					 That is wrong.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christopher Dawson is a dangerous sex offender. I have
					 been working on this case for a long time. To be labelled a dangerous sex
					 offender in this country is a serious charge. He got a passport from Canada
					 while in prison. This is serious. The same rules apply today. That can
					 happen.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I come from, if he gets a passport and lives on
					 the border he is going to go to the United States to get some child and run
					 back to Canada to avoid prosecution. These rules exist today whether or not
					 someone is a sex offender, a murderer or a terrorist. I have been saying this
					 in the House for eight years. This is serious and it is not being
					 addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is only one other thing I want to say about the
					 money that the government is spending on some of these projects. We have a
					 commitment from the government to develop a national sex offender registry. It
					 will not live up to its commitment that would have been about $5 million or
					 maybe a little more. In times of crisis I am perplexed as to why a government
					 says it is throwing money into all of this and will work it out later. The
					 country has been begging for a national sex offender registry. It is the same
					 thing I am talking about. They are different priorities. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a priority the government does not seem to
					 understand. I do not know what to say except that these are actual cases. I do
					 them all the time. I am very familiar with them. I could tell the House of 10
					 or 12 more. The problem is the government is not addressing these circumstances
					 at all in this legislation.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, the hon. member reminded me of numerous
					 cases in my riding as well. I could read off a list, but I will point to a
					 particular case which highlights another area of the existing rules which
					 creates problems.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A refugee claimant in my riding was forging passports
					 from his home. It took about three years to finally get the case to court. The
					 guy claimed he had no means of support, but he was driving a brand new Explorer
					 and living in the British Properties in Vancouver. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge gave him a six month suspended sentence. On
					 the very day that he was in the court getting a suspended sentence for forging
					 passports someone else was standing in for him downtown at the citizenship
					 court and getting his Canadian citizenship. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another example of existing rules which create
					 problems that terrorists use. Because our citizenship process does not properly
					 identify the person coming down to the court house, anybody can stand in and
					 get citizenship for people like the person I just mentioned.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is the hon. member aware of that problem in the
					 citizenship office? Has he experienced similar problems in his
					 riding?</p>


	<A NAME="Int-57012"></A><a HREF="#Int-57051"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-57009"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Randy White:
				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I know the hon. member for North Vancouver
					 has similar problems as I have in my riding. We do not live that far apart.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These situations exist. The government knows they
					 exist. When we hear that there are 27,000 people deported who are still in the
					 country, I do not know if the number is right or wrong. I do know that I
					 personally have dealt with well over a dozen and fought every case. Every time
					 I won the case and the refugee application was rejected because of some
					 criminality or something, they skipped and they stayed in the country. It has
					 all been a waste of time. The only ones left behind were the
					 victims.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of those who have deportation orders who are in this
					 country today, I would hesitate to guess how many are actual terrorists. With
					 that number of 27,000 I can guarantee the number is somewhere above 50 or 100
					 or whatever. I just do not know. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is serious. I ask the government for the
					 umpteenth time to address that particular issue in the legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to mention another thing. I received a rather
					 interesting suggestion from a lady by the name of Julia Milstead: </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The idea I had today would take time
						  before it could be implemented, but after the fault of the terrorism is proven
						  beyond a shadow of a doubt (which I'm sure will happen) the frozen assets of
						  the terrorist organizations should be distributed to pay for some of these
						  costs. Part of the punishment for their crimes should surely include
						  retribution, so the terrorists should be paying for these costs as much as
						  possible. I don't know how much of the costs the frozen assets would cover, but
						  I think it only justice that their assets should go completely toward these
						  costs. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a bad idea when we think about it. It has to
					 be worked out. These are the kinds of things the government has to get into,
					 looking at options and alternatives which may well provide better answers and
					 solutions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not saying that the legislation tabled is useless,
					 and I would if I felt that way. I think there is a lot of good in the
					 legislation. The government just has not dealt with one of the critical things
					 which is the people who are still here and who are still mobile. Some of them
					 probably are terrorists who are able to distract, destroy, disrupt our country
					 and the Americans'. Do not forget that the Americans know this just as well as
					 we do. With respect to everything I have said here today, the Americans know
					 what I am talking about.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am sharing my time with the member for
					 Hamilton West.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I appreciate the opportunity to consider the bill that
					 is before the House. Rather than read through all the points that other people
					 have said, I thought I would convey some of my thoughts about what I hope the
					 committee members will look at when the bill is before them. They have a very
					 difficult job looking at legislation and they do not have the vast experience
					 of another context. This is a new context for all of us. It is a new context
					 for the legislators, for people in our enforcement agencies, for the people who
					 have drafted the bill and for all people who have anxieties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be calm and we have to be rational. This
					 legislation will last longer than our fears. This legislation could last
					 indefinitely. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are provisions in the legislation calling for a
					 three year review. I have already heard many people suggest there be sunset
					 provisions, to use the common vernacular.</p>


	<A NAME="Int-57021"></A><a HREF="#Int-57026"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-57051"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></b>

	I have to think of the practicality. What would it mean
					 if we were in the middle of a case and this legislation sunsetted based on
					 provisions in the legislation? Perhaps the committee could consider sunsetting
					 parts of the legislation, perhaps some of those provisions that are the
					 investigative hearings or the preventative arrest, new procedures that we are
					 coming to. Perhaps we could look at that. To see what are the practical
					 advantages and disadvantages perhaps would be something worthy of attention by
					 the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier I heard statements indicating that we will not
					 be testing this at the supreme court for constitutional predisposition. It is
					 not impossible but it is very difficult for courts without factual situations
					 to deliberate on the constitutionality of a law. Usually individual cases have
					 different levels of hearings from trial to appeals all the way up to the
					 supreme court. They are heard on the basis of specific facts of whether a
					 provision is inside or outside, constitutional or unconstitutional. If it is
					 unconstitutional, it is void and we start over.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill before us today is new. It must have been
					 incredibly difficult work for the teams of lawyers and parliamentarians around
					 the cabinet table to look at this legislation and try to make it charter proof.
					 Many of us would agree that some of these provisions are riding pretty close to
					 what we would consider a normal edge. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of us in this Chamber are concerned about the
					 charter of rights and freedoms. We fought very hard in Canada to get that
					 charter. We do not want to give it up lightly. It is our obligation as
					 parliamentarians to closely scrutinize this bill. There is a need to get some
					 appropriate legislation in place, but we do not have to be on the steamroller.
					 We can take the time to ask questions, to do the work, to make the necessary
					 examinations and to call a number of witnesses who are experts in their various
					 fields. We also have to live with the reality of today. It is a different world
					 after September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me go back to before September 11. We think this is
					 a new bill. I am a member of the finance committee and last spring we looked at
					 Bill C-16, the deregistration of charities provisions. It has found a new life
					 as part 6 of this bill. The whole bill in theory is under the auspices of the
					 Minister of Justice. However part 6 is actually under the auspices of the
					 minister of revenue and the solicitor general. That is the reincarnation of
					 what was Bill C-16 except there have been a few changes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the major changes is the inclusion of
					 definitions of terrorism that were missing in Bill C-16 and which the committee
					 had stated were needed. It also changes the period of potential inquiry into
					 hearings from three years to seven years. That is quite an incredible
					 increase.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What else is different about these parts? First let me
					 speak to the parts that are specifically under the Minister of Justice and all
					 the various provisions, whether they are changing other pieces of legislation
					 or are new punishments, new crimes or new powers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In large part society is leaning toward the acceptance
					 of security over freedom, except we always have to take into account the
					 proportionality test that any court would look at in a piece of legislation
					 like this. Are the crime and the outcome related? Are they proportional? This
					 is when section 1 of the charter comes into play.</p>


	<A NAME="T1625"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1625"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1630"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1620"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1625)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I have not gone through all of these
					 sections in detail, I believe that a large number of people in Canada will come
					 to the conclusion that even though these are unusual limiting provisions and
					 procedures, they would be willing to go this far in these extraordinary
					 situations. The proportionality is there, although it is not laid out in
					 stone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proportionality test is different in part 6. Part 6
					 is not about criminal law. In criminal law there has to be mens rea. The person
					 has to have thought about it. The person has to have knowingly done something
					 wrong, it has be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that it was wrong, and then
					 there are consequences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of safeguards in that system. Beyond a
					 reasonable doubt is a very high standard. It is difficult to prove and there is
					 a good reason why it is difficult to prove. We have higher sentence structures
					 in the bill. I agree with those structures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 6 is an administrative procedure that is talking
					 about the result of stripping a charitable status. That is the outcome of all
					 of the procedures. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some provisions based on something we are
					 already doing as a government in section 40 of the Immigration Act to set up a
					 special procedure where there is a hearing before a judge. Under the
					 Immigration Act it usually is the immigration minister and the solicitor
					 general. In this particular piece of legislation it would be the solicitor
					 general and the revenue minister, CCRA. They will take some evidence. The
					 evidence they want to show is not evidence that would be revealed in a court.
					 Why? It is sensitive classified material. Perhaps it puts at risk a personal
					 information source.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ministers have to take this on reasonable grounds.
					 Basically this is the level of proof when someone is charged and there is an
					 arrest. This is not beyond a reasonable doubt. It is not the civil balance of
					 probabilities. There are different bars. It is a fairly low bar.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were examining this section, we were concerned
					 with a series of potential problems that could have a very chilling effect on
					 the charities in Canada. These charities have made their views known. The
					 committee had not finished its hearings. In fairness to the government, it had
					 not made its case yet.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious concerns were laid out. People can read our
					 data in the finance committee transcripts of the hearings last spring. The
					 government was aware of these. We thought the legislation would not go in the
					 form it was in. We thought there could be changes. In fact, it came to us for
					 our input because it was draft legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is here now and it is unchanged. Many organizations
					 are fearful of the outcome of this legislation. I particularly want to say that
					 this procedure under subsection 40.1(5.1) has never constitutionally been
					 upheld in any court because it was excluded by the Attorney General of Canada
					 in the Ahani decision on section 40.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have made my concerns known to members inside the
					 various departments here. I will have them give my concerns to anyone who is
					 interested. There are many good areas which we have to look at carefully. I am
					 supportive, as would all of us be, the doves and hawks, of getting the work
					 done and dealing with terrorism.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I address my comments to the member who
					 has just spoken. I know she would agree with me, with the exception from time
					 to time of a partisan outbreak that we saw a few minutes ago, that there is a
					 very sincere effort on the part of herself, myself and the vast majority of
					 members of the House to get on quickly and expeditiously with the bill, that it
					 be proper and balanced, that it get the job done and that the people of Canada
					 be protected by the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a democracy, we have a very interesting
					 situation. While we as people are persons and our property is protected by the
					 police, by the same token, within a democracy and free society, we are also
					 protected from the police and unreasonable police action. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore it is very important, as we put together the
					 tools the police will need to work with, the legislation and laws, that we make
					 sure they have a full complement of tools so they do not have to use tools that
					 are not there, in other words, that they do not have to use a screwdriver as a
					 chisel or vice versa.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the difficulties expressed by my party and other
					 critics of the legislation is the fact that there is no prohibition within this
					 omnibus bill for membership in a terrorist organization. Because that is
					 missing, it removes the lowest possible threshold for the police to start or
					 continue exploratory activity with respect to possible terrorist connections.
					 In other words, by having a very simple prohibition starting at the lowest
					 possible level the police would then be entitled on the basis of reasonable
					 suspicion to continue to ramp up their investigation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder if the member would agree with me that when
					 the committee is looking at this it would be very wise to consider seriously
					 and probably include an amendment to the legislation that would include the
					 prohibition of membership in terrorist organizations so that the police have
					 the smallest of the tools, the starting point of the investigation
					 process.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would be very happy to answer the
					 question to the best of my ability. I am not an expert but I think experts
					 would tell us that freedom of association is a charter right. As such, if we
					 just take pure membership we would then be making this law unconstitutional. I
					 have heard it said by the hon. member's leader and by many other people that it
					 is one of the basic principles, which is what we are talking about when we talk
					 about balancing rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I were a parent and my children were misbehaving I
					 would not tell them that they were wrong or that they were bad children. I
					 would tell them that what they did was wrong and that they should change their
					 activity. It goes to what we are saying here. I like the way the bill has
					 crafted definitions of terrorism. We are taking it away from the concept of
					 groups of people and putting onto people doing wrong activities, terrorist
					 activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like how we have gone to the 12 international
					 conventions. I certainly applaud that we are now able to accede to the last two
					 conventions and that we are the fourth in the world on one of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The understanding of where the balancing act should be
					 is important because otherwise we would have a sledgehammer coming down and the
					 tools we were searching for would be lost. The balancing act has been done for
					 very good reason. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am actually concerned about a lot of the tools we are
					 now giving to the police. I am concerned that the knowledge and safeguards we
					 might have on some levels may not get down to the operational level. However I
					 believe people are well intentioned, including the police and enforcement
					 services.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to go forward with a little faith in the system

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, the introduction of Bill C-36, the
					 anti-terrorism act, stands as the fulfilment of the government's continued
					 commitment to combating terrorism, a commitment that we have practised since
					 our election and which was exemplified in our capacity to respond immediately
					 to the horrific events of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To further extend the response capability and capacity
					 of our country, we have introduced the bill with the intent to provide further
					 tools to our law enforcement and national security agencies. The bill would aid
					 in the task of rooting out terrorist organizations, and that will curtail
					 future threats to the health and well-being of our citizens. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, the proposed act, while extending the powers
					 of our security agencies to combat hate crimes, is consistent with and
					 predicated on the word and spirit of the Canadian Charter of Rights and
					 Freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of central importance that while finding an
					 appropriate response to the current situation we act in accordance with the
					 principles and values for which this country stands and which, as
					 representatives of our respective communities, we must uphold.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 is designed to help us do exactly that. The
					 new anti-terrorism plan has four key objectives: to stop terrorists from
					 entering our country and to protect Canadians from terrorist acts; to bring
					 forward tools to identify and prosecute terrorists; to prevent our borders from
					 being held hostage; and to work with the international community to bring
					 terrorists to justice and impact the root causes of such hatred. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would help protect our borders economically
					 and, just as important, it would protect the principles of openness and
					 acceptance that are fundamental to the Canadian spirit. These are difficult
					 times that require difficult decisions. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a message for my constituents in Hamilton West
					 and my fellow Canadians. It is for them to go about their daily business and
					 their daily lives as usual, to understand that we must now live in a state of
					 heightened awareness. The bill is a response to and an expression of that
					 heightened awareness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the fight against terrorism, there are many weapons
					 in the Canadian arsenal. Some of these weapons are legislative, such as the
					 bill before us today and some include the skills and commitment of our local
					 and national security agencies and the capacity of our armed forces.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there is another weapon that is often
					 overlooked. It is the strong character of our country's pride in our commitment
					 to cultural diversity. With this pride resides the confidence that hatred and
					 violence will never find a home here in Canada. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is from the wellspring of this pride that our Prime
					 Minister recently asserted that “Canada will not use the justification of
					 national security to abandon our cherished values of freedom and tolerance. We
					 will not fall into the trap of exclusion”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our country's most enviable features is its
					 reputation as a land where individuals are free to practise their cultural
					 activities and commitments as they see fit, a land where peace loving
					 individuals from around the globe can come together in friendship and share
					 their rich and diverse traditions. No other country can claim the same degree
					 of success or commitment to multiculturalism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was back in 1971 that the Liberal government of the
					 Right Hon. Pierre Trudeau made Canada the first country in the world to adopt
					 an official policy of multiculturalism. We cannot doubt that in such
					 multiplicity we as a nation are made strong. However we must also not doubt
					 that our commitments to strength through diversity are also in danger of being
					 hijacked by the purveyors of hatred and terror. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my remarks to worshippers at a Hamilton mosque last
					 week I said “I am proud to be the son of an immigrant. My father is proud to
					 call himself Canadian”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are collectively a nation of many diverse cultures
					 brought together by a common goal of peaceful coexistence and equality.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must under no circumstances allow the world's terror
					 merchants to export their hatred to Canada. We must not allow them to undermine
					 the mutual respect that Canadians of all faiths and backgrounds have nurtured
					 for 150 years. We have worked diligently to firmly establish the basic
					 principles, values and shared beliefs that hold us together as Canadians.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the wake of the tragic events of September 11 it is
					 important; no, it is absolutely necessary, for Canadians to reaffirm the
					 fundamental values of our charter of rights and freedoms: the equality of
					 individuals of every culture, religion and ethnic origin. Our way of life and
					 system of values has made us proud of our country and provided us a tremendous
					 bounty of freedom, tolerance and justice. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It behoves us to protect ourselves through an awareness
					 of what is at stake in our response to recent events. We could inflict damage
					 on terrorists the world over by exporting our deeply rooted Canadian values
					 abroad. If our values can act as nutrients to the growth of a country such as
					 our own, surely enacting them in our foreign policy and allowing them to guide
					 our future international relations can be of benefit to the global community.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we act in immediate and necessary co-operation with
					 our allies to attack the threat of terrorism, it is perhaps time to consider
					 how the principles that make us strong might themselves weaken the roots from
					 which such hatred grows.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will close by raising this fraught question: Is it
					 too soon to debate the history of international relations and foreign policy in
					 a broader context? Is it too soon to enter into dialogue about the
					 responsibilities of each of us as global citizens?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we are to defeat terrorism we need to discuss and
					 confront the root causes of terrorist activities, namely the inequities that
					 breed discontent. We need to recognize the political and economic disparities
					 that have promoted social, cultural and physical starvation in certain regions
					 of the world. While today we are taking one of the many necessary incremental
					 steps in the battle against terrorism and terrorist activities at home and
					 abroad, we should recognize that this broader question must also be
					 addressed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing I will join what will certainly be a chorus
					 of voices in this place in thanking the many public servants who have worked
					 diligently and quickly to produce the bill. It was a huge undertaking. The bill
					 contains 146 clauses affecting more than 20 acts of parliament. At the
					 conclusion of this debate the all party justice committee will have the
					 formidable task of scrutinizing the bill and quite possibly suggesting solid
					 amendments to have it carried, we hope, unanimously.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I for one have every confidence that each and every
					 member of parliament on the committee will address the legislation with an eye
					 to reaffirming Canadian values and ensuring that our country's renowned respect
					 for diversity and justice is reinforced.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to
					 participate in the important debate on Bill C-36, the government's
					 anti-terrorism act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is without question deep concern among Canadians
					 across the country about the horrific acts that took place on September 11. As
					 we begin to come to terms with what happened and determine what kind of
					 responses there need to be, we in the New Democratic Party have stated clearly
					 every day in the House that our response should be undertaken through the
					 United Nations and in accordance with international law. It should be a
					 response that promotes peace and justice rather than further violence and
					 militarism. The NDP has articulated that position very well even if it is not
					 popular to do so these days.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addressing the bill before us today in terms of the
					 measures we are prepared to take and the powers we should confer upon law
					 enforcement agencies, there may be a rush to get the legislation through.
					 However it is incumbent upon us as members of parliament and upholders of the
					 public interest to have a sober analysis and review of the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have heard a lot of talk in the House today that the
					 bill would provide the necessary tools to law enforcement agencies. A lot of
					 members have remarked on that. I and my colleagues in the NDP want to make sure
					 those tools do not become sledgehammers that undermine or crush civil liberties
					 and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In speaking to the bill we must be circumspect. We must
					 be thoughtful and look at what its impact would be not only in the short term
					 but in the long term. I have been reading through various opinions of experts
					 and lawyers and look forward to the opinions of witnesses who will go to the
					 committee. One opinion in particular struck me. The president of the Ontario
					 Criminal Lawyers’ Association was quoted in the media today as saying that to
					 turn Canada into a police state in the name of liberty is bizarre. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we examine the bill we must look at each and every
					 clause to ensure that the broad powers and measures it contains will be used in
					 a way that ensures continued public accountability, transparency and due
					 process of law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an interesting article in the <i>Globe and
					 Mail</i> today which said that most Canadians would not be terribly
					 inconvenienced by the justice minister's proposals. It said the costs would
					 instead be borne by people who find themselves targets of police suspicion
					 because of their ethnic background, radical political views or association with
					 immigrant communities that have ties with groups deemed to be terrorist
					 fronts.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was an interesting commentary. It may well be that
					 most Canadians support the legislation because they do not see that it would
					 have an impact on them. They see it as powerful tool to deal with their
					 legitimate fears about terrorist attacks. </p>


	<A NAME="T1655"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1655"><!-- Hour: 4--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1700"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1650"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1655)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we must examine what the measures are and how
					 they would be applied. One thing I am concerned about is how the measures in
					 the act would be targeted to certain groups in our society. Are there adequate
					 protections in the bill to ensure that the strong measures and broad powers it
					 contains will be targeted, as the member for London West has said, to people
					 who are engaged in terrorist activities and not merely members of this or that
					 group? Will the legislation have an application and political weight that
					 begins to take on a broader net?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today in the House during question period I raised the
					 issue of students from other countries who come to Canada to study. It has been
					 confirmed by the RCMP that such students are being questioned and investigated,
					 particularly if they are in engineering or scientific programs and courses.
					 While there may be reason to do this, why do we single out a group of people
					 based on their ethnic background, country of origin or what they are studying?
					 This may have an important impact on Canadian students of colour who may be of
					 Arabic background or Muslim students who begin to feel they are being targeted
					 in some way. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is disturbing. A commentary in the <i>Globe and
					 Mail</i> said that many of us will not be inconvenienced by the act. It said we
					 will go about our business as usual and not feel targeted in any way. Given the
					 backlash that has already taken place in the country we must be terribly
					 concerned about the bill's impact in terms of targeting visible minorities,
					 political activists or even labour activists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will focus on three specific areas of Bill C-36. As
					 others have mentioned, it is a massive bill. It contains about 170 pages and
					 146 clauses. None of us have had time yet to go through it thoroughly. We hope
					 that will happen at committee. However it struck me that there are three things
					 we must look at carefully in terms of the balance between our need to protect
					 civil liberties under the charter of rights and freedoms and our need to
					 protect safety and security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the definition of terrorist activity concerns
					 me. Bill C-36 defines a terrorist activity as an action in or outside Canada
					 that is taken or threatened for political, religious or ideological purposes
					 and threatens the public or national security by killing, seriously harming or
					 endangering a person, causing substantial property damage that is likely to
					 seriously harm people, or interfering with or disrupting an essential service,
					 facility or system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The definition is carefully circumscribed to make it
					 clear that disrupting an essential service is not a terrorist activity if it
					 occurs during a lawful protest or work strike and is not intended to cause
					 serious harm to persons. The Minister of Justice addressed this in the House
					 today when she was asked about it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However we must closely examine this definition of
					 terrorist activity and ask a substantive question: Have activities taken place
					 in Canada that could be characterized as terrorist activities under the
					 proposed legislation? There are several that come to mind. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently in B.C. members of a health care union
					 participated in illegal strike activity. They walked out on a rotating basis.
					 It was not a lawful protest or work strike as defined in the legislation.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings to mind that even Canada has historically
					 developed anti-trust laws which were meant to prevent corporate monopolies from
					 controlling goods and services but which in actual fact were used against
					 labour unions to prevent them from organizing. The anti-trust laws were used
					 against unions to take away people's right to organize.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These historical references are very important. I have
					 a very serious concern about the definition that is being used. While I
					 appreciate the fact that the government lawyers and the government side have
					 gone to some lengths to try to come up with a definition that is specific, it
					 seems to me that the way it is written is very problematic. It raises the
					 question with me as to how broadly that could be applied.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, along with my colleagues, participated in Quebec
					 City at the summit of the Americas. We participated in the protests. To
					 reiterate the remarks of our House leader in debate earlier today, he made it
					 quite clear when he said that lawful sounds good, but there were a lot of young
					 people who thought they were engaged in lawful protest in Quebec City way
					 beyond the perimeter who did not challenge the wall or engage in property
					 damage or anything like that. There were people who did participate in other
					 forms of more direct action. How would those activities be characterized under
					 the legislation, perhaps not in the next few months or in the next year, but
					 what about several years from now, or if this legislation is still around, a
					 decade from now? The definition of terrorist activity is of much
					 concern.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the other area I have a lot of concerns about
					 is the whole notion of preventive arrest. This is something that is quite a new
					 feature in terms of Canadian law and gives enormous powers to law enforcement
					 agencies to arrest and detain people on the suspicion that they are about to
					 commit a terrorist activity. While on the one hand I think that may make people
					 feel safe and secure, it is demanded of us as parliamentarians to ask what
					 kinds of protections there will be in this legislation to ensure that this very
					 broad power is not abused and that people are not simply picked up willy-nilly
					 all over the place for whatever activity might be deemed to be suspicious or
					 somehow related to a terrorist activity. As I say, these are only a few of the
					 things that jumped out at me as I read through the bill in a very summary
					 way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is the whole notion of an investigative
					 hearing. I am not a lawyer, but my understanding is that this is really very
					 new in Canadian legal undertakings, this idea that the police could compel
					 persons to come forward with information before a judge even though they may
					 not themselves be charged with something or they may not know what
					 investigation is underway. In fact one senior federal official was quoted as
					 saying that we remove the right to silence. To me this was another flag going
					 up in terms of how and how broadly that would be applied. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are three areas that I think are very problematic
					 with this bill. The other aspect I wanted to speak on is the permanency of the
					 bill. I listened to the news last night and heard the comments made by Mr.
					 Clayton Ruby, a very well known criminal lawyer and advocate of civil rights in
					 Canada. I think he is an outstanding member of the legal community. I was very
					 interested to hear his remarks. He reminded us of our history in terms of when
					 legislation like this is brought in how permanent it will be.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presumably it is permanent. We know it will go through
					 a review in three years, but even when our House leader today raised the
					 possibility of the notion of having a sunset clause, it seemed to me that the
					 government was very reluctant to respond to that and basically shuffled it
					 aside. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Ruby basically characterized this legislation as
					 war measures legislation. I do believe we have to look at our history. We have
					 to look at what it is that we are embarking upon. This weekend in Ottawa at the
					 federal council of the New Democratic Party we had a very extensive debate
					 about what took place on September 11, what the party's position has been and
					 what it should say as events continue to unfold. I will quote part of the
					 resolution that was passed by our federal council and brought forward by our
					 international affairs committee. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The resolution states:</p>

						  history of internment of Japanese Canadians and the proclamation of the War
						  Measures Act in similar circumstances.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can already hear some people asking why we would drag
					 that up, saying that this is a different situation, but I really wonder if it
					 is. Again, I believe it is incumbent upon us as members of the House who uphold
					 the public interest to look at our history and consider that when these actions
					 were taken, the War Measures Act, the internment of Japanese Canadians, there
					 was also a political climate of wanting to take strong retaliatory action. In
					 hindsight now, in the one case 50 years ago and the other case 30 years ago,
					 there is a serious questioning as to whether or not those particular policies
					 were things that actually needed to be done. I suppose we can say that
					 hindsight is always perfect and we can always look for ways to criticize
					 something that was done.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, surely we can learn by examining the
					 legislation that took place then and what its impact was on civil society and
					 civil rights, and the singling out of identifiable people, in one instance
					 Canadians of Japanese origin and in the other instance political activists. Our
					 whole society was impacted by that in a very negative way.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I took Mr. Ruby's comments very much to heart as a
					 sobering reflection on what the House is poised to do in terms of bringing in
					 the legislation, which from all that we have been given to understand, will be
					 permanent. What impact will that have on our civil liberties in the longer
					 term? What kinds of powers are we giving to law enforcement agencies that will
					 begin to turn us more and more into a society where more control is given to
					 law enforcement agencies?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people may argue that is good and that is the
					 price of fighting terrorism, but I think we have to examine that. We have to
					 weigh that balance between civil liberties and the need for security. We have
					 to ensure that we do protect civil liberties and rights and freedoms in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said yesterday that he was genuinely
					 interested in hearing amendments and feedback as this goes through committee. I
					 hope that is true because to remove the protection for civil liberties is
					 something that we are possibly on the brink of doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have serious reservations about the bill. As it
					 continues to go through committee some of those issues will come forward. I
					 hope that members of the House will not be in such a rush to pass this
					 legislation that will deeply offend the basic values of democracy and civil
					 liberties in Canada in order to do what they believe is politically expedient
					 and because there is public concern in regard to passing
					 legislation.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member for his
					 thoughtful question. I am very aware of the fact that it was the present Prime
					 Minister, then minister of justice, who brought in the charter of rights. That
					 was a good thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I am also reminded that it was previous Liberal
					 governments that brought in some of the best social programs we have had in
					 this country and, I might add, with a lot of influence from New Democratic
					 members of parliament, but it was also Liberal governments that took away those
					 social programs. Nothing is static.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really what I am trying to get at in terms of
					 the political environment we are in and that the charter exists in. As we move
					 forward with the legislation we have to make sure that the intent, the
					 philosophy and the protection provided in the charter are actually protected
					 within the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can only say to the member that members in this party
					 have no wish to engage in political rhetoric. We are genuinely interested in
					 looking at the bill. That was clearly stated by our House leader, the member
					 for Winnipeg--Transcona, yesterday when the bill was introduced, although he
					 did make it very clear that we are not prepared to give blanket approval to the
					 bill and we are not prepared to rubber stamp it. In fact we will have our own
					 discussion about what we decide to do in terms of the support for this
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we participate at the committee the member can be
					 assured that we will be addressing the points that have come forward already in
					 terms of concerns and criticisms. I am sure there will be many more and I am

					 extraordinary times and quite often extraordinary times require extraordinary
					 measures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the hon. member expresses concern about us perhaps
					 infringing upon the rights of some of our citizens, I wonder if we talked to

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wonder where the member draws the line. It is easy
					 enough to say that we cannot infringe upon the rights of individuals, but
					 individuals caused the problems we have today. If we do not take measures to

					 good to us if we end up like a lot of people did on September 11.</p>

	Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question. It is a very

					 in this bill truly provide a society where we feel more secure? That is part of
					 the question that we are debating. I agree that we are not living in ordinary

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is our job. Our job is to go through that, make

					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear all the time that there are inherently evil

					 the best of intentions. There are people who abuse that. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To offset that in this time of crisis for our nation

					 parameters to the rights we all have that are contained in various pieces of
					 legislation. On a purely theoretical basis I do not object to that. </p>

	Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time today with the
					 member for Kitchener--Waterloo. A few weeks ago following the terrorist attacks
					 in New York City on September 11 we met in the House to debate a motion that
					 called on our government to introduce anti-terrorism legislation as soon as
					 possible. I am pleased to see that the minister and her staff have been able to
					 respond this quickly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to express my strong support for Bill C-36, a
					 made in Canada legislative response to the problems of terrorism. It is a
					 response that we hope will be effective, while being drawn up in such a way as
					 to be respectful of the constitutionality of the protected rights of
					 Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This legislation gives expression to our common resolve
					 as Canadians to ensure that those persons who plan or direct terrorist attacks
					 and those persons and entities that play a role in supporting them financially,
					 or otherwise provide them with the material support which facilitates such
					 acts, are denounced as criminals and brought to justice no matter where they
					 may be found.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians believe that all acts of terrorism are
					 criminal and unjustifiable and that they should be condemned as such. We are
					 confident that by enacting such legislation we are joining other like minded
					 countries around the world in efforts to prevent the commission of similar
					 crimes in the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians would agree that the objective of enacting
					 effective anti-terrorism legislation is laudable and necessary. Canadians would
					 also want us to reflect in a sober and critical fashion on the nature of such
					 legislation. I do not believe they would agree that it is necessary to abandon
					 our values, which make Canada a free and democratic society, to fight
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that the preamble to the bill contains
					 language through which parliament recognizes that the requirements of national
					 security and the need to combat global terrorism must be carried out with due
					 regard to the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Canadian charter so that we
					 can be true to the values of our society even as we battle this terrible
					 thing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has worked in concert with the international
					 community for many years to pursue initiatives that are intended to reduce the
					 threat posed by international terrorists. It should be noted that Canadian
					 diplomats played a leading role in the negotiation of the two most recent
					 international counterterrorism conventions, namely the international convention
					 for the suppression of terrorist bombing and the international convention for
					 the suppression of the financing of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to comment on the specific aspects of Bill C-36.
					 When the Canadian government signed these international counterterrorism
					 agreements it was seen as a commitment by Canada to move toward their
					 ratification at some time in the future. Unfortunately that time has
					 arrived.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The draft legislation contains measures that would
					 allow Canada to implement three international conventions, two of which concern
					 the fight against terrorism. The most recent of these is the international
					 convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism, which would
					 outlaw fundraising activities in support of terrorism and create provisions for
					 the seizure and forfeiture of the assets belonging to the terrorists or placed
					 at their disposal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also give effect to United Nations security
					 council resolution 1373 of September 28 that requires all states to take action
					 to prevent and suppress terrorist financing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 contains measures to implement the
					 international convention for the suppression of terrorist bombings that Canada
					 signed in 1998 in response to an increase in recent years of terrorist attacks
					 directed against civilian and government targets by means of explosive devices
					 or biological and chemical substances. In one of these indiscriminate attacks
					 in November 1996 a Canadian woman was killed in a terrorist bombing of a Paris
					 subway station.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would implement the convention on the safety
					 of United Nations and associated personnel. While this convention is not
					 regarded as a counterterrorism agreement it does cover acts of violence
					 directed against the official premises, private accommodation or means of
					 transportation of United Nations or associated personnel. It recognizes that
					 there is a need for appropriate and effective measures to prevent attacks
					 against the United Nations and associated personnel.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The implementation of each of these conventions
					 requires amendments to the criminal code to ensure that the crimes identified
					 in each of these agreements are offences under our law and to extend the
					 jurisdiction of Canadian courts over terrorist activities abroad.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person alleged to have committed a convention crime
					 abroad may be prosecuted in Canada if after the commission of the offence he or
					 she is found in Canada and is not extradited to another state that could also
					 claim jurisdiction over the offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly under the amendments proposed in Bill C-36 a
					 person responsible for a terrorist bombing of a public transportation system in
					 another country in which a Canadian was killed or injured could be extradited
					 to Canada to stand trial here for that offence.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has taken these steps to ensure that terrorists
					 are brought to justice by effectively denying them sanctuary after the
					 commission of a terrorist crime. There should be no safe havens for terrorists.
					 The terrorist attacks in the cities of New York and Washington on September 11
					 demonstrated to all of us that there is an urgent need for the international
					 community to act together in concert to ensure that each has effective
					 legislation in place to choke off fundraising efforts for terrorists and to
					 enact the necessary legislation to implement the entire series of international
					 and anti-terrorism agreements.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I congratulate the Minister of Justice and all those
					 who worked so hard and so very quickly to bring forth Bill C-36. Bill C-36
					 contains the additional measures that our law enforcement and security services
					 require to meet the threat posed by terrorism. It is simultaneously focused,
					 effective, broad reaching and reflective of Canadian values. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will have an opportunity to do some work on the
					 bill in the justice committee. There are issues that we all share. For example,
					 should there be a sunset clause? How do we protect against abuse of powers?
					 These are issues that will certainly be dealt with in committee. </p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am happy to have the opportunity to
					 speak in favour of Bill C-287 in principle, and I will expand on that later
					 on.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Davenport is a very strong
					 environmentalist. He has brought forth an issue which the vast majority of
					 Canadians are asking for. They are asking for public debate on the labelling of
					 genetically modified food.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know from a myriad of public opinion surveys, which
					 we should not use exclusively, that the vast majority of Canadians are in
					 support of mandatory labelling of genetically modified food. A recent poll in
					 the <i>Globe and Mail</i> cited it at 95.2% and a recent Decima poll had it at
					 87%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this private member's bill replicates the
					 Progressive Conservative position with respect to mandatory labelling of
					 genetically modified food, we said in our election platform last November that
					 we would work toward a law that would require the mandatory labelling of
					 genetically modified food. We think that is where Canadians are and that is
					 what we have before us today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-287 tabled by the hon. member for Davenport has
					 some very serious flaws which we would like to bring forth. The Progressive
					 Conservative Party and our coalition partners in the DRC are concerned about
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One is that the bill states that in order for a food to
					 be defined as genetically modified free it must have a threshold of less than
					 1% of GMO. Even the best infrastructure we could have in place today would make
					 that extremely difficult to utilize. The Europeans are using a threshold of
					 5%.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another aspect we are immensely concerned about is the
					 very real fact that the physical infrastructure is simply not in place to be
					 able to, for example in the case of grains and oilseeds, separate those that
					 are genetically modified from those that are GMO free.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The position we would like to talk about is quite
					 simple. Bill C-287 is not intended to add health or safety benefits to the
					 products of biotech. It is about Canadians' right to know what they are
					 eating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there is some difference of opinion about what
					 the right approach would be, the Progressive Conservative Party and our
					 coalition partners believe we should work toward a law to have mandatory
					 labelling.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are supporting this legislation in order to have the
					 debate the Government of Canada should be having. That is why we are supporting
					 it in principle at second reading. However the bill in its current form would
					 be more difficult to support at third reading.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biotechnology depends for its future success upon an
					 informed and supportive public. Measures are needed to build public trust and
					 gain the public's confidence in the safety of the food made using genetically
					 modified plants and animals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the biotech industry is a safe
					 industry. This is not about the safety of our food but the minimum we should be
					 providing to Canadians is the public right to know.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the platform I spoke about earlier we said quite
					 clearly that we would work toward a law requiring the labelling of genetically
					 modified foodstuffs. We support Bill C-287 in principle on the basis of
					 studying the matter further at committee. We need to say yes to debate and yes
					 to discussion. That is the position we wish to follow at this time.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandatory labelling can occur in the future only if it
					 is done in a cost effective way in concert with food labelling policies of
					 other major food producing and trading countries. We are in a situation where
					 there is not an established process with respect to mandatory labelling. The
					 Europeans will have that in place very soon. We need to build more confidence
					 in biotech. Labelling and having the confidence to label is a step in that
					 direction. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are countries that question the food safety or
					 the marketability of the product. Our farmers know that they have to respond to
					 this. The wheat farmers in Canada have said on previous occasions that they
					 would prefer that we just get away from genetically modified wheat, that they
					 do not want to be held at a competitive disadvantage either. Right now
					 genetically modified soy cannot be marketed to Japan. Canola cannot be sold to
					 Europe if it is genetically modified. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to touch on a couple of issues that other
					 individuals may raise throughout the context of this debate. There has been a
					 fair amount of misinformation with respect to the report that was recently
					 tabled by the Royal Society, in which voluntary labelling was recommended. That
					 should be considered. I do not think that is where we will ultimately
					 go.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to its study, the Royal Society of Canada
					 said that the panel recognizes there are broader social, political and ethical
					 considerations and debate about mandatory labelling of GM foods that lie
					 outside the panel's specific mandate. The discussion was not intended to
					 provide an answer to the issue of mandatory labelling. It simply said that it
					 was not within its mandate.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have an august direction to take if a range of
					 Canadians from 95.2%, as the <i>Globe and Mail</i> said, to 87%, according to
					 the Decima poll,say that mandatory labelling is something they want to proceed
					 with. It would be very wrong and very ill advised to vote against Bill C-287
					 and not at least have that discussion in committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what private members' bills are about: to
					 educate the public, perhaps to embarrass the government on occasion if it is
					 not going in a certain direction so that we can advance public policy. I want
					 to congratulate the member for Davenport for bringing the bill forward although
					 it has some very identifiable flaws in that we do not have the infrastructure
					 in place today. The percentage he utilized is wrong as well. However it would
					 be prudent for us to at least have a discussion at committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am concerned on one aspect. I received a letter from
					 the Minister of Health dated October 11, just five days ago, wherein he stated
					 that voluntary labelling was the only route to take. I refer to a letter he
					 sent to a constituent of mine who is a strong advocate of mandatory labelling,
					 Sister Angelina Martz of the Sisters of Charity of the Immaculate Conception of
					 St. John. She writes to me quite often. She consistently advances public
					 policy. I was pleased to at least support the perspective of that constituent.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians have made it very clear that they want to
					 take this direction. We may have some concerns in terms of the timing of this
					 initiative because the very last thing we would want to do is take even a
					 nickel away from the farmers at the farm gate.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are heading in the direction of mandatory labelling
					 at some point in time. It is only prudent for us to at least have the
					 discussion before Canadians and talk about the pluses and minuses and about the
					 right timing to go forward with it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We would like to vote in principle for the bill at
					 second reading, but if the bill comes back at third reading in the exact form
					 it is in right now, it will be difficult to support it.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to speak this
					 evening to Bill C-287, which in my view is necessary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is vital that we recognize the desire of Canadians,
					 which is consistent across the country, to ensure that labelling of genetically
					 modified foods is made mandatory. This is the primary purpose of this
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the principle, I believe that the vast majority
					 of Canadians are in agreement and I also believe that it is our duty to carry
					 out their wishes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the bill require any amendments, corrections or
					 adjustments? Perhaps. It is in committee that this work must be done. I
					 therefore intend to support the bill at second reading so that the appropriate
					 House of Commons committee can study it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be pointed out that supporting this bill is
					 not voting against genetically modified foods. Some people make this
					 connection. They say that anyone supporting this bill is automatically against
					 the existence of genetically modified foods and the fact that they are sold on
					 the Canadian market. That is simply not true.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept of mandatory labelling is not ipso facto
					 systematic opposition to genetically modified food. On the contrary, it is
					 instead a proposal of choice, relating to the principle that consumers are
					 entitled to know what they are eating. Our bottom line is merely a call for
					 support of that principle, the consumer's right to know what he or she is
					 consuming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That right manifests itself in the labelling of the
					 foods we buy in our grocery stores. That is what this bill seeks to
					 do.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is this a vote against our farmers. I say the
					 opposite is true; it is vote in favour of our farmers. If Canadian consumers no
					 longer have the right to know what they are consuming as far as GMOs are
					 concerned, the next step will be a food boycott.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, the desire to protect the farmer, which
					 appears to be the motivation of those opposed to this bill, is in danger of
					 turning against the very people it is trying to help, that is, this country's
					 farmers. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a vote against the farmers, nor against
					 genetically modified foods. It is vote in favour of the consumers' right to
					 know what they are consuming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit that I was somewhat stymied by a little
					 document sent to our offices today encouraging MPs to vote against this bill.
					 It comes from the agrifood industry. A number of points are raised in it and I
					 would like to address a few of them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the first, in which they claim a vote in favour
					 of the bill is a vote of censure, states as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>A vote in favour of Bill C-287 means
						  a vote of censure against our world-class regulatory bodies.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the case at all. This means that if a vote
					 in the House amends or expands upon a legislative measure, or some regulatory
					 measure. it represents censure of the body responsible. This is not the
					 case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What it is instead is a demonstration that our society
					 is evolving, our knowledge is evolving, our ability to genetically modify
					 foods, non-existent fifteen or so years ago, now does exist and needs to be
					 reflected in our regulations, in our legislation. This is not censure. Saying
					 that it is, in a way, is taking us for fools.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second point that is raised, I will read in
					 English.</p>


	<A NAME="T1835"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1835"><!-- Hour: 6--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1840"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1830"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1835)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

						  containing GM ingredients, estimated at 60-70% of products currently on store
						  shelves, despite the fact that they have undergone a rigorous approval process.
						  </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we vote against Bill C-287, that is what this means.
					 I have a serious doubt about that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague who spoke before me referred to a very
					 important document, entitled “Recommendation for Regulation of Food
					 Biotechnology in Canada”, prepared by an expert panel of the Royal Society of
					 Canada. It is important to note what they recommended for security in our food
					 system. Recommendations 8.1 and 8.2 state:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Panel recommends the
						  precautionary regulatory assumption that, in general, new technologies should
						  not be presumed safe unless there is a reliable scientific basis for
						  considering them safe. The Panel rejects the use of “substantial equivalence”
						  as a decision threshold to exempt new GM products from rigorous safety
						  assessments on the basis of superficial similarities because such a regulatory
						  procedure is not a precautionary assignment of the burden of proof.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The Panel recommends that the primary
						  burden of proof be upon those who would deploy food biotechnology products to
						  carry out the full range of tests necessary to demonstrate reliably that they
						  do not pose unacceptable risks.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that in some circumstances we are relying on
					 the concept of substantial equivalence to determine that. The Royal Society has
					 determined that it is not appropriate.</p>

	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third point made is as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>If the bill is passed, producers will
						  be forced to reformulate their food products with ingredients that do not
						  contain GMOs, as they have had to do in other countries.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This raises the following question: If it is what
					 consumers want, then is it not up to vendors to ensure that they get it,
					 especially when it is feasible? Who is deciding here? Consumers or vendors? Are
					 we being asked to reverse the law of supply and demand? It is completely
					 absurd. We could not, because we would have to change what we are offering
					 consumers, and give them what they want. It is completely backwards.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are told that if we support the bill there will be a
					 drop in investment in biotechnology which will lead to the loss of beneficial
					 genetic technologies and life sciences programs in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would assert that the opposite is true. If this
					 technology poses no risks, then why not be up front? The best way to do this is
					 through mandatory labelling on genetically modified food products.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, consumers will become aware of what
					 they are eating, which will have the opposite effect: a greater acceptance of
					 the technology and therefore more private sector investment in order to offer
					 more products. However, the opposite of what they claim is also true. If in
					 fact the country does not require mandatory labelling of genetically modified
					 foods, there may be a backlash. Consumers may well say “If you will not give us
					 want we want in terms of information, we will obtain it some other way. We will
					 insist on it”. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some companies have already decided not to stock
					 genetically modified products in their stores. The consequences for our
					 farmers, agricultural industries and the agrifood sector are serious. We would
					 be wise to think carefully before voting blindly.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, they say a vote against Bill C-287 would
					 ensure that food companies would continue their ongoing dialogue with consumers
					 about manufacturing processes, including the use of GM ingredients, the toll
					 free number and websites.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have just given us the solution for mandatory
					 labelling. It is very simple. We can design a symbol and that symbol could be
					 affixed on food products, be they packaged or not. When people buy fresh food
					 products, be they vegetables or fruits, they will find a sticker with numbers
					 on them, including where they have been grown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That symbol of genetically modified food products could
					 become universal, as other symbols have become, and could be affixed on all
					 food products, packaged or otherwise, with a website address or a 1-800 number
					 for Canadians to call and get the information they want.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is asking that we put a label on each apple.
					 However, a person could easily find out how a particular food product has been
					 modified genetically through a website address or a 1-800 number, thereby
					 giving the consumer what he or she deserves, that is, the information they want
					 in order to determine what they eat. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what is at stake here. It is not a vote against
					 genetically modified foods. It is not a vote against our farming community. It
					 is a vote in favour of consumers.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has a symbiotic relationship between the farming
					 community and the urban community. Whenever our farming community needs help,
					 quite often the urban community comes through, perhaps in some cases not enough
					 and I recognize that, but it has come through by way of tax grants and
					 programs.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reverse is also true. Not only the urban community,
					 where the bulk of consumers is located, but Canadians everywhere are demanding
					 to know, via mandatory labelling, whether they are consuming genetically
					 modified foods. That is to the advantage of our farming community as
					 well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we vote on this tomorrow, I invite all my
					 colleagues to vote in favour of sending this bill to committee so we can seize
					 the government of this important matter.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, as the public who is watching this debate
					 may know, the issue is a private member's bill which would mandate that there
					 be a label placed on all foods that are genetically modified. It would say
					 either “This food is genetically modified” or “This food contains an ingredient
					 that is genetically modified”. The fact is that there are pros and cons to this
					 move, as there are to most moves. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First I would like to tell the public what this bill
					 means by genetically modified. It states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>“Genetically modified food” means a food that is derived from a
						  plant, animal, microorganism or other biological entity capable of transferring
						  or replicating genetic material including sterile organisms, viruses and
						  viroids when such entity possesses a novel combination of genetic material
						  obtained through the use of modern biotechnology.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is biotechnology producing a novel trait in a
					 particular food or food product.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to also quote to the public from an
					 article by Peter McCourt who is a professor in the botany department at the
					 University of Toronto and holds an NSERC chair in plant genetics. He is an
					 expert.The reason I am quoting Mr. McCourt is to shed a bit more light for the
					 public on the whole matter of genetic modification of foods and crops.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The argument is that the insertion of
						  genes often combined with novel DNA sequences that regulate their expression in
						  the plant could result in unpredictable effects. Although this could be true,
						  it is just as likely to occur in nature or by any other traditional breeding
						  process. The food we eat has been continuously genetically engineered by
						  natural phenomena in ways that do not differ from the way we carry out GM
						  technology now. For example, up to 20 percent of some plant genomes contain
						  genetic elements that destabilize genes and genomes, move the genes around,
						  mutate and rearrange themselves randomly. Furthermore, the hybridization of
						  genomes of various species that occurs in traditional breeding programs also
						  leads to new and untested combinations of genes. The mistakable safety argument
						  is that the problem is the process of crop production. The concern should be on
						  the product--not how it was made. No food product, whether traditional or
						  modified by recombinant DNA, is without risk; this is why government agencies
						  test these products.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I understand Mr. McCourt to say is that the
					 genetic modification of food can and does occur naturally as well as by design,
					 and that the issue is not how the genetic modification occurs but whether the
					 food is safe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The questions for the public are these. First, is
					 genetically modified food safe for me? Second, if I am in doubt about that,
					 should I have a label on the food that at least lets me know that what I am
					 eating may have been or was genetically modified, bearing in mind that genetic
					 modification can be by design and also can occur naturally, according to a
					 genetics expert?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to place before the public and before the
					 House some of the pros and cons that I have gathered in discussing and reading
					 about this issue. I would like to thank my colleagues who have been very
					 helpful to me in understanding this, the member for Selkirk--Interlake and my
					 colleague from Nanaimo--Alberni, who is also with me as health critic.

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will list the pros of labelling food as genetically

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is inadequate scientific testing at the

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, safety should be the first and foremost
					 consideration. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, even existing science on the subject has been
					 influenced by the industry that depends on foods and food processing for jobs
					 and income. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, labelling gives people a choice because if they
					 know a food is genetically modified and they are concerned, they can eat
					 something else. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, the Royal Society of Canada's expert panel
					 says that there is currently no systematic scientific evaluation process to
					 establish the safety of GM foods for human consumption.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are some of the main reasons I have heard to
					 support mandatory labelling of genetically modified foods. However, I can also
					 provide an equal number of arguments against it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the European Union recently released a study
					 which found no significant problems with genetically modified foods.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, we should not make public policy on maybes. If
					 there is no scientific evidence, then we should not legislate. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, there is already mandatory labelling when
					 particular foods or products have been demonstrated to be a health risk or
					 concern. For example, foods containing genetically modified products that lead
					 to the same result as maybe peanuts or other nuts, to which some people are
					 allergic, are already labelled.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there would be massive costs to mandating a
					 label for all foods that are genetically modified or contain genetically
					 modified elements. This massive cost would really hurt the agriculture and food
					 processing industries. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, the science to date shows no unacceptable risk.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, labelling would suggest there is a problem. In
					 other words, people would ask why the government is putting a label on
					 something if there is no good reason to do so. They could conclude that there
					 must be a problem if there is a label. That would cause concerns where there
					 ought not be any or where there is no evidence that there are any real
					 concerns. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last argument is that our largest trading partner,
					 the U.S., with which we conduct 80% of trade, would likely refuse to send us
					 food if it had to label it because that would be a huge cost, especially when
					 there are no food safety risks yet shown.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like anything else, there are arguments for and against
					 mandatory labelling. I think my colleagues in the House who have suggested that
					 this matter is serious enough and uncertain enough that it needs further study
					 are correct. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would support a vote in the House to send the bill to
					 the committee so that these pros and cons could be further explored and weighed
					 by members and we could come to a proper conclusion.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a duty to Canadians. We want to do our best for
					 them. We want to make sure that we protect their safety to the greatest
					 reasonable degree and I think only further study by members of the House in
					 committee will allow us to do this.</p>

					 (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few moments to
					 remind the House and Canadians that October 16 is World Food Day. Today is the
					 day when we commemorate the founding of the United Nations Food and Agriculture
					 Organization. It was founded here in Canada, in Quebec City, on October 16,
					 1945. The theme this year is to fight hunger to reduce poverty. It underscores
					 the need to alleviate hunger in order to eradicate poverty around the
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to first congratulate the member for
					 Davenport for his work on this issue and particularly for his work on the
					 environment. In saying that, though, I would have to say that I disagree with
					 his approach on this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that the labelling of genetically modified
					 foods has become an important issue for consumers. However, I do not believe
					 that Bill C-287 is the best way to achieve this goal. Clearly a public
					 discussion involving parliamentarians needs to take place. I am glad that the
					 government has done that and has asked the committee on health to look into
					 this very important issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn to a few specifics for a quick overview of
					 exactly what we do first here in Canada with regard to genetically modified
					 foods.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health Canada and, in particular, the Canadian Food
					 Inspection Agency, share accountability for food labelling policies under the
					 Food and Drugs Act. Health Canada's responsibilities derive from its mandate
					 for health and safety issues. I might say to all members of parliament and
					 Canadians that we have the safest food standards in the world. We can be
					 assured that Canadian food is safe because we have the people in place in the
					 CFIA, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, and in Health Canada who take the
					 time to look at these issues and to look at these foods before they are put on
					 our plates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recognize that the labelling of foods derived from
					 biotechnology has become an important issue for consumers. I am glad that the
					 government continues to discuss these issues with groups within Canada and in
					 international organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognizing that there is a need for a public
					 discussion involving parliamentarians, as I said, the Minister of Health, the
					 Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, the Minister of Industry and the
					 Minister for International Trade contacted and wrote to the members of the
					 health committee asking them to look at this very important issue. There are a
					 number of concerns, particularly in rural Canada, as was mentioned earlier, as
					 to how this sort of labelling would take place and the onus it would put on
					 Canadian farmers today to bear the cost of this labelling. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, one of the initiatives underway in Canada
					 is the development of a Canadian standard for voluntary labelling of foods
					 derived from biotechnology in a project led by the Canadian Grocery Council of
					 Distributors and the Canadian General Standards Board, which are two groups of
					 individuals who have taken the time to consult with Canadians across the
					 country on this very important issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The draft labelling standard was put forward in July
					 2001 and is currently now open for comment from across the country. I would
					 like to say that this group is accepting comments from Canadians who want to be
					 involved and want to have a say on this issue until mid-October, with the final
					 publication of the final standards hopefully by March 2002.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another initiative underway is that of the Canadian
					 biotechnology advisory committee, which is currently preparing advice for
					 government on the regulation of GMO foods, including information provisions to
					 support informed choice with labelling. I guess that is one of the concerns
					 that a number of us had: that the choice of Canadians would be an informed
					 choice. As the hon. member knows, being involved with the European
					 parliamentary association, I do not think they have had the informed choice
					 over there. We want to make sure that Canadians do in fact have that informed
					 choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its interim report released in August, the committee
					 recommended that the government should support the development of an approach
					 to labelling genetically modified foods. It suggested the implementation of a
					 voluntary standard, such as what was being developed by the Canadian General
					 Standards Board, at least initially, in order to test its adequacy and
					 effectiveness and recognize the need for a reliable verification system to
					 support labelling, whether it is a voluntary one or a mandatory one.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It also recognized that the government must continue to
					 work with other countries to develop a harmonized international approach for
					 labelling genetically modified foods. It is critical to have set standards for
					 international trade and for our Canadian products to continue to go into places
					 such as Europe.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee is seeking input on its final draft
					 recommendations and we look forward to learning how Canadians respond to this
					 interim report. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk a bit about what has been said in a few
					 statements by these two groups. The first one is the Royal Society. The Royal
					 Society is a group of Canadians consisting of scientists, researchers and
					 people who are in the know about these sorts of issues. The government has
					 called upon and relied on them to look at this very complex issue and to make
					 some determinations. The Royal Society report stated:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>In the end, however, the Panel
						  concluded that there was not at this time sufficient scientific justification
						  for a general mandatory labelling requirement. However, the Panel concluded
						  that many of the concerns identified in this Report do call for a strongly
						  supported voluntary labelling system for GM foods. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report went on to state:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Many of the concerns voiced in favour
						  of mandatory labelling can be addressed, at least in part, by voluntary labels.
						  This is true, not only of the social, ethical and political concerns, but also
						  of some of the risk-related concerns, especially those related to uncertainties
						  and even fears about unsubstantiated risks associated with GM
						  foods.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The panel believes that strong
						  government support for voluntary labels is an effective way of providing
						  consumer input into these issues, and encourages the Canadian regulatory
						  agencies responsible to establish guidelines for the regulation of reliable,
						  informative, voluntary labels.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian biotechnology advisory committee made the
					 following recommendations. It said that Canada should develop a set of clear
					 labelling criteria regarding the GM content in food and that further effort
					 could be placed on the ongoing labelling initiative of the Canadian General
					 Standards Board and the Canadian Council of Grocery Distributors.</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small> It also recommended we implement the
						  labelling standard voluntarily, at least initially, in order to test its
						  adequacy and effectiveness and widely promote its use so that people have real
						  opportunities to make informed choices. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is certainly the direction in which I think the
					 government should go and it is a direction in which I think we as
					 parliamentarians should go to make sure Canadians across the country have
					 informed choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-287 raises a number of feasibility issues which
					 I believe can be addressed and studied at the Standing Committee on Health. I
					 would like to outline a few of the problems I see. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amendments to the Food and Drugs Act, as proposed in
					 the bill, would, I believe, create a two tiered system for genetically modified
					 foods. Depending on the method used and the development of the specific foods,
					 foods falling under the new definition would be required to be labelled to
					 indicate the method of production while others derived from more traditional
					 modification would be subject to voluntary labelling schemes. I think these
					 sorts of issues need to be addressed at the committee.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What concerns me more is the fact that with the actual
					 implementation of the bill mandatory labelling would require segregation in
					 handling, transportation and processing systems and the cost would be borne by
					 our farmers. The cost of changing the farms and the way they operate would put
					 an undue hardship on farmers. I think that is why farm organizations across the
					 country have looked at the bill and decided that there should be other ways to
					 approach it. I am sure that they, along with consumer groups and other groups,
					 would be more than happy to sit down and discuss the bill when the Standing
					 Committee on Health takes a look at the issue.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-287 is intended to respond to consumer demand
					 for choice. However the better approach to take is the approach being put
					 forward by me, by rural Canadians, and by a group of other interested Canadians
					 who want to talk about this issue and want to appear before the Standing
					 Committee on Health.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, four minutes go by pretty quickly. Perhaps
					 it is my fault, but I wish the Chair had recognized me a little sooner.
					 Regardless, I will try to get my message across in four minutes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the Bloc Quebecois and I agree with the bill on
					 GMO labelling. I think it serves more than getting a debate going, as some have
					 said. Consumers must have a choice. It is time to stop thinking for
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have information from the Association féminine
					 d'éducation et d'action sociale du Québec, the AFEAS. I recall working with a
					 number of ministers in Quebec's national assembly. One minister said to me
					 “When the AFEAS puts its mind to a problem or an issue, it gives considerable
					 thought to it and its comments are real”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say that the AFEAS in Quebec, and especially the
					 one from the St. Maurice region, have expressed their concerns to me about the
					 fact that people are almost obliged to eat genetically modified products. I
					 agree with my Liberal colleague, who said earlier that they have yet to be
					 proven dangerous. True enough, but the opposite has not been proven
					 either.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this debate is important and it should be
					 broad. We have to find out where we are going with GMOs. I remind those
					 watching that I have spent my life in the field of agriculture. I need not tell
					 them that in the past when people wanted to transform an animal and change it
					 genetically they took their time. I am not saying there is anything wrong with
					 going a little faster today, except that I see mistakes being made in genetic
					 improvements. We did not always end up with the animal we thought we would.
					 This applies to plants and to the food we eat as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the genetically modified foods we eat today,
					 there is no evidence that we will not come to regret it, even from a human
					 health standpoint. I agree with the 87% of Canadians and the 89% of Quebecers
					 who, in response to a Léger Marketing poll last July, said that they wanted the
					 government to make labelling of foods which have been genetically modified or
					 which contain genetically modified material mandatory, not
					 voluntary.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this is a start. Even if all that results
					 is that a parliamentary committee has to try to take it further and get to the
					 truth about genetically modified foods, I would be in favour of this bill, but
					 in my opinion we must go further still. The bill must be passed and put into
					 force and stiff fines levied for failure to comply with its
					 provisions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently, provision would be made for identifying
					 content of over 1% of genetically modified material. The 1% is not an
					 objective; it is there in case of error. Consumers have the right to know what
					 they are eating.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I would recall the advertising campaign
					 by a certain company that the consumer was king in its establishment. In Canada
					 and in Quebec, the consumer must continue to be king. He has the right to know
					 what he is eating.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stood in my place on numerous occasions to indicate

					 has chosen to recognize two private members who happen to be Liberals. There

					 recognition of members of each of those parties to speak.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to speak tonight and join in commending the

					 Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to express my
					 support for the government's anti-terrorism legislation, Bill C-36, and for
					 Canada's participation in the international effort to bring to justice the
					 perpetrators of the terrorist attacks of September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are no words adequate to describe the horrors
					 felt by people around the world at the slaughter of thousands of innocents and
					 the images of passenger planes crashing into the twin towers of the World Trade
					 Center. Over six thousand innocent people were slaughtered. Thousands of
					 widows, widowers and orphans were created. Children lost parents and people
					 lost friends and co-workers. No one was untouched. People who did not lose a
					 relative or a friend lost their peace of mind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In combating terrorism we are acting in concert with
					 our NATO allies, which have all agreed to invoke article 5 of the NATO treaty.
					 It states that an aggression against one member country is considered an
					 aggression against all. Our actions are consistent with the United Nations
					 convention on the suppression of terrorist bombing and the right of a nation to
					 defend itself against aggression.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The anti-terrorism act has four objectives: to stop
					 terrorists from getting into Canada and to protect Canadians from terrorist
					 acts; to bring forward tools to identify, prosecute, convict and punish
					 terrorists; to prevent the Canada-U.S. border from being held hostage by
					 terrorists; and to work with the international community to bring terrorists to
					 justice and to address the root causes of such hatred. The bill accomplishes
					 these objectives. These measures are in keeping with the actions of our allies.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation we must be prepared to ensure our safety
					 and security. The bill is not perfect and I hope that committee will recommend
					 a sunset provision. I also expect that other improvements will be proposed in
					 committee. It is incumbent upon free and democratic countries to send a clear
					 message to those who perpetrated the horrible acts of September 11. Therefore
					 we must act. The message is that those who have chosen the path of terror to
					 achieve their political ends will be apprehended and brought to justice.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Governments of countries that support terrorists are
					 equally responsible for the actions of those terrorists. Efforts toward
					 eradication of terrorism will be long term and multi-dimensional and to this
					 end we must dedicate ourselves to eliminating the conditions that breed
					 terrorism. We must strongly censure countries that act in their own military,
					 political or economic interests to support terrorist, fascist and extremist
					 factions in other countries. Their actions cause political destabilization and
					 undermine the integrity of the social, physical and economic infrastructure in
					 those countries. Too often this leads to disenfranchisement, poverty and
					 oppression of people in those countries. The deep rooted resentment and hatred
					 they feel toward those who are seen to have caused their misery is a breeding
					 ground for terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians want the root causes of terrorism addressed.
					 The inequities in affluence between the west and the rest of the people in the
					 global village must also be addressed. Our safety and well-being are not only
					 rooted in creating and supporting political and social conditions and
					 institutions that are sustainable and have the confidence of the people they
					 are intended to serve; we in the west will also have to provide increased
					 resources for human development in troubled societies if we are to be effective
					 in combating terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister said in his address to the NATO
					 parliamentary assembly on October 9 what we can never repeat often enough, that
					 Canada and its coalition partners:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">

						  Our dispute is with the terrorists and the Taliban regime that insists on
						  giving them safe harbour. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people of Afghanistan need our support. They have
					 suffered horribly because of years of drought and war in their country. To this
					 end, Canada and its allies have significantly increased contributions of
					 humanitarian aid for Afghan refugees. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our fight with terrorism does not represent a conflict
					 between religions or cultures. Terrorist acts are in no way supported by the
					 morals, beliefs or practices of Islam. Like all faiths, Islam is about peace,
					 justice and universal brotherhood and encourages harmony among all people.
					 Muslims in Canada and around the world have joined us in condemning
					 terrorism.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are engaged in an armed conflict so we must be
					 particularly vigilant in protecting the rights and security of all our ethnic
					 minorities. It is unacceptable and offensive in a democratic, pluralistic
					 nation such as ours that even one act of intolerance would be perpetrated
					 against our fellow citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have many fellow Canadians who are Muslims,
					 Christians and Jews who are from the Middle East or are of that ancestry and
					 other Canadians who look like they might have come from there. It is important
					 to remember that Judaism, Christianity, Islam and all other religions abhor the
					 terrorism that has taken place. This act was carried out by a small group of
					 fanatic extremists. We must fight any expression of xenophobia by reaching out
					 to our fellow Canadians and speaking out against hate and
					 intolerance.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very pleased to see the strong and consistent
					 efforts made by all parliamentarians and by our government to allay the
					 tensions and fears felt by minorities in our country. Our present actions
					 contrast most favourably with the dark days of our history when the government
					 was the leading force in carrying out acts of intolerance, a past where we
					 interned those we considered dangerous during our wars and whose only sin was
					 being different, the most grievous of these being against Canadians of Japanese
					 descent, thousands of whom were forcibly repatriated to Japan after the last
					 war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we have evolved. Canada has evolved into a
					 country that is made up of people from all over the world representing every
					 religion and ethnic group. We have come together in this country to build one
					 of the most prosperous and inclusive societies. Canada shines as a beacon of
					 hope in the troubled world too often torn by ethnic hatreds and intolerance.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bin Laden, the Taliban and all terrorists feed on
					 hatred and intolerance. It is in their interest to promote hatred so they can
					 carry out their terrorist acts. Every Canadian and every individual concerned
					 with terrorism can join the war against terrorism by working for an inclusive
					 society at home and abroad. We can do so by reaching out to people and
					 respecting their different religions and cultures and their humanity. We will
					 not tolerate any expressions of racism in our communities. The anti-terrorist
					 legislation, Bill C-36, strengthens our laws on hate crimes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I would like to express my support for and
					 gratitude to the courageous men and women of our armed forces. I believe that I
					 can speak for everyone in the House in wishing them a safe return to their
					 homes and families after they complete their tour of duty in making our country
					 a safer place.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I listened with great attentiveness to my
					 hon. colleague's speech on this important piece of legislation. I know that the
					 hon. member represents an area of the country where there are a lot of
					 factories, both large and small, that are very reliant upon north-south trade
					 with our U.S. neighbour.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly one of the great concerns that I have heard
					 expressed since the tragedy of September 11 is how this is impacting on and
					 threatening the huge trade relationship we have with the United States. I have
					 heard a number expressed by one of the hon. member's colleagues in the Liberal
					 Party indicating that nowadays there is upward of $1.4 billion a day in trade
					 between our nations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously one of the concerns being expressed by people
					 whose livelihoods are contingent upon the free flow of goods between our
					 nations is the whole idea that we can either work with the United States in
					 negotiating a comparable system of securing our borders so that we continue to
					 enjoy that trade or we can see it increasingly put at risk by not reassuring
					 the Americans that we have the willingness to basically wed our systems so that
					 they can feel comfortable that our standards, if you will, of securing our
					 borders from any would-be terrorists are as high as the standards employed in
					 the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that as a backdrop I will put a question to the
					 hon. member. I know it is of great concern to him because, as I have said, of
					 the huge economic impact that the fallout from this despicable action of
					 September 11 has had on his riding in particular. I would ask for his comments
					 about securing this perimeter of North America rather than looking at us as
					 individual nations in that sense.</p>

				  </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his
					 question. There is no question about it. Trade with the United States
					 represents a big part of the economy in my community. Nothing more exemplifies
					 that than the little gadget produced by Research In Motion which, I just found
					 out today, is being worn by every member of the United States congress. It is
					 called a BlackBerry. It is worn by the members of the United States congress
					 because it was one device that continued to function on September 11 when the
					 cellphone airwaves were jammed. This is just one example. We have many
					 industries in my community that very much rely on trade between Canada and the
					 U.S.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is quite correct. If we were to allow the
					 terrorist acts of September 11 to impair the economies of Canada and the United
					 States then we certainly would be letting the terrorists win. I will say to the
					 member that I have a great deal of sympathy for the idea of the Schengen
					 agreement that was negotiated in the European Union.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can come to some kind of arrangement to ease
					 transborder traffic and I can also say to the member that in many cases the
					 standards in Canada in terms of gaining access to the country are higher from a
					 security perspective than they are in the United States. Clearly the member has
					 touched upon an area that is of vital concern to both nations. I trust that it
					 will be adequately addressed.</p>

					 PC/DR): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to
					 add my comments to those expressed earlier on Bill C-36, the anti-terrorism
					 act, by my coalition colleague from Pictou--Antigonish--Guysborough.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I begin my comments on the bill itself, I would
					 like to extend a sincere thanks on behalf of my constituents in Prince
					 George--Peace River, and perhaps on behalf of all Canadians, to the architects
					 of the anti-terrorism bill, who dropped everything and began working I suspect
					 around the clock in order to have this bill ready for presentation to the House
					 yesterday.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One can only imagine how onerous this task must have
					 appeared during the first few meetings on those first few days. Yet the
					 challenge was met with a level of confidence and professionalism of which all
					 Canadians should be greatly proud.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sadly it is often the case that the work and sacrifices
					 of these dedicated individuals goes unnoticed or unappreciated. I would like to
					 assure everyone involved in the drafting of this legislation that the entire
					 country has taken notice of their work and thanks them for their
					 sacrifice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the opposition, it is not very often
					 that I find myself in the position of agreeing with something that the
					 government has done or that it has made a commitment to do. The fundamental
					 differences in our values and beliefs are what keep us on opposite sides of the
					 House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However there are occasions such as yesterday, when the
					 government supported our supply day motion condemning the attacks of September
					 11, affirming our support for the men and women of our military headed overseas
					 and the joint meeting of the defence and foreign affairs committees, where the
					 government finds itself supporting the opposition or conversely the opposition
					 supporting the government.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The international war against terrorism is one such
					 occasion. I commend the government and the Minister of Justice for undertaking
					 the introduction of this important new piece of legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill represents an important step but not the only
					 step in the development of a national strategy to address a threat that until
					 recently we believed to be a problem inherent in countries elsewhere in the
					 world. That perception of the world, perhaps somewhat misguided, some might
					 even say naive, was a reflection of the world that Canadians want to live in,
					 the Canada that we want to protect.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I struggle now to ensure that the reaction that we
					 undertake as parliamentarians and as Canadians is an intricate balance between
					 our desire to ensure that we are protected from harm and our desire to ensure
					 that we do not fundamentally change the way life that has been carefully
					 nurtured and protected by previous generations of Canadians.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the balance that I know was in the minds of the
					 drafters, lawyers, advisers and countless others who contributed to the bill.
					 It is a balance that I believe has been fundamentally achieved. Of course the
					 devil is in the details. However I am confident that any concerns that we, the
					 PC/DR coalition, may have will be adequately addressed during the review of the
					 bill by the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned previously, the bill represents only one
					 of a number of important elements in the fight against those determined to
					 undermine our confidence and democracy and our way of life. The passage into
					 law of the anti-terrorism act will provide us with a way to deter, disable and
					 dismantle terrorist activity, but having the means by which to undertake these
					 activities is equally important.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As with any law, it is essentially useless unless we
					 have someone to enforce it. Manpower, the human element in counterterrorism
					 activities is an area that has suffered considerable neglect in recent years.
					 It is an area that we can ill afford to continue to ignore. Year after year for
					 the past decade the budgets of the Department of National Defence, CSIS and the
					 RCMP were slashed. Entire departments in some cases, such as the Canada ports
					 police, were eliminated.</p>


	<A NAME="T1935"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1935"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1940"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1930"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1935)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frontline security duties, such as airport security,
					 were privatized. The focus at our borders was shifted from security and
					 enforcement to revenue generation and cash collection, all without due
					 consideration as to the long term effects these cuts might have on our national
					 security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aftermath of the events of September 11 have shown
					 that we cannot continue along this route. Canadians are tuning in to the fact
					 that the increased police presence at airports, nuclear power plants and even
					 on Parliament Hill is a redeployment of existing officers and that redeployment
					 means less coverage somewhere else. The practices of underfunding and
					 understaffing are being noticed and Canadians want something done about
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week, in keeping with the government's approach of
					 tell the world before it tells parliament, Canadians were subjected to a
					 national parade of cabinet ministers clambering over one another to make the
					 next announcement of a new government initiative for what can only be described
					 as a full court press in a game of catch up. In the world of public relations I
					 believe it is called damage control.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mesmerizing as it was to watch minister after
					 minister after minister and sometimes three at once announce new funding, it
					 was a completely redundant exercise since the Minister of Foreign Affairs had
					 previously announced that a meagre $250 million would be made available as an
					 immediate response to the deficiencies identified in our national security
					 network.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite attempts to generate enthusiasm for the one
					 time expenditure, it is readily apparent that this cannot be the full extent of
					 financial resources devoted to improving national security. As it is, the
					 Department of the Solicitor General of Canada only receives an annual budget of
					 $1.5 billion, which has to cover all operating costs of both CSIS and the RCMP.
					 Even if the full amount of the additional spending were allocated exclusively
					 to the solicitor general, it would only represent an increase of 16.63% in the
					 national security budget.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the recent public opinion poll supporting an
					 increase in spending on national defence of $3 billion to $9 billion, one could
					 conclude that Canadians would also be receptive to spending much more than the
					 $1.75 billion on intelligence and national policing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also apparent that to have any meaningful impact
					 the funding of our armed forces and national policing agencies must be
					 increased on a long term basis to ensure that the agencies responsible for
					 national security have the ability to sustain operations at the desired levels.
					 Now more than ever it would be irresponsible for the government not to
					 introduce a budget outlining to Canadians how it intends to finance our war on
					 terrorism over the long term.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to return at this point to the specifics
					 of Bill C-36, the anti-terrorism act. While I have nothing further to add with
					 respect to my comments on what the bill sets out to accomplish, I would like to
					 add one comment with respect to what I consider an intricate component that is
					 not contained in this bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 5 of the bill is devoted to the amendment of other
					 acts and proceeds to introduce amendments that are deemed necessary to ensure
					 that this bill integrates properly with existing Canadian law and to allow the
					 new act to achieve the desired objective.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I find surprising in this amendment to other acts
					 section is that there is no amendment to the Canadian Security Intelligence
					 Service Act that would broaden the mandate of CSIS to include conducting
					 international and covert information gathering operations as part of its normal
					 operations. I question how we will participate in the international fight
					 against terrorism without giving our intelligence service an international
					 mandate. It would seem to me that this is a question that should be considered
					 by the committee when the bill has been referred for its
					 consideration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the introduction of the bill represents the
					 beginning of the government's fight against the threat of international
					 terrorism and not the end. There is much work to be done if we are to rid
					 ourselves of this evil and providing that we are given the opportunity to
					 participate through debates and information briefings, I am certain the
					 government will find itself with all the support it needs during these
					 challenging times.</p>

					 General of Canada, Lib.): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, first, this bill will be important to our
					 law enforcement and security agencies. They need the bill because we need to
					 stop terrorists from getting into Canada and need to protect Canadians from
					 terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a nation we must be prepared to ensure our safety
					 and security. We need more and more powerful tools to identify, prosecute,
					 convict and punish terrorists and those who support them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation would give our law enforcement,
					 security agencies and courts the ability to do so. Our allies also need the
					 bill. If we truly want to be a leader in the international effort to deprive
					 terrorists of sanctuary, to shut off their funding and leave them nowhere to
					 turn, we must have strong anti-terrorism laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ratify the international conventions on the
					 suppression of terrorist financing and suppression of bombing and the
					 convention on the safety of United Nations personnel. We must be part of the
					 solution.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is especially true for our common border. The free
					 flow of people, goods and services between Canada and the United States is
					 absolutely essential for both of us. We must prevent the Canada-U.S. border
					 from being held hostage by terrorists. If we do not then the terrorists will
					 have won.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the House will know, the nature of terrorism is
					 constantly changing. Terrorist operations are decentralized and terrorist cells
					 are made up of highly motivated and skilled individuals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada, the United States and countries around the
					 world are adapting to dealing with new and emerging terrorist threats and
					 methods of operation. We are constantly re-examining and improving what we do
					 and how we do it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada has already taken significant
					 measures to enhance our ability to fight terrorism and will continue to take
					 any and all necessary measures to ensure the country remains safe and
					 secure.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last week the Government of Canada announced a series
					 of measures to improve airport security and improve RCMP capacity to fight
					 terrorism, especially in joint operations with our neighbours to the south, to
					 tighten up immigration procedures and freeze assets of terrorists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A full $250 million in new funding is being invested
					 immediately, and just last year we allocated $1.5 billion to the RCMP, CSIS,
					 CIC and other public safety partners to ensure that they continue to have the
					 tools they need to do their jobs effectively.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the special committee chaired by my colleague,
					 the Minister of Foreign Affairs, we continue our review of laws, policies and
					 procedures. As the Prime Minister has said, what we need to change will be
					 changed.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is evident that Canada and the United States have a
					 long record of close co-operation in fighting terrorism and transnational
					 crime. No two countries work more closely together on law
					 enforcement.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole point of our anti-terrorism plan, which
					 includes this legislation, is to deter and disable terrorists. In this regard,
					 our efforts and those of the United States will be complementary. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RCMP, CSIS, local police, customs, immigration and
					 transport officials work closely with their American counterparts each and
					 every day in their ongoing efforts to ensure the safety and security of our
					 citizens.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joint investigations and operations and the sharing of
					 information and intelligence show how close the relationship is between our two
					 countries.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These activities are possible thanks to the seamless
					 co-operation that exists at every level of our national law enforcement,
					 intelligence, security, customs and immigration agencies.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Washington two weeks ago to meet with
					 attorney general John Ashcroft he told me the United States government was
					 impressed. He thanked me for the co-operation it had received from CSIS and the
					 Royal Canadian Mounted Police. He said that before the U.S. could ask Canada
					 for help we were already co-operating to do the things we knew to be necessary
					 so we could succeed and bring the terrorists to justice. That is high praise.
					 It is true that while we protect Canada and Canadians we also help protect our
					 American friends and other allies.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To defeat terrorists we need to choke off their money
					 supply. Bill C-36 goes a long way toward achieving that. It would designate
					 certain groups as terrorist groups, make it easier to freeze their assets,
					 prosecute those who give them financial support and deny or remove charitable
					 status for designated groups. It would cut off financial support for terrorists
					 by making it a crime to collect or give funds either directly or indirectly to
					 carry out terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that some of the measures we propose
					 are extraordinary. That is why we have included significant checks and
					 balances. Canadians want the measures but they also want safeguards to ensure
					 the measures are targeted to terrorists and those who support them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, we will give police more tools to investigate and
					 prevent terrorist activity. Yes, we will make it easier to use electronic
					 surveillance against terrorist groups. Yes, we will take steps to protect
					 security information and detain terrorists. Yes, we will take measures against
					 groups that abuse our registered charity system to raise funds for terrorists.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, a nation must be prepared to protect itself
					 to ensure its safety and security. That is exactly what we are doing. The
					 murderous attacks of September 11 showed the world that terrorists have no
					 regard for their victims or themselves. If we are to prevent terrorism and save
					 lives we need the tools in Bill C-36.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill's measures are targeted directly at terrorists
					 but it is also important that the principles of judicial review and due process
					 be respected. Bill C-36 has found that balance. It is consistent with the
					 charter of rights and freedoms and it responds to the situation we face
					 following September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope all members of the House will support Bill C-36.
					 The bill would provide our legal system and police officers with the important
					 tools they need to do the job of making sure Canada remains the peaceful and
					 safe place it has been for many years.</p>

					 Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to enter the debate,
					 particularly because the government moved so quickly. Much of the work that
					 went into the bill should have been done years ago but nonetheless it is before
					 us now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years ago the Royal Canadian Legion had a motto
					 “If you can't remember, think”. There are many people in the House today, and
					 no doubt many people watching, who cannot remember certain events in our
					 history. I remember very well the events of September 3, 1939. I remember
					 September 10, 1939, when Canada declared war. I was only a boy. At the time I
					 heard some of the funniest statements one would ever want to hear, but none as
					 vicious as a statement I heard on September 11, 2001, on Canadian television. I
					 will get back to that later.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December 7, 1941, a Sunday morning I remember like
					 yesterday, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. Do members know what I heard in
					 this country? I heard that the United States had it coming. I would like
					 members to recall that date in 1941. Canadians and we in the House had better
					 thank God we had the United States as an ally. If not, we would probably not be
					 sitting here enjoying the freedom we are enjoying this very day.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the morning of September 11, 2001, my Ottawa office
					 staff phoned me and said they had been asked to leave. They told me to turn on
					 my television. As I sat having breakfast with my wife, I said that before the
					 day was over I would hear some of the same crapola I heard following December
					 7, 1941. Sure enough, all day long on September 11, 2001, and in the days that
					 followed I have heard that the United States had it coming.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The statements were not made by anyone in the House
					 because the House was not in session. However the CBC carried some programs
					 that made me sick to my stomach. They defamed our partner and ally through two
					 world wars. They blamed the whole thing on the United States. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are people in the House who say the United
					 Nations should take the lead role rather than the United States. I am sorry,
					 but one of our UN nations admitted the other day that it had within its borders
					 many of the same people whose names are on the list for terrorism. Sweden, a
					 member of the United Nations, said it could not do anything about it until
					 these people broke a law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to worry about the bill going too far
					 because it will not need an examination in three years. It will need to be
					 expanded before then. I do not think for one moment that we have seen the last
					 of the war on terrorism. There is a whole lot more coming. If there is one
					 theme I would like to leave the Chamber with it is this: No one's rights can
					 ever exceed the nation's right to security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pick up the papers and read all these things about
					 sweeping rights. We read that lawyers and civil rights people have concerns. No
					 one's rights can ever exceed the right to have a secure nation. We must be
					 cognizant of this fact: We did not have the charter of rights during World War
					 II but the security of the nation was utmost in everybody's mind. </p>


	<A NAME="T1950"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1950"><!-- Hour: 7--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1955"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1945"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1950)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came a lot closer to having war on our very soil on
					 September 11 than we did during those five years of conflict. Canadians were
					 killed not many miles south of the border. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have this hogwash in Canada that to be a true
					 Canadian one must somehow hate the Americans. It is generated. When I listen to
					 certain university professors, and everyone probably knows the one I am
					 referring to, I wonder what kind of message they are sending our students and
					 young people who attend university. It is shameful. It is disgraceful for the
					 nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at our charter for a moment. Let us look at
					 what happened in Seattle. Do we have freedom of assembly? Yes, we do. Do we
					 have freedom of expression? Everything is freedom of expression in this country
					 but who gets all the attention? Was the Operation SalAMI meeting a legal
					 meeting? Yes, it was. Were the protesters given legal rights? Yes, they were.
					 The same was true in Quebec. However we must always put our weight on the
					 ability of security forces to protect a legally constituted meeting.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to re-examine some of these things. We hear
					 people in the House, mainly members of the NDP, say we should not get involved
					 in the campaign against terrorism. We should not get involved? The Minister of
					 National Defence knows full well that any boat could pull into Toronto harbour
					 undetected and blast away. It is possible. We need to think of the security of
					 the nation more than we need to think of individual rights. This is terror.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I represent a rural constituency. This morning at 9
					 o'clock some people picked up their mail from a small post office in my riding.
					 They took it home and opened it and powder was in the envelope. They were not
					 ready for that. Neither was the RCMP. After nine hours someone finally came and
					 picked up the envelope. A lady is now receiving precautionary
					 antibiotics.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to state clearly to the Canadian people that
					 this is not the end of the crisis. Canada is subject to attack in any place and
					 at any time. The question is not so much whether we must go back and re-examine
					 Bill C-36. The question well may be whether we must strengthen its measures for
					 greater security. That may sound a bit rough for some people. However let us
					 not worry about our individual rights. Let us worry about the security of our
					 country. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our country and in my province we have terrorism of
					 a different sort. Bill C-36's definition of terrorism fits what is happening in
					 some of our cities. Homes are being raided and destroyed. People are being
					 molested. That is terrorism, even as defined by Bill C-36. The powers of the
					 bill, which some call wide and sweeping but which I call common sense, could be
					 applied to the domestic scene as well. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to support the bill but there is one thing I
					 want to see forgotten. I want to see Canada take a far different approach
					 through its media, the CBC and its town halls. We must stop thinking that to be
					 Canadian we need to defame the United States. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is about time. We enjoy our security because of our

	Mr. Speaker, yesterday I rose in the House to speak
					 with respect to our Canadian forces and the deployment of over 2,000 of them
					 with respect to the campaign against terrorism. Today I rise to speak about the
					 legislative changes in Bill C-36 as they affect the defence
					 portfolio.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the objectives of the government's
					 anti-terrorism bill is to eliminate the obstacles to the security of our
					 country. </p>


	<A NAME="T2000"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2000"><!-- Hour: 8--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1955"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2000)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed anti-terrorism legislation will amend the
					 National Defence Act to align it with changes in the criminal code, the Canada
					 Evidence Act and the Security Information Act. For example, the National
					 Defence Act would incorporate the definitions of terrorist events, terrorist
					 activity and terrorist group. This is to bring the military justice system,
					 which is a separate system, completely in line with the civilian
					 system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second set of amendments contained in this package
					 would provide additional authorities to the Communications Security
					 Establishment or CSE. This organization has an important role to play in the
					 campaign against terrorism since it is heavily involved in intelligence
					 information gathering and analysis. Not only does it intercept and analyze
					 foreign communications it also helps to protect the government's information
					 systems and networks.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is changing and so must CSE. The organization
					 needs to sharpen its focus on critical trends, on national issues and, most
					 important, on terrorism. These new authorities would enable it to meet the
					 requirements of the new environment and provide the kind of foreign
					 intelligence that Canada, working closely with our key allies, will need in the
					 coming months and years. This new framework would help CSE work more
					 effectively to help protect our own federal government computer systems and
					 networks.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intelligence needs of the government have changed
					 greatly since the end of the cold war. </p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, advances in technology have radically
					 changed the way the world communicates. These changes have made it increasingly
					 difficult for CSE to operate effectively within existing authorities. Currently
					 in its information gathering the CSE is focused on foreign entities. It can
					 only pick up information in foreign countries, not in Canada. Under section 184
					 of the criminal code it is unable to pick up any communication that either
					 starts in Canadaand is sent to a foreign country or is sent from a foreign
					 country to Canada. If two terrorists are communicating in foreign countries, we
					 could pick it up. If one of the terrorists moves into Canada, we cannot.
					 Therefore we are stymied in an attempt to deal with the terrorist problem. This
					 unduly constrains the effectiveness of the Communications Security
					 Establishment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that terrorists and those who support them
					 communicate with people in many different countries and they do communicate
					 with people in Canada. However, under the criminal code, if CSE is targeting a
					 known terrorist abroad and that individual then communicates with somebody in
					 Canada we cannot intercept the communication. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This constrains our intelligence collection apart from
					 that of our closest allies. We are working closely with the United States, the
					 United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Those countries have had the legal
					 framework in place since the second world war, and that is what I am asking
					 that we do through Bill C-36.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also important to understand that the proposed
					 amendment would not authorize CSE to focus its collection effort on Canadians.
					 The effort must continue to be focused on foreign entities and not on
					 Canadians. The proposed amendment states that CSE's activities would not be
					 directed toward any person who is a Canadian. It would simply enable CSE to
					 intercept the communications for foreign intelligence targets located abroad
					 when their communications go in or out of Canada or to an unknown
					 location.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CSE also requires additional authority, which that it
					 does not presently have to protect our own federal government 's computer
					 systems and networks from any mischief, unauthorized use, hacking or
					 interference. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Monitoring systems are indispensable tools in assessing
					 the vulnerabilities of our networks. Under its current legal framework CSE is
					 restricted in its ability to monitor the computer systems or networks of the
					 government. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment would therefore authorize it to
					 perform in a more effective monitoring fashion. This measure would help to
					 assure the protection of government computer systems. I am sure that is what
					 Canadians want. They want to have their government protect its systems and its
					 networks into the future, particularly when more government services are going
					 online.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An important point here is privacy. Let me assure the
					 House that the privacy of Canadians remains paramount and that it would
					 continue to be protected through an effective control regime in the conduct of
					 CSE's operations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Minister of National Defence, before authorizing CSE
					 to collect foreign communications which originate or terminate in Canada for
					 purposes of foreign intelligence, I would have to be satisfied on four counts:
					 first, that Canadians and persons in Canada would not be targeted; second, that
					 the intelligence resulting from this collection could be reasonably be obtained
					 by other means; third, that the value of the intelligence would justify the
					 means of interception; and, fourth, that a private communication would only be
					 used or retained when it was essential to the advancement of Canadian interest,
					 defence or security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should point out that CSE has an unblemished publicly
					 available record of compliance with similar kinds of controls in the regime it
					 has already operated under for a great many years. Over the past several years
					 both the privacy commissioner and the CSE's own commissioner, a retired judge
					 from the court of appeal in Quebec, have examined CSE's handling of information
					 involving Canadians. They concluded that it was done in compliance with
					 Canada's legal framework, including the Privacy Act and the charter of rights
					 and freedoms.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have confidence that this would continue if CSE
					 operates under these proposed new authorities. The commissioner's own mandate
					 is strengthened in this legislation to ensure that it does so.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good intelligence is one of the most important
					 contributions that Canada can make to the campaign against terrorism we are
					 waging with our allies. The proposed amendment enhances Canada's foreign
					 intelligence capacity by allowing CSE to intercept communications that may have
					 a direct bearing on terrorist operations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed amendment will be welcomed by our allies
					 as they already have this authority. It will be welcomed by them as evidence
					 that we are committed to remaining an active and contributing member of our
					 close intelligence partnerships. It will also enable us to more effectively
					 protect the computer systems and networks of the Government of
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the additional authorities provided to CSE
					 and the changes to the National Defence Act I have outlined would give us
					 better tools to fight terrorism effectively in the long run.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore recommend that we support them.</p>

					 Alliance): </b>

	Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise tonight and speak
					 to the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to continue to extend our
					 sympathies and best wishes to the families and friends of all victims, from
					 wherever they may have come, as a result of September 11. It indeed was a
					 tragic thing and our prayers continue to be with them whether they are from
					 Canada, the U.S. or wherever. I think that would be true of each and every one
					 of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to see the foreign affairs minister here
					 tonight. I would like to say to him, on behalf of the Wild Rose people and
					 myself, that we commend him for the excellent job he has done as the
					 spokesperson for our country in the event down there. He has done very well and
					 we are very pleased with that. I believe in passing out commendations when they
					 deserve it and he deserves it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second thing I would like to thank the Liberal
					 government for is the bill. It finally has arrived. I think it should have
					 arrived a little sooner but I would like to thank the government for using many
					 of our ideas and proposals that we have presented in the past. That is a
					 feather in its cap too. It really did not ignore what we were saying. It
					 included them in the bill. For that we say thank you. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lots of good things in the bill but there
					 are many things that we must now take into consideration. I would ask every
					 member of the government who is present tonight to please hear me out and to
					 consider these things quickly in terms of dealing not only with the bill but
					 with terrorism itself.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will start with Parks Canada. This may surprise
					 people. They may wonder what in the... that has to do with the issue but I will
					 explain.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Presently something is happening in all parks across
					 Canada. At one time it was the duty of many park wardens to enforce the laws,
					 to look after the needs of managing our parks and to make sure that things were
					 going well. It was managed by those people who were best trained and best
					 experienced for that kind of work: the park wardens themselves.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They did an excellent job in the past and we want them
					 to continue to do a good job. What does that have to do with the bill? Here is
					 the problem.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that the one thing that is lacking in the bill
					 is the resources to do the work that will be required as a result of September
					 11. I do not know who would initiate it, but it is time for somebody in the
					 government to initiate some conversations with the heritage minister to deal
					 with the park warden situation and get them back to work doing what they do
					 best, which is looking after the parks of Canada, and thus releasing the
					 hundreds of RCMP officers who are trying to do that job.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has hundreds of RCMP officers trying to
					 manage our parks. They are not trained or qualified to do that job. They do not
					 particularly like chasing poachers or looking for horns on top of vehicles that
					 should not be there or confiscating things. They need to get back to what they
					 are best qualified for and that is providing security and protection for this
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I plead with somebody on that side of the House to talk
					 to the heritage minister. We must deal with the park warden situation. We must
					 get them back to work in the parks and equip them with the tools they need to
					 do their job effectively so the RCMP officers can go back to their duties of
					 providing safety and protection for this country, which is what they want to
					 do. They do not want to chase elk, deer and those who would poach
					 them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever came up with the idea that is what had to take
					 place really surprises me. However, the move was made and it will cost, if it
					 has not already, as was reported to me, about $40 million to have RCMP officers
					 in the park areas doing the job of highly qualified people who are already
					 there just waiting to go back to work.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the circumstances of September 11, it makes
					 absolutely no sense for us to even consider using police officers in some
					 capacity other than that of providing safety and protection to this great
					 nation of ours. Since that is what they want to do and what they were trained
					 to do, why, for Pete's sake, does the government not allow them to do it? Could
					 the members over there please wake up the heritage minister and tell her to get
					 the issue settled with the park wardens? They want to get back to work as well.
					 They can do a great job. Let them do their work.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have visited a number of border crossings, land
					 border crossings and airport crossings, and if there is one thing customs
					 officers want to contribute to the whole cause it is to be given the ability to
					 actively participate in the protection of Canadians and Canadian soil.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to read to the House the regulations
					 regarding customs officers. It is number 16 of the regulations. It
					 states:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Customs officers shall not use force
						  against members of the public where it is known or strongly suspected that the
						  individual is carrying a weapon and considered dangerous, if in the judgment of
						  the officer involved the use of force would present an undue risk to their
						  personal safety or to the safety of another officer of the public. In these
						  circumstances officers shall note the pertinent details of the case, permit the
						  individuals to proceed into Canada unobstructed and then officers will notify
						  the police immediately.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whoever wrote that regulation did not take into account
					 the 50, 60 or more crossings in this country. When they phone the police it is
					 up to two or three hours before the police can respond to their call, just
					 because of their location. A lot of these locations have one individual on
					 duty. If anyone thinks for a moment that the terrorists would only use the most
					 active ports to enter into our country, the bigger ports, they had better think
					 again. The terrorists know about these ports. They know about these entries
					 into Canada where there is a cabin and one person on duty and that at 10
					 o'clock or 9 o'clock at night they put out a pylon to stop the flow of traffic
					 and then go home. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me tell the House about the attitude of the
					 officers on the front line, the first line of defence at the borders. They want
					 to be equipped and trained. They want the tools needed to enter into the battle
					 of stopping terrorism from entering this country. They do not want to allow
					 peoples to enter into our country unobstructed when they know they will only
					 cause a lot of trouble and grief to a lot of innocent people. They know this
					 will happen but because of government regulation they are not allowed to stop
					 them. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should all think about terrorists arriving at our
					 border. They are smart enough to know they cannot come through Toronto or
					 through Port Erie, so they go up to Roosevelt, which has only one person, or
					 somewhere else that has only a one cabin one person operation and they come
					 right in. All they have to do is act tough and scary and the customs officer
					 has no choice but to let him go and then phone the RCMP which could be 200 to
					 300 miles away.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are just common sense things that we could do to
					 provide protection. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I encourage the government to get the park wardens back
					 so we can bring more police back on duty doing what they do best. It should
					 also train and equip our customs officers so they can do the job of arresting
					 people at the border like they so desperately want to do. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to change our attitude on this. It is a serious
					 thing. Allowing terrorists to enter our country unobstructed creates a great
					 risk to people in Canada and that just plain does not make sense.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask the government to please listen to the people on
					 the front lines, to those who work hour after hour in defence of this land. It
					 must hear their pleas and listen to them. If the government puts away its

					 (Haldimand—Norfolk—Brant, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise today to
					 take the opportunity to speak to my constituents and other Canadians who are
					 watching tonight about the importance of the anti-terrorism act that we have
					 now introduced in the House, about to what exactly is in the act and how I
					 believe the act helps to lessen the threat of terrorist activities here in
					 Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is determined to take steps to stop
					 terrorism. Over the past number of weeks I think the Minister of Foreign
					 Affairs and the Minister of National Defence have very clearly outlined the
					 steps we believe need to be taken to help fight terrorism in Canada. I have
					 certainly outlined what I believe to be the reasons behind the actions taken
					 today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say at the outset that the actions we are
					 taking in the legislation today might not have been acceptable in Canada two
					 months ago, but certainly after the events of September 11, I do not think
					 there is any question. When I go back to talk to my constituents on the street
					 they say they are prepared to give a little of their rights and freedoms ensure
					 that Canadians are safe. The constituents I have talked to on the street
					 certainly are in favour of the approach that we are taking here, with the
					 understanding that there are checks and balances within the legislation to make
					 sure that governments and representatives of governments do not take advantage
					 of these changes in the laws that we are making here today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will outline a bit of what is in the act. The act
					 tries to identify, prosecute, convict and, in particular, punish terrorist
					 activities here in Canada. Activities in Canada, as we know, have always been
					 under the criminal code. Canada has in fact been a leader at the United Nations
					 in pushing for international conventions on terrorism. We have now signed all
					 12 United Nations conventions on terrorism and we have ratified 10. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this legislation would do is help ratify the other
					 two conventions of the United Nations that try to attack terrorism
					 internationally.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is critical in what we have tried to do is to get
					 the international community moving to fight terrorism. Under the auspices of
					 the United Nations, the work it has done on these conventions goes a long way
					 to co-ordinating the efforts of the world community to fight
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the two conventions that the bill would help ratify,
					 the first is the suppression of terrorist financing convention. That relates to
					 the freezing of terrorist property by prohibiting dealing in any property or
					 with a person engaged in terrorist activities and also by prohibiting making
					 available funds, financial and/or other related services to terrorists. What
					 that tries to do is strike back at terrorist financing to make sure that these
					 terrorist organizations do not get the financing they require to carry on their
					 activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other convention that the act would deal with is
					 called the suppression of terrorist bombings convention. It contains provisions
					 relating to the targeting of public places, government or infrastructure
					 facilities or transportation systems with explosives and/or other lethal
					 devices such as chemical and biological devices. What this tries to do is make
					 sure that these activities are not carried out by terrorist groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this also does is deal with provisions within the
					 Criminal Code of Canada. It defines what a terrorist activity is in the
					 criminal code. It states that it is an offence under one of the ten United
					 Nations anti-terrorism conventions and protocols, which is what I just spoke
					 about earlier. If people do things to break those conventions or protocols,
					 then they are conducting a terrorist activity.</p>


	<A NAME="T2020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2020"><!-- Hour: 8--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it says that an action taken for political,
					 religious or idedogical purposes which threatens the public or national
					 security by killing, seriously harming or endangering the person, causing
					 substantial property damage that is likely to seriously harm people or by
					 interfering with or disrupting an essential service, facility or system, is a
					 terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other side, we have public debates in this
					 country that sometimes lead to demonstrations where people go out and break a
					 few buildings, or tear down a fence or something. That would not be called a
					 terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we have tried to do is balance the legitimate
					 right of Canadians to express their views and at the same time make sure that
					 these terrorist activities do not take place in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill also designates terrorist groups and
					 activities. The definition in the designation framework would provide clear
					 guidance to the police, the prosecutors, the courts and the public as to what
					 is and what is not a terrorist group or activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also make it a crime to knowingly collect or
					 to provide funds to these terrorist groups, the maximum sentence under that
					 would be 10 years, and to knowingly participate in or facilitate these
					 activities of terrorist groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also be a crime to instruct anyone to carry
					 out a terrorist activity on behalf of a terrorist group and also to knowingly
					 harbour or to conceal a terrorist. By doing this, someone would get 10 years.
					 In fact, for a lot of the activity in the terrorist group, one could get life
					 sentences also.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The criminal code would also stipulate that the
					 sentences imposed for each of these offences would be served consecutively so
					 the time period would be longer.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also change the criminal code to make a new
					 definition and designation of schemes that would make it easier to remove or to
					 deny charitable status to some of these terrorist groups. As has been listed in
					 the paper, there are a number of groups around the world that claim to be
					 charities and claim to do certain noble things for people around the world.
					 However, they are taking those dollars and funneling them to terrorist
					 activities. This would make it a lot easier for the government to deny that
					 charitable status to these groups to ensure that this sort of activity does not
					 take place in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would also allow stronger investigative tools for
					 our police forces and to find these terrorist groups.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measures within the legislation deal with electronic
					 surveillance. Nowadays terrorist groups have all kinds of opportunities with
					 new electronic media to deal with these sorts of issues. This would help take
					 away their ability to use the Internet, to use this electronic surveillance to
					 carry on their terrorist activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Official Secrets Act would also be amended to
					 address national security concerns, including threats to espionage by foreign
					 powers and terrorist groups, and make sure that they are not able to carry on
					 these activities denying them access to the information they
					 require.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe very strongly that we have hit the right
					 balance in this approach. I believe that constituents in my area support the
					 approach the government is taking on this issue. I would encourage any of them
					 at any time to contact me and let me know their views. We will continue to
					 fight terrorism, as the Prime Minister said, to make sure that these activities
					 do not take place in Canada or around the world.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to take part today in
					 this exercise in reflection brought about by the anti-terrorism
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of September 11 have wreaked havoc with
					 everyday life and the way people go about their daily life. It can be said that
					 since September 11 we have been experiencing a shockwave. In my riding, I have
					 heard stories when talking with friends about how life is no longer the same.
					 We thought we were not vulnerable to an attack such as this one. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People are experiencing feelings from fear to anger and
					 compassion. Compassion is being felt for many American citizens, but there is
					 also a feeling of compassion for what is happening in faraway lands, in
					 Afghanistan, compassion for all these displaced people who are destitute and
					 often on the verge of starvation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the unfortunate event of September 11,
					 we as a society have a lot of thinking to do. Our vision of the world leads us
					 to rethink not only what an anti-terrorism act should be but also our vision
					 and the compassion we should show to improve the living conditions of people in
					 the Middle East, in Asia and across the world. As we know, the conflict in
					 Afghanistan is not the only one going on in the world today.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is aimed at reassuring our fellow citizens but
					 also at eradicating terrorism. I have been wondering. Will this bill reach its
					 intended goal? Is it not too far-reaching and might it not fail? How could we
					 better reassure people? Could it be through a change in attitude? I believe a
					 change in attitude is a goal we should strive for. Does the bill not go too
					 far?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that several people, more precisely 62% of
					 Quebecers, have some concerns about losing the freedoms and privileges
					 guaranteed by the charter of rights and freedoms, privileges that were acquired
					 over time. They are concerned with security. We know that security has been
					 seriously jeopardized. Right now we can feel that people are scared, especially
					 in the United States. Even here on the hill, we had an emergency situation
					 yesterday because of a letter that might have contained anthrax. We know that
					 this feeling of fear could very well affect us too.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attacks on New York and Washington made us aware of
					 the dangers stemming from the international situation. They warned us that from
					 now on we would have to be on our guard. Many people are on the verge of a
					 psychosis about terrorist attacks. If this is what bin Laden wanted to achieve,
					 I think he succeeded. We must react and we must do it quickly. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that rapid action does not require haphazard
					 measures. I hope that in introducing this bill, the government will be open to
					 amendments that we may want to propose to ensure that this bill does not
					 infringe on our rights and freedoms. The Bloc Quebecois has asked a lot of
					 questions and has some concerns about the implications of this bill. In fact,
					 there was an obvious political goal attached to the introduction of this bill,
					 that is, to calm the public. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the government will succeed in recreating for a
					 few days or a few weeks the illusion that Canadians had before September 11,
					 namely that they can live in relative peace under the umbrella of the United
					 States. It will take only one serious incident to change all that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may try to prevent, repress and punish terrorism,
					 but will we be able to eradicate it without dealing with the feeling of
					 hopelessness that causes it?</p>


	<A NAME="T2030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2030"><!-- Hour: 8--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we prevent an individual, whether or not he
					 belongs to an organization, from taking other people's lives with his own? I
					 wonder if an anti-terrorism act will keep at bay people who are prepared to
					 give up life or to risk it in the name of a so-called holy war.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why we must be very careful about the type of
					 bill on which we will vote here, a bill that requires the support of members of
					 parliament. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must ask ourselves the following questions. Why must
					 we legislate against terrorism? How can we do it without infringing on those
					 freedoms that are so dear to us and that were gained over the years? Last, will
					 this legislation be enough to avert the threat?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us begin with the first question. Did the
					 government have to introduce these measures today? Either the security measures
					 in place were inadequate and the government was careless or else it was fully
					 aware of the possibility of terrorist attacks. If it was, this means that
					 existing measures were not applied properly. Either way, the government is
					 responsible and must now hurry to reassure the public with its omnibus bill.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are examples that illustrate both carelessness
					 and mismanagement. The first one is the delay in reviewing the cases of refugee
					 status claimants in Canada. We had an act that could have allowed us to be much
					 more vigilant. It often takes several years before a ruling is made. It may
					 take in excess of five years. Hanging a sword of Damocles over the heads of
					 these claimants will not facilitate their integration, if they are accepted, or
					 their expulsion, if they are rejected. If the act had been properly enforced,
					 part of that problem might have been solved.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example is the privatization of security
					 services at airports. The discovery of knives on aircraft at Toronto's airport
					 shows that the government was negligent and missed an opportunity to tighten up
					 security for the benefit of passengers by resorting to penny pinching schemes.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, today the government announced measures that
					 will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. It should have thought of these
					 measures before, but we cannot go back in time. However, we must be vigilant as
					 to the types of bills that we are going to pass in the coming
					 months.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I hope that the government will give opposition
					 parties enough time to hear witnesses and recommend amendments to the
					 bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A second concern is the issue of security. Since it is
					 possible to improve the security of Quebecers and Canadians by rigorously
					 applying existing security measures, is it necessary to go as far as amending
					 the criminal code to grant broader powers to the police force in terms of
					 preventive custody, electronic surveillance and opening of postal and
					 electronic mail?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there not a risk of violating the fundamental rights
					 of law-abiding citizens? This is the question the House leader of the Bloc
					 Quebecois asked the Prime Minister today. We cannot say we got reassuring
					 answers with regard to the goals of the anti-terrorist act.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, the long term effectiveness of the
					 comprehensive strategy being proposed raises concerns. In the aftermath of the
					 air strikes by the U.S., can we really believe that an anti-terrorist act will
					 prevent such acts in the future? Not only should we find a political solution
					 to the problem, but we should also be cautious about exclusively military and
					 police solutions. We have to go beyond that.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before September 11, there was already a terrorism
					 problem. We could have been much more vigilant. This is the why I ask the
					 government to be cautious in the choice of legislation it wants to implement in
					 Canada. It might bring in a short term solution, but such legislation could
					 have, in the long term, a destructive impact on democracy in Canada and in
					 Quebec. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before September 11, the Canadian Security Intelligence
					 Service, the RCMP and the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency knew that something
					 was going on in Quebec and in Canada. However, all the information was
					 concentrated in the hands of the solicitor general and the Minister of Justice.
					 We could have been much more vigilant.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are irritants in the bill. It should be reviewed
					 every three years. This legislation could be counterproductive. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill should contain a sunset clause, otherwise it
					 would no longer be in force. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have to be very vigilant. I ask the government to
					 show openness and to listen to opposition parties, which might change its mind
					 regarding this anti-terrorist legislation.</p>

					 Secretary to the Minister of Labour, Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, yesterday the government introduced in
					 the House its anti-terrorism act. It is strong new legislation to deal with
					 people and acts that were mostly unknown before September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of the legislation is to identify, convict and
					 punish terrorists and provide new tools to the police and other agencies
					 effectively to pursue and prosecute terrorists. Some of these measures are
					 strong but they are consistent with Canadian values of respect and fairness.
					 The legislation is also in step with measures being taken by our allies
					 everywhere. With the legislation, we join our international partners in taking
					 steps to stamp out terrorism around the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me talk about some of the provisions of the new
					 act. It would allow law enforcement agencies to define terrorist groups and
					 activities. It would make it easier to prosecute terrorists and those who
					 support them. It would make it an offence to participate in or contribute to
					 the activities of a terrorist group. It would make it an offence to harbour a
					 terrorist. The new legislation would create tougher sentences and parole
					 provisions for terrorist offences.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of these measures go to the heart of rooting out
					 terrorists in our country. All of these measures are appropriate following the
					 events of September 11. They are in line with what must be done and what is now
					 being done by our allies around the world. It is important to repeat that
					 following the attacks on September 11, the Prime Minister and Canadians with
					 him have called for a renewed commitment to Canadian values of respect,
					 equality, diversity and fairness.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is worth making one more time. This is a
					 campaign. This is new legislation against terrorism, not against one cultural
					 community, group or religious faith. The anti-terrorism act reaffirms Canadian
					 values and ensures that the Canadian respect for justice and diversity is
					 reinforced.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The legislation takes direct aim at the root causes of
					 hatred and its expression. For example, amendments to the criminal code would
					 allow our courts to order the deletion of publicly available hate propaganda
					 from computers. Very importantly, further criminal code amendments would create
					 a new offence of mischief with a maximum sentence of 10 years for acts
					 committed against a religious place of worship which are motivated by bias,
					 prejudice or hate. Amendments will also be made to the Canadian Human Rights
					 Act clearly prohibiting using telephones, the Internet or other communications
					 tools for the purposes of discrimination or hatred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a free and democratic society. We must remain a
					 free and democratic society. The anti-terrorism act introduced by the
					 government yesterday has as its first goal to keep Canada free and democratic.
					 To do this we must confront the terrorist forces against us within our own
					 borders and across the world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is doing just that. Canadians can be
					 comforted in knowing that with the legislation all that must be done is being
					 done to stop terrorists and terrorist acts, to deal with the hatred that is a
					 root cause of terrorism, and to protect our values and our way of
					 life.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my belief that the anti-terrorist act has
					 balanced the need to confront our enemies with the desire of all Canadians to
					 live in a free, diverse and fair society.</p>

					 Centre-East, Canadian Alliance): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I was in Ottawa on September 11 and
					 watched in disbelief, as did millions around the world on their television
					 sets, as one and then a second airplane crashed into the World Trade Center in
					 New York. Quite simply, the world gasped as these horrible acts of terrorism
					 unfolded right before our very eyes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no doubt that this brought terrorism home to
					 our country. A peaceful fall day was shattered by the hard realities of the
					 terrible human toll right in front of us on our televisions. Since then a great
					 sense of insecurity and vulnerability has swept the continent on a level
					 unimaginable just an hour before the skyscrapers crashed to the
					 ground.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These acts also brought terrorism to Parliament Hill
					 itself. Terrorism arrived at the door of this House to a Canadian population
					 that shared in our neighbour's grief and now shares in our neighbour's war
					 response.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It changed things forever. It brought terrorism into
					 our daily vocabulary. It brought terrorism into our daily lives. It caused a
					 tidal wave of disruption that reached into every corner of our economy,
					 government, schools and communities. It shook our placid society to its core as
					 our government fumbled as it responded to the threat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the effect on our economy was definitely
					 traumatic in the short term, our citizenry's response was unbelievable,
					 incredible. There were many isolated great efforts as some rose above the rest
					 to help. We saw thousands of Canadians step forward to host and help stranded
					 air travellers and others race to New York to offer their specialized services.
					 Those unable to assist directly did so through their generous donations of
					 money and blood.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These acts by the terrorists succeeded in sending a
					 number of companies in Canada and abroad into receivership, but our
					 determination and resolve will quickly put things back on track. I am confident
					 that with our collective international will we will fight these terrorist
					 pressures with a vigour reminiscent of the stubbornness of allies in World War
					 II. The bill today, while incomplete, will help in the war on
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrorists are not the enemies of the past, the
					 ones who opposed us under the Geneva convention set of rules. Those rules of
					 war were established to protect the innocent, the unarmed, the unprotected. No,
					 today's enemies are cowards that hide in caves, behind rocks and live under the
					 protection of the freedoms we fought for in previous times. Cowards like that
					 deserve no respect or mercy. They are as much a danger to us as they are to the
					 people they purport to represent and the false legitimacy they cower
					 behind.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We, with the help of our allies, will overcome these
					 terrorists. We will bring them forward and bring justice upon those determined
					 to undermine our civilized nation's efforts and successes. We will exact
					 retribution from those who cowardly assassinated thousands of peaceful
					 civilians who were simply going about their daily lives working for their
					 families. If we do nothing, we invite similar attacks in the future. These
					 cowards must realize that their actions are civilly and morally repugnant and
					 will come at a great personal cost to them.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We congratulate the government for finally getting on
					 with the job of national security. To date, the government's reaction to this
					 critical issue can be best described as slow motion and delayed
					 reaction.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Already the changes are evident on Parliament Hill.
					 There are tighter security controls. There has been the introduction of vehicle
					 inspections and checkpoints. There are more officers on duty today than there
					 were for the first four hours after the strikes in the United States on
					 September 11. I am pleased to see that there is now a heightened level of
					 awareness and vigilance on the Hill, at our airports and in other public
					 buildings. This is welcome and gives confidence and reassurance to those who
					 work in and visit these buildings.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a past member of the Royal Canadian Air Force, it is
					 fair to say that I have a sense of the military mind and thinking. Our military
					 is proud and ready to serve at any time. As they say in the navy, they are
					 ready, aye ready. They are ready to contribute and assist under any emergency,
					 whether it be ice, fire, flood and of course now the war. They wear their
					 uniforms more proudly today than they have over the recent past. I invite all
					 members of the House when meeting members of our armed forces in uniform to
					 give them warmest greetings and show them that we care and that they are
					 appreciated.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While they have been under the continual assault of
					 cutbacks, slashback and neglect, their years of training and patience again
					 regain importance under present global circumstances. On Wednesday we will see
					 them off from our port of Halifax in new frigates. I have personally been
					 aboard the HMCS <i>Charlottetown</i> and can attest to its first rate
					 construction and the pride of its first rate crew: first rate ships for first
					 rate sailors.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to allay fears that the aging Sea Kings are
					 unsafe. The crews and pilots need these assurances after recent reports. The
					 minister too has assured us that they will be flown safely under strict
					 limitations. Missions will be limited and greatly downgraded and scaled back
					 from the mission standards of new helicopters, but will still have some limited
					 air transport capability. Some day soon I hope the government will finally
					 order first rate helicopters for our navy's first rate frigates.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure the government will be analyzing our current
					 military state under an expedited timetable. I hope it will revisit tenders in
					 progress to ensure our men and women in uniform will have the best equipment
					 possible to do the job and do it safely. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must learn the lessons from our experiences in the
					 past. In World War II we traded the safety of our soldiers for the sake of
					 expediency. We provided Sherman tanks that were under-armoured and under-gunned
					 compared with those of the enemy. Many lost their lives because we traded
					 quality for quantity and low price. We provided the best soldiers with the
					 least effective tank. I hope and pray that the government will never ever
					 follow that strategy of providing lesser capability equipment to our frontline
					 military simply to save money.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time to reassess and reconsider overly
					 simplistic assessments of a reduced threat by the end of the cold war. Today
					 the hot war has begun. It is a war that is fought in some of the most extremely
					 high temperature climactic conditions. The Middle East, Africa, the Pacific,
					 the Balkans and now the Arabian Sea are theatres that severely test the high
					 temperature operating capabilities of a helicopter to perform missions, but
					 perform it must.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While our Sea Kings can be safely operated on very
					 limited missions, they are not designed for service in the extreme heat zones
					 of the world. They cannot lift off from a stationary ship if fully equipped
					 with gear and fuel in over 35 degrees Celsius weather. They have served us well
					 in cooler climates but now need to be replaced with a craft designed for hot
					 war theatres and modern needs. I strongly stress my desire to see the public
					 works minister expedite the maritime helicopter project to replace the Sea King
					 with the best unit available for the job and to leave politics out of the
					 decision for the sake of our aircrews' lives. We need the best equipment in the
					 world for the best men and women in the world. Considering what we are asking
					 of them, it is the least that we can provide. Our soldiers depend on our
					 government to provide them with the very best to go into conflict with. If
					 their lives are on the line, we must give them the very equipment
					 possible.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to comment on the bill we are debating
					 today and read a short extract that emphasizes the need for this bill and the
					 need for the bill to go further. A communique from the Equality Party with the
					 heading “Canada soft and squishy on its own terrorists” indicated that
					 punishment meted out to bombers and languished terrorists is laughable.
					 Mathieu, recently convicted of planting bombs outside the Second Cup
					 restaurants in Montreal because the chain carried an English name, was charged
					 and sentenced and he will be serving no more than one to two months in jail.
					 This is his second offence for a terrorist bombing action. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge imposed the minimum sentence despite the fact
					 that Mathieu had a prior record for FLQ terrorist bombing and was described by
					 the judge himself as not yet rehabilitated and motivated. He was motivated: by
					 hate and prejudice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This underlines the reasoning behind the very real need
					 for the bill today. I support the bill but I would also suggest that it does
					 need vast improvements to strengthen it. However, it absolutely will be a tool
					 in the fight against terrorism.</p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, our attention has been turned upon a
					 changed world since the New York and Washington, D.C., terrorist attacks of
					 September 11. A paradigm shift has occurred, like no other that most of us will
					 ever see. I do not believe we will ever erase the impact of these tragic events
					 on our personal lives, on the life of our nation and indeed on that of our
					 global village. We have had a wake up call like few others in our history.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been very proud of the leadership of our Prime
					 Minister and of the tremendous competence exhibited by our cabinet ministers as
					 the government responded quickly, responsibly and carefully to the new
					 challenges of making our neighbourhoods, our country and our world safer for
					 everyone.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also been very impressed with the calm and
					 caring response of my constituents and Canadians from coast to coast who
					 refused to rush to justice. I believe the vast majority of my constituents and
					 Canadians, as they express their support for our American neighbours, want us
					 to deal firmly, effectively, thoroughly, but justly, with the threat of
					 terrorism everywhere, not only through this terrible episode but in the future
					 as well.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we debate Bill C-36, a bill to combat terrorism, let
					 us first review some of the many challenges that seized the attention of our
					 leaders and the government over the past month.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was the whole general area of security,
					 especially airport security. I remind members that each one of these security
					 matters entailed tremendously complex issues to be resolved and they were
					 resolved quickly and effectively with the assistance of a tremendous public
					 service. There was border security. As we all know, we share the longest
					 unprotected border in the world with our U.S. neighbours. Included with the
					 issue of border security was making sure that cross-border commerce would soon
					 return to some semblance of normality. I would like to mention that the
					 president one of my constituent businesses, Manitoulin Transport, contacted me
					 and asked for our best efforts to make sure that cross-border commerce would
					 return as soon as possible. I am sure every effort will be expended to achieve
					 that goal.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister and all of us have been seized with
					 trying to get life back to normal, making sure that tourists were travelling
					 and that small businesses were trading not only among themselves in this
					 country but across the border.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has been
					 seized with refugee and immigration issues, and of course the media attention,
					 especially in the early days, really put a tremendous amount of pressure on her
					 and the government. I appreciate how it was handled. Her response, along with
					 the responses of other ministers, resulted in great confidence across the
					 nation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More recently there have been issues of bioterrorism,
					 but we do not know the outcome yet. There is also the issue of money
					 laundering. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course there is the need to respond in a military
					 way to the call of our U.S. neighbours and allies to deal with terrorism. We
					 can only express our pride in and appreciation for our military personnel,
					 land, air and sea, for their willingness to be prepared and to, when needed,
					 enter into dangerous situations on our behalf to make sure that we, our
					 children and grandchildren can look forward to a more peaceful
					 world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The public has noted with approval the support of both
					 sides of the House for the involvement of our military in Afghanistan and here
					 at home and for the need for an appropriate military response. It has been
					 refreshing. Partisanship has for the most part been set aside during this
					 difficult time. I do know that the public appreciates that.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November 11 is the day that we cherish each year to
					 remember the members of our military from past wars and peacekeeping. We have
					 come to count upon our legion branches across this country to make sure that we
					 never forget the terror and tragedy of war. It is very comforting that at this
					 time we have those elders among us to make sure that we continue with measured
					 steps over the weeks, months and years ahead. There are many lessons that we
					 can learn from our legion members. I want to express thanks to them for what
					 they have done for us. I know that we will be counting on them considerably in
					 the future.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to very briefly mention that I think the
					 government's response to the September 11 attacks has been clear and concise.
					 Canada's anti-terrorism plan has four major objectives. The first is to
					 basically stop terrorists from getting into Canada in the first place and to
					 protect Canadians from terrorist acts. The second is to bring forward tools to
					 identify, prosecute, convict and punish terrorists. The third is to prevent the
					 Canada-U.S. border from being held hostage by terrorists and impacting on the
					 Canadian economy. We count on that Canada-U.S. trade. The fourth is to work
					 with the international community to bring terrorists to justice and address the
					 root causes of such hatred.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More specifically regarding Bill C-36, we must give
					 some credit to the great number of public servants who spent intense hours and
					 days in a large group effort to bring forth legislation that I believe will
					 withstand the test of time. However, with the assistance of the justice
					 committee it will no doubt be made even better. We commend them for their
					 efforts. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-36 includes defining and designating terrorist
					 groups and activities to make it easier to prosecute terrorists and those who
					 support them. It includes tougher sentences for terrorism offences. It would
					 make it an offence to knowingly participate in, facilitate or contribute to the
					 activities of a terrorist group. It would make it an offence to instruct anyone
					 to carry out a terrorist activity or an activity on behalf of a terrorist
					 group. It would be an offence to knowingly harbour a terrorist. Also, it would
					 move us forward in cutting off financial support for terrorists and would make
					 it a crime to knowingly collect money or give funds either directly or
					 indirectly in order to carry out terrorism. It would make it easier to deny or
					 remove charitable status from terrorist groups under the Income Tax Act and
					 easier to freeze and seize their assets. Of the 12 UN conventions, of which
					 Canada has already ratified 10, the last 2 are ratified in the bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hesitate to use the word war. I prefer the word
					 campaign, because I think our efforts here are about making peace. However,
					 sometimes making peace requires a firm hand and a firm resolve to deal with
					 people who would abuse the freedoms of others. This is not a campaign against
					 an ethnic group nor is it one against a country or a religion. It is a campaign
					 against terrorists, who are essentially criminals seeking to destabilize our
					 society for their own ends. Regardless of how they would rationalize those
					 ends, in the eyes of the vast majority of the people on this planet those ends
					 are not justifiable. Not only have they hijacked planes for their terrible
					 cause, they have also hijacked a great religion, Islam. Indeed, the roots of
					 Judaism, Islam and Christianity are the same. I am sure no amount of terrorism
					 will deter us from finding peace some day for the entire world.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I wish our military bon voyage, safe travel and a
					 quick return, I will conclude by expressing my hope that the co-ordinated
					 efforts of the countries of world at this time to deal with terrorism will in
					 due course turn to dealing with the other great challenges of this planet, such
					 as poverty, environmental pollution and other forms of crime.</p>

					 BQ): </b>

	Madam Speaker, in my statement this afternoon I
					 mentioned that we are campaigning for life without violence. This evening I am
					 obliged to speak of the violence that does exist.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bit of a paradox that we are obliged to speak
					 of such violent things once again, and it will certainly not be the last time
					 we will have to talk about the min the House. We speak of them not only in this
					 House, because I am sure people who watched us yesterday and are watching us
					 today and will watch us tomorrow will continue to speak of the events of
					 September 11. It is part of our day to day reality and we have no choice but to
					 speak of it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What really bothers me is that I was born in a free
					 country and want it to remain free. I would also like Quebec to be a free
					 country.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do I speak of that? Because it annoys me that we
					 have to pass such laws, bills that are vital but affect the balance between
					 security and freedom. I would never have thought that we would have to speak
					 more of security than of freedom.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have children and I hope they will live in a free
					 country. For us to be in a free country, our freedom must not be curtailed, and
					 this is what concerns me. Our fundamental guarantees must remain untouched
					 also.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talk of the constitution. This is a major issue. We
					 could simply talk of freedom, but we must look at the source of our freedom and
					 what makes us a democracy, which must be properly enshrined so that we can live
					 in a free country, on a free planet. This is something we should be able to
					 take for granted. We saw what happened on September 11. We had no
					 choice.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either people are poor or they live in an undemocratic
					 system. They have no freedom and in their lives they have a problem: they are
					 forced to live in abject poverty. That is the word, poverty.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poverty is why we are talking about antiterrorism
					 legislation today. This is a pity. I hope the money spent on it will not just
					 go to sanctions but will also reduce poverty and suffering so that we can solve
					 the problem of terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope this will be discussed. There is a lot of talk
					 about sanctions and how to stop terrorists, but is there another way to deal
					 with this problem? Maybe this should be looked at also. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were four objectives in the government's
					 anti-terrorist plan when work was begun on drafting this legislation: to
					 prevent terrorists from entering Canada and to protect Canadians and Quebecers
					 against terrorist acts; to provide tools for the identification, prosecution,
					 conviction and punishment of terrorists; to ensure that the border between
					 Canada and the United States is not taken hostage by terrorists, which would
					 have serious repercussions on our economy, both in Canada and Quebec; and to
					 co-operate with the international community to bring terrorists to justice and
					 to deal with the root causes of the hatred that motivates them. Those were the
					 four objectives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something will have to be done about this bill and I
					 hope that the government will have its ears wide open, both here and in
					 committee, that it will not go too fast and that it will listen to experts. We
					 can hear from people who not only are experts in international law but who know
					 a lot about terrorism. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want the definition of terrorism to be much more
					 precise and not as broad as what we find in the bill now. </p>


	<A NAME="T2105"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2105"><!-- Hour: 9--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2110"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2105)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That definition does not include a definition of a
					 terrorist. Of course we are told that we cannot get an international consensus
					 on what terrorism is. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that the bill only refers to terrorist
					 activities without defining terrorism. It goes without saying that it will be
					 difficult to do that, but we should not hurry, because what are terrorist
					 activities?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bill, the definition of terrorist activity is
					 twofold. Clause 83.01(1) reads as follows:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>an act or omission committed or
						  threatened in or outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, is one of the
						  following offences:—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is a list of ten conventions that were
					 signed and ratified by Canada. There are also two that remain to be ratified
					 and implemented in Canada.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clause 83.01(1) states the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>an act or omission, in or outside
						  Canada, </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(i) that is committed in whole or in
						  part—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most important part in that clause is the
					 expression “in whole or in part”.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expression “in whole or in part” opens up a lot of
					 possibilities. It is not restrictive. It leaves the door open to anything that
					 will follow. It gives an idea of what the legislator wants to do. The
					 legislator is the House of Commons. This expression is broad and is followed by
					 this:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(A)...for a political, religious or
						  ideological purpose, objective or cause,</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(B) ...with the intention of
						  intimidating the public, or a segment of the public, with regard to its
						  security, including its economic security, or compelling a person, a government
						  or a domestic or an international organization to do or to refrain from doing
						  any act, whether the person, government or organization is inside or outside
						  Canada—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I skip 83.01(1)<i>(b)</i>(ii)(A), (B), (C) and (D) to
					 go to the following:</p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>(E) to cause serious interference
						  with or serious disruption of an essential service, facility or system, whether
						  public or private, other than as a result of lawful advocacy, protest, dissent
						  or stoppage of work that does not involve an activity that is intended to
						  result in the conduct or harm referred to in any of clauses (A) to
						  (C).</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very broad. This paragraph says in part that the
					 organizations seem to be made up of unions or supporters. We have seen what
					 happened at the summit of the Americas in Quebec City. Police officers did a
					 good job. Some of the protesters were there but were not provoking anything.
					 However, things happened that could even be classified as terrorist acts.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot leave such a broad definition of terrorist
					 activity in this legislation. I believe a definition of terrorism should be
					 included, or the concept should at least be explained. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the European Commission meeting held in September, a
					 proposal was made to the council. Terrorist acts are said to generally affect
					 the physical and psychological integrity of a person or group of persons, their
					 property or their freedom, just as common law offences do. Terrorist offences
					 go much further than that, because they undermine the political, economical and
					 social structures of countries through violence. It is a very severe form of
					 crime. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, we find the following proposal in a
					 definition of a terrorist offence. </p>


	<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>Terrorist offence deliberately
						  committed by a person or group of persons against one or several countries,
						  their institutions, their population, with the intention to intimidate them and
						  to destroy or severely compromise the political, economic or social structures
						  of those countries, in particular murder, bodily harm, kidnapping or hostage
						  taking, blackmail, theft or robbery, unlawful seizure of governmental or state
						  facilities—</small></td>
</tr>

					 to the Minister of Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the
					 debate on Bill C-36. It is an important bill which will be going before the
					 justice committee. Canadians will be comforted to know that it is a very
					 important bill and that it will undergo rigorous scrutiny by the House, both at
					 second reading and in committee. Representatives from all parties will have an
					 opportunity to address witnesses, including the minister, departmental staff
					 and anybody else they feel has relevant information, because the bill is an
					 omnibus bill and touches a number of important aspects related to
					 terrorism.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many members have already put on the record a number of
					 the provisions of the anti-terrorism bill. I will leave it at that. There were
					 a couple of aspects though that I did want to deal with. It is important that
					 the definition of terrorism or terrorist activity is understood in the context
					 in which the bill deals with it. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Terrorist activity is defined as an offence under one
					 of the 10 UN anti-terrorism conventions or protocols as defined in another
					 jurisdiction or where for political, religious or ideological purposes one
					 threatens the public or national security by killing, seriously harming or
					 endangering a person, causing substantial property damage that is likely to
					 seriously harm people, or by interfering with or disrupting an essential
					 service, facility or system.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very important that we are focusing on and
					 dealing with terrorism. The definition is crafted to make it clear that
					 disrupting an essential service is not a terrorist activity. There has been
					 some concern about whether or not this application would be too broad. It is
					 not a terrorist activity if it occurs during a lawful protest at a work site or
					 is not intended to cause serious harm to persons. There is within the
					 definition this clear focus on truly defined terrorist activities.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill was introduced yesterday. Constitutional
					 experts will be looking at charter issues and criminal lawyers will be looking
					 at a number of the subtleties. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two issues have come up that I thought would be of
					 interest to dwell on. One is called the preventive arrest, which Canadians
					 should know about. We are talking about individual rights and freedoms and the
					 extent to which these things would be appropriate, given the circumstances of
					 September 11 and the challenge that free and democratic countries face now.
					 </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventive arrest is a process whereby something
					 similar to a grand jury would allow people, where there was a suspected or
					 alleged risk of terrorist activity, to be taken into custody. During this
					 process they would be subject to the rules of perjury. In other words, if they
					 lied or it was shown that they had lied in their responses, they could be
					 subject to the laws relating to perjury. They would not be able not to answer
					 questions in that hearing. If they did not answer, like in any other judicial
					 proceeding they would be held in contempt according to contempt
					 laws.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interestingly enough in this process nothing that they
					 would say could be used against them in the event that they were ultimately
					 charged. It is a separate process. It is a new instrument that I wanted
					 Canadians to be aware of. </p>


	<A NAME="T2120"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2120"><!-- Hour: 9--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2115"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2120)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of a preventive arrest, the outcome could
					 be that the people would simply be released because the judge was satisfied.
					 They could also be charged as a result of the information developed by the
					 investigation. They could even be released with certain conditions, similar to
					 a peace bond situation. This is mutual and Canadians would want to inform
					 themselves and watch the development of this issue.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second one I thought was interesting is a process
					 called the investigative hearing. This is something similar to a process
					 whereby people would receive a subpoena to appear before a hearing in which
					 they would be asked certain questions related to their activities. This may
					 lead to other things. However it is another tool which would help to achieve
					 the objectives of the bill to allow those who are responsible for detecting and
					 preventing terrorist activities from occurring to be able to deter terrorist
					 activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill contains a number of other aspects. Members
					 have very eloquently described the extension of wiretap provisions and the
					 impact on other jurisdictions, police forces and provincial
					 integration.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at this issue I thought about the ongoing
					 process and discussions of the post-September 11 attacks. It has to do with the
					 allegation by some that Canada is a haven for terrorists. This is a very
					 serious allegation and a very serious indictment and Canada should strongly
					 respond to the myth of that statement. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act will be one of the tools we can use to dispel
					 that myth. It would be quite legitimate to suggest that if Canada did not have
					 an effective anti-terrorism piece of legislation comparable to the legislation
					 in place in other jurisdictions such as the United States, Great Britain or
					 elsewhere it would be the weakest link. Canada would in fact become that haven.
					 It is very important for us to know what is going on internationally to make
					 sure that the provisions under this act work and work in the same realm of
					 effectiveness we see in other jurisdictions.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to finish off with something that concerned me a
					 bit today. There was a speech on the bill by the Leader of the Opposition in
					 the House. As usual, the discussion always seems to slip into immigration and
					 refugee issues. We talk about new Canadians and how we will toughen up the
					 Immigration Act because of criminals coming into Canada or what will we do
					 about it.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No issue has been stressed more by the Prime Minister,
					 the Minister of Foreign Affairs and members of our caucus than the importance
					 of understanding this is not a war against Afghanistan. There are terrorists
					 who happen to be in Afghanistan. We cannot let this become a cultural or a
					 religious bias. I do not think anyone in Canada would say that anyone of
					 Afghani background should be suspected of being a terrorist. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remind Canadians of what the Prime Minister said last
					 night in the debate and today in question period. We have taken every step
					 possible to ensure that the rights and freedoms of Canadians and all those on
					 our soil who are protected by the charter of rights have been fully taken into
					 account. Those rights and freedoms will be unaffected substantively by this
					 legislation. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that we, as a small country with a
					 baby boomer situation and an aging society, will depend very heavily on the
					 immigration system over the next 20 years to provide us with people to support
					 our population base and our economic base.</p>

					 (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian Alliance):
				  </b>

	Madam Speaker, as others have said 10 minutes is a very
					 short time. I can assure everyone that I wish I had an hour or two because
					 there are so many aspects of the bill I would like to speak on. What I will do
					 is limit myself to one part of the bill about which my colleagues have not
					 spoken. They have covered some very important areas in other parts of the bill,
					 but I would rather talk about some of the things that are missing from the
					 bill, and one in particular.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a conundrum that opposition MPs find
					 themselves in when the government comes out with a bill that has perhaps 60% of
					 or 40% or even 20% of what it should have in it. Do we vote against because it
					 does not have everything it is supposed to have or do we accept that it has
					 some good in it and pass it because anything is better than nothing? That is
					 something that I will need to look at.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says this is critically important. We
					 have even negotiated a swift passage of this bill to committee. That is why we
					 are in tonight at a late hour. If the government really were sincere about
					 that, I would remind it that we brought forward a supply day motion almost a
					 month ago that was essentially the same, in fact different only in the respect
					 that the government has left some things out that should be in it and which
					 were addressed in our supply bill.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope that the ministers present will pay particular
					 attention to what I have to say in the hope that they might convince their
					 colleague, the Minister of Transport, when they meet in committee to reconsider
					 some of the things he is doing or rather fails to be doing.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area I want to talk about, and which needs to be
					 addressed to seriously deal with terrorism or the threat of terrorism in the
					 country and the safety of Canadians, is airport and aircraft security. I want
					 to talk about a single example because that is unfortunately all that time will
					 permit. It is a very serious breach in airport security.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister is talking about spending a very large
					 portion of the money in the transport sector on enhanced new equipment that
					 will go into the big airports, such as Pearson, Montreal and Vancouver
					 International. The problem is, as the old saying goes, a chain is only as good
					 as its weakest link. There are dozens of small airports around the country that
					 feed into the big airport locations and have almost no security at all. They do
					 not have basic x-ray equipment.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bags are checked by very conscientious people using
					 nothing but their eyes and hands. As people might well figure, particularly
					 with hard shell luggage, it is not very hard to put false compartments or false
					 bottoms in certain types of suitcases. They can run them through and check
					 them, but we know already from the minister's own testimony in the House that,
					 just as bureaucrats attempted to take fake guns through security, one in five
					 make it through. That is in airports that have the fancier equipment
					 now.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happens when a sincere terrorist, who will use any
					 method available to him, tries to do this at some low key location? The
					 minister is putting all his eggs in the high traffic airports and is in fact
					 doing nothing. I asked him in committee and he confirmed that the government
					 had no plans whatsoever for these small airports.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People will go through security in these low key
					 airports and then fly to places like Vancouver, Calgary, Pearson or Montreal.
					 They will land in those airports and disembark into the terminal, not outside
					 but inside. Then they will pass this fancy new enhanced equipment, which the
					 minister has said he intends to purchase. What have we done? We have bypassed
					 all the safeguards the minister has claimed he will put in place. Those people
					 are now between the security system and the aircraft.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure everyone there are a lot of other ways. I
					 have worked in the industry for most of my life and I could go on for an hour
					 describing the various ways that a serious terrorist could breach security and
					 get weapons onto an aircraft. That means that the aircraft itself is the last
					 line of defence in terms of thwarting the plans of a hijacker or terrorist,
					 particularly one that is plotting some horrific action like what was done in
					 the United States on September 11.</p>


	<A NAME="T2130"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2130"><!-- Hour: 9--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2125"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2130)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those three things that must be done are these. The
					 cockpit crew must be secured. The crew must be informed of what is going on.
					 There has to be a method to subdue a hijacker if one should try to take over
					 the plane.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flight crew is secured inside the cockpit by having
					 a substantive locked door with the necessary structure so that it cannot easily
					 be broken down, never mind just opened. Once the crew is secured inside the
					 cockpit, it does little good if they do not know exactly what is going on
					 inside the main cabin. That can be done by installing a very inexpensive closed
					 circuit television that will give a view of what is occurring in the
					 cabin.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we have the crew inside a secured cockpit and we
					 have them informed as to what is going on. What happens if one or more
					 hijackers or terrorists try to take over that aircraft? What do they do if
					 terroriste hold a young flight attendant and threaten to cut her throat if the
					 crew does not open the door? What if they proceed to do it, then say they will
					 do it to one passenger every minute until they open the door, or conversely if
					 they start to break down the door?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Air marshals are one possibility, provided it happens
					 to be a flight on which there is an air marshal and provided there are not
					 enough terrorists on board that they actually outnumber the air
					 marshals.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that has been suggested is to arm the
					 crew. I personally do not think that is a great idea because before the flight
					 crew can use a firearm, if that is what they have been provided with, or stun
					 guns like British Airways has talked about, they first have to breach the
					 secure mechanism between them and the hijackers. They have to put themselves in
					 harm's way in order to have the possibility of using this. Depending upon what
					 the terrorists are armed with that may not be a very good idea.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will suggest something that is very drastic but I am
					 suggesting it under drastic circumstances. It is serious when passengers or
					 crew on board the aircraft are harmed seriously or killed or when there is an
					 attempt to break the door down. That suggests there is a good possibility the
					 aircraft could be used as a missile and flown into a building, as was the case
					 in New York City on September 11.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under those circumstances, we should have a serious
					 talk about the concept of having a cannister whereby the pilots could go on an
					 oxygen system and release the contents of that cannister into a main cabin and
					 put out the people who are in there. That is drastic, but so are CF-18s flying
					 in our airspace armed with missiles with the knowledge that they may be called
					 upon to shoot down that aircraft with its passengers. I fly a lot and if I had
					 my druthers I would far sooner be knocked out with a knockout gas than shot
					 down by one of our CF-18s.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly matters that we have a terrorism bill.
					 There definitely is some good in the bill, but there are some gaping holes in
					 it as well. Until we fill those, we are still putting at risk Canadians who are
					 depending on us to look after their safety. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe I will close with the facet of the costs
					 associated with this. I would suggest that there are no costs on a net basis.
					 One of the solutions for small airports, which has been discussed before, is to
					 do away with security at these airports. We are talking about Beach 200 twin
					 engine turbo props. We are talking about Dash 8s. No one will to hijack them.
					 They can be rented or leased without any security at all. If the aircraft are
					 flown to Vancouver, the passengers could be released not on the secure side but
					 into the main terminal building. If they wish to go onto the main aircraft,
					 they would then have to go through that enhanced security.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government got rid of the cost of putting the gas
					 system on board the airplane, building up the door and putting on a closed
					 circuit system. If the airlines did this they would create confidence in the
					 travelling public. If one passenger flew on each aircraft once at full fare
					 across Canada it would cover the entire cost. We can do a lot better than we
					 are doing with this bill. I hope the government will be amenable to improving
					 it when we reach committee.</p>

					 NDP): </b>

	Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-36.
					 These are particularly dangerous and fragile times not only for us as Canadians
					 but internationally as well. We are witnessing a United States led bombing
					 campaign in Afghanistan which, in my view and the view of my colleagues, is in
					 breach of international law. The response to the September 11 terrorist attacks
					 should be under the framework of the United Nations. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are also very dangerous and difficult times on
					 the domestic front. Thomas Berger wrote an eloquent book on the fundamental
					 rights and freedoms of Canadians. He called it <i>Fragile Freedoms</i> and
					 indeed the freedoms that Canadians have are fragile, particularly those set out
					 in the charter of rights and freedoms.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is precisely at times such as these that those
					 freedoms are potentially under the greatest assault. We recall during World War
					 I the internment of Canadians of Ukrainian origin, and in World War II the
					 internment of Canadians of Japanese origin and the confiscation of their
					 property.</p>


	<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course in 1970, the War Measures Act was invoked and
					 400 Quebecers were arrested without any evidence, incarcerated for several
					 weeks and then released.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am very proud of the fact that at the time the NDP
					 was the only party to say “No, this is not acceptable; this is an abuse of
					 power”.</p>


	<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we invoke the kinds of sweeping new powers
					 contained in Bill C-36, it is critically important that the government
					 demonstrate to Canadians that the existing powers in legislation accorded to
					 the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to CSIS, to the Communications Security
					 Establishment and to the Canadian armed forces are inadequate to respond to the
					 terrorist threat. If we are not in a position to ensure that is indeed the case
					 and if we are extending sweeping new powers, they risk violating the most
					 fundamental rights and freedoms set out in the charter of rights. I believe
					 that in a preliminary review of this legislation there are a number of
					 provisions of the legislation that risk violating the charter of rights and
					 freedoms. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a particular personal interest in that charter
					 having been a member of the constitution committee that drafted the charter of
					 rights back in 1980-81. I believe I am the only sitting member of the House who
					 was in fact a member of the committee that wrote the charter of rights and
					 freedoms. I recall the minister of justice at the time was the member for
					 Shawinigan, today's Prime Minister. We wrote that charter for a very specific
					 reason. It was to ensure, particularly at times of widespread popular sentiment
					 that might risk assaults on fundamental rights and freedoms, that the judiciary
					 would be in a position to say “No, you are going too far”. I believe that we
					 risk going too far in this legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly the internment of Canadians of Japanese
					 origin was popular. The proclamation of the War Measures Act was very popular.
					 However they were both profoundly wrong. When I read for example the definition
					 of terrorist activity in this legislation none of us have any concerns about
					 the incorporation of the various United Nations conventions. My colleague the
					 member for Winnipeg--Transcona, the New Democratic Party justice critic, spoke
					 earlier on this legislation. He pointed out that there was no issue with
					 respect to that or indeed a number of other provisions of this legislation that
					 we would be prepared to support.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However the definition of terrorist activity I believe
					 goes too far. It refers to political, religious or ideological purposes. It
					 talks about causing serious interference with or serious disruption of an
					 essential service, facility or system, whether public or private, other than as
					 a result of lawful advocacy. Consider for a moment the possible risks of this
					 and what this could be applied to. There are many examples of this, some
					 historic, some current. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The African National Congress in its fight against the
					 brutal and racist apartheid regime in South Africa would clearly have been
					 caught by this legislation, as would any Canadian who supported the African
					 National Congress in its fight against apartheid. I see the member for
					 Edmonton--Strathcona. I know he was a long time opponent of apartheid. He
					 probably even sent a dollar or two to assist in the struggle against it. Had
					 this legislation been in effect, he, as well as I and others, would have risked
					 imprisonment for that. I do not want to see us bringing in legislation that
					 would imprison people who are supporting those who are fighting tyrannical,
					 brutal, repressive regimes. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall the freedom fighters in East Timor fighting
					 against the genocidal Indonesian regime. I remember the Sandinistas fighting
					 against Somoza in Nicaragua. I remember the FMLN in El Salvador. Those are some
					 of the historic examples. As Alan Borovoy of the Canadian Civil Liberties
					 Association said, “It is one thing to say we won't countenance people assisting
					 dictators against democrats, but why shouldn't Canadians be free to assist
					 democrats against dictators?” This bill would appear to criminalize that
					 activity.</p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we know that there are people around the world
					 who are engaged in struggles. Whether Canadians agree or disagree with them, do
					 we want to define as terrorists those who support self-determination for the
					 Tamils, for the Chechens, for the Kurds or the Kashmiris? I think here
					 particularly of the Kurds who have been tortured, villages that have been
					 destroyed by the repressive Turkish regime, and member of parliament Leyla Zana
					 who has been imprisoned. For those of us who wish to support them in their
					 struggle against that repressive regime, would we be subject to this
					 legislation? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Canada would environmentalists or labour
					 activists who were engaged in protests be subject to the sweeping powers under
					 this bill?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Winnipeg--Transcona has pointed out
					 as well the provisions on preventive detention and investigative questioning,
					 the sweeping new wiretapping provisions, the new unprecedented powers to the
					 Communications Security Establishment, the powers for ministers to override the
					 freedom of information legislation by executive fiat.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say in closing that I would support sending the
					 subject matter of the bill to committee, and sending it to committee urgently,
					 but I cannot support the bill in its present form. I believe that the powers
					 that are in the bill constitute potentially a very grave abuse of civil
					 liberties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be a sunset clause as well, not simply a
					 review after three years but a sunset clause, to ensure that the many draconian
					 provisions of the bill in fact are not extended beyond a one year
					 period.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I voice my deep concern about the legislation and in
					 closing point out the words of Clayton Ruby who has reminded Canadians that
					 once these extraordinary powers are brought in, they are not rolled back. As
					 Fred Kaufman, a former judge of the Quebec Court of Appeal, who was appointed
					 by Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to prosecute people after the 1970 FLQ crisis,
					 said, “One has to be careful because emergency legislation drafted in haste
					 stays on the statute book”.</p>

					 Bill C-36.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

						Desrochers, a young boy from my riding of Hochelaga--Maisonneuve. Then there
						was Bill C-24, which is currently before the other House.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I give speeches, I always start by saying that
						  it is important to find the proper balance between the role of the state, which
						  is to ensure public safety and security, especially when it comes to fighting
						  organized crime or, as in this case, terrorism, and the most virulent forms of
						  terrorism we have witnessed in September. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still think that we need to balance the tools
							 we give the state and its officers, including police officers, with the
							 freedoms that are so dear to all of us.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been and still am under the impression
								that with the defunct Bill C-95 and with Bill C-24 we had managed to reach our
								goal. After a quick glance at Bill C-36, I am not so sure we can do it with
								this legislation.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it stands today, if we were to have a vote
								  at third reading to pass as is all the provisions introduced today, I would
								  find it somewhat difficult to support the government. Why? The problem is not
								  the goal, as I believe that everyone of us will agree with the principle that
								  we must fight terrorism as it now exists.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we talk about keeping terrorists out
									 of Canada, when we are asked to provide the necessary tools to identify and
									 prosecute people who carry out terrorist acts, I agree. When we are told that
									 we must prevent the Canada-U.S. border from being held hostage by terrorists, I
									 agree. When we are told we must work in co-operation with the international
									 community to bring terrorists to justice, in particular to be tried by an
									 international court, these are all goals that we fully support and for my part
									 I support them, just as my Bloc Quebecois colleagues do. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that to know whether to
										reach such goals, which are not only laudable but our duty as parliamentarians,
										do we really need a two page long definition, like a Spanish inn where everyone
										and anyone can find something to his liking? </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the definition of a
										terrorist act, and I quote:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(b)—an act or omission, in or outside Canada—
											 </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far so good. Then it
										states:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(A) —in whole or in part for a political, religious or
											 ideological purpose, objective or cause— </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This exposes the government to a lot of
										criticism. Then it states:</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right">
</td>
<td><small>(B)...with the intention of intimidating the public, or a
											 segment of the public, with regard to its security, including its economic
											 security, or compelling a person, a government, or a domestic or international
											 organization to do or to refrain from doing any act, whether the person,
											 government or organization is inside or outside Canada.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I believe, might lead to excesses.
										A militant organization opposed to the status quo might be working to bring
										about changes for ideological reasons and one might consider that to be
										economically compelling. One might consider it to be compelling as far as the
										government structure is concerned.</p>


	<A NAME="T2150"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-2150"><!-- Hour: 9--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T2155"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T2145"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(2150)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not a definition that should
										automatically apply to non-terrorist organizations.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep it short, I think that in
										  committee we will need to tighten the definition of terrorist activity or
										  terrorist group.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will also have to
											 consider very seriously another matter of concern, which is the fact that the
											 Attorney General of Canada, the Minister of Justice, might use information to
											 build a case or to instruct her officers to act on her behalf without
											 necessarily having to account for how she carries out her duties.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this means is that the
												Attorney General of Canada or any of her officers could act in such a way that
												we would end up with no one being held accountable. Not only would no one
												account for their actions, but we would not be able to find out why they acted
												the way they did because that information would not be made available through
												access to information.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another area of concern relates
												  to the fact that in a piece of legislation as important as the one dealing with
												  gangs and organized crime, the government found a way to use judicial
												  authorizations in just about any circumstances, but it will not be able to do
												  so in this case.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my time has expired, I
													 will conclude by saying that I hope some serious work will be done in
													 committee. I must say that we will have a number of criteria. For example, we
													 hope that the legislation, once it is passed, will remain in force only for a
													 specified period. That means that after three years it should not be simply
													 reviewed and extended. We want parliamentarians to have the opportunity to vote
													 on it again, because the time will have come to determine to what extent it has
													 helped us meet our objectives. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to caution the
														government against trying to fast track the process in a way that would give us
														only a few days to consider this bill in committee. I think that somewhere
														around Christmastime would be a decent target from a parliamentary point of
														view. </p>

					 Lib.): </b>

	Madam Speaker, the introduction of this legislation has
					 generated a configurative response which tends to characterize if not
					 stereotype the discussion as one of national security versus civil liberties.
					 Accordingly, I would like to identify if not briefly comment upon a cluster of
					 areas that have been configured as national security versus civil liberties
					 concerns.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to suggest that the appropriate optic
						should be that of human security, that the appreciation of this legislation
						should be approached from the perspective of the promotion and protection of
						human security and which sees the anti-terrorism law and policy as a priority
						on the human rights agenda and not simply on a national security agenda, and
						which jettisons the moral and legal shibboleth that one person's terrorist is
						another person's freedom fighter, which has blunted and blurred the moral and
						juridical divides and pre-empted and precluded effective anti-terrorism law and
						policy.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it has been said that the legislation is not
						  unlike the War Measures Act, that it is violative of our guaranteed fundamental
						  freedoms under the charter of rights and freedoms and that it will not pass
						  constitutional muster. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to recall that there was no
							 charter of rights at the time of the War Measures Act, that the provisions
							 authorizing preventive detention and the like under the War Measures Act have
							 no parallel under the present legislation; that the rights and freedoms under
							 the charter are not absolute but are subject to reasonable limitations
							 prescribed by law, as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic
							 society; and that the supreme court has developed a number of interpretative
							 principles, such as the contextual principle, the internationalist principle
							 and the comparativist principle, to determine whether any limitations are in
							 fact demonstrably justified.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, under the contextual principle,
								the issue would not be examined under the abstractions of national security
								versus civil liberties, but under the concrete case and context of terrorist
								assaults on human security. </p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the internationalist principle, the
								  court would look to see whether the legislation is in pursuit of our
								  international treaty undertakings and the like.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the comparativist principle, the
									 court would look to see what other free and democratic societies like the
									 United States and the United Kingdom have done. Under the margin of deference
									 principle the court might well defer to a parliamentary judgment respecting the
									 overall promotion and protection of human security in the face of this
									 international terrorist assault.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the question arises whether the
										definition of what constitutes terrorist activity and terrorist offences and
										whether these definitions are over-broad or sufficiently circumscribed to pass
										constitutional muster. It is clear that in respecting the delineation of
										terrorist offences, pursuant to the 10 issue specific international
										anti-terrorism treaties, these offences are properly defined and circumscribed
										and they incorporate by reference definitions already under the international
										treaties and present in the criminal code.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to new definitions of
										  terrorist activity as set forth in proposed section 83.01 of the act, they
										  appear to be clearly defined, both with respect to the character of the
										  terrorist acts and the mens rea, or guilty intent, required for prosecutable
										  purposes.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, with respect to the issue of
										  participation and contribution offences, the burden of proof will be on the
										  state to establish that there was intent on the part of the accused that the
										  activities were for the purpose of facilitating or carrying out terrorist
										  activity.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, there is the issue respecting
											 the process of adding a group to the list of terrorists. Admittedly, it
											 incorporates a number of protections, including provisions for removal,
											 judicial review and safeguards to address cases of mistaken identity. As well,
											 the list must be reviewed every two years by the solicitor general, but this
											 well may become a politicized provision which would prejudice the integrity of
											 the anti-terrorism law and policy and therefore should be approached with
											 respect to appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth, there is the civil
												forfeiture scheme, which raises the question as to whether the procedural
												safeguards respecting confiscation of property are sufficient. In that context
												it is important to note that the safeguards include court protection of the
												interests of family members in the principal residence, access to the property
												in order to meet reasonable living and business needs and legal expenses and
												appeal procedures.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sixth, there is the issue of the
												  financing of terrorism offences. Here it is important to appreciate that this
												  offence has been established pursuant to our prospective ratification of the
												  international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism,
												  that it requires the consent of the attorney general to prosecute, and that the
												  state must establish a mens rea threshold that the accused knew or intended
												  that the moneys or resources were in fact being used to plan, facilitate or
												  carry out terrorist acts. </p>

	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventh, in fulfilling its
												  mandate to collect information, the Communications Security Establishment must
												  receive authorization from the Minister of National Defence to intercept any
												  communication to or from a foreign target located outside Canada that
												  originates or ends in Canada. Admittedly the minister must be satisfied before
												  issuing such an authorization that measures are in place to protect the privacy
												  of Canadians, but should there be a requirement for a judicial authorization
												  cabinet ministers would delegate this authority.</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three other points in
													 the bill which I will identify. Eighth, is there a breach of the solicitor
													 client privilege with respect to information disclosures mandated under the
													 act? Ninth, what about the provisions respecting preventive arrest which
													 admittedly required judicial authorization and consent of the attorney general
													 but which are new procedural approaches in that regard? Tenth, are there
													 investigative hearing provisions where the judge may order the examination of a
													 material witness?</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are 10 neuralgic points
														which the Standing Committee of Justice and Human Rights will address in the
														days and weeks ahead.</p>
