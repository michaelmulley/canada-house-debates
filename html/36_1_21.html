</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of taking into account safety concerns 
and local economic spin-offs before proceeding with any further 
privatization of Marine Atlantic services between Cape Breton and 
Newfoundland. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I rise today on this issue because it 
is of considerable importance to the people in my riding who live 
in and around the port of North Sydney, an historic port and an 
area which I believe was once the fourth most important port in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, unfortunately, the towns of North Sydney and Sydney Mines 
are in a difficult economic situation for a number of reasons. 
Partly it is because of the dependence on the coal industry in 
the town of Sydney Mines.  As a result of the decline in the coal 
industry there has been a decline in the port facilities and 
shipping in the town of North Sydney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of crucial concern is the link between North Sydney and Port au 
Basque, an historic link which has existed for close to a century 
when North Sydney was the gateway to Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I left Cape Breton early this morning.  I would be remiss if I 
did not comment on the weather, which was sunny and clear and 
with no snow on the ground.  As I had an opportunity to fly over 
the island, it afforded me a chance to look down on the town of 
North Sydney and the tremendous waterways and the ocean that form 
the coastline of Cape Breton.  Historically that coastline has 
been a source of tremendous wealth and development, not only for 
Cape Breton but also for Canada.  When the Europeans first came 
here they arrived on that coastline.  In fact, the first fishing 
boats came to North Sydney as early as the 15th century and began 
what was to develop into a tremendous trading port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1834 the British based General Mining Association built the 
first coal shipping pier in North Sydney.  It also built the 
first iron railway in North America which ran between Sydney 
Mines and North Sydney, allowing the mined coal to be transferred 
to the ports for shipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By 1850 North Sydney was a major, busy centre of activity and by 
1880 there was a bank, a jeweller and the development of a town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>North Sydney was a major port in what was then the province of 
Cape Breton. There are those on the island who think perhaps we 
should return to those days. However, at that time we were still 
a separate province, not annexed by the province of Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1885 North Sydney sought incorporation as the first 
municipality on the island.  As I have indicated, in the 1870s it 
was the fourth largest port behind Montreal, Quebec and Halifax. 
In approximately 1889 it became the gateway to Newfoundland. 
It became the mainland terminal for ferry service to that 
province although it was not a province at that time.  On June 
30, 1889 the first ship left from Port aux Basques with 50 
passengers and arrived in North Sydney.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That pattern has been repeated for 100 years.  It is a pattern 
guaranteed to the province of Newfoundland under the terms of 
Confederation; that there would be established a transportation 
link to connect the island of Newfoundland to the mainland of 
Canada. The town of North Sydney prospered as a result, as did 
the town of Port aux Basques.  Many sailors, many fishing and 
trading vessels made that port their home.  In both communities 
there was the development of hotels and restaurants, ship supply 
stores and many merchants to provide for the needs of those 
sailors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During World War I the port of North Sydney again played 
decisive role.  We can still see the remnants of battalions. That 
repeated itself on the 1940s where North Sydney was an assembly 
port for the ships loaded at the “Saint River” ports before 
they crossed the ocean. In 1941 there were over 400 ships 
anchored in the port of North Sydney. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brief historical outline will indicate the importance of 
shipping and the shipping trade to the town.  It is no secret 
that over the last number of years, with the decline in the 
fisheries and with the decline in the coal industry, the town of 
North Sydney has suffered a tremendous economic burden. Despite 
that the people of the town are resolute.  They have continued to 
thrive.  Some of the businesses have been there for 100 years. 
They are family businesses.  One bank remains committed to the 
town.  The town has not prospered but it has endured and made the 
best of a bad situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is tremendous uncertainty in that town today.  Those who 
come from not quite as economically advantaged parts of Canada as 
others will understand that when there is uncertainty in a town 
like North Sydney, it has tremendous ramifications on investment 
and on the social fabric of the town.  That uncertainty derives 
from whether Marine Atlantic will continue to be an economic 
presence in that town. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for the uncertainty is many fold.  In part there are 
rumours, as there always are in certain towns where there is one 
major employer, of downsizing, of privatization, of alternate 
routes.  There is concern that the head office of Marine 
Atlantic, which is now located in Moncton, may become the centre 
for reservations which employ a number of people in the town, and 
there is a concern that there may be a decline in activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That kind of uncertainty spreads throughout the entire island. 
When I talk about the town of North Sydney it is important to 
understand that it is perhaps a 20 minute drive from Sydney which 
also benefits from any economic activity in that port. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not clarified what the minister of 
transportation intends to do with the whole Marine Atlantic 
enterprise.  I point to section 140(1) of Bill C-9 which may not 
seem terribly important to anyone who is not from North Sydney. 
The section allows the minister to enter into agreements with any 
persons, including the government of a province, in respect of 
the continued services of Canada's constitutional obligations, 
which is a direct reference to the ties to Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 140(1)(b) ensures “the continuation of services similar 
to those provided by Marine Atlantic Inc. before the transfer, 
sale or disposal on the terms and conditions that the minister 
considers appropriate, including by making financial 
contributions or grants or other financial assistance”, and in 
section 140(1)(c) “the assets of Marine Atlantic Inc. that are 
transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of under subsection 
(2)”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition section 140(2) indicates “Marine Atlantic Inc. is 
authorized to transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of all or 
substantially all of its assets used in any major business or 
activity of the corporation, including the shares of a 
subsidiary”. 
To the people of the town of North Sydney this heightens the 
concern they have surrounding the enterprise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To illustrate the importance of the Marine Atlantic to the 
general area, let me indicate what was spent from 1995 to 1996 by 
Marine Atlantic in the town of North Sydney.  I will not read the 
entire list, but I will read those in a community as desperate 
for economic growth as we are in Cape Breton: Lingan Builders 
Limited, $36,000; Ojolick Associates, a local architect, $35,000; 
Professional Upholstery, $3,300; R&A Paper Products, $31,700; 
Clover Produce, close to $300,000, because it provides much of 
the foodstuffs for the ferry service that travels back and forth; 
Convention Cape Breton, $17,000; Ryan Wayne Carpet Sales, 
$63,000; Standard Office Supplies, $11,400; and the list goes on 
to indicate the kind of impact the enterprise has on the 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these companies are small, locally run businesses in the 
towns of North Sydney and Sydney.  They all employ three to four 
people from the community in solid jobs.  The loss or the 
downsizing of Marine Atlantic would have a tremendous impact on 
the local economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we have sought clarification from the government on what 
its plans are for Marine Atlantic so that at least the people in 
the community can make their plans, we have not received any 
clear message.  I can cite correspondence between me and the 
minister and between my predecessor and the former minister 
wherein requests were made on the future of Marine Atlantic. The 
responses continue to be somewhat vague.  I could illustrate that 
by reading an example into the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 20, 1997 the Canadian Auto Workers, which is the union 
that represents many of the workers, sought from the then 
minister of transport some clarification.  The letter stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rumours—cause much stress for the employees of Marine Atlantic. 
We, Mr. Minister, as the executive of the unions representing 
1,300 Marine Atlantic employees in Atlantic Canada,—are asking 
you to respond to us as quickly as possible to advise us of the 
facts. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The response was anything but clear.  It stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expected that Marine 
Atlantic will continue to operate this service with the aim of 
reducing costs and increasing efficiency.  Please be assured that 
you will be informed if there is any change of circumstances 
concerning the future of Marine Atlantic as an ongoing concern. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a commitment in the letter to maintain the 
constitutional requirement of service between Newfoundland and 
Cape Breton.  However the matter of privatization was not clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read from a pamphlet given out by Rod Morrison, president 
and CEO of Marine Atlantic, to the workers.  The date on it was 
some time after the letter to the minister.  He stated in the 
pamphlet: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no truth to these damaging rumours and I want 
you to know the Government of Canada has not given me any direct 
or indirect indication that privatization is imminent. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to state something that was important: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the best people, the best ships, the best technology and, 
with a continual commitment towards efficiency, I am satisfied we 
will remain as the operators. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Notwithstanding I wrote to the current minister requesting 
clarification and the response I received was: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the location of the—head office, MAI is currently 
examining all options and will put forward a recommendation in 
due course.  Any proposed relocation will, however, be based on 
commercial considerations— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people in North Sydney and Sydney Mines are under very real 
stress as a result of the unclear position of the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last weekend when I was in my riding it was raised by two 
constituents.  I was not in the town of North Sydney.  These were 
people I met in Sydney while I was at a meeting there.  They 
talked about the impact on their families.  It is important for 
us to know exactly what direction the government will be moving 
in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect I have asked the government to consider in this 
motion is the safety impact.  Currently Marine Atlantic has a 
good safety record, one of the best in North America, because 
there is a strong unionized workforce, a satisfied workforce, and 
it has been operating the transportation link for near 100 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing I ask the government to consider the advisability of 
taking into account safety concerns and the local economic 
spinoffs before proceeding with any further privatization of the 
service between Newfoundland and Cape Breton. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I consider it a privilege to 
address the motion put before the House by the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria.  It asks the government to take into account 
the safety concerns and local economic spinoffs before proceeding 
with any further privatization of Marine Atlantic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go any further, however, allow me to assure the hon. 
member and all other members of the House that safety is the 
government's top priority when it comes to transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Economic growth and job creation are important objectives and 
solid reasons behind why the government is pursuing the 
commercialization of marine services and facilities.  Marine 
Atlantic Inc., a crown corporation established back in 1986, has 
operated six ferry and coastal services since its inception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These have included the constitutionally guaranteed ferry links 
between North Sydney, Nova Scotia and Port-aux-Basques, 
Newfoundland, and between Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick, and 
Borden, P.E.I.  In addition, a convenient alternative to the 
highway was provided year round between Saint John, New 
Brunswick, and Digby, Nova Scotia.  Seasonal services were also 
operated between Labrador and Newfoundland; between North Sydney, 
Nova Scotia, and Argentia, Newfoundland; and between Yarmouth, 
Nova Scotia, and Bar Harbor, Maine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 Marine Atlantic carried 2.8 million passengers, 965,000 
passenger vehicles and 290,000 commercial vehicles.  The company 
has also done an excellent job for many years.  Marine Atlantic 
employees are to be commended for their efforts.  Like most 
organizations, however, Marine Atlantic has been affected by our 
fiscal concerns and by the need for increased efficiencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national marine policy announced in December 1995 called for 
Marine Atlantic to substantially reduce its costs and increase 
efficiency ensuring that the most effective and efficient use is 
made of tax dollars in the delivery of government services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the government's efforts to reduce the deficit 
numerous commercialization initiatives have been concluded with 
both the private sector and the province of Newfoundland.  These 
have had a significant impact on the operations of Marine 
Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to provide the hon. member for Sydney—Victoria 
with the following update.  In July 1995 Newfoundland accepted a 
one time cash payment of $55 million in exchange for assuming 
responsibility for the provision of ferry services on the south 
coast of Newfoundland, previously provided by Marine Atlantic, 
and services between Jackson's Arm and Harbour Deep provided by a 
private operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In March 1997 Newfoundland also took over the remaining ferry 
services in Labrador provided by Marine Atlantic as well as 
assignment of the St. Barbe, Newfoundland, and Blanc Sablon, 
Quebec, ferry services in exchange for a lump sum payment of $340 
million.  This service was provided by Marine Atlantic in 1997 
under contract with the province.  Future provision of the 
coastal service is under study by the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of the national marine policy a request for 
proposals was issued by Transport Canada in July 1996 seeking 
commercial interests in assuming Marine Atlantic's Yarmouth, Nova 
Scotia, Bar Harbor, Maine, Saint John, New Brunswick and Digby, 
Nova Scotia, ferry services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This resulted in the selection of Bay Ferries Limited of 
Charlottetown, P.E.I., to assume operation of these two services 
effective April 1, 1997. 
Under this agreement the federal subsidy will be eliminated in 
three years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opening of the Confederation Bridge on June 1 of this year 
replaced the federal constitutional obligation for ferry service 
between Borden, P.E.I., and Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of these different initiatives the subsidy paid to 
Marine Atlantic has been reduced.  It will drop from $122 million 
in 1993 to a forecasted $25 million in 1999.  That is a 
significant savings to the taxpayer.  Equally important, and I 
know it is of great concern to the hon. member, it is a savings 
that has not come at the expense of service.  Those who relied on 
Marine Atlantic two years ago continue to receive ferry service 
today either from the company or a private operator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine Atlantic remains an important partner in Newfoundland's 
economy providing the constitutionally guaranteed service between 
North Sydney, Nova Scotia, and Port aux Basques and the 
alternative ferry service between North Sydney and Argentia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has not received or requested any 
proposals to take over these remaining Marine Atlantic ferry 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Sydney—Victoria will be happy to learn that the 
federal government will continue to support all constitutionally 
mandated ferry services as well as those to remote communities. 
Such services need not always be provided by Marine Atlantic but 
they must be provided and they must be there in a reliable sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Transport Canada will continue to explore options to reduce the 
cost to the taxpayer of subsidized ferry services.  It is 
expected that Marine Atlantic will continue to operate the 
Newfoundland services with the aim of reducing costs and 
increasing efficiency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will continue to regulate ferries for safety. Any 
operator of ferry services, whether it be Marine Atlantic or 
someone else, must meet the stringent safety requirements set out 
by Transport Canada's marine safety branch.  Furthermore in most 
commercialization initiatives it is likely that the same vessel 
would be used to provide the ferry service under a charter 
agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marine Atlantic has been able to achieve significant savings for 
the taxpayer.  Subsidies have been reduced even as service has 
been maintained.  Safety remains a top priority and all ferry 
operators must continue to meet the highest standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government believes it has done an excellent job 
assisting in the transition to a more flexible and efficient 
arrangement for ferry services.  We are therefore happy to 
support the private member's motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That—the government should consider the advisability of taking 
into account safety concerns and local economic spin-offs before 
proceeding with any further privatization of Marine Atlantic 
services— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such concerns have received top priority since the day the 
national marine policy was announced almost two years ago.  Hon. 
members can be assured that they will continue to weigh very 
heavily in all the government's policy decisions. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I too am pleased to speak on the motion today.  It is a 
timely issue, particularly in light of the economic stresses and 
changes impacting citizens in Atlantic Canada over the last 
while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also allows us to examine the performance of the federal 
government on this issue and related issues.  I congratulate my 
colleague from Sydney—Victoria for raising the issue today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
consider the advisability of taking into account safety concerns 
and local economic spin-offs before proceeding with any further 
privatization of Marine Atlantic services between Cape Breton and 
Newfoundland. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important because it addresses the ferry service between 
Cape Breton and Port aux Basques as well as the summer service 
between Cape Breton and Argentia, Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the impact of the service on Cape Breton is substantial, 
for Newfoundland it is essential for the ferry to provide a 
critical link between Newfoundland and the rest of Canada.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, as has been mentioned, the federal government has a 
constitutional obligation. One of the conditions of Newfoundland 
entering Confederation was that there would be a year-round ferry 
service between that province and the mainland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a number of fronts this is very important both to Cape Breton 
and to Newfoundland.  An efficient and economical transportation 
system is vitally important to our Atlantic provinces. In any 
analysis or discussion about the economic opportunities in that 
part of the country, a timely, cost efficient and effective 
transportation system does become a very critical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The marine Atlantic ferry and coastal services are a vital 
component of the maritime transportation network.  With the new 
economic development such as Sable Island gas, the Voisey's Bay 
development, Hibernia and other economic opportunities, these 
ferry services and the ability of citizens to access different 
parts of the Atlantic provinces quickly and easily will become 
more and more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been very interesting to see how this whole area of 
privatization of the ferry services has developed.  As many 
people are aware, privatization has not just taken place in the 
Newfoundland and Cape Breton end of ferry services, but there has 
been significant change in the Yarmouth to Bar Harbour and Digby 
to Saint John legs of the ferry service.  This has caused a great 
deal of concern to many of the people in that area and rightly 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noted just recently in the October 16 <I>Chronicle-Herald</I> a 
very disturbing headline, “East coast towns suffer as 
transportation links are lost”.  The big headline is even worse, 
“Yarmouth—A dead area, according to a lobbyist”.  One can 
imagine for those Canadians who live in those areas how concerned 
they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that there are changes due to economic restructuring and 
positive changes as time goes on.  Sometimes as some job 
opportunities are lost, others open up. Having said that, it is 
up to the government as the responsible party here to really 
examine the impact and planning that goes into these kinds of 
changes to minimize the negatives for the citizens involved. I 
think that is what my colleague from Sydney—Victoria mentioned 
in his motion and with which the government agrees, according to 
the government speaker, needs to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to talk to some of the people I personally 
know out in that part of the world and to get their comments on 
some of these privatization changes.  I received a comment from a 
lady who was pretty pointed about things.  She said, “In the 
current government's headlong rush to privatize, they have 
maintained consistency in the way they have handled all their 
other programs.  Namely, they are consistent in their poor 
planning and in their failure to acknowledge long range 
considerations.  They just do things and walk away from the 
consequences”.  That really sums up how a lot of people in 
Atlantic Canada feel about some of these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes there is a bit of a characterization of my party, the 
Reform Party, as being just in favour of privatization of 
anything and everything at all cost.  That is certainly not the 
case. One of the founding principles of Reform, the principles on 
which we think public policy should be formulated, is principle 
17.  We believe that the legitimate role of government is to do 
for people whatever they need to have done but cannot do it all 
or do as well for themselves individually or through 
non-governmental organizations.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Reform were looking at this ferry service and how it could be 
best run, the first thing we would look at is what would best 
serve the interests of the people who are being affected by the 
service, who are using the service, who are the end users of 
whatever government does here. We would examine whether this is a 
service that cannot be done by people, either individually or 
through non-governmental organizations, as well as government 
could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it were decided that this was a service that government could 
do better than any other organization, then we would make sure 
that was delivered. If it was decided in consultation with the 
end users letting the people who are affected speak for 
themselves instead of the made in Ottawa solutions that so often 
take place, then we would make sure that the move toward 
delivering the service in that manner through a non-governmental 
agency was again done in the best interests of the people with 
long term planning, with careful steps and with an 
acknowledgement of the need to minimize the impact on the people 
who are using it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting when reading the headline “Yarmouth area 
dead” to remember that Yarmouth has not only lost its ferry 
service but it lost the rail service and the air service. Also 
the highway down to that part of the country is in severe 
disrepair in many areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One wonders if the headline were “Shawinigan area dead” 
whether there would be the same attitude of this government as 
there is to the headline “Yarmouth area dead”.  I suspect there 
would be a great deal of scrambling to make sure that the 
negative consequences for some parts of the country were a lot 
better looked after than they have been for the part of the 
country we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party has given a great deal of thought to ways and 
means to revitalize the economy of the Atlantic provinces.  There 
have been a number of studies done in the Atlantic provinces 
themselves that point to the fact that the traditional approach 
of the old line parties simply has not worked at all in the best 
interests of Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atlantic Institute for Market Studies, itself based in 
Atlantic Canada, came out with a stinging report just a few 
months ago.  It said that the traditional agencies of subsidy and 
political patronage that have been put into place in the past 
have actually been a real hindrance to economic growth and 
prosperity in that part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan is based on a strong, vital transportation network as 
part of the plan to rejuvenate and revitalize the Atlantic 
economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We too support this motion.  We feel it is an appropriate 
motion.  We hope the government will take a long sober look at 
the best interests of Atlantic Canadians when making changes such 
as those the government has made in the past.

consider the advisability of taking into account safety 
concerns and local economic spin-offs before proceeding with 
any further privatization of Marine Atlantic services between 
Cape Breton and Newfoundland. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, moreover, pleased that fate has given me the opportunity 
to speak on this subject this morning, since I had the pleasure as 
a tourist this summer to use the services of Marine Atlantic with 
my family. Its services are highly appropriate, highly competent, 
and very secure.  This motion uses three terms which draw my 
attention: “safety”, “local economic spin-offs” and 
“privatization”, and I would like to speak a little on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to privatization, which I shall return to at the 
end of my speech, this must be handled with kid gloves, for if 
there must be privatization it must not mean a change for the 
worse.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are talking about a ferry that can accommodate over 
1,300 persons, if I remember correctly, and 400 motor vehicles, an 
imposing ship, safety measures are self-evident.  It was very very 
well maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Failure to keep it so can lead to drama.  There was such a 
drama in the North Sea, in the Mediterranean, with a similar ship. 
It was doubtless not properly maintained.  There was negligence, 
whereas here in the maritimes the ships are well maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, from a safety standpoint, before we start talking about 
privatization, we should ensure that today's standards are 
maintained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another area where caution should be exercised.  I am 
speaking of benefits to the local economy.  We can imagine that the 
government has taken care for some one hundred years—it was in 
1889 that it took over the Port-aux-Basques to North Sydney run, 
and I have taken the trip between Port-aux-Basques and North Sydney 
and North Sydney and Argentia, a comfortable 14 hour trip—to do 
two things at once: provide a safe and adequate service to users 
and to promote regional economic development by encouraging local 
economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we put this service into the hands of private enterprise, 
we will have no guarantee in economic terms of the same interest, 
the same care and the same concerns or of any desire on the part of 
the new management to develop the local economy, which, as my 
colleague from Sydney—Victoria pointed out, is facing difficulties 
in the fishing and coal industries.  As we all know, the maritimes 
are facing a very difficult period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the time to question a winning formula.  The 
service is a good reliable one that provides obvious local 
benefits.  More attention should be paid to it.  When the 
government privatizes or jettisons a public asset, there is no 
guarantee that the resource will be better utilized or the service 
better provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our transport critic told me on the phone this morning with 
regard to the motion, he hears more and more comments to the effect that 
services, maintenance or safety at the Quebec airports that were 
privatized—particularly in Mont-Joli, Sept-Îles and Rouyn-Noranda—may 
not be at the level they used to be before privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not become dogmatic. The current thinking in the western 
world is that the state must delegate more and more of its traditional 
responsibilities to all sorts of stakeholders. Yet, common sense 
dictates that responsibilities in the air, marine and railway 
transportation sectors should be those of the state, of the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is currently a belief in the western world—and the 
Canadian government helps promote it—that the state no longer has any 
business providing these services. A debate is urgently needed to 
challenge the idea that the private sector is the solution to all our 
problems. Quite the contrary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One can see that poverty is on the rise, that there is a 
globalization of misery. 
Instead of having increasingly civilized societies, we now have two-tier 
societies where the very rich make up 15% of the population. As I was 
recently told, in Chile, for example, and in Argentina, which have 
public health services on a par with those in Quebec and Canada, 
following all these free trade policies, all these pressures to promote 
globalization and freer trade, if one gets sick who does not belong to 
the select 15% club, it seems—and I hope I am wrong—one better 
bring his or her own sheets to the hospital. 
If you are hospitalized in Chile, the more family members you have 
to come and feed you the better.  From what I hear, the health care 
systems in Argentina and Chile were as good as ours until they were 
undermined to a point that is a disgrace to countries that call 
themselves civilized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So I am very pleased to be speaking to this issue this 
morning, because when you have a winning formula such as Marine 
Atlantic ferry services, which runs perfectly well, on time and 
safely, why mess around? 
Why run the risk of turning this over to any old Tom, Dick or 
Harry, who will, in all likelihood, think it is alright to maximize 
his profit and who will perhaps take chances with government 
inspectors, as we see too often, and possibly endanger the lives 
and safety of tourists visiting this lovely area of the maritimes, 
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We therefore readily agree with this motion.  We congratulate 
the minister from Sydney—Victoria for presenting it and, as the 
member for Trois-Rivières, I can say that I view it as part of a 
much larger movement that we must increasingly oppose because, the 
official rhetoric notwithstanding, this movement is not synonymous 
with real progress, but rather with an erosion of quality and all 
too frequently a maximization of profits, which is what we are 
seeing too much of right now throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we know, and this can never be said often enough, that 
358 billionaires, according to a UN—not a Social Credit, but a 
UN—report, control 45% of the world's wealth, we have a problem 
that should be debated by all parliaments without delay, and 
perhaps by a rejuvenated United Nations, which could arrange a true 
debate on the development of our economies in general.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the motion by my colleague for 
Sydney—Victoria.  I believe the motion also has the support of 
our constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It disturbs me when the government takes the path of 
privatization. There are many examples out there of what 
privatization has done to Canadian standards, for example Nav 
Canada's flight service and air traffic control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Safety is still at a premium and I commend the government for 
maintaining the safety of aspects of it.  We now have reports 
that Nav Canada wants to lay off 1,000 workers.  Those who will 
be left within a year or two will be coming up for contract 
renewal and will be asked without a doubt to take further wage 
cuts and concessions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My concern for the government and the working people in Atlantic 
Canada is that when we go the notion of privatization, instead of 
the government and the Canadian people becoming the shareholders, 
the shareholders are few, usually a company or certain 
individuals. The pressure on the individuals or the company to 
provide excessive dividends to their shareholders means that 
lower standards, wages and benefits have to accrue to the people 
who work in that environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My one concern besides supporting the motion is that the 
government also take into consideration the labour, financial and 
benefit standards of workers currently in those facilities, 
especially those in Atlantic Canada and Marine Atlantic.

the Queen's Privy Council for Canada and Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is my 
pleasure to speak to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is not 
here to introduce the motion personally because of the weather 
conditions.  He is in transit and has not arrived. However, it is 
his desire, with the unanimous consent of the House, to speak to 
the motion later in the day if that is possible. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise in support of the motion to set up a 
parliamentary committee to review the proposal to replace the 
present denominational school system in Newfoundland with a 
single non-denominational public school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, a consensus developed around the need to modernize 
the school system's administrative structure. This consensus was 
confirmed by a referendum. We know, therefore, that Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians strongly and democratically support this amendment 
proposal. 
In the September 1997 referendum, the proposal carried in 47 of 
Newfoundland's 48 electoral districts. Not less than 73% of voters said 
yes to changes proposed by the province's government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, analysis of the referendum results leads us to believe 
that the proposal has the support of denominational minorities. The 
people of Newfoundland voted on a clear and concise question and 
expressed the desire to steer the province's school system in a new 
direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As premier Tobin indicated, this referendum has produced a clear, 
strong and outstanding degree of consensus. I think it would be fair to 
say that, in the wake of the referendum, this consensus has expanded. 
The Newfoundland legislature unanimously voted in favour of the 
constitutional amendment proposal, in spite of the fact that some of its 
members had voted against on referendum day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, every member of the legislative assembly who had noted no 
in the referendum eventually endorsed the resolution. One of them, 
namely the provincial Leader of the Opposition, explaining his decision, 
said: “The people of the province have spoken in a very clear, very 
definitive way, and we have an obligation here to respect the wishes 
that have been carried out in a democratic manner.” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that, given its commitment to the democratic process and 
to democratic values, this House should strike a parliamentary committee 
to examine the issue. Parliamentary committees are key elements in this 
process and the democratic tradition in Canada. 
They give experts, groups and individual citizens an opportunity to 
express their views and help the people and their elected 
representatives better understand larger issues.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On an issue as important as schools, it is doubly important to hear 
a wide range of opinions at the federal level. Our children are 
basically our future. If we want Canada to remain competitive and to 
continue to be renowned around the world for its quality of life, we 
must make sure that our children receive the best education possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the challenge facing us. One might say there is no greater 
challenge for a country than ensuring that its children acquire the 
knowledge, abilities and skills required to excel in a world that is 
increasing complex and shrinking at the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we have a moral obligation to give the best to our 
children. As Lutheran theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer said: “What it does 
for its children is the touchstone of any society's morality.” That is 
why this government is working with the provinces to end the scourge of 
child poverty. That is also why, when a society achieves a clear 
consensus about what the administrative framework for the education of 
children should be, governments have a responsibility to respond in an 
appropriate, measured fashion, in accordance with the established 
democratic procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do the people of Newfoundland want their school system to be 
organized? 
Well, as mentioned in the referendum question, they want a single 
school system where all children, regardless of their religious 
affiliation, attend the same schools where opportunities for religious 
education and observances are provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundlanders and Labradorians clearly did not vote to drive God 
out of their schools. Of course, non-elected church leaders will no 
longer have a special place in the new school system. Like the members 
of the legislature, who will have the overall responsibility for 
education, school boards will be elected by parents and other members of 
the public in Newfoundland and Labrador and will be accountable to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this does not mean that religion will no longer be welcome in 
the schools of Newfoundland. On the contrary, there will be a mandatory 
provision guaranteeing that courses in religion will be taught in 
schools. 
And religious observances, such as saying the Lord's Prayer or 
displaying Nativity scenes, will be held when requested by parents, and 
members of the clergy will be permitted to visit schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, according to legal opinions obtained by the Government of 
Newfoundland, children will not be required to attend religious classes 
or to participate in religious observances if their parents do not wish 
them to do so. The whole idea of these reforms is to provide parents 
with greater control over their children's education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the changes to the school system that were approved by 
the people of Newfoundland and their democratic representatives in the 
legislature. This is the new system which, according to them, will best 
meet the particular needs of Newfoundland.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a fundamental point. As the royal commission that looked 
into the province's school system at the beginning of the decade pointed 
out: “Perhaps more than any other institution, the education system is 
closely linked to the society and world that shape it and that it, in 
turn, will come to shape as well”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland school system should reflect the situation and 
needs of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians, just as the Ontario system 
should reflect that of Ontarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that Newfoundland always had a unique 
school system. For instance, it is currently the only system where all 
schools are denominational schools. 
The education reform was bogged down for years, but Newfoundlanders and 
Labradorians finally endorsed a set of changes that will ensure that 
their school system can satisfy their changing needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that the changes contemplated by 
Newfoundland do not set a precedent for any other province. Naturally, 
what works in Newfoundland and meets the needs of children in that 
province may not be adapted to the needs of children in Alberta, Quebec 
or the Yukon. In our federal system, each province may choose the school 
system that best reflects its particular situation and needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that the fact that the changes contemplated by the 
Government of Newfoundland do not affect in any way minority rights to 
education in other provinces will be raised and reinforced during the 
proceedings of the joint committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada indicated time and again that, beyond 
this, should any province seek an amendment to its terms of union or to 
section 93 of the Constitution, the federal government will want to see, 
as in this case, a reasonable level of support among the denominations 
concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland, 72% of voters in regions as profoundly Roman 
Catholic as the Burin Peninsula and the Avalon Peninsula voted yes. 
While it is difficult to assess the level of support of the Pentecostal 
community because of how scattered it is, all four Pentecostal members 
of the legislative assembly endorsed the resolution to amend Term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It should also be noted that, as I said, all schools in 
Newfoundland being denominational schools, every denomination, not only 
Roman Catholic and Pentecostal, will be affected by these changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The royal commission I referred to earlier noted that the school 
system in Newfoundland had been established in response to specific 
needs in very difficult circumstances and that its development these 
past 30 years had been characterized by adapting, adjusting and 
restructuring on the basis of changing times, conditions and priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Newfoundland and Labrador recently expressed the 
desire to see their school system continue to adjust to changing times 
and priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal system too has shown it is capable of adjusting to the 
changing needs of Canadians. 
Our federation has changed since 1867 in order to take up new challenges 
and to reflect new priorities. This federal government is working with 
its provincial partners on a number of fronts to carry on this 
modernization process. Much can be accomplished and was indeed 
accomplished through administrative agreements or through the exercise 
or non-exercise of powers, without changing one iota in our 
Constitution.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not make the mistake of thinking that the Constitution is 
or should be a static document. It is not. Rather, it is a living 
document that can be adjusted to reflect our changing times. 
The changes requested by Newfoundlanders and Labradorians would require 
a constitutional amendment, and the level of support shown for the 
proposal to amend Term 17 leads me to believe that such an amendment may 
be totally appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed joint committee will provide an excellent forum where 
my fellow parliamentarians can decide for themselves the merit of the 
amendment proposal, which would enable Newfoundland to carry out in its 
education system reforms it has been wanting to carry out for a long 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I hope the House will approve today the setting-up of 
this committee. I invite my colleagues to support the motion before us. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I rise to address the motion before the House to 
appoint a special joint committee to consider matters related to 
a constitutional amendment concerning the Newfoundland school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank the parliamentary secretary for his explanation 
of the motion and the Newfoundland reforms.  I note that he used 
the word reform numerous times in a positive vein.  I would like 
to encourage him to keep up that habit.  It is a good one to 
cultivate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to begin by observing that the amendment to be 
considered by the committee pertains to the rights of provinces, 
the education of children, majority and minority rights.  It is 
therefore not just a dry constitutional amendment, as the 
parliamentary secretary alluded to.  It does deserve our full 
attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 1, I addressed the House in relation to the proposed 
amendment of section 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867 as it 
pertains to Quebec schools.  There is a certain parallelism 
between this motion and the motion we addressed that day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time I pointed out that the intent of this section, 
which we would ultimately be amending, is to recognize the 
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces over education subject 
only to the proviso that the provinces not pass laws that 
prejudicially affect rights granted by law to any class of 
persons prior to the establishment of the federal union or the 
union of a province with Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, we proposed that the House apply three great tests 
to any constitutional amendment brought before it, including 
proposed amendments to section 93.  Those three tests were the 
test of democratic consent, the test of the rule of law and the 
test of the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to continue to urge the government to adopt these 
three tests as a national standard to be applied consistently to 
all constitutional amendments.  The word here is consistently. 
For example, when Quebec proposes yet another referendum on the 
secession issue, which is a huge constitutional change, the 
federal government has a right, indeed an obligation, to make 
clear its views on how such a referendum should be conducted in 
order to meet the test of democratic consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prime minister, for example, has said that such a 
referendum, to be legitimate, must involve a fair process and a 
fair question.  We agree with that.

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those are the requirements for Quebec constitutional 
initiatives to meet the test of democratic consent, those should 
be the same requirements for other provinces.  We should be 
insistent in this House that that high standard be adhered to in 
every case so we respect equality of the provinces and do not 
impose a lower standard of democratic consent on one province 
than another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now turn to the position of the official opposition on the 
proposed Newfoundland schools amendment which will be the subject 
of consideration by the committee being proposed by this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition has communicated to interested parties 
in Newfoundland over the last number of months that it neither 
supports nor opposes a denominational school system for 
Newfoundland.  We feel this is an issue the people of 
Newfoundland must determine for themselves by means of a fair 
democratic decision making process in accordance with the rule of 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Reform caucus in Parliament with respect to 
any proposed constitutional amendment will be determined by 
applying these three tests which I have already alluded to.  If 
we are satisfied the proposed Newfoundland amendment meets these 
three tests, our members would be inclined to vote in the House 
in favour of the proposed amendment.  If we believe the proposed 
amendment does not meet these tests, we will suggest to the 
Newfoundland legislature that it make such changes as are 
required to ensure compliance with these tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me share with the House where we feel this amendment now 
stands in relation to these three tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first is the test of democratic consent.  When we applied 
the test of democratic consent we asked whether there was a clear 
majority result from the referendum on the proposed term 17 
amendment, was the referendum process fair and was the 
referendum question unbiased. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears at this time that the term 17 proposals have passed the 
test of democratic consent.  A larger majority, 73%, approved the 
proposals contained in the latest referendum than did the 
previous one.  There was a large turnout, 53.1%, when compared 
with typical voter turnouts for such electoral events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum was conducted by Newfoundland Elections, a body 
separate from the government under the authority of the 
Newfoundland Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all our members are convinced that the Newfoundland 
referendum was as democratic as it should have been.  They will 
be seeking answers and will expect the special committee to seek 
answers to questions about the referendum itself, such as those 
raised by the Hon. Kevin Barry, a retired judge of the Newfoundland 
supreme court, in correspondence with a number of MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we are presented with more evidence to the contrary than 
we have received thus far, we are assuming the referendum met the 
test of democratic consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second is the test of the rule of law.  There is a question as 
to whether section 93(1) can be amended using the section 43 
amending formula of the Constitution Act, 1982.  I have dealt 
with this concern on a previous occasion and do not intend to 
repeat the arguments here.  Suffice it to say the special 
committee should satisfy itself that this is the appropriate 
formula.  Assuming it does so there is another more fundamental 
concern that can be raised and has been raised under the heading 
of the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Term 17 is intended to serve as a replacement for section 93 
of the Constitution Act, 1867.  Reform MPs are particularly 
interested in ensuring the Newfoundland educational reforms do not 
violate the letter or the spirit of section 93(1) which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In and for each province the legislature may exclusively make 
laws in relation to education, subject and according to the 
following provisions: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) Nothing in any such law shall prejudicially affect any right 
or privilege with respect to denominational schools which any 
class of persons have by law in the province at the union. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 93(1) does not prevent Newfoundland from reforming its 
educational system or from implementing reforms that affect 
minority rights, but the rule of law, particularly the law 
contained in section 93(1), requires the Newfoundland government 
to demonstrate that its proposed reforms do not prejudicially 
affect the rights of those who desire a religious orientation in 
the education of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that this interest in the religious orientation in the 
education of children is broader and deeper than the mere 
provision of non-denominational religious courses in secular 
schools and the permitting of religious observances supervised by 
a secular authority. 
It includes the right to have those courses and observances 
provided in an environment that truly reflects spiritual values. 
It is this broader right that many parents would like to see 
safeguarded.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are aware that the minister of education for Newfoundland has 
obtained a legal opinion from a respected law firm stating that 
the proposed amendments to term 17 are legal, but we are also 
aware that the original term 17 amendment proposed by the 
Newfoundland government in 1995, which we were assured conformed 
to the rule of law, was subsequently found to be constitutionally 
suspect by the Newfoundland supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members of the official opposition are therefore not yet 
convinced that the latest Newfoundland amendment fully conforms 
to the rule of law.  Our concerns would be alleviated if the 
government of that province were to obtain a ruling from the 
province's supreme court clearly establishing that its proposed 
amendment does not prejudicially affect rights protected under 
section 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not in the interests of the people of Newfoundland, the 
Government of Newfoundland or the Government of Canada to permit 
any ambiguity to exist on this question.  The last thing any of 
us want is for this amendment to proceed and for the educational 
reforms based on it to proceed only to discover later, by means 
of a court decision, that they are unconstitutional and must be 
changed again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intergovernmental affairs minister and the justice minister 
will know that section 93 of the Constitution act has been 
judicially considered over 50 times in the past.  Is it not in 
everyone's interest to get a clear signal from the courts in 
advance that the educational reforms proposed by Newfoundland 
conform to the rule of law in this important matter of 
safeguarding minority rights? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third is the test of the Canadian interest.  The actions of one 
province affecting majority and minority rights in education may 
set an important precedent regarding the educational rights of 
majorities and minorities in other provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary said in his remarks that the 
Newfoundland reforms are not precedent setting.  However, it is 
not a question of whether the educational reforms are precedent 
setting; it is a question of whether the treatment of minority 
and majority rights is precedent setting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because the Reform caucus is not wholly convinced that the 
latest Newfoundland amendment conforms to the rule of law, 
particularly as it relates to protection from prejudicial 
effects, we are not yet convinced that the Newfoundland amendment 
therefore meets the test of the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To summarize the application of these three tests to the 
amendment that will be considered by the committee to be 
established by this motion, in our judgment the Newfoundland 
schools amendment does not yet appear to have passed two of the 
three tests which Reform MPs have established as conditions for 
our support of such amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If further evidence is presented to us and our constituents 
prior to voting on this amendment in Parliament which satisfies 
our concerns then we would be inclined to support the amendment. 
If no such convincing evidence is presented to us and our 
constituents and we remain doubtful then our inclination would be 
to vote against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately Reform MPs will be particularly influenced by the 
opinion of their constituents and whether those constituents are 
satisfied that the Newfoundland amendment is democratic, legal 
and in the national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, a word on amending the motion to make it better. That 
of course is one of the functions of the official opposition; it 
is not simply to point out the flaws in what the government is 
doing but to endeavour to make it better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our intent to amend the motion establishing the committee 
to ensure that its deliberations include the application of the 
three tests which I have already mentioned.  We also ask the 
House to amend the composition of the committee and its terms of 
reference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the joint special committee to consider the Quebec schools 
amendment was set up, Reformers and members from various other 
parties in the House objected in principle to unelected and 
unaccountable members of the upper House participating on the 
committee.  In the case of the joint special committee to 
consider the Quebec school amendment, we did not make an issue 
out of Senate participation because we had larger fish to fry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time, however, the government has shown an increased 
propensity to initiate in the Senate bills which we believe 
should be initiated in the House. 
This we find particularly objectionable.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whereas it is apparently the government's position to enhance 
the role of unelected and unaccountable senators by referring 
more and more important matters to their attention, it is the 
position of the official opposition to restrain that role. Our 
amendment to the motion will therefore also include striking all 
references to senators and the Senate from the motion. My 
colleagues will elaborate further on this position in debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also if a committee is being set up to receive advice from 
citizens and witnesses on the Newfoundland schools amendment, it 
seems self-evident to us that such a committee should hold 
hearings in Newfoundland. Our amendment to the motion will 
therefore also ensure that the committee is directed and 
empowered to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore conclude by moving the following motion.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK18">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By replacing the words: “Special Joint Committee of the Senate 
and the House of Commons” in the first paragraph with the words: 
“Special Committee of the House of Commons”; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By adding immediately after the words: “concerning the 
Newfoundland school system;” the following: “more specifically, 
the matter of applying the following three tests for such a 
proposed constitutional amendment: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>1. The Test of Democratic Consent, 
</I></B></P><P align=left>2. The Test of the Canadian National Interest, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. The Test of the Rule of Law”; 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>By deleting the words: “and seven Members of the Senate” in 
the second paragraph; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By inserting after the word “Committee” in the sixth paragraph 
the words: “be directed and authorized to hold hearings in 
Newfoundland and”; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By replacing all the words in the eighth paragraph with the 
following: “That the quorum of the committee be nine members, 
whenever a vote, resolution or other decision is taken, and that 
the Chairperson be authorized to hold meetings, to receive 
evidence and authorize the printing thereof, whenever six members 
are present,”; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By deleting the words “Senate and” in the ninth paragraph; 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By replacing all the words in the twelfth paragraph with the 
following: “That, notwithstanding usual practices, if the House 
is not sitting when the final report of the committee is 
completed, the report may be deposited with the Clerk of the 
House, and the report shall thereupon be deemed to have been 
presented to the House”; and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By deleting all the words in the last paragraph. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of these amendments is to remove the references to 
senators and the Senate from the motion; to ensure that the 
committee holds hearings in Newfoundland; and most importantly, 
to ensure that it subjects the Newfoundland schools amendment to 
the three great tests of democratic consent, the rule of law and 
the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  The Chair will take 
the amendment under advisement for a few minutes. Resuming 
debate. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK19"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak on the motion, as amended by the Reform Party. I 
will come back later in my statement to this proposed amendment which 
defines the interests to be considered in a constitutional amendment 
process but which also seems to involve a very particular interest by 
the Reform Party in this matter. We will come back to this later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine the content of the whole proposal, whether or not 
there is an amendment, as suggested at this time by the Reform Party. 
What is involved is the creation of a committee to review a motion that 
would amend section 17 of the Constitution, which is the agreement 
between Newfoundland and Canada concluded when Newfoundland joined the 
Canadian federation and which is the result of a genuine democratic 
process—I will come back to this later—which was followed in the case 
of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is at issue in the first instance? Section 17 provides for and 
guarantees the denominational status of the school system in 
Newfoundland. Since education comes strictly under provincial 
jurisdiction, people in Newfoundland agree today, but they decided on 
this already two years ago and twice during referendums, that they 
wanted to change their educational system in order to have a 
non-denominational system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT16"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a number of advantages.  One is the 
modernization of their facilities.  They will also be able to 
reduce the number of school boards, while not eliminating religious 
education entirely.  However, this should be achieved at the 
request of parents.  Religious education could continue within the 
schools.  They would not be denominational schools as they are 
currently.  The amendment Newfoundland is seeking would mean the 
amendment of section 17 of the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has all come about through a process, which began a 
number of years ago, but which was not given expression until 
hearings were held by a royal commission of inquiry.  If I am not 
mistaken, it was in 1992 that Newfoundland made the proposal. 
Taking a look at how things progressed subsequently, a first 
referendum was held in 1995 and resulted in a motion before 
Parliament.  The referendum was carried, if I remember correctly, 
with 54% of the votes and a participation rate of slightly more 
than 50% of the population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment proposed by the Newfoundland government was 
subsequently contested before the courts, which rejected it.  The 
Government of Newfoundland decided to hold a second referendum.  It 
even expanded the terms of the reform and again turned to the 
people for their reaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level of support was even higher the second time around, since 
the Newfoundland government received the support of 73% of the 
population, again with a participation rate of about 54%, or slightly 
over 50%. Twice, the Newfoundland government decided in a democratic 
fashion to amend its system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that a similar process is taking place in 
Quebec—and I will get back to this—to protect, if you will, the 
denominational system of two specific regions, namely Montreal 
and Quebec City. I should point out that consultations took 
place, because when it comes to the constitutional amendment that 
will affect Quebec, Liberal members often claim no consultations 
were held, in an attempt to justify their desire to hold such 
consultations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are ill-informed about what goes on in Quebec. Yet, they 
have a number of members in our province and they should know 
that a summit conference on education was held in Quebec. One 
clear item on the agenda was how to make the required amendments 
to have a non-denominational school system in the Montreal 
region, which is primarily concerned, because the protection did 
not apply to the other regions in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals seem to forget that consultations did take place. The 
reservations or positions expressed by almost all of the groups we are 
now hearing, in public venues or other forums, are already known because 
they did state their views at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In politics, it often seems difficult to differentiate between 
consensus and unanimity. 
A lack of unanimity does not mean that there is no consensus. A 
“consensus” means that a majority of people or groups share the same 
clear desire to go ahead. We can see it here because when people are 
being consulted we often hear those who oppose the initiative, thus 
giving the impression there is an imbalance, but such is not the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most groups—including the Quebec Conference of Catholic 
Bishops—stated their support for the new proposal made by the 
Quebec government to bring about a constitutional amendment which 
has the unanimous support of the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to the case of Newfoundland. Following its second 
referendum, Newfoundland's legislature unanimously decided to support 
the motion. 
MLAs who were opposed bowed to the democratic verdict—and more 
power to them.  In democracy, it is important to recognize the wish 
of the majority.  And that is what they did.

<A HREF="#LINKT17"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation has every appearance of being one which could be 
resolved quickly and easily.  But why create a committee? There is 
the question. We will not oppose the creation of a committee, 
although we have a number of reservations on that score. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be impossible not to have a committee in this 
instance when there is one in the case of Quebec.  The government 
would have trouble justifying the length of time it is taking to 
approve the constitutional amendment for Quebec. 
We know very well that this committee came about because of 
lobbying by Alliance Quebec and other groups that are always 
feeling threatened and that wanted to be heard, that turned to 
Ottawa to protect them.  Through political pressure, they succeeded 
in obtaining a process designed especially for them, and now we 
find ourselves having to do the same thing for Newfoundland.  When 
the people have expressed their wishes democratically in a 
referendum and unanimously in their legislative assembly, what else 
can be learned from these consultations?  Would the government be 
nasty enough to tell them “After all that, you will have to 
introduce more amendments and start the process all over again”? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the committee has done its work, the conclusion reached 
will be that the amendment should be passed.  So this committee is 
a bit of a sham. 
If that is not the case, then it is despicable of the federal 
government to keep lording it over the provinces as though it has 
the monopoly on wisdom and truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The exercise was gone through in Newfoundland and in the case 
of Quebec, but the federal government is still trying to keep a 
finger in every pie, with the support, furthermore, of the Reform 
Party today, in the sense that that party would like to add a 
clause about Canada's interests to the conditions for deciding on 
the advisability of making amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is meant by Canada's interests?  We know very well where 
it is headed with that.  What it has in mind when it talks about a 
referendum, and even when it talks about this issue, is not the 
situation in Newfoundland but the one in Quebec, the constitutional 
amendment in Quebec and a future referendum in Quebec. 
The Liberals are playing games here, and even more so on other 
issues, but that is part of the strategy for plan B, defining the 
rules, making sure the federal government has a role to play in the 
next referendum in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And now, supported more than ever—and supported is not even 
the right word, as he is practically leading the onslaught—the 
leader of the Reform Party is giving a sense of direction to the 
federal government, and it is following the path he has set out. 
Now, he is defining new criteria.  He is even questioning the 
support he could provide.  But where is the sense of democracy?  In 
the case at hand, the people of Newfoundland have spoken, not just 
once but twice.  They have spoken in full knowledge of the issues 
at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something else was said, which I feel obliged to explain here. 
There is always this notion constantly going around in Ottawa: the 
clarity of the questions. 
This makes me laugh, because I have read the press review of the 
first referendum held in Newfoundland.  What did the opposition or 
those who were in the no camp have to say?  “The question is not 
clear”.  I remember also having read that about other referendums, 
the ones in Europe on the treaty of Maastricht, for example: “The 
issues are not clear.  The questions are not clear”.  That is just 
what happens when there is a referendum.  If the people on the no 
side feel that things are not clear, then let them explain them. 
Does that mean that they are incompetent at making themselves heard 
and understood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Behind all this is the hope that the 49.5% of Quebeckers who 
voted yes did so because they did not understand.  We are unable 
to understand the issues, not smart enough to do so. 
That is what it means when they say the question was not clear, 
that people do not understand, that they spoke without 
understanding the real issues at stake, that they were taking the 
exercise of democracy rather lightly. That is a classic approach. 
The no side here is not the only one to do it.  It was also the 
case to a certain extent in Newfoundland, in the first referendum. 
It is the case with just about any referendum held just about 
anywhere in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are lessons to be drawn from this.  Newfoundland defined 
its own democratic exercise. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, when the courts appeared before them as an obstacle on 
their path, once again the premier of Newfoundland, who happens to be a 
former federal minister, decided to go to the people. For him, the voice 
of the people was more important than the voice of the courts. Here 
again, this was a wise course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully his former colleagues here will remember this, because it 
is evident that they wish to have courts and judges step in to define 
the process soon to occur in Quebec. Once again, there are interesting 
precedents in the case of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the first time, when 54% of the people voted yes, and 53% of 
the population participated, so that in absolute terms it was about a 
quarter of the population that gave its approval, the government 
sincerely and clearly had the intention to proceed. Such was the case 
also with the federal government, as was seen with the motion in this 
House. Why is it that the democratic will of the people of Newfoundland 
can be recognized in this instance, but not the democratic will of 
Quebeckers in other instances? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an issue that they have to deal with here. It is a fact 
that they are debating this in their caucus and that their party is 
divided on this at the moment. They could be seen the other night on 
television rising in committee to defend the interests of anglophones in 
Quebec who feel threatened and persecuted by the constitutional 
amendments that are on the way for the denominational system in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a funny business.  Imagine finding yourself in a 
situation that could repeat itself if the Reform Party decided to 
oppose Newfoundland's amendment too and the government having to 
turn to the Bloc Quebecois to pass the constitutional amendments in 
the case of Quebec and perhaps even in the case of Newfoundland. 
The presence of certain Quebec sovereignists will compensate for 
the lack of political courage of certain Liberal members.  This 
will clearly be the case with Quebec's constitutional amendment. 
The only way they can be sure at the moment that things will move 
ahead is to count on the massive and unanimous support of the 
people in the Bloc Quebecois.  As their majority is very fragile, 
this is their best assurance of being able to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us hope the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the 
people lobbied by Alliance Québec and others will not back down. 
We will see.  The next few weeks will enable us to judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have a double challenge.  If they fail, they will sadly 
once again have to admit their failure to substantially amend the 
Constitution to bring it up to date.  The amendments are not as 
basic or as objectionable as all that.  In the case of 
Newfoundland, it is democratically supported, and yet they are 
having an impossible time proceeding on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just imagine if, one day, we were contemplating a division of 
powers, what sort of debate we would have.  Imagine if we were to 
redefine power in Canada.  Just imagine all the pressure, the 
division within the Liberal Party.  Already we can see a lack of 
support for this sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why this Constitution has been called a yoke.  I am 
pointing this out, because people may have forgotten. 
The Liberals must always be reminded that the Canadian Constitution was 
patriated by a Liberal government, something for which they are still 
paying the price in Quebec. There is a blank line at the bottom of the 
document, because Quebec never signed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberals will say: “Lucien Bouchard will never sign the 
Constitution”. But they should remember that, before Lucien Bouchard, 
René Lévesque, Pierre-Marc Johnson, Robert Bourassa, Daniel Johnson and 
Jacques Parizeau also refused to sign it. Six Quebec premiers, one after 
the other, have refused to sign the Constitution. The Liberals must live 
with this. Canada can hardly boast about its Constitution to the world 
when there is still a blank line at the bottom because it was never 
signed by Quebec. Yet, our province is a key player, a founding people, 
as they said at the time. Such language was quickly dropped in favour of 
“a bunch of people who are somewhat unique”. This is where we stand now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is almost up, I will move on to another issue. 
As mentioned earlier, we will support the establishment of the 
committee. We will do so, but I want to point out another strange idea, 
namely to set up a joint committee with our dear senators. These people, 
who are not representatives of the democratic process, will get involved 
in a process they already unduly impeded once in the case of 
Newfoundland. They will form a committee with members of Parliament.

does not represent anything, who is a friend of the Prime Minister or of 
a former Prime Minister, who shows up whenever he or she feels like it, 
who is definitely not a workaholic and who is not a symbol of pride, 
certainly not in Quebec and, I am convinced, not in several other 
regions of the country either. Our senators are no great source of 
pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians travel abroad, they do not boast about their 
country saying: “Come and see us. We have a great Senate that is part of 
our assets”. On the contrary, we are all somewhat uncomfortable because 
the Senate, this sad travesty, is costing us some $50 million per year. 
I will not feel comfortable sitting on the committee next to or opposite 
a senator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we sometimes have to put up with things we do not enjoy, 
and I will do so to speed up the process. As for the two constitutional 
amendments that are the subject of the debate, we will, as I said, help 
the government ensure that things move quickly and efficiently. It was 
not necessary to set up a committee, but we will live with the decision 
and hope the government will not get scared when a few opposition 
members express their views on either of these two closely related 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel there is reason to be concerned today with the attitude of 
the leader of the Reform Party who is starting to qualify his support in 
all sorts of ways, so that in fact it no longer is support, and who 
continues to pile the objections on to justify his opposition to the 
other constitutional amendment. We know very well what he is up to, and 
furthermore, he draws a very clear parallel with a possible referendum 
in Quebecon sovereignty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an overlapping of these issues and, as things move along, 
this will become increasingly obvious. It is clear that the Liberals are 
in a very uncomfortable situation because of this, and are having a lot 
of difficulty keeping order in their caucus. But we are here to tell 
them, and I am telling the parliamentary secretary who is here, that at 
least they know that 44 members will compensate for the several Liberals 
who will run wild and disappear along the way, and that they will have 
difficulty getting support from the other parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will end with this. We will have the opportunity to discuss this 
issue again in committee, as this involves a constitutional amendment 
under section 43, chapter 5, whereby the Constitution can be amended 
bilaterally by a provincial government and the federal government. If 
only one provincial government is affected in the matter, once the 
committee has finished its work, it will not be necessary to discuss 
this again in Parliament. So this is probably the last time I will be 
speaking on this issue here, I hope. I also hope that everything will 
proceed normally and that, by Christmas, all of this will be a debate of 
the past. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we proceed 
further, I would like to inform the House that the amendment of 
the hon. Leader of the Opposition is in order. 
<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I rise to support the motion to refer this constitutional 
resolution to a committee.  However, the NDP caucus reserves the 
right to listen and to pay attention to what goes on in the 
committee and to make a decision on how we will vote on the final 
outcome of the committee's deliberation when the resolution comes 
before the House in the future, depending on what we perceive as 
the appropriate position during that process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that it would be appropriate for all of us to 
make up our minds before the committee is even struck, although I 
know that is often the case with respect to ordinary legislation. 
In the case of this constitutional resolution there are a lot of 
things that need to be considered. 
There are a lot of conflicting values, conflicting priorities. 
There are conflicts between our respect for provincial autonomy 
and our respect for the democratic process as it is reflected in 
referendums.  On the other hand, there is our concern about 
whether it is ever appropriate for minority rights to be overcome 
by a majority vote in a referendum. There are the matters that 
have been raised by others on the floor before I came to my feet 
having to do with the rule of law and whether this is in fact 
constitutional.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that respect, I am very sympathetic to the view that perhaps 
this matter should be referred to the supreme court before it 
proceeds any further.  I know the government does not seem to be 
inclined to do that.  I recall other constitutional debates in 
the House where a reference to the supreme court was helpful and 
where the government was found to be wanting in its position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think particularly of the patriation package in 1981-82 where 
the matter was finally referred to the supreme court and the 
supreme court ruled that the government—at that time it was the 
federal government that was acting in a particular way—was 
acting in contravention of the conventions of Canadian 
constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It might well be useful for all of us to know, rather than 
debating it endlessly, whether what the Newfoundland government 
proposes to do is constitutional or found to be so by the supreme 
court if it were referred to the court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just a little bit of history.  Some members may recall when term 
17 came before the House in the last Parliament, the official NDP 
position at the time was one in support of passing the resolution 
but that we were not unanimous in that regard.  There were NDP 
members of Parliament who voted otherwise because they were 
concerned about many aspects of this change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time some members of Parliament, not just in the NDP but 
other members of Parliament, shared the concern of the religious 
communities outside Newfoundland that this action might have a 
precedent setting effect, if not legally at least politically in 
terms of how minority or denominational rights could in future be 
changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a great deal of concern that, at that time, just the 
changing of these minority rights by virtue of a referendum might 
set unwanted precedents.  It would seem to me that that concern 
is amplified in this case where the referendum and the subsequent 
constitutional resolution do not propose to change, but rather, 
to eliminate those denominational rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that this is something that the committee would 
take very seriously, whether or not this is, in fact, something 
of which we should approve as a Parliament.  An interesting 
question that I would recommend to the committee—this is where 
the question of minority rights and democratic process 
interact—is where those minority rights reside. Do those 
minority rights, in this case, the rights of denominations to set 
up their own schools, reside in the churches as institutions or 
do they reside in the people who might send their children to 
these schools? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the rights reside in the institutions and it is the Catholic 
church or the Pentecostal church or the Seventh Day Adventist 
church or any other church that has these rights, if it is the 
church's right to set up these schools then it seems to me that 
the outcome of the referendum is not as relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these rights reside in the people rather than in the 
institutions, then one has to look at the outcome of the 
referendum and ask a variety of questions. 
On the one hand one has to ask the question about the turnout 
which some have described as high but which in some respects is 
still low.

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand and given that it is low, one has to ask the 
question why.  If these denominational rights are being taken 
from everybody in Newfoundland because the vast majority of the 
population has the right to attend denominational schools, why 
did they not turn out in force to protect these rights? I asked 
myself this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having met with representatives of the Catholic and Pentecostal 
churches, I think they make a decent argument that there is a 
small proportion of Pentecostal and Catholic schools in smaller 
communities that will be disproportionately affected by this 
amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One still has to ask why the entire Catholic community in 
Newfoundland did not come out and vote to save the schools of 
their Catholic brothers and sisters.  I have to ask that 
question.  Perhaps there is an explanation for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The argument is that people demonstrated their willingness to 
support denominational schools by virtue of the great numbers 
that registered their children in denominational schools after 
the last change.  Registering a child in school is a public 
thing, something the church and neighbours know about, that 
everybody knows about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voting or not voting in a referendum or a secret ballot is 
perhaps a more anonymous way of sending a message that one might 
not want to publicly send.  This is another thing that occurs to 
me as I try to analyse the outcome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time it seems to me what we have or may have—and 
this is something the committee would want to look into—is a 
case where certain groups had these rights under the constitution 
and the terms of union.  These rights were changed by virtue of 
the last change to term 17.  These groups saw fit, in the course 
of implementing those rights, to exercise their rights by taking 
the government to court on the constitutionality of the 
implementation of the previous change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When they did that the response of the provincial government, as 
I understand it having been found by the courts not to be 
implementing the changes properly or constitutionally, was not to 
say that perhaps they could do it better or perhaps do it 
differently.  The response of the provincial government was “You 
are exercising these rights in the courts.  You are irritating 
us.  You are getting in the way of our implementation.  We have a 
solution.  We will have a referendum and take away these rights 
from you altogether”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a stretch to imagine, without knowing the mind of the 
premier, that this could be characterized as a form of 
retaliation or bullying.  I do not know but I can certainly see 
where some people may have a legitimate case for perceiving it as 
such.  That is another concern the committee should look at in 
its deliberations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to my Bloc colleague.  He was making 
an argument which assumed that there was no difference between an 
amendment such as the one before us to change something with 
respect to education and minority rights in Newfoundland and a 
constitutional change that would follow on a referendum in 
Quebec, the question which would pertain to the separation of 
Quebec and the destruction of Canada as we now know it. 
I do not accept the equivalency of these two amendments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of an amendment whereby Quebec would propose to 
separate from the rest of Canada and bring the rest of Canada and 
Canada as we know it into danger, there is such a thing as the 
Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that this does not necessarily mean a sovereignist 
or separatist outcome of a Quebec referendum would have to be 
disregarded in the Canadian national interest.  The response to a 
clearly worded question might be so overwhelming that it would be 
in the Canadian national interest to respect that particular 
outcome rather than try to keep Quebec captive in a country it no 
longer wanted to belong to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would certainly reject what I take to be the view of the Bloc 
in this debate.  It finds one of the criteria in the Reform 
amendment, Canadian national interest, to be objectionable on 
first principles.  I do not think that is something we can 
accept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having said all these things, we look forward to the 
deliberations of the committee.  On the amendment by the Reform 
Party we may want to have somebody speak to that later today. We 
will see about that, but I do not see anything objectionable in 
much of what is contained in the Reform amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly the idea that the committee should go to Newfoundland 
is a worthy one and one we would want to support.  I do not see 
anything wrong with the three tests the Reform Party wishes to 
embed in the criteria by which the committee is to judge the 
appropriateness of the constitutional resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see anything wrong with an amendment which separates 
the House of Commons from the Senate and which makes the point 
many of us have been trying to make.  Some parties have been 
making it since 1933.  It was a party called the CCF, a 
predecessor of the NDP.  It is inappropriate and a blemish on the 
Canadian democratic process to have constantly intertwined with 
the House of Commons, whether it is in the form of a special 
joint committee or in any other way, this undemocratic appointed 
body at the heart of our democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to run into this in the third world we would say 
“What a banana republic.  They have all these guys appointed for 
life and they never have to face the electorate”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know, Mr. Speaker, if you have ever been on a 
international delegation where you have had to try to explain 
this to people and say he is a senator or she is a senator.  They 
immediately assume the American model of a senator where the 
senators have even more status than members of the House of 
Representatives because they are elected for longer terms, there 
are fewer of them, and so on.  You say “No, that is not the case 
in Canada.  They are appointed at age 42, 55 or 63 until they are 
75”.  Trying to explain that is sometimes really tough, 
particularly when we are the ones who are leading seminars around 
the world to try to instruct people on the democratic process and 
at home we have the Senate.  This is really embarrassing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should go beyond the point of being motivated simply by 
embarrassment or by our commitment to democracy.  We should 
realize it is high time the Senate was reformed to make it 
elected and to make it a place where the regions of the country 
could have more clout at the centre and more meaningful and equal 
participation in the deliberations of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did not rise to make a speech on Senate reform, so I have to 
watch that I do not get off track.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me first say that I am pleased to see that the particular 
resolution will be sent to a committee of the House.  This is the 
second time in this sitting of the House that I have stood in my 
place to voice my profound concern for the resolution coming from 
the Newfoundland House of Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just about a year ago the House passed a resolution to amend 
term 17 of Newfoundland's terms of union with Canada.  The 
amendment at that time diminished the right of parents to have 
any kind of a meaningful say or role in the religious education 
of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's proposed amendment sponsored by Premier Tobin and the 
current federal government will eliminate or wipe out 
forever—and I think that is what we have to be clear on—the 
right of Newfoundland parents to have any kind of a choice in 
their children's religious education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people will argue—and it has been argued here today—that 
in both cases the resolution sent to the House enjoyed majority 
support of the people in Newfoundland and Labrador as expressed 
in a referendum.  To these people I have to say that a referendum 
is a very blunt instrument with which to amend the constitutional 
rights of minorities.  In any such battle the minority will lose 
by definition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To add insult to injury—and I would like to concentrate for a 
moment on the referendum process—the Tobin government called the 
referendum in the middle of summer vacation, which is not against 
the law.  He kept it short.  It was only a 31 day period, which 
is not against the law either. 
He spent roughly about $350,000 to $400,000 on advertising his 
position extensively and did not advance even $1 to the no side. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He allowed any citizen in any part of the province to vote 
anywhere at all in the province.  He would not allow scrutineers 
to be present when the vote was being counted and he released the 
text of term 17 only 16 hours before the actual vote was taken in 
the advance polls. That to me is a prime example of somebody 
wanting their cake and eating it too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to ask what has brought this issue to Ottawa twice in a 
one year period.  As I indicated earlier, there was a stormy 
debate on the Hill on this matter about a year ago.  Premier 
Wells did hold a referendum and with a 54% vote he sent his 
amendment off to our nation's capital.  That amendment to term 17 
saw all schools being declared interdenominational with a 
provision for unidenominational schools if the numbers warrant 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this spring all schools in Newfoundland underwent a 
school designation process.  The parents of nearly 30,000 
students voted to keep their children in a unidenominational 
Pentecostal or a unidenominational Catholic school system.  That 
caused some concern among groups of people and led to a court 
challenge by a group of parents which ground the school 
designation process to a complete halt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As tensions mounted on the issue, our new premier Mr. Tobin saw 
his chance to take advantage of the public mood and he held his 
own referendum.  And it was very much his own referendum.  He 
picked the time, he wrote the question and he made up the rules. 
The outcome was a foregone conclusion with 38% of the province 
voting yes on the premier's proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been roundly criticized in my home province for 
continuing to speak up on behalf of these people who did not vote 
to give up their rights to have a say in the religious education 
of their children.  The resolution we are dealing with in this 
House today has passed the Newfoundland House of Assembly 
unanimously.  I do not think it is healthy in a democracy for 
fundamental constitutional change to be made in the air of 
parliamentary unanimity.  This is especially so when we are about 
the business in this House of wiping out for ever and a day the 
constitutional rights of minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When term 17 was last before this House, Cardinal Carter of the 
Toronto Archdiocese wrote to the Prime Minister.  This is a good 
quote from the letter:  “The amendment process under the 
Constitution requires your government to play the role of 
guardian of minority rights, and if your government rubber stamps 
an amended term 17, how can it in principle resist similar 
requests from voting majorities in Alberta, Quebec and Ontario?” 
He asks:  “Would French language rights survive outside of 
Quebec if they were subject to a referendum?”  He goes on to say 
again:  “There is a natural reality that occurs because of 
population imbalance and that is why minority rights have to be 
protected in the Constitution of Canada”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems the cardinal felt there was a danger in altering 
minority rights in response to public opinion.  His concerns are 
more than justified when we reflect on the atmosphere in which 
the referendum was held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Premier Wells' amendment, if parents did not have 
sufficient numbers to set up a full fledged denominational 
school, they could at least avail themselves of a religious 
course particular to their own faith. Under the proposed 
amendment parents will be offered only a generic, state run, 
state designed religious course.  It is basically a sociology 
course about religion.  It will have no basis in Christian 
religion which is why there is such an outcry from some people on 
this issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Constitution as well provides for the freedom of 
religion.  However once this resolution passes, Newfoundland will 
be the only province in Canada where the state sets the religious 
education program.  We all remember what former Prime Minister 
Trudeau said in the House that the state has no place in the 
bedrooms of our nation.  In the proposed resolution the state is 
coming dangerously close to ensconcing itself in the churches of 
our nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Term 17 was placed in our terms of union in recognition of the 
very prominent role that the various Christian churches played in 
the development of education in Newfoundland.  Term 17 has been 
amended twice already. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the mid-eighties it was amended to include constitutional 
recognition of the Pentecostal faith. There was no fuss at that 
time because we were including a longstanding reality. In the two 
referenda since that time the Pentecostal groups have voted 
overwhelmingly to retain their rights in education.  They are a 
minority.  They represent only 7% of the population of 
Newfoundland.  They have voted twice already to retain their 
rights in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year's amendment diminished denominational rights, but 
parents still had a right and they still had a choice with regard 
to the religious education their children would receive. Should 
we now one year later be eliminating that right and that choice 
altogether?  Should last year's amendment not have been given a 
little time to settle into the social order?  Should 
constitutional rights be subject to the ebb and flow of public 
opinion? The ultimate question is, is a constitutional right for 
minorities really a right if it can be altered or eliminated so 
easily? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions which are not being widely asked in my 
province and I feel that I have a duty to raise them.  I feel 
that this Parliament has an obligation to wrestle with these 
questions before the final vote is taken.  I firmly believe that 
the latest amendment to term 17 is something we will live to 
regret in the long run. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents in the rest of North America are fighting for the right 
to bring religion back into the public schools.  In Newfoundland 
we are about the business of kicking religion out of our school 
system. I am very concerned about this.  People have indicated 
that I should vote with the majority on this issue when it comes 
time to vote in the House.  That would certainly be the easy way 
out, but I do not think it would be right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a good thing a joint committee of the House and the Senate 
is being formed to look at the resolution.  I sincerely hope 
there will be an opportunity for the committee to go to 
Newfoundland to hear the no side, to hear the yes side, to hear 
all of the concerns that people have about this particular 
resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope all members of the House will look at this particular 
resolution very carefully and will do some research on 
denominational rights in Newfoundland and Labrador.

of a minority group, and he also feels that a referendum is not 
sufficient.  Even if the majority wills it, it is not sufficient, 
as there must be constitutional protections somewhere.  Taken to 
its extreme, following his reasoning, these protections would have 
to be in place perpetually, forever.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He quotes someone as saying: “For example, if a referendum 
were held on French language rights outside Quebec, one could 
assume these rights were threatened”.  But there is a fundamental 
problem.  Are they telling us that minority rights are opposed by 
the majority?  That would be assuming they are given any, but that 
the population is against those rights, which is extremely 
worrisome. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It means that Canadian public opinion might be opposed to the 
rights of francophones, which is the example he gave.  And these 
are the same people who have just told us how they love us, and so 
on, and how they need our understanding, the love-ins and all that 
stuff. 
There is a basic contradiction here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in general, I am convinced, are in favour of minority 
rights.  Quebec is a fine example, with its anglophone minority. 
If there were a referendum in Quebec on anglophone minority rights, 
I am convinced that the population would vote in favour.  Why, 
then, use this argument and play out this debate against a backdrop 
of language minority rights, when this does not appear to be 
pertinent in the least? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are people who want to modify an education system in 
order to create one that appears to them to be more modern, more in 
conformity to reality and to the needs of today.  How can the two 
debates be mixed?  Is he trying to tell us, when it comes down to 
it, that the majorities allow minority rights, but only 
unwillingly? 
This demonstrates a substantial underlying problem, and a profound 
intolerance that appears to exist within the majority groups in 
Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Madam Speaker, it appears to me the 
hon. gentleman is asking whether constitutional rights should be 
perpetually available to all minority groups even though it seems 
to be evident that they have relinquished these rights.  People 
have asked me that question on a number of occasions. That is not 
the whole case in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I keep referring back to the Pentecostal assemblies of 
Newfoundland which comprise only 7% of the population and which 
voted overwhelmingly to retain these rights in education.  Is the 
hon. gentleman saying to me that even though they are a minority, 
even though they have their rights protected under the 
Constitution of Canada, that we can subject these people to the 
tyranny of the majority, if he wants to put it that way, and wipe 
out these rights at will?  I do not think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If you are going to alter a minority right in this country, one 
of the responsibilities you have is to at least consult the 
groups whose rights are directly affected.  In this instance 
these groups have not been consulted.  They have had their rights 
subject to the majority without any consultation whatsoever. That 
is a grave concern. Minorities should be widely consulted when 
their rights are at stake but in this particular instance that 
has not been done.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
to understand what we are doing, we are simply voting on a 
resolution to set up a joint committee of this House and the 
Senate to further study this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank my colleague from St. John's East for sharing his 20 
minutes with me.  Under the strange rules of procedure, we know 
we are not going to discuss a lot in our 10 minutes but we do 
want to make our point.  I assure you we will be taking a very 
active role in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the leader of the opposition has suggested, we would like to 
see the committee travel to Newfoundland to take presentations 
and to listen to the people most directly involved. I know we 
have a December 5 deadline and it does not provide very much 
time.  The issue is crucial and important to many people in 
Newfoundland and I think we should have the courtesy of allowing 
the joint committee of the House of Commons and Senate to visit 
Newfoundland.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 10 minutes it is pretty hard to discuss an issue that takes 
into account minority rights, majority rights, the responsibility 
of government to govern as it sees fit and to take into account 
religious rights and freedoms which may or may not be impinged on 
by this whole process.  One also has to take into account a group 
of people I do not often hear very much said about and that is 
the students of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue debated first by the government of Premier Wells and 
later by the government of Premier Tobin is on who controls what, 
who has the power and who has the authority.  These matters have 
become all-encompassing for the individuals involved, both on the 
church side of the argument and on the government side.  In many 
cases the persons who are lost are the tens of thousands of 
students in Newfoundland schools.  They are the ones that first 
and foremost must be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with my colleague from St. John's East on certain of the 
points that have been made.  I do not believe the referendum 
process was done fairly.  It was not done the way it should have 
been done.  The referendum was held quickly and in the middle of 
the summer.  It was held in great haste because the public 
opinion polls of Mr. Tobin showed that this reform could be 
rushed through to get it over and done with.  I do not think that 
was fair to the churches, to the parents or to many of the other 
participants in the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The result did get the objective that the government wanted at 
the time. It did get a reform vote that said 73% of those who 
voted were in favour of reform.  They wanted the system changed. 
A lot of people did not vote.  In our democratic system we really 
have to discount those because, as we often say, if you do not 
vote you really do not have a say.  We cannot come back here and 
say in total only 54% of the people voted.  This House of 
Commons could never be filled if those were the rules.  No one 
would ever be elected.  It is not just who voted, it is how they 
voted.  We have to take that into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum passed.  However, one thing the referendum showed 
loud and clear was that a lot of people wanted change.  They 
wanted reform.  The other side of the coin was that Newfoundland, 
under the Liberals in 1989 of Premier Wells and later Premier 
Tobin had gone through very significant cost cutting measures in 
the Newfoundland education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are very sceptical of a government that says “Give me 
this great new power so I can reform the system” when it spent 
nine years gutting the system, laying off teachers, closing down 
schools and raising the pupil-teacher ratio.  It did not support 
the Newfoundland Teachers Association requirement for teacher 
retraining or for students to have access to decent equipment, 
which you now need in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland has many schools.  My district has 800 students and 
30 computers.  That did not happen overnight.  These 800 students 
in the high school system are expected to compete in this new 
information age.  It simply will not happen.  It is substandard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of this might be the responsibility of the churches or 
their bureaucratic system and the waste that went on in the 
denomination educational system.  The fact is they did not 
co-operate nearly as much as they could have or should have.  We 
do have an integrated system in Newfoundland where Anglican, 
United and some other Protestant faiths work together.  They have 
an excellent system of education.  When that was established back 
in the 60s and 70s a lot of people thought an integrated system 
was going to be terrible for Anglican and United students.  It 
did not happen that way.  The teachers are still Christian, the 
community is still Christian and the teaching is done in a 
slightly different way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland deserves a significant amount of 
blame for the confusion.  It did not say in one simple way what 
it wanted to reform toward.  All it has done is find a way to lay 
off some teachers, balance the books, cut the deficit.  But the 
government has not done what it wanted to do for education which 
was to reform it. The Newfoundland system is in significant need 
of help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in the House knows what the Newfoundland economy is 
like. We have the highest unemployment rate and the lowest per 
capita income. Newfoundland is always at the wrong end of every 
scale. Education, a lot of us believe, is probably the only way 
matters can be resolved.  It will not be resolved by putting more 
money into income supporting programs like TAGS in the long haul. 
We will not solve that problem by simply allowing 
Newfoundlanders to out migrate and become a problem in Calgary or 
in Toronto or somewhere else. We will not help Newfoundland 
society unless we give the Newfoundland students the tools to 
contribute and compete within Newfoundland.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is really what the whole reform business is all about.  It 
is about how we get a better school system.  I have come to the 
conclusion, having looked at the referendum results of 73%, that 
the majority of Newfoundlanders are willing, albeit with some 
significant question marks attached, to give the Government of 
Newfoundland and Labrador the responsibility to deliver and 
implement a new education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of all Newfoundlanders, it has to work.  If it 
does not work, then an awful lot of Newfoundlanders are going to 
be very seriously handicapped in the future by not being able to 
earn a decent living, not having the educational tools to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With no side voting 27%, it is a grave concern.  Many of them 
are in my riding.  Many of them have previous concerns about the 
trust they can place in any government, that is, the government 
in Newfoundland or the government here in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my case, I am willing, as I think most Newfoundlanders are 
now ready to give them the benefit of the doubt, that a new 
system has to be implemented in Newfoundland, but it has to be a 
new system that is significantly reformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody is going to be on the hook after the amendment and 
the resolution are passed by the House of Commons and the Senate, 
it will be the Government of Newfoundland and Premier Brian 
Tobin. If a better system cannot be delivered, if a higher 
percentage of people do not finish high school, if the university 
participation rate is not higher, if the unemployment rate is 
still high after the education system is reformed, it will be a 
terrible shame to all those persons involved, in particular the 
Newfoundland government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just hope there is a willingness in the Government of 
Newfoundland to forget the idea of deficit reduction at all cost. 
That deficit reduction means our schools are going to be much 
less better served. If it is just going to be deficit reduction, 
laying off more teachers, then this reformed school system in 
Newfoundland, I assure all the people in this House of Commons, 
will not serve our people any better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for everyone in the House of Commons to realize 
that every Newfoundlander wants to contribute to Canada. However, 
they cannot contribute unless they have the tools so to do.  One 
of those fundamental tools in our modern society has to be an 
excellent education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former teacher, I am convinced that we can have a better 
education system.  It is most unfortunate that we have to come 
this route to get it.  One advantage is that we are here, in a 
democracy and basically we have a chance—as the member for St. 
John's East and I disagree on this issue—to come here to express 
our ideas, our values and our viewpoints.  We will make the 
decisions and live with them as best we can.  At least we can do 
it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can only say again that I am voting in favour of the 
resolution because I think it will give a better school system to 
the students of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, my question is for the two hon. members for St. John's 
East and St. John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Winnipeg mentioned earlier, this is a 
concern of such very great importance not only to Newfoundland 
but across the country.  Yet a few years back the same question 
was asked of the people of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pentecostal and Catholic organizations got together and 
mobilized their forces and came within a few percentage points of 
defeating the original motion.  This time the question was asked 
again and received overwhelming support of those people who 
voted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of an issue of this importance—now I am receiving all kinds of 
letters and all kinds of phone calls regarding this—why did the 
people not get out this time and vote?  So many people stayed 
home.  I would like those people from Newfoundland to answer tell 
me why people stayed home and did not vote on this very critical 
and very important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Madam Speaker, there are several 
reasons for it.  Partly it was the summer. Having education 
reform or something like that in the middle of July and August 
when many people are on holidays, travelling outside the province 
is difficult.  We had the Cabot 500 celebrations where there were 
a tremendous amount of volunteers involved. Many were parents and 
teachers and there were school board activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the timing of it, having it on September 2, gave little 
or no input certainly made it difficult.  The other part is that 
we are just so sick and tired of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been an ongoing debate in Newfoundland.  I taught school 
in the early 1970s and it was there then and long before that. 
People just got tired of it. The people of Newfoundland are 
beginning to realize that this information age is going to pass 
us by if we are not careful.  So let us get on with the reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of people have just said that it is going to happen 
anyway. Let us just do it and have it over with. 
<P><A NAME="LINK27"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan—Shuswap, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member a couple of 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity of travelling in Newfoundland and I spent 
some time in the schools there talking to the students as well as 
teachers.  This is a great concern in Newfoundland, as the hon. 
member has said.  It is so much a concern that I am troubled 
about the committee having a time limit of December 5. That 
really scares me when we are going to make a decision pertaining 
to a province which was guaranteed a lot of things when it joined 
Confederation, yet none of it has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say in all sincerity, that if there is one province in 
the country that has really been taken advantage of since 
Confederation it is the province of Newfoundland. When I see a 
time limit of December 5 being put on a committee that is going 
to study how education be furthered in one of our provinces, it 
causes me great concern. I wonder if the hon. member would 
address that for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think there would be a 
pretty enthusiastic group in Newfoundland if we were to suspend 
the House in January and members came to Newfoundland and 
renegotiated the terms of the union.  We would be pretty 
delighted to take back fisheries management and give the 
government health care and education and a few other things that 
we find it difficult to afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole business is very serious and I for one would be more 
than happy to see the deadline of December 5 extended somewhat, 
not ad infinitum, but until another time. Maybe a practical 
suggestion would be that when the House is not sitting in January 
and part of February to take some time and go to Newfoundland and 
do this thing properly.  Certainly I think the people of 
Newfoundland would benefit from it and the whole House of Commons 
would as well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to 
rise on a matter on which I last addressed the House on May 31, 
1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are dealing with an issue of constituent power.  That is 
basically the constitutional amending power and to some extent it 
is terra incognita, or better said, the law in the making because 
there have been so few precedents to date that what we do creates 
the precedents of future conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did make several observations that are perhaps worth 
repeating.  I will not forget, by the way, the useful 
intervention by the Leader of the Opposition because I think that 
deserves some special comment in light of what has happened since 
the debate in May 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of what this amendment stands for, I think it can 
be established as a constitutional duty of the federal government 
to respond with all deliberate speed to requests by provinces 
made under section 43 of the Constitution Act of 1982, for changes 
in the Constitution.  Section 43 relates to what we might call 
bilateral amendments to the Constitution. They concern the 
federal government as Canada and the government of one province 
only.  It might be said that by definition the significance of an 
amendment made thereto is limited to the federal government for 
Canada and the the province concerned.  It does not bind other 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this was a matter of some concern to people in provinces 
other than Newfoundland 18 months ago, and many of us including 
myself were visited by very distinguished religious and other 
authorities, I felt it necessary to make some comments which I 
will repeat again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal for amendment relates to a request by Newfoundland 
for change of term 17, of the terms of the union of 1949 and it 
is limited to that.  It has no legal implications for other 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, as a matter of constitutional interpretation, the 
Supreme Court of Canada gives a deference in the interpretation 
of the Constitution to what are called the travaux préparatoires, 
the parliamentary debates. 
They have a significance they do not have in relation to ordinary 
legislation and I built into my own statement my reasons for 
voting 18 months ago that I was voting on an amendment limited to 
Newfoundland, and I would recommend to other members to do the 
same.  This would help create the precedent that this does not 
apply to other provinces where other considerations apply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are legitimate considerations in all provinces, in Ontario 
obviously, but in British Columbia where the issue of funding for 
schools including church schools is a relevant political issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a further matter I would also say that there have been 
significant changes here since the matter was first presented 18 
months ago and this House voted overwhelmingly to approve it. 
The matter originally approved by this House went to the Senate 
and the Senate did not act with all deliberate speed.  It took 
perhaps a certain amount of time longer than I think the 
constituent process envisaged.  It then went to hearings by the 
Senate which I commended, by the way, to a number of people who 
had written to me as a chance to have their views expressed.  It 
also went to the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and a single judge 
gave a ruling.  It was at that stage that the premier of 
Newfoundland called for a referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said I would comment on what the Leader of the Opposition has 
proposed. I have said to him at times only half in jest that I 
feel these parts of his thinking may be borrowed from some of my 
earlier writings.  I know the Leader of the Opposition is opposed 
to a non-elective legislative chamber.  I think it is hard to 
deny the question that the constitutional legitimacy of a 
legislative body depends on its being elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless I think we should recognize that the Senate and the 
Senate committee in this case, which was a strong committee, 
performed a useful and constructive role in the months that 
followed on this House vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the premier of Newfoundland appeared in Ottawa to defend 
this measure 18 months ago some asked him if there had been full 
consultation and could he give them assurances here because they 
are getting representations from voters in Newfoundland and 
people in other provinces.  He undertook to have discussions and 
consultations with them.  I think that was an important 
undertaking.  I read this again into my address in the House of 
Commons so that it would be a matter of record that under the 
principles of constitutional comity it would be understood that 
the premier approaching for a constitutional amendment under 
section 43 might find it proper to give undertakings of this sort 
which could in a sense become constitutionally binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am simply saying is that the extra time, including in 
this the Senate role, I think has been helpful and we come to 
this matter again 18 months later with a very substantially 
augmented case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think these figures, because they have been passed over 
perhaps rather too obliquely, are startling.  There is an 
overwhelming majority, 73% of the Newfoundland population, that 
has approved this measure in a province-wide referendum vote. 
That is an astonishing figure for referenda. It goes even beyond 
the majority that rejected the Charlottetown accord throughout 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we say what is the significance of a referendum, we can go to 
the Prime Minister of Great Britain and we will see that this is 
participatory democracy in action.  It is so much becoming part 
of constitutional thinking that it would take a good deal of 
courage to say let's write off the 73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go a step further and say that 47 of the 48 Newfoundland 
electoral districts have voted to support this measure.  That is 
an astonishing figure, let us face it, in terms of any of our 
votes in any of our own provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me look at the breakdown which has been made for me of the 
votes analysed constituency by constituency in an attempt to 
determine the particularity of the vote.  In the St. George's Bay 
region, which is 74% Roman Catholic, 59% of the population voted 
yes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1350"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1350

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Burin peninsula, which is 48.5% Roman Catholic, 72% voted 
yes.  That is an astonishingly high percentage.  In the Avalon 
peninsula, which is 48.5% Roman Catholic and Newfoundland's most 
heavily populated region, 72% voted yes.  That again is a 
remarkable figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go to the Pentecostal vote in the four electoral 
districts where Pentecostals are most heavily concentrated, the 
resolution carried with majorities of 57% to 64%.  If we are 
looking for participatory democracy, if we are looking for 
popular consultation, I would defy anybody to find a more 
startling affirmation of public support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are matters in this contempory era that Prime Minister 
Blair of Great Britain calls the second modern period which have 
implications not merely for the economy but also for the 
political processes.  There is, I think, a clear support for what 
is normally our duty in acting on a request under section 43. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the federal government, unless there is a 
direct conflict with the charter of rights or some other 
constitutional fundamental provision, is bound to act on a 
provincial request.  When we get this support in terms of the 
popular majority, it seems we are bound to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition did raise the issue as to whether 
this should be discussed or considered by a joint Senate and 
House committee.  As I say, I have sympathy with the viewpoint of 
the paramountcy of the elected House.  I would simply say that we 
have already had the opportunity of the Senate participating in 
this process.  In my view it was not necessarily surprising 
that the particular senators delegated to that committee 
before were exceptionally talented people.  I think their role 
has been constructive and useful.  There is a body of accumulated 
experience and I see no point in disturbing it at this stage, 
although I understand the point of the Leader of the Opposition 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Back again to this issue, I think it is necessary to reaffirm 
the point we have basically made.  This is a proposition limited 
to a change to term 17 of the terms of union of Newfoundland with 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we are normally bound as a federal government to act on 
a resolution presented in good faith under section 43 by a 
provincial legislature unless there are overwhelming 
constitutional reasons to the contrary.  We did not see those 18 
months ago and I do not see them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the support of the people of Newfoundland, expressed in 
the only way in a constitutional democracy it can be expressed, 
through a vote, is overwhelming.  I do not see that we would be 
justified in rejecting it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the implications for other provinces, as I have said, I read 
into my own vote, and I commend to others to do this, a 
limitation to a particular constitutional amendment proposed 
under section 43. This is without prejudice to a position that I 
and others may take on a request from Quebec for an amendment or 
a request from other provinces.  However, I see no implication 
here for perfectly legitimate political requests or demands that 
religious groups in other provinces may make for various actions 
by their government, whether it be in the form of state aid to 
education of religious schools or otherwise. Those must be fought 
on their political merits within those provinces and they are not 
affected by what we are doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are there any other matters here?  I would take note of the fact 
that I believe the premier of Newfoundland has discharged, in 
good faith, the undertaking he made that he would consult with 
religious groups within the province.  I think he has acted in 
good faith on that.  I am impressed by the guarantees that he is 
giving here that religious education will be made available in 
the province in what will become non-religious schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He has also carefully read the constitutional precedents and 
none are better developed than those before the United States 
supreme court.  He has built into that guarantee guarantees of 
the rights of parents of children who might wish to opt out of 
their religious instruction.

listened to objections that were made here by members of this 
House on both sides who may have supported the measure but had 
some objections to the way it was being done but who may have 
voted for it nevertheless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier has responded well.  I think we should take this as 
an example of good faith on his part and we should respond 
equally to that.

improved over the measure which I voted for before.

Vancouver Quadra, who was an emeritus professor of law.  He has 
been quoted in all Canadian faculties of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some questions, however, about the sort of nuance he is 
introducing when he says that we are now debating the particular

reservations when it came time to discuss the particular case of 
Quebec and the amendment that province is seeking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member for Vancouver Quadra to tell us if he 
has any reservations and if they are the result of the Reform Party

a few other provinces, not the Province of Quebec.  I already have 
an opinion on the amendment favoured by the Government of Quebec,

here that I would like to make a distinction between the two cases.

question which I believe is fundamental to human rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can take my car to a shop and have it fixed. Even though the 
repairs are covered by the British Columbia government run 
insurance company, I can choose the car dealer.  I can choose my 
doctor for myself and members of my family, even though it is a 
government funded health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he agree that we should have also the fundamental right to 
choose for our children how and where they should be educated? If 
there is a defence of that right of free choice, should there be 
a financial penalty attached to exercising that right? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on this particular issue 
we have all the rights guaranteed by the charter of rights 
and an amendment put forward by a province cannot run 
counter to the charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue left open, and I was particularly referring to 
issues raised by certain provinces in relation to the 
Newfoundland question, it seems to me completely open, if and 
when we adopt this amendment, to raise the issue of the provision 
of provincial aid, for example, for education in church schools 
and other provinces.  That is an issue to be fought out within 
the political processes there, but there is no negative 
implication from a vote here.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the way the Liberal government is cooking up this deal 
on emissions is starting to remind Canadians of how Mulroney 
cooked up the Meech Lake deal. The process is the same.  A few 
heads of state get together in a room.  They agree to some 
emission deal.  It is top down, it is rushed and worst of all, 
Canada agrees to sign before getting agreement from the key 
players back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This approach did not work for Mulroney on the Constitution. Why 
is the environment minister creating an environmental Meech Lake 
accord? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I have said many times before, the 
government is committed to legally binding targets that we will 
sign onto with other annex I countries in Kyoto, Japan. With 
respect, the government is also working in a serious style of 
negotiation with all of the partners in this country who, after 
Kyoto, have to be involved in putting in the measures necessary 
to meet our targets. We do this with respect in our negotiating 
process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it would seem to me that if you are taking a common 
sense approach to negotiating an environmental deal, you do a few 
common sense things first. You get an agreement from the 
provinces, the industries and the consumers at the front end. You 
get an agreement in Canada about appropriate levels, about what 
costs are acceptable and how to implement.  Then you take this 
made in Canada deal to Kyoto and you sign the treaty only if it 
meets or exceeds your criteria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the environment minister is, is this common 
sense approach not preferable to the top down, cart before the 
horse, Meech Lake approach the government is taking? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the Reform Party what 
its own position is on this very serious global issue. Is it 
going to continue to put its head in the sand and say that there 
is no problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which implicates the future for our children 
and our grandchildren.  In its own Reform document the Reform 
Party says it supports ensuring that all Canadians dwell in a 
clean and healthy environment.  When are you going to start 
standing up for— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, I invite you please to 
address your remarks to the Chair. 
<P><A NAME="LINK70"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Reform's approach has been for years to balance 
environmental and economic concerns.  The way to do that is to go 
to the Canadian players first and get an agreement.  You get an 
agreement on levels.  You get an agreement on costs.  You get an 
agreement on implementation.  Then you take the made in Canada 
agreement to Kyoto and negotiate with the international players 
and they sign if they get agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the minister not take that approach in that sequence? 
Why does she start at the top, say she is going to sign something 
and then come back and persuade the Canadian players to get an 
agreement? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I, other ministers in our government and 
our officials have held many, many meetings over the years with 
officials and other parties to this important negotiation. With 
respect, the Reform Party cannot even listen to its own critic 
about its position. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in response to the environment minister, I would like to make my 
position abundantly clear. I oppose a gas tax.  I oppose an 
energy tax.  I oppose an environment tax. I even hate the GST. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the minister, why will the environment 
minister not do the same thing? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the government is open to looking at many 
alternatives with our partners in dealing with this important 
issue which affects all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose the critic opposite is suggesting that he is 
responding to his own quotes where he says “You have to look at 
the whole package of where you are going to go, where you want to 
be. Yes, environmental taxes even may be part of the equation if 
they are dedicated”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Nanaimo—Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let me say it again. The Reform Party will strenuously oppose any 
new tax the Liberals bring in, thanks to Kyoto. No gas tax, no 
energy tax, no environment tax, no green tax at all, no tax 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the minister not stand in her place today and tell 
Canadians that the Liberals will not raise taxes because of their 
backroom deal in Kyoto? 
<P><A NAME="LINK75"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Minister of the Environment, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this issue is much more important than 
the scare mongering of the Reform Party on the issue of taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the Reform Party what they are going to do, 
what are their own suggestions about dealing with greenhouse gas 
emissions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
rumours are flying about the government's support for the section 
93 constitutional amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs promised to act 
quickly so that the Government of Quebec could go ahead with this

</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs tell us if the 
government intends to require all Liberal members to vote in favour 
of this amendment? 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt about the 
government's support for this initiative.  As for whether the Prime 
Minister intends to insist on party discipline or whether he will 
allow a free vote, only the Prime Minister can answer this question 
in due course.  But it is a government initiative proposed in this 
House, and it is the government's intention, of course, to proceed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
one of the principles underlying oral question period is that the 
government is accountable and must answer.  If the Prime Minister 
is not here, it does not mean the government ceases to operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs to 
tell us if the government intends to require all Liberal members to 
vote in favour of this amendment and not to engage in doubletalk 
with statements to the effect that the government is favourable, 
but that members are being allowed to vote as they wish and that it 
does not recognize the unanimous request of the Government of 
Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Government of Canada supports the constitutional 
amendment passed unanimously by the National Assembly.  We think it 
is important to have a parliamentary committee, particularly as 
there was not one in the National Assembly.  We think that the 
amendment should be approved because it is good for Quebec and 
because there is consensus.  A committee is doing its work and 
members should quit their politicking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993, when New Brunswick needed a constitutional amendment to 
make French and English the province's official languages, the Prime 
Minister, who was then the leader of the opposition, demanded that 
Liberal members show solidarity in supporting New Brunswick's request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister intend to make the same recommendation to the 
government, to ensure Quebec's request for an amendment meets with 
success? 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is important to remember that the first time New 
Brunswick's request was debated in this House, the small number of Bloc 
Quebecois members who were here at the time refused to support it, thus 
preventing us from having the unanimous consent necessary to make the 
change before the election. The Bloc Quebecois opposed the request. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> It is not true. 
<P><A NAME="LINK83"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Bloc 
Quebecois wanted a recorded division to force everyone in this House to 
show his or her true colours and we got it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. Are 
not the current hesitations of the government an indication that the 
various interest groups and lobbies are getting their way and are 
beginning to weaken the unanimous consent of the National Assembly? 
<P><A NAME="LINK84"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion (President of the Queen's Privy Council for 
Canada and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Quebec is a pluralistic society whose people hold various views. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government reviewed the issue and concluded there was 
a consensus for a measure that would be appropriate for Quebec society. 
The committee is doing its work and we will await the results.

question is for the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nova Scotia's premier is back in Ottawa.  This former Liberal 
member of Parliament is now telling anyone who will listen that 
he left federal politics to try to undo the damage caused by four 
years of disastrous Liberal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the finance minister confirm that he will today discuss with 
the Nova Scotia premier ways to undo the damage of cuts to 
education, undo the damage of cuts to health care and undo the 
damage being caused to Nova Scotians by his blended sales tax? 
<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, indeed today I will be meeting with the premier of Nova 
Scotia.  He is coming here with a number of items to discuss with 
myself and with other members.  I look forward to this particular 
discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier of Nova Scotia, long time a member of this House, is 
an outstanding Canadian.  He has a very clear vision of the 
future of Nova Scotia.  We will do everything we possibly can to 
make sure that Nova Scotia continues to progress. 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, they 
may actually get somewhere in this pre-election flurry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was an MP the Nova Scotia premier voted for the blended 
sales tax.  He now admits that the BST is hurting Nova Scotians. 
The Prime Minister on the other hand is busy gloating that he has 
worked the bugs out of the BST, that it is a great tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister be meeting with the Nova Scotia 
premier to reminisce about the days when they were BST boosters 
together in the Liberal caucus, or will he instead get down to 
business and undo the BST and the damage it is causing to Nova 
Scotians? 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the harmonized sales tax is supported by the chamber of 
commerce and all of the small and medium size business groups in 
Nova Scotia precisely because it has lowered taxes for consumers, 
because it has lowered their administrative costs and it is 
enabling them to create jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very surprised that the leader of the NDP, who has some 
experience in Nova Scotia, would not support the premier of Nova 
Scotia who is an outstanding Canadian, an outstanding 
representative of Atlantic Canada, and who is here to do his best 
by the province.  What the leader of the NDP ought to do is to 
support him in his desire to improve—

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last Friday in Vancouver I met with representatives of the 
Community Fisheries Development Centre, the Coastal Community 
Network and the United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union.  All 
of these groups said to me that the government's Mifflin plan for 
the fishery was an unmitigated disaster, that the government is 
not listening and that if the government has a plan for the 
fishery, they have no idea what it is.

<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has been very clear in the past that it is not 
the attitude of those supported by the colleague of the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the

minister's hot air and rhetoric about this issue.  What they want 
to know is what the government is going to do.  It is their 
livelihood that is at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can I suggest something constructive to the government and to 
the Deputy Prime Minister?  At the APEC summit that will be held 
in November in Vancouver, the Prime Minister will meet with 
President Clinton.  Will they give a mandate to the two envoys, 
Mr. Ruckelshaus and Mr. Strangway, to report to them at that time 
so that they can bring a solution to this very important issue 
for the livelihood of fishermen on the west coast?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it all depends on whether a proper, good, effective 
report is ready. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Later this week both Messrs. Strangway and Ruckelshaus will be 
in Ottawa to meet with officials to brief us on their progress. 
They have undertaken an extensive consultation.  We want to know 
how far they have been able to come with recommendations.  It 
will depend on where they are at.  That will determine when and 
where we then present those reports to the President of the

will be administered at arm's length.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Canadians have seen their standard of living eroded in the last 
few years primarily because of tax increases.  We know the 
government has said absolutely no to tax relief but it has said a 
big yes to tax hikes in the form of the $700 increase to CPP 
premiums, double that if you are self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So what are Canadians supposed to do?  Are they supposed to eat 
a little less every month to save some money?  Are they supposed 
to skip their mortgage payments, maybe take the kids out of 
hockey? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the finance minister tell Canadians, with the highest 
personal income taxes in the G-7, just where the money is 
supposed to come from for the $700 CPP tax hike? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, once again, one really has to look at the adequacy of 
the research department for the Reform Party.  The fact of the 
matter is the net worth of Canadian households is up.  The fact 
is what the Reform Party has not done is tell the Canadian people 
what it would do with the very large liability that is owed to 
those Canadians who are currently retired or those Canadians who 
are currently working and putting money into the Canada pension 
plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As things currently stand there are only one or two 
alternatives.  Either Reformers are suggesting a 13% premium 
versus 9.9% or they would renege on the commitments to 
Canadians—

those who rely on it, what Reform will do with about $600 billion 
liability.

hospitals and shutting down schools.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Members will recall 
that at the termination of the debate before question period the 
hon. member for Vancouver Quadra had seven minutes remaining on 
questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I just had 
a private conversation with the member for Vancouver Quadra and 
he is now prepared to answer the question I asked just before 
question period started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am eagerly anticipating the answer with respect to the freedom 
of parents to choose education for their children and not to 
suffer a financial penalty for making that choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I had begun to answer the 
question and question period arrived so my answers were a little 
elliptic.  I am happy to add to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation in Canada is different from that in the United 
States.  In particular our charter of rights is different from 
the American bill of rights.  I think we can resume the position 
as follows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no constitutional separation of church and state in 
Canada.  Therefore it is perfectly open for any province within 
the constitutional provisions to make provision for financial aid 
to church schools or other schools.  That is a political choice 
of the province.  There is no constitutional barrier to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the issue of parents' rights, it is within the rights of 
parents to ask for religious exercises in schools.  That was 
again a decision for the province and the provincial 
instrumentalities which include municipal bodies and eventually 
school boards.  The matter essentially is that there are no 
constitutional fetters.  It is a matter of the political choice 
of the electors and their elected representatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that answers the question the hon. member posed.  It is 
an important question.  I realize in this general debate on the 
Newfoundland amendment, and I suspect the Quebec amendment to 
come, there are matters of this sort that are a concern to 
citizens of the country.  I have received representations and 
questions on them myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I thank the hon. member for aiding the cause of 
enlightenment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for 
Vancouver Quadra if there is no constitutional separation of 
church and state in Canada where the protection for 
denominational schools is.  Is it under section 93? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the only constitutional 
protections that exist are under section 93 as such.  I should 
have said when there is no separation of church and state as in 
the United States.  There is no official religion here as there 
is in Great Britain.  The only formal constitutional guarantees 
are in section 93. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be called upon in the next few weeks to rule on the 
question in relation to Quebec and its request for a 
constitutional amendment.  It is essentially a matter of the 
political will.  There are no barriers other than the barriers in 
the political processes of persuading one's citizens to adopt a 
particular course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, since the hon. member opposite 
has said that it is a matter of political will I have another 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to be a fundamental right of parents to make choices 
with respect to how and where their children are educated. 
If they were not taxpayers I suppose we could simply say it was 
public policy, public money, and not their money. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1510"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially 100% of these parents are also taxpayers.  They pay 
into the education pot.  Why can they not take money from the 
education pot to which they have contributed and make a free 
choice on how their children are educated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member suppose the Liberal Party will ever demonstrate 
the political will to grant this most fundamental human freedom? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would have to reply to 
the hon. member that we have a federal system and a 
constitutional division of competencies.  That is a question more 
properly addressed to the provincial legislature in his case or 
to provincial legislatures generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is within the free will of the provincial legislatures to 
make these arrangements.  There is an increasing sophistication 
in provincial legislatures and a realization that within the cost 
of education there has to be some greater pluralizing of the 
educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say he should go directly to the provincial legislature. 
The problems are not constitutional.  They are matters of 
political choice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I address the 
debate today on term 17 and the Newfoundland educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important for all of us to look at what a 
Canadian constitution is and to decide whether it is an 
historical document with no relevance to today's society.  Should 
it be a document that evolves with the changes in our society, 
stays up to date with the times and changes with the needs 
expressed in different communities? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before the House refers to term 17 and the 
Newfoundland agreement of coming into Confederation.  It deals 
with denominational schools and whether or not they should be run 
by the churches as opposed to the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation has occurred over the years and was brought into 
question in 1992 by the Williams Royal Commission on Education 
that reported to the government with recommendations for change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discussions were entered between the government and the churches 
to try to come up with some kind of consensus.  They were unable 
to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this situation then Premier Clyde Wells of 
Newfoundland attempted to reach a compromise position in 1995 
with the churches and the government by introducing a 
constitutional amendment to term 17 which altered but did not 
eliminate denominational rights.  On September 5, 1995 the people 
of Newfoundland voted in a referendum on the following question: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you support revising term 17 in the manner proposed by the 
government to enable reform of the denominational education 
system?  Yes or No. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 384,734 voters on the list 52% of them cast ballots.  The 
result was that 54.8% said yes.  They felt that there should be 
some changes to term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 31, 1995 the Newfoundland House of Assembly passed 
the resolution to amend term 17.  In June 1996 the House of 
Commons passed the motion.  In July 1996, after holding committee 
meetings from June 18 to July 10, the Senate committee issued its 
report recommending amendments to the resolution.  In August 1996 
amendments to the school act and the education act were 
proclaimed replacing the 37 denominational school boards with 10 
interdenominational boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I looked at that and at the population of Newfoundland with 
37 denominational school boards it seemed like an onerous system. 
In Vancouver, Surrey and Richmond, each city has a school board. 
In essence, we are talking about 1.5 million people in the 
greater Vancouver area with less than 10 school boards.  I would 
think that perhaps it makes some sense for that to have happened.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 the Senate voted to amend the resolution.  In December 
1996 the House of Commons passed the original resolution for a 
second time. A new Schools Act and Education Act came into force 
in January 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we have to acknowledge is that Newfoundland has done 
something that Quebec has yet to do.  When Newfoundland decided 
that it was going to bring these kinds of changes to the school 
system, whether or not it had the support of the people, it had a 
referendum.  It knew that if it was going to be supported by the 
people, by the citizens of Newfoundland, that it would have to go 
out and sell the idea.  As I said a little earlier in my 
comments, 54% of the people of Newfoundland said yes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens is that people challenge and this was no different. 
After the Schools Act and Education Act came into force there 
was a challenge to the way the province of Newfoundland was going 
to administer it. In May 1997 the Catholic and Pentecostal 
churches issued a statement of claim and application for 
interlocutory relief in the Newfoundland supreme court.  In July 
1997 Mr. Justice Leo Barry granted an injunction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is necessary for us to understand that the injunction 
was not against amending term 17 but it was against the changes 
to the Schools Act as a result of the changes to term 17.  I 
would hate to see in Canada that we would feel that a 
constitution cannot be changed.  It is important for me to make 
the clarification that the courts were not saying we could not 
change the Constitution. They were merely addressing how the 
changes to the Constitution were being processed through the 
Education Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland, in realizing that there was a problem in its 
constituency, did another honourable thing.  It went back to the 
people and said that it wanted the people to tell it whether they 
agreed with what it was trying to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In September 1997 Newfoundland put another question to its 
people which was very clear:  Do you support a single school 
system where all children, regardless of their religious 
affiliation, attend the same schools where opportunities for 
religious education and observances are provided, yes or no? The 
result of that referendum was 73%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to use three tests as to whether or not the 
Constitution should be amended.  It is very important if we 
accept the fact that they are changing a living document which 
can be amended, to understand or accept whether the people are 
behind the changes, the people who will be affected by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the change have the consensus of the population?  I think 
Newfoundland has gone to great lengths to find that consensus and 
it has met that test. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second test is whether they are legally able to do that. 
Something we will see over the next few years is whether there is 
a consensus that Newfoundland has the right under the law to make 
those kinds of changes to term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the final tests has to be as to whether it is in the 
national interest.  Is the change that is taking place going to 
be in the best interests of the citizenry?  Is it going to 
protect the minority populations that will be affected by it?  Is 
it going to recognize that sometimes when we do things for one 
province it has an effect on other provinces in Confederation?

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a country, we must always look at whether this amendment to 
part of the Constitution which may only affect one province will 
have any effect on other provinces in a way that would not have 
the support of the people in the other provinces.  Is it going to 
be a precedent when dealing with constitutional issues down the 
road? We have to look at the three different areas that might be 
affected through constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to individuals who are concerned as to whether or not 
there was a proper consensus of the population, I would like to 
think that with two resolutions that clearly indicated what the 
province was intending to do with the support of the majority of 
the population that they could feel comforted that it did have a 
consensus.  Within the rule of law if there is a problem 
concerning whether or not there is a legal right, it will be 
challenged in the courts and it will be decided very clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third question on national interests is perhaps a little 
harder to deal with.  That is a question we will have to set our 
minds to.  The committee that will be formed by the House of 
Commons will have to set its mind to the question of whether this 
is in the national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment that was introduced earlier today by the Leader of 
the Opposition deals with whether it should be a joint committee 
and whether the hearings should take place in Newfoundland.  It 
is time the Senate be relegated to the position it is in, a house 
that has no support because it is unelected.  How is it possible 
for an unelected body to be making these serious recommendations 
on changing a constitution when it is not accountable to anybody? 
It is a system that may be outdated and should be looked at 
being changed, as is term 17 of the Newfoundland school act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is whether we can justify dealing with term 17 
in Ottawa.  How is it possible for the people of Newfoundland to 
feel they have been taken seriously, that they are being given 
every opportunity and an equal opportunity to meet with committee 
members to have their positions heard if they are expected to 
travel to Ottawa?  In this situation the committee should be 
holding its hearings in Newfoundland where the parents live.  The 
committee should make sure Newfoundlanders have the full 
opportunity to present their position before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again the government is dealing with a very serious issue, 
amending the Canadian Constitution, and it has set a deadline. 
The committee must report back by December 5.  When we talk about 
constitutional matters that have great importance to our country, 
although I believe it should be a living breathing document, we 
cannot make decisions in haste without fully reviewing all the 
aspects of legality, consensus and national interest. I would 
hope the government would allow ample opportunity for that 
process to take place before it forces a report back in this 
House.

In accordance with established procedure, the Speaker of the Legislative 
Assembly of Newfoundland forwarded to the Clerk of the Privy Council a 
certified copy of the resolution, which was received on September 8, 
1997. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our role and responsibility as parliamentarians is to consider 
the proposed amendment and to decide whether to approve it.  As I 
have already indicated on several occasions, the Government of 
Canada supports the proposed amendment which will allow 
Newfoundland to proceed with major reforms to its education 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following many years of rancorous and divisive debate in 
Newfoundland over the role of the churches and religion in 
education, it is the government's view that the proposed 
amendment strikes a workable balance. In Newfoundland the 
proposed amendment appears to enjoy a high level of consensus, 
including a reasonable degree of support from affected 
minorities. The government bases its assessment in part on the 
House of Assembly's unanimous endorsement of the amendment 
resolution and on the result of the provincial referendum in 
which 73% of the voters approved a proposal to reform the 
education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the Government of Canada is of the view that any 
attempt to alter entrenched minority rights should be marked by 
processes that are fair and thorough. To this end, the government 
is striking a special joint committee to examine Newfoundland's 
resolution to amend term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is our belief that the hearings will help to enhance public 
input and understanding of the proposed amendment. Moreover the 
committee's work will aid Parliament in making its independent 
assessment on the facts of the case and on the merits and 
appropriateness of the proposed amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. colleagues will recall, this is the second time in less 
than two years that Parliament has been asked to consider an 
amendment to term 17 of Newfoundland's terms of union. While this 
situation may seem unusual, the Constitution does not set any 
limits on how often legislators may seek constitutional 
amendments.  It is up to Parliament and the provincial 
legislature to which the amendment applies to determine the 
appropriateness of each proposed constitutional change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand fully the circumstances which have given rise to 
this second amendment proposal, it is necessary to briefly review 
the provisions of term 17.  It is also helpful to examine the 
intensive efforts that have been made over the past seven years 
to reform the education system in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In lieu of section 93 of the Constitution Act 1867, 
constitutional authority for education in Newfoundland was set 
out in term 17 of the province's 1949 terms of union with Canada. 
Term 17 granted six denominations the right to operate their own 
publicly funded schools. In 1987 term 17 was amended to extend 
denominational school rights to the Pentecostal assemblies. These 
seven denominations operated four separate school systems:  the 
integrated school system of Anglican, Presbyterian, Salvation 
Army and United churches; the Pentecostal school system; the 
Roman Catholic school system; and the Seventh Day Adventist 
school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador appointed 
Dr. Len Williams, a former teacher, principal and president of 
the provincial teachers association and current university 
professor, to chair a royal commission on education reform. 
The commission was asked “to obtain an impartial assessment of 
the existing education system and to seek an appropriate vision 
for change”.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1992 report of the Williams royal commission recommended the 
reorganization of the education system in Newfoundland and 
Labrador to permit government to administer the system in a more 
efficient manner.  The commission proposed the creation of a 
single interdenominational school system encompassing the four 
separate denominational systems in operation at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Initially the Government of Newfoundland sought to achieve this 
change through non-constitutional negotiations with 
denominational leaders. When nearly three years of discussions 
failed to achieve an agreement the Government of Newfoundland 
sought institutional reform through a constitutional amendment to 
term 17 of its terms of union. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the amendment that Newfoundland sought, and which was 
authorized by this House and proclaimed by the Governor General 
on April 21, 1997, represented a compromise.  The amendment would 
not have eliminated all single denominational schools. The 
amendment was designed to provide the Newfoundland House of 
Assembly with additional powers to organize and administer public 
education through a system of interdenominational schools, while 
retaining the rights of Roman Catholics and Pentecostals to 
unidenominational schools under certain conditions. These 
conditions were to be set out in provincial legislation that was 
equally applicable to all schools, either unidenominational or 
interdenominational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the attempt to legislatively implement the new term 17 
under a revised schools act was successfully challenged in the 
Newfoundland supreme court.  On July 8, 1997, Mr. Justice Leo 
Barry granted representatives of the Roman Catholic and 
Pentecostal churches a temporary injunction halting the entire 
educational reform process. In Justice Barry's view, the new 
schools act favoured interdenominational over unidenominational 
schools.  Therefore he found that a trial judge would likely find 
that the legislation was contrary to the amended term 17, which 
required that interdenominational and unidenominational Roman 
Catholic and Pentecostal schools be given equal treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As even Mr. Justice Barry acknowledged and anticipated, the 
injunction resulted in a “significant disruption” for teachers, 
principals and students who had been reassigned to different 
schools on the basis of the new school legislation. It also 
resulted in the reopening of some schools and the rehiring of 
some teachers who had been laid off following certain school 
closures and resignations.  For the Government of Newfoundland 
and citizens who thought the divisive of education debate was 
behind them, the injunction raised many questions and a great 
deal of uncertainty about the future structure of the school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Newfoundland filed an appeal, but did not 
pursue the matter.  Instead, on July 31, 1997, Premier Tobin 
announced in a province-wide telecast that he would hold a 
referendum on September 2 to secure a mandate to amend term 17 
once again.  Premier Tobin explained that for five years the 
provincial government, schools boards, teachers' associations, 
the churches, parents and students “have all been engaged in 
what seems to be a never ending debate about how to reconcile the 
need for reform of our education system with the rights of the 
denominations in the education system”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While not referring specifically to the injunction blocking 
educational reform, Premier Tobin argued that “During the last 
five years, we have seen every attempt to reconcile these two 
ideas, education reform and denominational rights, end in more 
confusion and more conflict”. 
Consequently, Premier Tobin decided to go to the people once 
again to seek a mandate for an amendment to term 17. The proposed 
amendment, which we are asked to consider, is to create a single, 
publicly funded and administered school system. The brief text of 
this term 17 amendment which only contains three clauses, is 
plain and clear and states that:

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(1) In lieu of section 93 of the Constitution Act 1867, this 
section shall apply in respect of the Province of Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(2)  In and for the province of Newfoundland, the legislature 
shall exclusive authority to make laws in relation to education, 
but shall provided for courses in religion that are not specific 
to a religious denomination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(3)  Religious observances shall be permitted in a school where 
requested by parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposed amendment, which constitutes a major restructuring 
of Newfoundland's education system, is supported by a substantial 
majority of the province's population and enjoys a fair degree of 
support from affected minorities. In addition, the House of 
Assembly gave the unanimous approval on September 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In considering this amendment the government has sought to 
ensure that its process is thorough and gives due respect to 
affected minorities. Members will recall that the issue of 
minority rights was not central to the government's consideration 
of the previous term 17 amendment. The old term 17 granted 
certain rights to seven denominations representing 95% of the 
population.  However, following the amendment to term 17, the 
integrated group, Anglican, Presbyterian, Salvation Army and the 
United Church became one majority class of persons comprising 52% 
of the population.  The Roman Catholics became a sizeable 
minority of 37%, the Pentecostal are a minority of 7%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given this amendment's effect on minority rights, a mere 50% 
plus one referendum majority would not have been sufficient nor 
adequate in measuring the degree of consensus among affected 
Roman Catholics and Pentecostals. But the referendum did not 
result in a narrow majority: it was an overwhelming majority of 
73%, which provided evidence of minority support. The proposal 
carried in 47 of Newfoundland's 48 electoral districts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Voter turn out was 53%, but given the high probability that 
opponents of the education reform proposal were most liken to 
vote, the results sent a clear message that there is substantial 
support for this amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An analysis indicates that in heavily Roman Catholic areas the 
proposal was supported by a majority.  The St. George's Bay 
region, which is 74% Roman Catholic, voted 59% yes.  The Avalon 
peninsula, which is 48.5% Roman Catholic, voted 72% yes. 
Coincidentally, the Burin peninsula is also 48.5% Roman Catholic 
and it also voted 72% yes.  Approximately 75% of all Roman 
Catholics in Newfoundland and Labrador reside in these three 
regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is difficult to assess accurately the exact degree to which 
members of the smaller Pentecostal community supported the 
proposed amendment.  However, in the four electoral districts 
where Pentecostals are most heavily concentrated the resolution 
carried with majorities of 57% to 64%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, on September 5, the four members of the Pentecostal 
faith who sit in the Newfoundland House of Assembly and represent 
districts with significant Pentecostal populations, joined their 
colleagues in unanimously supporting the resolution to amend term 
17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, in assessing the proposed amendment, parliamentarians 
should accord due respect to the fact that all of the members of 
the House of Assembly voted in favour of the resolution to amend 
term 17. This included all Catholic and Pentecostal members who 
had campaigned for the no side and voted no in the provincial 
referendum.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The overwhelming support the amendment received in the 
referendum and the House of Assembly represents a clear consensus 
that appears to include a reasonable measure of support from the 
affected minorities. Parliament should interpret this as a clear 
signal that the population of Newfoundland and Labrador wants to 
proceed expeditiously to reform its education system in a manner 
that is fair to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the midst of the confusion that resulted following the 
injunction halting the implementation of the 1997 term 17 
amendment and after years of debate over educational reform and 
the role of the churches, Newfoundlanders want to move on. The 
results of the referendum and the unanimous vote of the House of 
Assembly indicate that it feels the proposed amendment strikes a 
fair and workable balance that allows reform to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed term 17 clearly states that education is a matter 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.  However, the amendment 
will not take religion out of the schools.  The new term 17 
contains a mandatory provision that guarantees that “courses in 
religion” must be taught and “religious observances” must be 
“permitted in schools where requested by parents”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Correspondingly, the term will not require children to attend 
religious observances or classes if their parents object.  This 
interpretation is supported by the legal opinion of two eminent 
lawyers, the well-known constitutional expert, Mr. Ian Binnie, 
and former federal justice minister, the Hon. John Crosbie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government acknowledges that the Newfoundland and Labrador 
Roman Catholic bishops and the leadership of the Pentecostal 
church have concerns about the new amendment.  However, we feel 
the Government of Newfoundland is demonstrating a spirit of 
openness with regard to a continued role, albeit 
non-constitutional, for the churches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In anticipation for the term 17 amendment's adoption, the 
Newfoundland department of education has begun setting up a 
consultative process for developing the new religious education 
curriculum. Although there is no requirement to do so, the 
department of education has indicated that this process will seek 
representations from the province's various denominations. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, should another province wish to propose changes to 
the conditions of its union or to section 93, it will be incumbent on 
Parliament to look at the facts and to assess the validity and 
appropriateness of the proposed amendment. Parliament will also 
carefully determine whether the amendment enjoys reasonable support from 
those concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case before us, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador 
duly authorized, under section 43, an amendment to Term 17 which will 
only apply to that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada believes the amendment is justified. We 
feel it enjoys adequate support from those concerned, including 
minorities, and we believe it deserves Parliament's support and 
approbation. However, the joint committee and all parliamentarians will 
have to conduct their own assessment of this amendment, which will allow 
Newfoundland to implement the necessary reforms to its education system, 
as it has been hoping to do for a long time.

my question is for the hon. Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the consensus in Newfoundland has been by referendum and the 
consensus for the Quebec application is by the legislative

obtain a ruling from the provincial supreme court on this matter 
to clarify the issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure what issue

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand the problem the hon. member has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 43 applies, so it is a bilateral amendment.  Is that the 
point?  If the point is that it is a bilateral amendment, there 
is no problem with that.  I was surprised to hear the Leader of 
the Opposition say that section 93 is involved.  By no means does 
section 93 have anything to do with this.  It is section 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first sentence in term 17 is: “In lieu of section 93 of the 
Constitution Act, 1867, the following term shall apply in respect 
of the province of Newfoundland”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is section 17, not section 93. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a short 
comment before putting my question to the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since this morning, Reform members seem to get the Quebec and 
Newfoundland issues mixed up, not realizing that section 93 is not 
involved, contrary to what they have been saying all day. The two issues 
are different from a procedural point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, Reformers would like a referendum to be held in Quebec 
on this issue. However, there is a consensus on this issue, which even 
the federal government deemed adequate to move forward. 
I remind Reform members that it is not only sovereignists who feel there 
is an adequate consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the minister is this: Given that Newfoundlanders 
said yes twice—both times through a democratic process involving 
consultations and a royal commission of inquiry—why establish such a 
committee? We will not oppose it, but one wonders. Why set up a 
committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could it be that, following the work of the committee, the 
government may find it necessary to make amendments, changes, etc., or 
is everything already decided anyway? The people have spoken. Why set up 
a committee and particularly, as I said this morning, a joint committee 
that will include our dear senators, whose legitimacy is being 
questioned by everyone? 
So, why set up a committee after the people have already clearly voiced 
their opinion and are, for all intents and purposes, waiting for us to 
move forward? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, the member is 
quite right.  Each province must be considered individually.  But 
the same principles must be applied to all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of the Government of Canada, there are two 
principles.  First, is the proposed amendment good for the province 
in question?  Second, does it have enough support, including by the 
minorities affected?  The Constitution obliges us as 
parliamentarians—in a sense this is what we are paid and elected 
by our constituents to do—to make up our own minds and to examine 
these two issues.  That is why there must be a parliamentary 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason there must be a parliamentary committee, and 
the case of Quebec is an illustration, is that even when there is 
a consensus, and a fairly clear one, there are always some people 
who are worried. 
When no one will speak with them, they worry even more.  It is 
better to speak with them, hear what they have to say and see that 
their point of view is made widely known, as was done by the 
newspapers in Quebec on the weekend, so that provincial legislators 
can see how they can finetune their policy so that things will go 
well in the province, because consensus is not the same thing as 
unanimity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Mr. Speaker, since we are comparing the two 
cases, you will forgive me if I correct certain facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These groups, in the case of both Newfoundland and Quebec, 
have already been heard.  Here in Ottawa, they are talking as 
though there had never been any consultations regarding the 
constitutional amendment affecting Quebec.  There were the États 
généraux sur l'éducation and consultations on Bill 109.  So the 
groups that come here are not expressing new and different points 
of view.  You want the provincial governments to hear these 
arguments, but I do not think there is anyone who has heard a 
single new thing with respect to either the case of Newfoundland or 
that of the Government of Quebec.  It then becomes a pretext. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always a bit of a paternalistic attitude that the folks 
in Ottawa must form their own opinion.  The people of Newfoundland 
have expressed their point of view, and they clearly had one 
opinion.  There were several years of discussions with the groups 
concerned, and the reason the government held a referendum was 
because it was unable to come to an agreement with these groups. 
Almost everything there is to say has been said.  How does the 
government think we are going to reach different conclusions?  On 
the contrary, this even weakens the consensuses somewhat because 
the two concepts of consensus and unanimity are being dragged in.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the government's process not going to weaken somewhat the 
existing consensuses, which are strong both in the case of 
Newfoundland and in that of Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is not paternalism in the 
least, it is federalism.  Federalism is defined as a system in 
which public power is not concentrated in a single order of 
government, thus better protecting the freedom of citizens.  The 
democratic federations are evidence of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, the Canadian Parliament, have the responsibility of 
looking at what has occurred. The hon. member tells me it is 
unlikely the judgment brought down unanimously for the province of 
Newfoundland—this being the case we are addressing today—can be 
changed.  The government agrees fully that it is unlikely, but we 
still cannot be remiss in our duty to look at this very closely. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have just 
heard the minister say that we must protect citizens' rights.  But 
a parliament must also, unquestionably, respect citizens' wishes. 
In order to understand his argument better, I would like to propose 
a totally opposite scenario to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine that the conclusions of the committee, the 
formation of which is referred to in the motion before us, were 
contrary to the intentions of the people of Newfoundland as 
expressed in the referendum.  What should we conclude about our 
parliamentary system and about a federalism that no longer 
respected the will of the people? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Stéphane Dion:</B> Mr. Speaker, this is an extremely 
hypothetical example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since we are dealing with hypotheses, let us assume that one 
province, with a very strong majority, were to turn up with a 
constitutional change that was clearly discriminatory toward a 
minority in that province—and I am not in the least singling out 
New Brunswick with this, it being a bilingual and profoundly 
democratic province—but let us assume that sometime in the next 
few decades a government with a bad idea were to say to us “We've 
had enough of official bilingualism in New Brunswick, and we have 
a clear majority behind us in this”.  We would still ask them what 
the Acadian minority in New Brunswick thought about this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite a clear majority, the Government of Canada—probably 
a Liberal one—would say “You will not even get that past the first 
door of this Parliament, because there are minority rights that 
have to be respected”. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am a bit 
surprised by the minister's responses to my two colleagues' 
questions, particularly on the subject of minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am surprised at not having heard anything from him since his 
arrival here on the assimilation of francophones in Manitoba, for 
example, or the assimilation of 72% of the francophones in British 
Columbia. I am also very surprised that he did not rise in response 
to remarks by a member of his party, the member for Vaudreuil.  He 
spoke in committee, but did not rise in the House when the member 
for Vaudreuil said “I want anglophones in Quebec to have the same 
rights as francophones in Manitoba, Ontario and British 
Columbia”. 
This kind of argument does not hold water, given the rights enjoyed 
by the anglophones in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If francophones in the rest of Canada had only 10% or 15% of 
these rights, they would be in heaven.  And in a committee struck 
by this minister and this government, for remarks such as these to 
come from the mouth of a member from Quebec, the member for 
Vaudreuil, al I can say is this is what these empty committees lead 
to.  In Newfoundland, 73% of the population and a royal commission 
have shown that this is clearly what they want.  And clearly this 
committee will come to the same conclusion reached in Newfoundland. 
Otherwise, everything would be topsy turvey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The central government is the offspring of the provinces, 
rather than the reverse.  So the provinces should be telling the 
central government what to do. 
They must tell the central government: “We are transferring 
jurisdictions over to you”. But the federal government has no business 
interfering in provincial jurisdictions. There is a will that was 
clearly expressed.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I agree with our party critic. We will not object to 
the establishment of the committee, so that this is not interpreted as 
our being opposed to the motion per se. But it is nonetheless ridiculous 
to spend time and money to sit and discuss rights and democracy with 
unelected senators, with remnants of colonialism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see any need to go to the great dormitory to come to an 
honest and appropriate decision. 
We could do without these hon. sleepyheads, as a now retired senator 
used to call them before becoming one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, there is no need for such a committee since there is a 
clear and unequivocal will. And if the government had wanted to do the 
right thing, the responsible thing, it would have tabled a motion and we 
could have moved on, instead of wasting time and money when the people 
have clearly expressed their will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same is happening with the Quebec resolution. When I see a 
minister, an academic from Quebec, question a unanimous resolution 
passed by the National Assembly, after the consultations that have taken 
place, after the anglophone minorities were consulted, after anglophone 
members from Quebec said they were satisfied following the changes they 
themselves proposed. Here is a minister from Montreal, who, while having 
some experience and knowing that the entire Montreal intelligentsia 
realizes that this resolution should have been passed 30 years ago, is 
wasting our time and, for partisan purposes before the election, refused 
to bring in a motion to settle the matter. I can see the minister 
leaving. I cannot blame him. Sometimes the truth is hard to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of bringing in a motion, he focused on the election, and 
today he is referring the matter to committee. What do we hear in these 
committees? 
Stupidities and idiotic comments such as those made by the members for 
Vaudreuil and Mount Royal<B></B>. This is a fine kettle of fish. The government 
decided to strike such a committee, but when the minister goes around 
with his committee's picnic basket, he does not realize that ants are 
getting into the basket and that,moreover, these ants are Liberal Party 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear extremists make all sorts of idiotic comments and present 
arguments not based on any principle or consultation. Such is the threat 
posed by these committees, particularly expanded committees, with 
senators, or members of the other place as we say here, who want to give 
us lessons in democracy. 
The world's most undemocratic institution sits next to us, and this 
government is giving it importance in two ways: first, by having 
senators sit on so-called joint committees and, second, by appointing 
new senators when others retire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one way to deal with the Upper House: it must be 
abolished. Conduct a poll and hold a referendum. You will see what the 
public thinks. In Quebec, 92% are in favour of abolishing that 
institution. The only way to get rid of the Upper House is by attrition, 
as we did in Quebec. I believe it was the Bertrand government which made 
a pact with the Quebec Senate. It stopped appointing new senators and 
told those who were there “Go home. You will get paid for the rest of 
your life. After all, you only come here for that pay cheque”. 
They were absolutely useless. This is a cancer we must get rid of.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This 
upper House is a hotbed of patronage, and this is something that the 
Liberal Party specializes in, patronage, financing, rewarding buddies, 
this is what the Liberal Party stands for. You keep the operation open 
and when you have a chance you put in another buddy, as was done for the 
latest appointments, for example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, while considering this issue here, with this debate on the 
creation of this useless committee, we have at least the opportunity to 
ask the following question: When the people of Newfoundland approved the 
referendum with a 54% majority and then when judges, not from the 
Supreme Court this time with their Santa Claus costumes, but judges from 
the Superior Court ruled that the question was not appropriate, what did 
the Government of Newfoundland do? It told them where to go and it held 
another referendum. What does the federal government do? It says: 
“There 
was a second referendum and the yes side won again so we will agree to 
create a committee and put a resolution before the House to have it 
approved”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But have you noticed that when Quebec is involved, people refer to 
the Supreme Court? 
In this case, even if there is a referendum in Quebec, people say: 
“In 
this case this is not acceptable”. If there is a referendum on 
sovereignty, people will say: “This is not acceptable”. In the case of 
Newfoundland, it told its Superior Court where to go and it held a 
referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Personally, I prefer to tell the minister and his government 
colleagues that when there is a referendum with a clear yes for 
sovereignty, nobody, but nobody will prevent a people from going 
forward, especially not judges from the Supreme Court dressed in Santa 
Claus costumes and appointed by the Liberal Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate at least gives us the opportunity to show to all 
Quebeckers that if they want to assume responsibility for themselves by 
voting yes in a referendum, the federal government will have to submit 
to their will, like Newfoundland has just done. It did not appeal the 
ruling of the court. 
It said “We are having another referendum”.  And bang, the 
government finds itself forced to respect that desire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder, when I hear what is being said in the House today, 
if the suggestion does not need to be made that, when this 
committee's work is over—which I hope will be as soon as possible—and 
when it comes back to this House, if we could not talk of the 
rights of francophone Newfoundlanders, and make a little comparison 
between the rights of the francophone Newfoundlanders and the 
rights, the treatment—a source of great pride to us—of the 
anglophones of Quebec. The anglophone minority in Quebec is the 
best treated minority in the world, and Quebecers are proud of 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And we will continue to be proud after sovereignty, when we 
will still be cited as an example throughout the world for the way 
we treat our anglophone minority, for our anglophone minority in 
Quebec has played an important part in our development as a nation. 
I cannot say the same for the treatment reserved for the 
francophone Newfoundlanders, the Franco-Manitobans.  If we review 
the history of the provinces, when most of the Canadian provinces 
were founded, francophones outnumbered anglophones.  Today, because 
of legislation passed in recent years, the past 20, 30, 40 or 50 
years, legislation forbidding francophones from having the same 
rights as anglophones, the rate of assimilation has been so strong 
that it is still 72% in British Columbia and 60% in Manitoba, and 
francophones who speak French in the home are virtually non-existent in 
the western provinces. 
They were a majority when these provinces came into being.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At the end of our proceedings in committee, we could perhaps tell 
Newfoundland to provide its French speaking population, in its 
regulations, practices and school boards, the same rights English 
speaking Quebekers have in Quebec. I dream of the day when the federal 
government and the other provinces in Canada will have enough 
determination to sign a reciprocal treaty concerning the rights of 
anglophones in Quebec and of francophones in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ask French speaking people in the rest of Canada, in your 
provinces, whether they would support a motion in this House granting 
them the same rights English speaking Quebeckers are enjoying. They have 
English primary schools and high schools and comprehensive education in 
English from kindergarten to university. They have three universities 
when they make up only 10% of the Quebec population. Mr. Larose, in his 
testimony before the committee, listed all the benefits English speaking 
Quebekers have in Quebec. As a majority and as a government, we are 
proud to give them those benefits because they are full-fledged members 
of Quebec society. We are proud. How nice it would be if French speaking 
Canadians could say the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs seems to like committees 
a lot. Let me suggest one to him, a committee on minority rights in 
Quebec and Canada. Let us review these rights province by province. 
Some people here will be ashamed because, as happened a couple years 
ago, the French speaking minority had to go to school in sheds, with 
kids having to go to the outhouse. Things have been that bad for some 
French speaking Canadians. We have been talking about that. Some of them 
are treated that way. We could compare, and then talk about bilingualism 
and about the two official languages of this great Canada. We would see 
what the real situation is like, and how serious the assimilation 
problem is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, this committee should be as short-lived as possible. As 
a matter of fact, it should not even have been struck; however, it must 
be because of the minister's public commitment to do so, thus wasting a 
lot of time and money. The government has probably run out of ideas, as 
it usually does when it comes to interesting issues, such as how to deal 
with unemployment, use the employment insurance surplus, develop a 
policy to eliminate the deficit, review the cuts to social programs in 
order to remedy the situation since the economy is improving. Rather 
than dealing with these things, it keeps on talking about the 
Constitution. It is the world gone topsy turvey. All the federal 
government wants to do is talk about the Constitution and strike 
constitutional committees, instead of dealing with the issue in one day, 
when Newfoundland has made its wishes clearly known.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to congratulate my hon. colleague from Richelieu for his 
speech delivered with his usual dynamism, which provided a very 
insightful look at our institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As you heard, he very aptly described the other House, which 
is called the Senate and which should not be called the Senate—a 
collection of dinosaurs that costs Canadians millions of dollars, 
an undemocratic institution, as my colleague from Richelieu so ably 
pointed out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask him, more specifically, what logic he sees 
in the operation of the Senate and in the head of Senator 
Beaudouin. I hope we can name him, for I want to make sure we 
understand one another. What kind of logic does he detect in the 
head of the ineffable constitutionalist Beaudouin, who is now a 
richly rewarded and oh-so-objective senator, who continues to 
appear as an expert on the CBC with all of its objectivity, who 
covered himself in shame the other day in the face of the alleged 
consensus, as he put it, in Quebec on the amendments to be made to 
the Constitution in order to set up a system of education based on 
language rather than religion, and who said that a referendum was 
required? There is no consensus in Quebec, a referendum is 
required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Newfoundland they had a referendum and the government is 
once again stepping in to slow the democratic process and set up a 
joint committee to study the problem. 
I do not understand the logic of these people.  I would like to 
know whether my colleague from Richelieu understands it.  They want 
us to hold a referendum and when we have one, it is still not 
enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where is democracy in Parliament, in this government, in 
Canadian institutions, which are becoming increasingly spineless 
and which are increasingly branding Canada as a country with no 
ethics? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish I had a clear answer to 
give my hon. colleague. I share the concerns of the hon. member for 
Trois-Rivières. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He mentioned the dinosaurs—oops, sorry—the senators. 
Dinosaurs and senators. When I travelled through my riding last week, 
someone told me a story about senators. It went like this “How does a 
senator wink? By opening an eye.” It is odd, but it describes them well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About a year ago, I passed by a senator's office as I was walking 
down a corridor. It was 10 a.m. and the senator was at his window. I 
stopped and said “Stop looking out of your window, senator, or you will 
have nothing left to do this afternoon”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the image we have of these dinosaurs, as you called them. 
One of the dinosaurs you referred to would like to give us lessons in 
democracy. That takes the cake. 
A member of the most undemocratic institution in the world wants to give 
lessons in democracy to a province, or a legislature, that legitimately 
obtained a democratic mandate from the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two referenda were held in Newfoundland. That is still not enough. 
He comes and tells us “You in Quebec, your consensus—” Our consensus is 
based on a unanimous resolution passed in the National Assembly, where 
three political parties are represented: the ADQ, the PQ and the Liberal 
Party. I estimate that half the Liberal Party members are anglophones 
and individuals from the various ethnic backgrounds that enrich the 
people of Quebec. These members unanimously proposed, after consulting 
their communities, a number of amendments, which were approved by the 
National Assembly following further consultations at the time of the 
États généraux on Bill 109.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, we held the necessary consultations and all of a sudden an old 
dinosaur from the other place told us: “Is this a democratic 
process?” 
And he adds that when we hold a referendum on sovereignty, and we will, 
he will not feel bound by it. He is saying: “Hold a referendum, but if 
it goes through, we will not feel bound by the decision. However, if it 
does not go through, we will say that it was proper, that democracy is 
protected”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> It only works one way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> It is a one-way democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to the hon. member for Trois-Rivières, I ask myself the 
same questions on the institution, on those who are part of it, and on 
the government's true intentions in setting up a committee. Today, it 
announced the setting-up of a committee which, when you think of it, 
will only rehash the same old arguments that were raised for months in 
Newfoundland, before finally arriving at an almost unanimous conclusion. 
And the same goes for Quebec, where the National Assembly was unanimous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, why set up committees? It is probably—and I ask myself the 
same question as the hon. member for Trois-Rivières does—to pass the 
time, because the government has no political will to truly lead the 
country, to advocate new directions for the economy, and to ensure that 
the injustices created by the cuts it imposed on the provinces are 
corrected.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure as a 
young member of Parliament from Newfoundland to participate in 
the discussion on the amendment to term 17. I would like to 
emphasize a couple of points. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we speak of the amendment to term 17 in the House, we are 
also speaking to all the Canadian public.  We do so through the 
televised debates in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for 
Lac-Saint-Louis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain points which the hon. member opposite raised 
which cannot go unchallenged.  It would be unfair not to 
challenge them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was suggested that the francophone community of my province 
of Newfoundland and Labrador enjoys second class status, that it 
has accepted second class status, as alleged by the hon. member. 
He alleges that it is content with that position. I am here to 
report to the House of Commons this afternoon that the 
francophone community of Newfoundland and Labrador is very much 
alive, vibrant and very assertive about its position in our 
society.  It has done so with great power, great conviction and 
great pride. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud to report to the House this afternoon that the 
francophone community will be participating in the school board 
process.  It will enjoy the privileges and rights of its own 
school board.  That is something which is very specific and 
unique to the francophone community.  It is in celebration of the 
fact that it has a very special culture, a very special language 
which deserves recognition within the policy of school board 
governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The francophone community also enjoys its own newspaper.  In the 
riding of the hon. member for Burin—St. George's there is a 
francophone community that flourishes.  It is very much alive. It 
is not second class to anyone, as suggested by the hon. member 
opposite.  It is very much alive and very proud.  They are very 
much willing to participate in strengthening their culture.  I 
salute the francophone community of Newfoundland and Labrador.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current debate is on the amendment to term 17.  In this 
House we enjoy certain privileges, one being the privilege of 
debate.  I am proud that the privilege of debate was extended to 
the people of Newfoundland and Labrador in this argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A referendum was held in the province of Newfoundland and 
Labrador and it has been stated on several occasions that the 
debate was very clear, the referendum was very clear.  The 
conclusion of the referendum was a change was requested by the 
people of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation where we are going to change the school 
system of my province to what the wishes of the people are.  I am 
pleased to continue with this particular debate among my 
colleagues in this House and in the other place so that we can 
ensure speedy passage, a thorough thoughtful passage, because 
that is exactly what the people of Newfoundland and Labrador want 
us to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Saying that the other place has no part in this debate I think 
is fundamentally wrong.  Our Constitution recognizes the other 
place, recognizes its existence. Therefore a unilateral decision 
to say that we should not join in discussion with the other place 
is wrong.  It is important that we take into consideration all 
parliamentarians' points of views. In saying that, I take into 
consideration some great members of the other place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak of none other than the hon. Jack Marshall, a member of 
the other place who very much protected the rights, privileges 
and responsibilities of all Newfoundlanders and Labradorians.  He 
was an outspoken advocate of the rights of veterans and did a 
very good job.  I am not prepared to say that his role was in the 
least bit insignificant.  Quite frankly it was very significant. 
The people in my riding as well as those in the riding of 
Burin—St. George's understand that. I am sure if he were still a 
member of the other place he would be anxious to join in this 
debate and would provide a fruitful discussion and would add 
considerably to the context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Newfoundlander educated in the very school system that we 
now debate, and as a Roman Catholic educated in the system that 
we now debate, I support the change.  I support the amendments 
fully.  I think it is time Newfoundland and Labrador be the 
recipient of a modern education system in line with the wishes of 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel strongly that this is about the protection of rights.  I 
feel strongly that all citizens of Newfoundland and Labrador 
should be afforded all those protections.  I will give a specific 
example. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my province there are approximately 1,100 to 1,200 
communities.  Every community has a school.  Not every community 
has 20 schools representing all the major religions that are 
vested within the province but all communities have at least one 
school.  Some have three.  Some communities with small population 
levels have a number of schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where a denominational right exists, if you are a member of that 
community but you are not a member of the denomination which 
holds the school in the community, under the current system that 
we are suggesting we should amend you will be instructed in a 
religious denomination which is not your own faith. I have been 
through that system and I have seen young men and women of other 
religions, future leaders of our country, instructed in a faith 
not of their choice.  It is not because of anything we are doing 
in the House today, but because of the old system.  That is 
exactly what happened.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If you happen to be a member of the United faith or the 
Pentecostal faith in a community which only had a Catholic 
church, then you were either instructed in Catholicism or you did 
not go to school.  That quite frankly is not befitting of a 
modern day society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Religious instruction will be entrenched. There will be 
religious instruction for those who wish to participate. That is 
a fundamental right.  What will also be fundamentally guaranteed 
is that those who do not want to be instructed in a religious 
faith not of their choice will not have to be subjected to that. 
From the point of view of this House that is a very important 
consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of a modern democracy is making sure that in the case of a 
community where the majority is of one particular faith, that for 
some reason the minority is not required that they get either no 
education whatsoever or religious instruction in a faith not of 
their choice. That is just a simple point I would like to add to 
the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As someone who grew up in the system, someone who believes in 
the need for change and will be supporting it strongly, I 
encourage members opposite to think once again about the 
constitutional provisions that provide for debate by the Senate, 
to support this change and to do so in an expeditious fashion.

comment before my question.  The member has said he thinks it 
perfectly normal to have senators—he named one—, for they can be 
important individuals, distinguished citizens and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the question.  The question is: Who do they 
represent?  I repeat, and I said this earlier in the House, that I 
am going to be uncomfortable on the committee to see people around 
me who are not elected, who have been appointed by the Prime 
Minister or by a former Primer Minister, because they are sometimes 
there so long that it is not necessarily the one now in office who 
appointed them. 
These people do not represent any democratic values and will be 
questioning democratic decisions—I am coming to my question—that 
were taken on two occasions in the case before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not find it abnormal that a committee is being formed 
when we could simply pass a motion, since the issue has been 
debated several times in his province?  It could be wrapped up this

requested by the people in his own province. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question asked by the 
hon. member opposite is if I find it abnormal or unusual.  The 
simple answer is no.  The Canadian parliamentary system allows 
for two houses. Joining forces to hear testimony from expert 
witnesses in one forum is very efficient.  It is very honest and 
it is very straightforward.  I have absolutely no problem with it 
at all.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
under section 93 the Constitution requires that in Newfoundland 
or anywhere else in the country for that matter, the rights of 
the minority dissenting group are not to be prejudicially 
affected when changes are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The denominational supporters have been offered only a very 
sanitized, sterilized, neutered, generic, no name brand of 
religious class in place of the religious instruction that they 
were accustomed to in the past. Because they are basically 
offered a sociology of religion course, that does not equate to 
the provisions made for them in the past.  It seems that there is 
a negative and prejudicial effect for the Roman Catholic and 
Pentecostal church adherence. How are their interests not 
prejudicially affected? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, notwithstanding that it was 
the minority itself that chose a change, the hon. member opposite 
raised the issue that section 93 applies here.

amendment.  It is part of the terms of the union between Canada

province of Newfoundland and Labrador. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While education is a provincial jurisdiction, term 17, as it was 
formerly worded and as we are debating in the House, was a 
limitation on provincial responsibility or provincial right. We

member said he did not consider francophones as second class people and 
he is right, as was another of my colleagues who was misquoted when he 
said that the perception of people is that, when they see how 
francophones have been treated, they have the impression they were 
treated as second class people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec for example, the rights of anglophones are well 
respected, we are a model for the rest of the world.  For 
instance, an English speaking person from Quebec can be elected 
and sit in the House of Commons or the National Assembly. Three 
Equality Party members spoke only English and they sat in the 
National Assembly.  I am a francophone, I speak only French and I 
sit here.  Could a Newfoundland member speak only French, as the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  It is my duty 
pursuant to Standing Order 38 to inform the House that the 
questions to be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as 
follows:  the hon. member for Mississauga West, Airports; the 
hon. member for Frontenac—Mégantic, Closure of a B.C. Mine; the 
hon. member for Davenport, Law of the Sea.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I think this is a crucial debate. The basic issue is the 
fundamental rights of minorities. So, the basic question is the 
following: Before replacing constitutional rights with legislative 
rights, what process should we follow? I think that is the question 
before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, I have to point out the surprising differences between 
the comments made by my hon. colleague from Humber—St. Barbe—Baie 
Verte and those made by the hon. member for Richelieu, who spoke just 
before him. On the one hand, my colleague made a reasonable, sincere and 
positive contribution to this crucial debate about minorities and their 
vested rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meanwhile, what did we hear from the hon. member for Richelieu? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> The truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> That the committee currently holding hearings 
and hearing a lot of witnesses about the repeal of section 93 of the 
Constitution is wasting its time. That it has heard nothing but rubbish 
and nonsense. That the justices of the Supreme Court— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon:</B> You got that right. It is all rubbish and 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, that just goes to prove what I 
want to say, that these people cannot take part in an honest and open 
debate. Their describing the justices of the Supreme Court as people 
dressed up like Santa Claus shows the respect the Bloc Quebecois has for 
the eminent justices of our Supreme Court. That is the tone of this 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely why we need parliamentary commissions. 
We need parliamentary commissions, because we are dealing here with the 
vested rights of minorities who have the right to be heard and to ask 
for a comprehensive debate on their rights.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would like to see this pushed through 
because the three parties in the Quebec National Assembly voted 
unanimously in favour of the resolution placed before them.  I 
would point out to the members of the Bloc Quebecois that this same 
resolution denies the existence for Quebec of the 1982 
Constitution, which they themselves invoke in creating linguistic 
school boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So the minorities will have to trust a government which says 
“You are protected under section 23 of the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms, but at the same time we do not recognize that Charter”. 
These are the same people who have referred to the Supreme Court 
justices as wearing Santa suits.  That is why we need parliamentary 
commissions here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Newfoundland, at least its government will have 
had the courage to hold two referendums in a row.  Let us recall 
the debates that went on about term 17— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of us said “Let's be careful.  Let's use extreme caution 
when you talk about constitutional amendments”.  Maybe we should 
have had a longstanding parliamentary commission when term 17 was 
first debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what we did.  We pushed it through quickly.  What 
happened?  When it got to Newfoundland, the Supreme Court of 
Newfoundland said “No, no, don't go ahead with the school 
boards”, which caused a second referendum to take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know 73% of those who voted declared that they were for the 
changes proposed by the Government of Newfoundland.  That means 
also on the other side, and I appreciate all that my colleague 
has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course we need reform in the school system.  Of course all of 
us are for reform in the school system, but what we should worry 
about—I don't say that our answers will be any 
different—fundamentally is that 27% in Newfoundland, and those 
people in Quebec who come before us at the parliamentary 
commission and say “Let's use more caution.  Let's take more 
time”. Instead of that, we have declared that on November 7, for 
Quebec for all intents and purposes the committee stops its work, 
and December 5 for Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken part in many pieces of legislation, both in the 
National Assembly of Quebec and here, where we took months to 
look at legislation.  I remember the CEPA hearings on the 
environment which took over a year to decide whether we were on 
the right track or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet somehow we trivialize constitutional amendments.  We take 
them for granted.  If a majority here or a majority there 
decides, then it must be right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental reason for constitutional protection is not to 
protect majorities who can change laws whenever they want.  It is 
to protect minorities who cannot change those laws. That is why 
we need those parliamentary commissions.  That is why we need 
senators, because the fact is that senators are far less partisan 
than our Houses, whether it be in Quebec or Newfoundland or here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we need depth in our parliamentary commissions, to 
hear as many people as possible, to take more time if necessary, 
to pause, to use caution before we change the constitutional 
provision which, once gone, can never come back because the 
minorities can never reinstitute them.  The majority will always 
rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point I want to make today.  I want to ask that we 
treat these constitutional amendments, whether they be in 
Newfoundland or in Quebec, by taking all the time necessary.  I 
must admit very frankly that in Newfoundland much more care has 
been taken to involve people than was the case in Quebec. If 
another week will go by, another month will go by and another 
year will go by, this will not change the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the spirit.  I never interrupted the gentleman.  That is 
the spirit.  That is the spirit of the Bloc Quebecois.  They 
cannot tolerate another opinion.  They cannot tolerate an opinion 
that is not theirs, and they talk about democracy.  They talk 
about extremists in the parliamentary commission that is hearing 
Bill 93. I will suggest that the public will judge from the 
debate here where extremism is. 
I suggest it is not on this side.  We want a fair debate.  We 
want an open debate.  We want a constructive debate.  All we 
say is that constitutional provisions are there to protect 
acquired rights, fundamental rights and minority rights.  Let us 
take whatever time is necessary to listen to people to make sure 
once and for all that we are on the right track.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
point out to the hon. member that if you sow discord and attack members 
opposite, you should not be surprised to be repaid in kind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to say that in 1792, when the British Crown 
created the first Upper House, its members—we now call them 
senators—were appointed, not elected, and their only role was to oppose the 
decisions of the Lower House on behalf of the British Crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Things have not really changed.  The Upper House, the Senate, is 
here to oppose the measures that the establishment, and I would say the 
financial establishment of Toronto in particular, does not like.  It is 
here to oppose the decisions of elected representatives and to make sure 
that the government does not have to abide by the public will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, I have a question for the hon. member.  When we strike a 
committee, I believe we give it the power to recommend in favour or 
against.  Would my colleague agree if the committee were to return with 
a negative recommendation on the amendment requested by Newfoundland? 
How could he explain to his colleagues from Newfoundland that the will 
of the people would not be respected, when they clearly indicated the 
decision they wanted the House to make? 
In other words, are we going to have a kangaroo committee or a committee 
which might decide against the people of Newfoundland?  I am anxious to 
hear our colleague's answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that the Minister of 
Intergovernmental Affairs has answered the question very clearly. A 
committee will be struck to assess the matter, it will report to the 
House, and the House will decide after due consideration. This is how it 
is done in every committee. The committee will hear the stakeholders. It 
will review the matter, it will report to the House and the House will 
decide accordingly. The decision rests with us here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
who has just spoken has taken exception to some of my comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would remind him that he was once a member of the National 
Assembly, and I find it odd to see a member from Quebec who sat in the 
National Assembly, who experienced the quality and the greatness of the 
democratic debate there and of the consensuses that develop occasionally 
and who knows that it is only rarely that an unanimous resolution can be 
achieved, question the consultations that these members from Quebec 
carried out in their ridings to reach a consensus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But he does not know what consensus is, because when he was in the 
National Assembly and when his premier, Mr. Bourassa, introduced Bill 
178 which met the expectations of both anglophone and francophone 
communities, he and a couple of his colleagues voted against the 
consensus that existed in Quebec, and for this he was no longer welcome 
in his own Liberal Party and he had to come here to beg for a job, 
perhaps eight or ten years before he actually got elected to this House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it is typical of the Liberal Party to pick up people like 
that. The proof is that there was Mr. Harper who sat here, Mrs. 
Carstairs was named to the Senate. Clyde Wells will most likely be 
appointed one day to the supreme court. This year, they have a new 
batch: the members for Abitibi, Bourassa and Anjou, they are the Liberal 
Party's new batch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not wish to stoop to 
the level of the member for Richelieu.  What he is saying makes no 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I voted in the National Assembly according to my conscience. 
Most of the time, I voted for my party.  I also voted against it 
many times.  I have done so here.  I will continue to do so.  I 
will vote according to my conscience.  I will do so whenever my 
conscience demands it.  If that bothers the member for Richelieu, 
too bad.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
sharing my time with my colleague from Compton—Stanstead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need today for religious denominational schools like 
I have probably never seen in the last 25 years. We just have to 
come into the House of Commons and take a look at what has 
happened here.  We cannot say the Lord's Prayer for the first 
time in 131 years in the House of Commons.  I am really appalled 
that has happened here.  When that was going to happen I was on 
call-in shows from British Columbia to Newfoundland about the 
fact that the word God was being taken out of the prayer of the 
House of Commons as well as not saying the Lord's Prayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I got a call from the hon. member on the government side saying: 
“Elsie, we are going to put “God” back in the prayer tomorrow 
morning”.  And I said thank God for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just take a look at our young people and the pressures they are 
under today.  I took my two sons out of the regular school system 
in Saint John, New Brunswick.  I am Protestant but I put my sons 
into the Catholic school because they had the teachings there 
that were needed.  The peer pressure in our society today is 
unbelievable.  I am appalled to think that we would even talk 
about not allowing our denominational schools, our Catholic and 
Pentecostal schools in Newfoundland to exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that all of us in the House of Commons have received 
correspondence from the Hon. Kevin Barry, a retired judge of the 
Supreme Court of Newfoundland.  I am going to refer to the Hon. 
Mr. Barry's correspondence because he spells it out just the way 
it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is saying that the new amendment proposed by the government 
would provide for religious courses which it would compose itself 
from whatever sources it deems appropriate.  He says the only 
condition it would have to observe in so doing would be that the 
content of such courses must not be specific to any denomination. 
In effect, with that sole limitation the government would then be 
in complete charge of religious education in schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this country was built on good Christian values.  We 
have respect for all cultures.  That is why we open our doors 
here in Canada, for people to come from all over the world, and 
we expect them to respect our culture as well, which was built on 
Christianity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the Hon. Mr. Barry, there would be no obligation on 
the government to consult with leaders of the principal 
denominations or any of them.  For Catholics religious education 
for their children in school is a vital part of their educational 
development and it has been part of the school system in 
Newfoundland for the past 200 years.  To eliminate it because 38% 
of the population voted for a questionable saving in the cost of 
education would be a very grave injustice to the parents who wish 
to educate their children in a denominational school.  It was 
never intended by our forefathers that democracy would be used to 
crush minority rights in this way.

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the course of the Newfoundland government's campaign, the 
government had declared that religious education would still be 
available after the passage of the amendment.  Let me say that 
this could be no more than a pious hope on its part since term 
17 as amended provides absolutely no such guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if the proposed amendment becomes law, 
government will have the exclusive authority and control over 
religion in all schools without obligation to consult any outside 
party as to its content. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just take a look at us right here.  Government decided to move 
in and we cannot say the Lord's Prayer in the House of Commons. 
What is going to happen in the school system? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government received many requests for a judicial 
interpretation of the text of the amendment before the referendum 
vote, it steadfastly refused to consider it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It keeps referring to the fact that it is going to save money 
and that it is going to be a better school system.  As far as I 
understand it and have been told, the Newfoundland school system, 
as it exists today with the denominational schools and the other 
public school system, rates third across the country. They cannot 
do much better than that unless they come up to second and first. 
If we leave them alone in the system they probably will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government declared as one of its reasons to abolish 
denominational religious education in schools that its standard 
of pre-university education was intolerably low.  When we have a 
referendum and this is what we are telling the people, that it 
would be greatly improved by getting rid of church influences in 
our schools, I pray that we will have more church influences in 
society in the future.  I mean that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at the pages who are here today and the young people I 
see on the streets.  I look at the young people who are lost in 
my own city.  They need to have church influences.   As I started 
to say at the very beginning, they need it more now than in the 
last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that the standard of education for schools in 
Newfoundland ranks the third highest in all of Canada.  The 
government also informed the public that the cost that 
denominational schooling adds to the general system of education 
is intolerably high.  We have been informed that the cost of 
education on a per capita basis in Newfoundland is the lowest in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been hearing from our people that they are going to save 
money.  We heard from Premier Tobin that this is why we have to 
do it.  Yet the cost of their education on a per capita basis is 
the lowest in Canada the way it is now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the day it announced the referendum, Premier Tobin's 
government utilized public moneys and resources to finance and 
support its campaign to abolish denominational education.  At the 
same time, it denied any requests from the other parties for 
funding to assist them.  It campaigned as though the referendum 
was a political election.  It did not permit any scrutineers to be 
present in the ballot booths during the voting process, during 
the counting of the ballots or to oversee the measures taken for 
the scrutiny of the ballot boxes.  I have never heard tell of 
this before.  No, sir.  That is a very serious situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I am not aware of any allegations of fraud or improper 
dealings with the ballots, it is an old saying that justice must 
not only be done but must also appear to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very concerned, just like the hon. Kevin Barry is, and many 
other people.  Educated and intelligent people over there can see 
that this is going down the wrong road.  It is going in the wrong 
direction. I am in favour, as we are here, of having a committee. 
Senators should be on it because they have people there to assist 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to all members in this House to not let this happen. Do 
not go in this direction.  Think about the children.  Put them 
before politics and before anything else and keep the 
denominational schools in Newfoundland.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
torn on this issue because my background is both as a Catholic 
and a democrat.  I wish that Catholics in Newfoundland had turned 
out at the polls in numbers requisite to be able to stop this. 
However, that being said, democratic consent was sought on this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Issues have been raised in terms of whether or not there were 
scrutineers at the polls.  Unlike general elections, there were 
no people representing specific parties and there were no 
stipulated interest groups.  As a result, it was very difficult 
to determine which people would act as scrutineers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not impressed that the Government of Newfoundland did this 
during the summer, allowing only a 31-day writ period. 
Nonetheless, the people of Newfoundland have spoken.  As a 
democrat it is difficult for me to stand in the House today and 
say this provincial initiative should not be supported because 
the people of Newfoundland did indeed vote for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to propose the following.  I know this is not the 
question that the people of Newfoundland had an opportunity to 
vote on, but I wish it had been the case.  This question was 
asked today within our caucus.  Why should a parent not be free 
to choose where to educate their child without financial penalty? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am drawing attention to the idea that funding should follow 
the student, as in a voucher system.  Religious based schooling 
should not be ended to bring in monopolistic, cookie cutter 
public education under a single board.  Indeed, I wish the people 
of Newfoundland had been presented options, a whole bunch of 
choices, rather than being presented with a cookie cutter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member believe that vouchers and direct school 
funding would have been a better scenario? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member said that 
there were no political parties involved and that there was no 
politics involved.  Politics was involved, as we stated, 
concerning scrutineers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, if we take a look at the system that was put in place, the 
people of Newfoundland were not given an opportunity to digest 
what was happening to them.  They had only 16 hours before the 
advance polls from the time the question was put before them. 
There is no place in the world in which we would let that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a better system.  Perhaps the system suggested 
by the hon. member is the better system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have denominational schools and a Roman Catholic school in my 
city. The provincial Liberal government wants to close the 
denominational schools.  I fought to keep them.  We had only one 
girls Catholic school and one boys Catholic school. It is a boys 
and girls Catholic school now.  We also have one Evangelical 
school.  That is all we have, but the government wants to close 
them too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am really worried about the direction in which we are going. 
I have to say that what they are proposing is wrong. We have to, 
all of us, take a look at it for the sake of the children of this 
country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring (Edmonton East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in the House today to speak to the motion put forward by the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs.  The motion is to strike a 
special joint committee of the Senate and the House of Commons to 
consider matters related to the proposed amendment of the terms 
of union of Newfoundland concerning that province's school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee will be instructed to consult 
broadly and review such information as it deems appropriate with 
respect to this issue.  The committee is to be composed of 16 
members of the House and seven members of the Senate and must 
present its final report no later than December 5, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers recently supported a motion to strike a special joint 
committee to study a proposed constitutional amendment to the 
Quebec school system.  However, we had reservations about that 
process.  We were concerned about the extremely short timeframe 
the committee had to conduct its review and to report its 
findings. 
We also believe it was absurd to have senators who have no 
democratic legitimacy sitting on the committee.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, despite these points of concern, the members of this 
side of the House were generally supportive of the establishment 
of a parliamentary committee to study the proposed resolution on 
the Quebec school system.  Similarly, while we have corresponding 
concerns regarding this special joint committee, we generally 
support the establishment of another parliamentary committee to 
study the proposed amendment regarding the Newfoundland school 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A large number of people in Newfoundland have been demanding a 
non-denominational school system for that province for more than 
three decades.  During that time two royal commissions have 
studied the issue.  There have been endless negotiations and 
debate, several court rulings and one constitutional amendment, 
and now two province-wide referendums on the school system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many commentators have noted that a single denominational system 
will be less costly and more efficient.  The Premier of 
Newfoundland has estimated that the system will save $25 million 
per year.  Clearly this is a very important issue.  The proposed 
amendment deals with the Canadian Constitution which is the 
fundamental law of this land.  In this case Parliament has been 
asked to constitutionally amend the 1949 terms of union that 
brought Newfoundland into Confederation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party believes strongly that education is a matter of 
provincial responsibility and that provincial jurisdiction over 
education should be respected and enhanced.  Therefore, we 
neither support nor oppose church run or non-denominational 
schools for Newfoundland. We believe this is an issue that must 
be decided by Newfoundlanders by free and democratic processes 
and in accordance with the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principal interest of the federal Parliament in educational 
reform is primarily that such reforms do not prejudicially affect 
the rights of minorities which Parliament has an obligation to 
protect.  As the other speakers from my party have stated, we 
believe Parliament should discharge these responsibilities by 
making any constitutional amendment proposed by a province, such 
as the one that will be considered by this special joint 
committee, subject to these three tests: democratic consent, the 
rule of law and the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quickly review the three tests we feel must be satisfied 
if this amendment is to gain the support of the Reform Party. 
First, was there a clear majority of Newfoundlanders that 
supported the constitutional amendment through the results of a 
province wide referendum?  Was the referendum process fair?  And 
was the referendum question unbiased? The amendment was approved 
by majority in two separate referendums with the second 
referendum having an overwhelming majority of 73%.  The turnout 
of 53% of eligible voters was fairly high when compared to other 
similar referendums.  The referendum vote was conducted by 
Newfoundland Elections, the government's arm's length agency 
established to ensure fair and democratic elections. Therefore it 
appears that term 17 amendments have passed the test of 
democratic consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, is there compelling legal evidence such as an upper 
court ruling that certified the constitutional amendment itself 
conforms to the rule of law?  Term 17 of the 1949 terms of union 
is intended to serve as a replacement for section 93 of the 
Constitution Act concerning education and applies exclusively to 
the province of Newfoundland.  Therefore, it can legitimately be 
amended by the provincial legislature and the House of Commons 
passing identical resolutions in accordance with section 43 of 
the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 93 does not prevent Newfoundland from reforming its 
educational system or from implementing reforms that affect 
minority rights.  But the rule of law requires that the 
Newfoundland government demonstrate that its proposed reforms do 
not prejudicially affect the rights of those who desire a 
religious orientation in the education of their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been informed that Newfoundland's minister of education 
has obtained a legal opinion stating that the proposed amendment 
to term 17 is legal.  However, the original term 17 amendment 
proposed by the Newfoundland government in 1995 was found to be 
constitutionally questionable by the Newfoundland supreme court. 
Therefore, we are not entirely convinced that the latest term 17 
amendment fully conforms to the rule of law.  Our concerns might 
be alleviated, however, if the Newfoundland government was to 
obtain a ruling from that province's supreme court establishing 
that the proposed amendment does not prejudicially affect the 
rights under section 93 of the Constitution act.

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, is there is clear evidence that this educational reform 
does not prejudicially affect rights previously granted to the 
citizens of that province and in no way damages minority rights 
in that province or any other province? As with the proposed 
constitutional amendment regarding the Quebec school system, the 
manner in which this matter is handled may set an important 
precedent for other provinces with respect to educational reform 
as well as minority rights. Because we are not convinced that the 
latest Newfoundland amendment adheres to the rule of law, we are 
also not convinced that the term 17 amendment meets the test of 
the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to close with an appeal to any common sense that 
exists in the government to allow a free vote on constitutional 
amendments, such as the one before us on Newfoundland term 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While claiming there is strong consensus for a linguistic school 
system in Quebec, the federal intergovernmental affairs minister 
has ducked the question whether there should be a free vote in 
Parliament on the constitutional amendment. The government has 
been successful in paying lip service to the principle of free 
votes for members of the House, but it has failed to put its 
words into action.  Free votes have been few and far between. 
One of the few times members have been actually allowed a free 
vote was on the previous vote on the Newfoundland school 
question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We encourage the government to make a clear and unequivocal 
public acknowledgement of the precedents set by the previous 
Newfoundland amendment for both the Quebec amendment as well as 
the vote that is now required on the Newfoundland constitutional 
amendment. Such a declaration of support for the principle of 
free votes would remove the constraints of party discipline from 
members of the House and allow government backbenchers to vote 
without falling out of favour with the party leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members that on matters as important as changes to 
fundamental law of the land, Reform MPs will be particularly 
influenced by the opinions of their constituents and whether 
Canadians are satisfied that the amendment in question is 
democratic, legal and in the national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I ask, what will guide the MPs from other parties 
in these matters, the will of their constituents and the Canadian 
national interest or the heavy hand of party discipline? 
<P><A NAME="LINK204"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, this is quite a topical issue when we look at the news 
today and see what is happening in Ontario.  I want to put a few 
comments out for thought.  I also agree with my colleague from 
Calgary West when he speaks of a voucher system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I, too, believe in the democratic process.  The people of 
Newfoundland have spoken and we have come up with this three part 
test.  I also would encourage a free vote in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize how important education is to all of our children. 
We are setting trends for what could follow across other 
provinces.  We need to provide the best possible education we can 
for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This comes close to home for me.  In British Columbia, we face 
numerous challenges and problems within our public school system. 
I have studied very carefully the next door province of Alberta 
which has both the public school systems.  It has the Catholic 
public school board and the other public school boards. The 
taxpayers are given the option of choosing where their tax 
dollars go.  They have some choices for their children.  By doing 
so, they hold the school boards and the schools accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again it follows along the lines of if someone provided the 
student or the child with a voucher, the schools and the school 
boards would have to be accountable because they want to attract 
those vouchers to their schools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in the democratic process.  The people of Newfoundland 
have spoken, provided they have satisfied these three tests.  I 
am not convinced they have totally done that but it is something 
we have to be having a hard look at. 
We need to look beyond December 5.  It is something that is of 
provincial jurisdiction, but it is something we must all be 
thinking about for the sake of our children and their future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I too believe that it 
has the appearance that democratic consent has been met by having 
a referendum in Newfoundland to test the question. I have some 
concern about whether a majority can overrule minority rights and 
this is a minority rights issue.  I believe that good effort has 
been made for democratic consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The test not put forward has been the test of the rule of law. 
That is one test that should be implemented as soon as possible 
to clarify areas of doubt in the democratic consent as well as 
whether it affects Canadian interests.  It should have a a test 
for the rule of law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Eastern Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Reform Party.  The hon. member 
mentioned earlier that in his opinion 53% was a fairly good 
turnout for a vote of this nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the members for St. John's East and St. John's West 
earlier why they felt there was such a low turnout for such an 
important question. The response from the representatives from 
St. John's East and from St. John's West was that it was during 
the summertime, during the Cabot celebrations and many people 
felt that because there was unanimity by the members of the 
legislature in Newfoundland was the reason the turnout was low. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member honestly believe that 53%, under those 
circumstances during that time, is really a high turnout for such 
an important issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the referendum was well 
advertised.  It was well known that it was being conducted.  The 
low numbers of turnout are just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It had been well advertised.  It may have been in a period of 
time, summertime, when it is difficult for people to acknowledge 
or respond to it.  But by being advertised, we believe democratic 
consent has been given by having the referendum process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Jordan (Leeds—Grenville, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to touch on the question by the hon. member's 
colleague on the use of a voucher system or an educational system 
that makes use of empowering the user and the inherent logic in 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder, as a former educator though I may be engaged at that 
at the moment, does he not think or not recognize that there is a 
danger that the education system, by engaging in a bidding war 
and the marketing activities necessary to attract vouchers, might 
take resources away from the fundamental reason that these 
systems exist?  I do not see this type of activity aligning 
itself too closely with what is going on in the classroom.  If 
resources are scarce, is there not a danger that we might, 
through the funding mechanism, be forcing education systems into 
activities that are not in the best interests of the students? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe that having a 
voucher system may enter an element of fairness by levelling the 
field and making it more fair for the different denominations to 
have their own education system. I would not find that to be a 
problem or creating undue competition.  It would possibly improve 
the system. 
<P><A NAME="LINK207"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Parliamentary Secretary to Prime 
Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to pursue that 
question further. 
If you pursue the voucher system and all the students who receive 
this decide to transfer to another province, how will that 
catastrophe be responded to?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would consider that to 
be a hypothetical situation.  I think we are here to debate the 
Newfoundland resolution which is before us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn (Saanich—Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, my hon. friend on the other side brought up this voucher 
system question.  I know it is a little bit off the topic, but by 
empowering the students who are going to use the service, a 
minimum standard curriculum could be provided.  I believe this 
would give a much better quality of education because it would be 
market driven and it would be up to the institution to provide 
the best service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A parent may have five or six choices and would pick the 
institution which was most suitable and which would provide the 
best education.  A dollar value should not be placed on the 
voucher. It is to provide a service.  It would make the schools 
or institutions very competitive.  Again it is such an important 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Calgary West suggested that should have been 
part of the choice given to the people of Newfoundland.  We are 
setting a trend for the rest of the country.  It is such an 
important issue that we should really think it through so that we 
provide the best alternatives for our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Goldring:</B>   Madam Speaker, I concur with my 
colleague that the voucher system would have been an important 
element to have in this resolution, or to propose to the people 
of Newfoundland.  I agree it would certainly add an element of 
fairness to the educational system in Newfoundland. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. David Price (Compton—Stanstead, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I want to begin today by reading to you from the column by 
William Johnson which appeared in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> last 
week. In it he wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Removing constitutional rights from a minority is a serious 
undertaking.  Ottawa showed its contempt last year by trying to 
ram through Parliament the amendment to Newfoundland's Terms of 
Union as it affected religious control of the school boards.  The 
result was a constitutional mess, and Parliament will have to 
deal again with the issue of Newfoundland's schools. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well here we are again for a second time in as many years 
dealing with the issue. Members of the House of Commons did not 
travel.  They did not even hold hearings. The government rushed 
it to judgment and the result was, as Mr. Johnson noted, a 
constitutional mess. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am new here and I would certainly not want to make snap 
judgments.  I do not wish to insinuate that the Liberals are 
heartless and that they are acting with no regard for others.  I do 
not wish to insinuate that the Liberals are not doing a good job in 
keeping an eye on the provincial authorities and allowing them to 
do their jobs as they must.  And I particularly do not wish to 
insinuate that the Liberals have mishandled the Constitution in a 
cavalier manner. That would be to make judgments and that is not my 
purpose. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I do know is that the other place did hold hearings. 
Members of the other place travelled to St. John's.  The Senate 
wrote an outstanding report.  The chair was Senator Sharon 
Carstairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government called a snap vote late one afternoon to dismiss 
the work and the will of another house of Parliament. In fact I 
am told that voices from every part of the Chamber were yelling 
“dispense, dispense” when the Speaker was informing this House 
of the message from the other place. This House did not take the 
time to listen, to consider and today this is the result.  It is 
back before us again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are going to do something, we should do it well.  If we 
are going to amend our Constitution, we should do it right.  If 
we are going to remove minority rights, we had better be certain 
that the affected parties are heard from. It is their right and 
our duty.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take the time now to speak to the amendment put 
forward by the Reform Party.  I am currently sitting on the 
special joint committee to amend the Constitution with regard to 
Quebec schools.  The players are different but the same important 
debate remains:  the protection of minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent one week on this committee but I have to tell this House 
and the Reform members who sit on this committee with me that I 
value the role the senators have played so far.  The other place 
does more than provide sober second thought.  The other place 
provides expertise. Whether it is the Constitution, human rights 
or education itself, the other place shares with a committee 
experience that is far reaching. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are speaking of is amending Canada's Constitution. This 
is serious business.  Reform should understand how serious this 
is and should support the other place's role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 3, 1896 Sir Wilfrid Laurier made what some consider his 
best speech.  He spoke in defence of minority rights in Manitoba. 
At second reading of Bill 58, the Remedial Act, Wilfrid Laurier, 
who was not yet prime minister, asked, “Is the government 
impelled by the desire of doing justice to the minority?”  He 
continued, “In a community with a free government in a free 
country like this, upon any question involving different 
conceptions of what is right or wrong, different standards of 
what is just or unjust, it is the part of statesmanship not to 
force the view of any matter but to endeavour to bring them all 
to a uniform standard and a uniform conception of what is 
right”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>None in this House approach Sir Wilfrid Laurier's eloquence and 
leadership, but today's Prime Minister need not be eloquent.  He 
need only ask himself whether an amendment to term 17 is 
necessary to achieve the provincial government's stated intention 
of reforming the educational system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sir Wilfrid Laurier knew so long ago that rights are aimed at 
limiting and domesticating state power in attenuating its 
outcome.  Does this Prime Minister understand what Laurier 
understood? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast to the Unitarian point of view in which the ends 
justify the means, human rights offer an ethical approach setting 
constraining limits on authority.  As expressed in a letter dated 
May 27, 1996 from Archbishop Francis J. Spence, president of the 
Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops, to the Prime Minister, 
the primary responsibility of the Government of Canada is not the 
reform in Newfoundland's education system, which all parties 
agree is necessary, but the protection of minority rights under 
our Constitution from the arbitrary action of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution and the charter can either be worthless pieces 
of paper or very real and binding instruments of guidance.  A 
true standard.  Whether these documents will be one or the other 
does not depend on governments alone. It is up to all of us to 
determine how seriously these guidelines will be taken, how they 
will be implemented and made real. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary to recall these documents that guide Canadian 
society and try with new energy to ensure that the government 
acts according to their spirit.  Governments must accept the 
indivisibility of human rights and respect constitutionally 
entrenched minority rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Newfoundland terms of union are enshrined in the Canadian 
Constitution.  Premier Tobin appears to no longer respect those 
terms.  The Prime Minister appears to accede to a historical 
approach to public policy making.  Together they appear 
disrespectful of the rule of law and delicate balance that must 
accompany a state's intrusion into a matter expressly outside its 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the will of the popular majority been a safe haven for 
safeguarding the rights of the minority?  No it has not.  Nor 
indeed has the majority's will always been when one considers the 
history books and the many clashes between minority and majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is precisely why Reform Party's policy of blind adherence 
to government by referendum is seldom in the true public interest 
and hardly ever in the interests of legitimate minority 
interests. There are some issues that legitimately require 
majority action and others which lie outside the proper arena of 
majority determination.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Majority rule implies a great deal about civil rights, such as 
free speech, free assembly and free association.  I might add 
that the word majority means major part, and so connotes the 
presence of other parts in one as several minorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some would say that minorities constitute the margins of 
society.  Others would say that minorities are the practical 
manifestations of a society's ability to accommodate and provide 
safe alternatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than build on Canada's proud heritage and respect for 
minority education rights by extending rights, perhaps to the 
francophone minority in Newfoundland, Premier Tobin and the Prime 
Minister have actively pursued a diminution of minority 
safeguards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His Eminence G. Emmett Cardinal Carter in writing to the Prime 
Minister on May 21, 1996 said:  “I am disappointed, like many 
Canadians, because I took you at your word and the Liberal Party 
is a party of principle and a champion of minority rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take no pleasure in drawing to the attention of the House the 
following curious examples of political leadership.  On March 12, 
1993 just before an election, the then premier of Newfoundland 
made a statement in the House of Assembly:  “In response to the 
church leaders' concerns that implementing certain 
recommendations of the royal commission report would jeopardize 
their traditional rights, government has assured the leaders that 
it is not seeking change to the Constitution that would remove 
the constitutionally protected rights of classes of people 
specifically provided for”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's great advantage over other nations is our tradition of 
diversity which was born of the historic necessity of English and 
French speaking Canadians working together and which has 
blossomed into a basic respect for the multitude of cultures 
which make up Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian tradition has been one based on the obligations of 
history and respect for cultural, religious and ethnic 
minorities.  That tradition is in a certain degree of peril with 
this latest incursion into the Constitution to strike down the 
valuable education rights of the religious denominations in 
Newfoundland. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating again the Newfoundland schools 
issue.  It is an issue which the government seems to slip in and 
foist upon the House without due notice.  I must say it certainly 
caught me by surprise that it was going to be discussed again 
today. I find that most disturbing because I think that the issue 
itself is an issue of significant importance not only to 
Newfoundland but also to Canadians from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning my leader gave an outstanding speech on this matter 
in the House.  We would do well to listen to the cautions that he 
raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He suggested three things.  He proposed three tests which should 
be considered before any constitutional amendment is passed by 
the House.  The three tests which he suggested are the test of 
democratic consent, the test of the rule of law, and the test of 
the Canadian national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would first like to take a look at the test of democratic 
consent.  He asked questions about that.  Was there a clear 
majority result from the referendum respecting the term 17 
amendment?  He asked if the referendum process was fair and if 
the question was unbiased. I have a lot of problems with the 
whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read into the record some of the problems that 
Harold Flynn, president of the Newfoundland and Labrador Catholic 
Education Association, printed in an advertisement in the Ottawa 
<I>Citizen</I>.  He noted that the government's conduct during the 
referendum compromised the democratic process.  He said:  “We 
urge you to consider all the facts before making a decision”. 
The first point that he asked us to look at was this. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT75"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first point read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendment will bring about profound social change in 
Newfoundland, and deprive denominational minorities of the same 
religious education rights that are currently enshrined in the 
Constitution. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get on to this point later in my speech but he has raised 
an important point, the legality of the issue.  The second point 
read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The referendum was announced only on July 31, leaving too little 
time for thoughtful analysis and informed debate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The text of the proposed Constitutional amendment was not 
presented until August 24, precluding an opportunity to consider 
its merits and implications. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government spent significant amounts of tax dollars to promote 
the YES side, but refused public funds to those with different 
views. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those points he raised question the validity of the process 
used.  It is important to note that if we are to conduct 
referendums; if we believe in the referendum process; if we want 
the referendum process to solve certain issues whether the issue 
be capital punishment, the abortion issue or so on; and if we are 
to use the referendum process, we must ensure the process is run 
fairly and there is no bias built into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By allowing for as little time as was allowed for in this vote 
it precluded thoughtful analysis of the issue and precluded 
honest debate.  The fact that the government financed one portion 
of the debate is not healthy in a referendum process.  If the 
government is proposing a referendum it should leave the 
discussion of the issue and the financing of the matter to the 
citizens.  It is wrong for the government to involve itself in 
the debate in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next point read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government has allowed voters to cast their ballots outside their 
electoral districts, increasing the opportunity for electoral 
abuse. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And the next read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government refused to allow scrutineers at polling stations, 
denying advocates an opportunity to observe the voting process to 
ensure that it was fair and democratic. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Flynn went on to note: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We regard the Canadian Constitution and its safeguards as a 
sacred compact.  We believe the procedure to change it must be 
equally sacred—especially when they affect minority rights and 
referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By exploiting this referendum “mandate”, the provincial 
government plans to subordinate the rights of religious 
minorities to the tyranny of the majority. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not agree more with what Mr. Flynn noted in this talk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last point he raised is another point raised by the Leader 
of the Opposition this morning, the test of the rule of law.  It 
is important to address that issue.  Inherent in that test of 
responsibilities is that the government has to protect minority 
rights, and it is something that it has not done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addressing that particular issue I think it is worth noting 
section 93(3) of the Constitution in particular: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where in any province a system of separate or distinct schools 
exists by law at the union or is therefore established by the 
legislature of the province, an appeal shall lie to Governor 
General in Council from any act or decision of the provincial 
authority affecting any right or privilege of the Protestant or 
Roman Catholic minority of the Queen's subjects in relation to 
education. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That statement puts a heavy burden on the government.  It means 
that the government cannot change the Constitution with regard to 
education rights willy-nilly.  It must reflect carefully on its 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Newfoundland entered into Confederation in 1949 the terms 
of the union gave special protection to the Newfoundland 
denominational schools.  The protection given in term 17 of the 
terms of union was in addition to the general protection of 
denominational schools given in section 93 of the Constitution of 
1867, what has always been known as the British North America 
Act.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment of the Constitution of Canada proposed by the 
Government of Newfoundland before the House today would remove 
the special protection negotiated in 1949.  More than that, it 
would exempt Newfoundland from the general protection found in 
section 93.  That section applies to all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amendment would remove the protection available to all 
other Canadians.  In one fell swoop Newfoundland would go from 
giving the best protection to its minority denominational schools 
to giving the least. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Section 93 makes the federal government a guarantor of minority 
denominational schools, which means the federal government has a 
responsibility in the matter of minority denomination schools. 
This Parliament has responsibility to protect minority 
denominational education.  It cannot simply allow the 
Constitution to be changed in that manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beyond that particular point of law is the next point addressed 
by the Leader of the Opposition this morning:  how this would 
affect other Canadians.  This point is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ted Byfield in a recent column in <I>The British Columbia 
Report</I> noted that it is one of Canada's current ironies that 
the kinds of schools the Government of Newfoundland is 
desperately trying to institute and make compulsory people in 
other parts of Canada are trying just as desperately to escape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A series of questions have to be asked here.  Who will educate 
my children?  That is a key question.  Who will be responsible 
for educating my children?  Will it be the government, the 
teachers' union, a committee of the school or me, the parent? Who 
will be ultimately responsible for educating that child?  Who 
will ensure that the values I teach my child at home will not be 
undermined when I send my child to school? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Newfoundland wants to move toward a public school system, a 
government run school system that tries to say somehow or another 
it can teach values without teaching them, that somehow it can 
instil in my children the kinds of values I want them to take 
into life, and that it can do it without doing it. That sounds 
almost contradictory but that in fact is what it wants to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is wrong.  I have a particular set of values that 
deals with things important to me.  Those things might be my 
views on the abortion issue.  They might be my views on same sex 
marriages.  They might be my views on any one of a number of 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my child goes to school my values should not be undermined. 
The religious values I may want to teach my child are not 
contrary to the laws of the land.  They are values that have long 
standing in the community, at least 2,000 years. They are values 
I hold dearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In saying that I am not setting myself up as some kind of 
paragon of virtue.  Far from it.  The only perfect man died 2,000 
years ago.  You and I know that quite well, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that I try in the best way I can to instil 
in my child some values that I think worth while.  I do not want 
to send my child to a school where those values would be 
undermined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the province of British Columbia that can happen and that 
bothers me greatly.  In Newfoundland's current system there is 
choice within the community.  One can pick a Catholic school, a 
Pentecostal school or one of the unified schools. 
I think that choice should be expanded.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The supreme court recently heard a petition from some 
fundamental Christians in Ontario who wanted to have some 
government funding to support their schools.  That was denied.  I 
think denying that is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parents should have the ultimate authority on how they spend 
their money, on how they educate their children.  That authority 
should be issued to them with a voucher.  They should have the 
right to pick the school they want to educate their children in. 
There should be no questions asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bothers me greatly to see the legislation before the House. 
In my view the government is treating lightly its responsibility 
to protect denominational schools under the Constitution.  Not 
only that.  It is trampling on my rights and the rights of the 
citizens of Newfoundland to educate their children as they see 
fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raise another point.  I feel somewhat reluctant to do it but I 
will do it anyway.  It has to do with the trend in our society, 
the news media in our society and other factors in our society. I 
feel somewhat awkward raising the issue.  I do not want someone 
asking who this guy thinks he is.  As I said before I do not 
pretend to be perfect, but it bothers me greatly to see the 
continual beating up the Christian community has taken by the 
media and by the government in bringing forward the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could cite example after example, which I will do.  The first 
example of government beating up on the Christian community is 
the bill.  It is as clear to me as the sun rising in the morning 
that the bill is somehow simply denying people the right to have 
their children educated the way they see fit, and that way may be 
the Christian way.  It bothers me that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could skip out to British Columbia to take a look at what has 
happened with the British Columbia College of Teachers.  It is 
denying Trinity Western University, a fundamentalist Christian 
university, the right to train teachers for the public school 
system.  Trinity Western University requires that its students 
take an oath to abstain from homosexual activity and to abstain 
from premarital sex, in other words to support a clearly 
Christian agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the college of teachers, the taking of that oath 
should disallow that university from training teachers because 
teachers who have made a commitment to living up to these 
Christian ideals are somehow unfit to teach in the public school 
system of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is absolutely outrageous.  It bothers me greatly to 
think that could happen in this country.  If that were a Muslim 
or a Sikh university I do not think we would see that action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another example of this beating up of the Christian 
community reflected in the bill.  It is the comments of the new 
host of the popular CBC Radio talk show <I>Morningside</I>.  He 
said “The Catholic Church is the largest criminal organization 
in the world after the Mafia”.  Michael Enright is the host who 
took over from Peter Gzowski.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot fathom for an instant how a man could make that kind of 
comment, an outrageous statement like that, and then be allowed a 
place on a radio station in Canada, and not only that, a publicly 
funded radio broadcast.  It is absolutely unbelievable that 
statement was made, and yet it happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way the CBC conducted itself during this debate, it forgot 
for example that the first hospice for AIDS patients in the world 
was founded in New York by Mother Teresa.  CBC does not mention 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's national newspaper, when it reported on Mother 
Teresa's death, spent most of it's column beating up on her 
rather than acknowledging that this woman had lived a truly 
Christian life and tried to help people who were suffering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It beat up on her for a number of issues.  It beat up on her 
because she was opposed to abortion and it beat up on her because 
she espoused the beliefs of her church and practised them like 
most of us could not begin to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CBC did that.  The Toronto <I>Globe and Mail</I> did that and 
during the debate on this Newfoundland schools issue, the CBC 
twice aired the show <I>The Boys of St. Vincent</I>, a program 
which had to do with problems that occurred in the Catholic 
school system, in the boarding school system in Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know it happened.  You know it happened.  Everybody knows that 
happened, but there is an issue here that seems to be forgotten. 
When somebody steals from the collection plate, you 
don't blame the church.  You blame the individual who stole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the CBC wants to do is when something goes wrong, it 
wants to blame the church.  That is reflected in this bill.  The 
key fundamental problem with this bill is that it denies parents 
the right to educate their children the way they want to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundamentally it denies the Christian community in Newfoundland 
the right to educate its children and to see that its views and 
beliefs are not undermined by the school system.  I am talking 
about fundamentalist Christians, I am talking about Catholics, I 
am talking about the Christian community in Newfoundland.  That 
is what this bill is about.  It undermines that very right.  That 
is why it is wrong. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Maurice Vellacott (Wanuskewin, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
during the course of the afternoon we have heard on numerous 
occasions the fact stated that there was something in the way of 
a better system in Newfoundland, that various church groups were 
dragging their feet and slowing up the system so that this could 
be occurring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to dismiss some of those myths and refer to some of those 
things that are actual fact from the Newfoundland situation. Time 
and again it has been asserted by people that the Roman 
Catholics, Pentecostals and others were seeking to frustrate the 
process of educational reform, how necessary it was and yet being 
blocked by these obstinate people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Premier Tobin made that point on numerous occasions, that they 
were trying to prevent this from occurring.  The truth is that 
those groups, the Pentecostals, the Roman Catholics, willingly 
embraced reforms that came along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They entered into dozens of joint service arrangements and 
consolidated and closed scores of schools.  They co-operated with 
the government in the reduction of school boards from the 
original 267 down to the present number of only 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today 90% of Newfoundland communities have a single school 
system and only 10% have more than one system, so considerable 
changes have occurred with regard to reform over the last while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have no objection to the government operated provincial 
school construction board.  They accept that school bus reform is 
necessary, that school councils will serve a useful purpose, that 
school boards may be fully elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For many years governments in that province have set the 
curriculum.  They have trained and certified teachers, and until 
it unwisely abolished them, they also set and corrected public 
exams. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1750"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these groups want to protect?  They have not been 
standing in the way of reform. They simple want the right, as has 
been stated by many others here, to bring up their children, send 
them to schools where their own faith values are pre-eminent. 
That is a bit of a prelude. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to pass on to the test which was mentioned by our leader 
this morning, the test of democratic consent, and offer some 
suggestions as to where it may be suspect or found to be lacking 
with regard to the whole matter of democratic consent. Was the 
question a fair one?  Was it clear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members may be aware that this question was developed by the 
Newfoundland government's public relations firm and was one of 
several potential questions subjected to some mini polling and 
focus groups to try to massage it to the point where it came up 
with a question that would ensure a certain outcome of the vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question also referred to a preference for a single system 
where all children would attend and where religious education is 
taught.  Of all the children in Newfoundland, 90% are presently 
in that kind of system.  Therefore Roman Catholic, Pentecostal 
and integrated children have access to a program in their own 
faith if there is sufficient demand. That was the question and 
the people believed they were voting yes to preserve this system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On July 30, 1997 single school system was defined by the premier 
as a Christian school system.  One month later, seven days before 
the actual vote, one day before the advance polls, a single 
school system had been redefined as a public, non-denominational 
school system and religious education had become not necessarily 
Christian but general.  In the three days before the Labour Day 
weekend there was insufficient time to address the fact that the 
question now meant something entirely different than originally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question fails to address the real issue.  Voters want some 
constitutional rights of parents to choose separate schools 
removed.  It is my belief that this was not a fairly worded 
question.  There were some shenanigans which took place in the 
last days which did not give people time to properly address the 
question before them.  As a result they voted in favour of a 
prior question stated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend 
for that comment.  I think he has hit the nail on the head, that 
there was a lack of clarity in the question asked. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, if we are going to promote the idea of a referendum in 
this country, especially if we want to use a referendum to change 
the constitution and if this is a minority rights issue we have 
to be double certain that the referendum is conducted in a fair 
and honest way and that the question asked is clearly understood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue goes beyond simply a referendum.  The heart of 
the matter is the responsibility the government has to protect 
minority rights.  The question here is larger than a bilateral 
change of the Constitution between the federal government and 
Newfoundland.  When section 93 is changed, we are talking about a 
change that will affect Canadians elsewhere.  It will have an 
impact on the separate school system in Ontario and across the 
country.  That is a key issue.  The government cannot treat this 
matter lightly.  It has to be doubly certain that what it does 
will not undermine our Constitution and the faith that we should 
have in it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Elinor Caplan (Thornhill, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
been listening to the debate and the question I have for my 
colleague is whether he visited Newfoundland and spoke to people 
there. It is my understanding that 53% of the population 
participated in the vote, a majority of the population.  Of those 
who voted, 73% voted in support of the change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also know that within the legislative assembly it was a 
unanimous vote.  Even those who have constituencies where they 
represent the minorities who have expressed concerns about the 
change supported it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the members who are speaking in opposition to this 
if they went to Newfoundland, as I did, and asked the people in 
Newfoundland how they felt about this.  If the member did not, 
how could he possibly object to a legislative committee hearing 
that will allow people to come forward and express their views? I 
believe that is the appropriate course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is 
yes, I have been to Newfoundland on many occasions.  Yes, I have 
talked to people from Newfoundland on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the fundamental issue that my friend across the way is 
ignoring is the conduct of the referendum itself.  The fact that 
the turnout was 53%, more than half the population, in a sense is 
appalling because it is not a huge turnout.  Why that is I do not 
know.  What I do know is that the referendum was not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, the first referendum was most appalling.  In fact, 
the government gave out information, made commitments in the 
brochures and whatnot that it sent out in support of its 
position which were clearly untrue.  That again is appalling. It 
is appalling behaviour on behalf of the government and it gets to 
the fundamental issue here.  It we are going to use referendums 
we had better make darn sure that we conduct those referendums 
properly and that we ask clear questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this House cannot criticize referendums which take place 
in Quebec if fuzzy questions are asked.  We have had the 
experience in Newfoundland and supported it unfortunately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about conducting referendums, the issue goes far 
beyond this one matter here.  It goes to the bigger issue of 
another referendum in Quebec. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to speak to this motion today and the amendment, 
particularly, brought in by the leader of the Reform Party 
earlier this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment a bit about the process that we are now 
entering into.  It is interesting for me to listen to the party 
that has made quite a truck and trade with the referendum issue 
now not only endorsing the referendum idea but also pointing out 
the cautions and care that must be taken when one uses 
referendums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often during campaigns and when the blood is running fairly hot 
and furious, people will say that the Reform Party wants a 
referendum every other Thursday.  It wants to decide everything 
under the sun by referendum.  That of course has never been the 
role or the proposed role that the Reform Party has had in mind 
when we talked about the use of referendums.  We have always said 
that referendum is the best and most exact way to go to the 
people for their input on legislation and in order to let them 
have a direct say in a direct democracy way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that does not mean that we can run roughshod over 
minority rights.  That does not mean that it should be a sloppy 
question.  It does not mean that governments should use their 
considerable power and ability to spend money to try to stack the 
vote, to get the vote out or to do all kinds of unusual things, 
last minute changes and amendments.  All those things have been 
brought up on this side of the House today as precautions, things 
that when one uses referendums one has to be careful with. It is 
not something where we want someone with a sparkle in their eye 
and a good glib line to come out and just say maybe we can swing 
the country over this way and do something outrageous.  That was 
never the intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that people are paying attention to the fact that 
referendums, properly used, are a very good indicator of the 
people's will.  However, the key is the proper use, the judicious 
use of the question itself and the whole thing that surrounds it. 
That is why we have these particular amendments that we are 
dealing with today.  That is why we say that this should not go 
forward unless it has proven the test of the democratic consent. 
In other words, was the question fair?  Was adequate notice 
given?  Were both sides or all sides taken into account when the 
question was put?

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason we say that and want this in the motion is because we 
were assured by the Newfoundland government that this was all 
done during the first referendum.  Yet there were some problems. 
People said it was not that clear.  It was not all that it should 
have been.  Maybe it did not pass the rule of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have put these three amendments today. We want to 
make sure the democratic consent has been properly handled.  We 
do not want a rubber stamp that says send it to the House and it 
will do as we say.  Let us examine the whole thing.  That is why 
it is in this motion.  By all means send it to committee and let 
us examine it.  We do not reject it outright, but we want to 
examine it in its entirety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to make sure that the rule of law has been 
followed.  The rule of law protects minority rights from the sort 
of thing I have been talking about.  It makes sure that somebody 
through with a good line and a promise to save you a dollar does 
not run roughshod over the rights of others.  “Just vote for 
this and I can guarantee it”.  It gets passed quickly and people 
come back later and say “My goodness, which rights did we 
trample on?  What have we done here?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once that amendment is made we have something that is very 
difficult to change, as it should be.  We want to make sure that 
if it is changed it passes the rule of law.  That is why we want 
and would have preferred to have had the Newfoundland government 
refer this to the supreme court for a ruling before it proceeded. 
It should determine if it prejudicially affects the interests of 
minorities, not just an opinion of a legal firm.  We would have 
liked to have had the court say “Yes, we have examined this and 
the rule of law has been carefully guarded with regard to 
minority rights”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not convinced that a Senate-House of Commons committee is 
the best place to hear this.  Increasingly the government has 
tended to use the Senate to introduce bills.  Four or five bills 
have been introduced in the Senate.  We are quite annoyed that 
the Senate is hearing bills which should properly come through 
this place, the place of the common people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A motion like this that gives added legitimacy to the Senate, 
when its legitimacy is probably at an all-time low, is a mistake. 
That is why in the amendment we suggest that it should be placed 
here before the people in this common house in order to discuss 
the issues of the common people.  It should not be sent to the 
house of lords where they have an appointment for life and a 
pension to boot. We find that offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The true democratic act is to put it before the people who are 
accountable to their constituents.  The people who are 
accountable are the members of this House.  They are not in the 
other place where the only accountability is to the party which 
sent you there.  That is not accountability.  That is a parking 
spot.  This is why we would rather have this changed to bring it 
before the House for resolution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also like to see a free vote on this.  It was mentioned 
by an hon. member opposite that it passed the Newfoundland 
legislature unanimously.  That is encouraging.  I am sure the 
committee will take that into account. I can guarantee that it 
will not be unanimous in this place. Members of all parties will 
carefully weigh this before they vote yea or nay for a variety of 
reasons, some of which have been brought out by the member from 
Delta—South Richmond and others who have pointed out flaws in 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very least we should be entitled to on an issue of this 
magnitude is a free vote.  We cannot be all powerful and all 
knowing.  We are not the great and wonderful Oz.  We are people 
who bring different points of view to the discussion.  We have 
had different discussions with people from Newfoundland and other 
groups that are concerned.  We should be encouraged to have a 
free vote on all sides of the House so that we can get a true 
perspective of our constituents' feelings, if they have strong 
feelings, as well as those of the people of Newfoundland.

what a referendum process should look like.  There are various 
foibles or landmines, as it were, which can happen during the 
referendum process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A referendum does not solve all problems.  It is part of a 
process of several steps in gaining democratic consent, looking 
after the national interest, protecting the rights of minorities 
and protecting the rule of law.  This amendment is supposed to do 
all of those things.  I believe it will do it very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members, in a free vote, to support the 
amendment, move on to the main motion and send this off to 
committee where we can do a better job, not only here, but as the 
amendment indicates, we will be able to travel to the province of 
Newfoundland to deal with it there, with the people who are most 
affected.  Let us not just talk about it here, let us go to the 
people who will be affected by this and hold public hearings to 
get their input.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Anders (Calgary West, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
a tough question for my hon. colleague.  I wonder if he finds it 
strange that both the Liberals and the Tories find all sorts of 
problems with the propriety of the referendum.  They say there 
were problems with the democratic consent and that the Government 
of Newfoundland far outspent its objectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think back to the 1992 Charlottetown accord.  The federal 
government at that time outspent objectors 13 to 1 and yet lost 
the referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like my hon. colleague to comment on the fact that the 
Liberals, and especially the Tories, are questioning the 
democratic consent and the propriety of a referendum in which the 
government severely outspent its objectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, sometimes members of the 
Reform Party have a certain satisfaction at having been on the 
right side of the Charlottetown accord.  There is a certain 
satisfaction in knowing that we were on the right side of the 
democratic consent.  The people of Canada, if they are given 
enough time and information, and in some cases a political 
vehicle, will decide on the right side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a wonderful thing during the Charlottetown accord to see 
people for probably the first time in a lifetime actually 
discussing the Constitution of the country.  It was a beautiful 
thing.  It was the first time in my life that anyone had said: 
What about this provision?  What about the Senate?  What is its 
role?  How can it be improved?  What about the number of seats? 
Should certain provinces have a veto? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was a wonderful thing to openly discuss that without any 
fear.  It was a wonderful way to get public input and to educate 
people. It was a good process.  Those were the days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of questions with respect to the referendum 
which was held in Newfoundland.  Why were there two referenda? We 
were promised that the first one would be the referendum to end 
it all.  Everything was done properly.  Why then did we need the 
second referendum? It is not a matter of referenda until we get 
the answer we want. It has to be done right at the outset. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying it should not be referred to and examined by a 
committee.  That is the question that should be asked in 
committee.  That is the question that should be taken to the 
people of Newfoundland for consideration.  That is the question 
on which we should have a free vote.  It is not that it is right 
or wrong, but it is a question that deserves to be put. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has already been mentioned by an hon. member, after all of 
the publicity and all the brow beating, only 53% of the people 
came out.  I wonder why that is.  I am not from Newfoundland, so 
I do not know.  I would like to travel there to find out. 
Was there a problem with the process? Perhaps not. Perhaps 
everyone is happy with it.  In that case we probably will hear 
that in spades when we travel to Newfoundland.

will be educated, I question that only half the people thought it 
was important enough to cast a vote. That is why the question was 
raised on this side of the House. That is why our amendment deals 
with this idea of going to the people, checking it out in 
committee by asking all these questions that have been laid out 
in the amendment so that we can do it properly, do it right and 
do it only one time instead of coming back and rehashing it 
again. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to make two points relating to my friend's 
comments.  The first one is that opposition to or support for a 
particular point of view in a referendum cannot always be bought 
and sold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The classic case in point was in British Columbia during the 
Charlottetown referendum where Rafe Mair influenced a great 
number of people with his comments on that issue.  I think it 
would be very difficult to put a value on it.  But the concern 
that we have is that if the government is getting in there, 
supporting somebody on one side or the other, that it is unfair 
and that is just not the way it is supposed to be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point that my colleague from Fraser Valley made is 
worth repeating.  It is the notion of a free vote on this matter. 
That is very important.  If we are going to make constitutional 
change we do not want any hint that somehow or other the result 
happened because of a political deal, that it was a backroom deal 
by the political elite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue must be a free vote.  We must insist on a free vote. 
In a matter of this kind we have to stand up and let our 
constituents know just where we stand on it.  We should not be 
hiding behind a party whip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the observations of my 
colleague from Delta are right. I just hate to come right out and 
say it.  Referendums cannot be bought easily but referendums can 
be massaged, depending on how it is put to the people, the timing 
of the vote, the wording of the question, last minute changes, 
release of new information, all those things.  One could jack 
that around, especially the time factor, if one does not give the 
time required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Overall the referendum process is a good way of getting a 
barometer of people's feelings on a particular issue.  They need 
information, the pitfalls and so on to make sure that the 
referendum is fair and above board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I think the member from Delta is concerned 
about a free vote is because a little too often people are 
shuffled off from this place.  They go to become premiers of the 
Atlantic provinces, where the cards and the chips are called in 
at that time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The caution here is, why is it when members are part of the 
government side, they then go on to the happy hunting ground, 
taking their pension with them and become maritime premiers. We 
have had three of them now.  They continue to roll back here. 
They continue to say “How is it going, how is the old boys club, 
is there anything else we can do for you?  I will tell you this. 
You give us the HST and we won't complain.  You give us a billion 
dollars and we'll shut up”.  All that stuff starts going on. 
Pretty soon we question even something like this referendum 
result.  After all, it was the former fisheries minister who 
wandered off and became the premier, but I wonder if he is still 
tied in any way to the government side?

the reasons why many of us say let us go to the people of

their children to these schools and we will take them at face

</I></B></P><P align=left>The whip for the Reform Party has asked for a free vote on this

<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
about three weeks ago I asked a question in this House of the 
Minister of Transport with regard to what are commonly referred 
to as the curfew hours operating at Pearson international 
airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question was can the minister confirm that there are 
guidelines restricting the hours of operating at Lester Pearson 
international airport and can the minister assure the citizens of 
Mississauga that the government will not allow the GTAA to 
unilaterally change these hours.  I would like to point out the 
fundamental reason for asking that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past summer, there were some tests conducted by the GTAA 
that were referred to in the media as secret tests. They were 
tests of planes flying in the hours that would generally be 
considered restricted hours, say between the hours of 12.00 am 
and 6 a.m. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These tests were conducted without any prior notification of the 
residents, the city or myself or anyone else.  The purpose of the 
tests was to see if the noise actually did bother people at that 
hour of the night.  I can say that it did.  The results were 
quite conclusive and the people were upset that tests were done 
in what was seen as somewhat of a clandestine fashion, a 
secretive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason that I asked the minister the question, to the 
parliamentary secretary who is here to respond to this concern, 
is that the citizens of Mississauga have had a longstanding 
relationship obviously with Pearson international airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concerns about increased traffic, increased noise, the lack 
of proper hush kitting on some of the older jets that are coming 
in, the concerns around the increased traffic in the area of 
cargo are very real for the citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I clearly recognize the significance of Pearson 
international airport as an economic engine within the GTAA, 
an employer, a taxpayer, a job creator, there is no question that 
it is a significant facility within the GTAA and within the city 
of Mississauga. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There must also be recognition by the people at the GTAA, by Mr. 
Turpen, by the entire staff and the board that there has to be 
some way to live in harmony with the citizens who reside within 
the boundaries of the city of Mississauga, particularly in the 
area around the airport. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reason for asking the question and my concern is to ensure 
that the citizens can live with some reasonable assurance that 
there will not be an increase in night flights and that the 
curfew area or the restricted operating area will be respected by 
this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the parliamentary secretary can also address the concern 
of the expanded cargo coming into Pearson with some reference to 
the usage of the Hamilton airport and other facilities around the 
GTAA to ensure that we do have an economic infrastructure that 
works solidly within the community, to the benefit of the 
business community, but at the same time allows the citizens to 
have a reasonable night's sleep during those hours.

would ask the parliamentary secretary to respond with particular 
emphasis, if he could, on the area of the increase in— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Parliamentary 
Secretary to Minister of Transport. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my short answer to the hon. 
member for Mississauga West would be yes.  The constituents in 
his riding, in Mississauga and the greater Toronto area, can rest 
comfortably.  There will be no unilateral changes to the night 
flight hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I give some detail to the hon. member.  The government has 
been taking positive steps to bring Canada's transportation 
system in line with our nation's needs as we move into the 21st 
century.  These actions have been designed to promote safety, 
efficiency, affordability, service integration, innovation and 
commercialization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national airports policy is a major initiative that has 
shifted the federal government's role in airports from owner and 
operator to landlord and regulator.  Among the responsibilities 
transferred to the new airport authorities is the responsibility 
for the management of noise in the vicinity of the airport and to 
provide a forum for consultation with the local community on 
matters of aircraft noise within the community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government maintains an oversight role in noise 
issues by keeping the final approval authority for the mandatory 
noise operating restrictions and noise abatement procedures 
published in the <I>Canada Air Pilot</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These regulations and procedures are not guidelines but are 
mandatory and have the force of law.  Airport authorities 
including the Greater Toronto Airport Authority cannot 
unilaterally change the published night flight restrictions, but 
they do have the authority to grant exemptions and extensions on 
the same basis as was practised by the department prior to the 
transfer of responsibility to the GTAA.  The department does not 
intend to change these restrictions at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to exemptions and exceptions, as owner and operator 
of the airport Transport Canada previously managed a regulatory 
regime which permitted exemptions to normal hours of operations. 
This was to allow for the unforeseen circumstances such as 
weather delays, air traffic control delays, some delays as a 
result of mechanical problems and emergencies, and for some 
operational or other reasons when quieter aircraft were used.

Saturday, November 1, LAB Chrysotile, a limited partnership led by Jean 
Dupéré, will close the 110 year old BC asbestos mine in Black Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three hundred workers will lose their jobs; 82% of them are over 50 
years old, and 36% are over 55. These 300 workers have an average of 27 
years of experience at the mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mine closure is catastrophic for the Thetford and Black Lake 
area and for the whole MRC. It must be understood that 300 layoffs in 
Thetford and Black Lake is the equivalent of 7,000 layoffs in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three weeks ago, the BC mine workers committee met with the 
assistant deputy minister of human resources development for the 
province of Quebec, André Gladu. On behalf of the Minister of Human 
Resources Development, he proposed three active measures to the 
committee, namely targeted wage subsidies, training courses and what was 
formerly known as self-employment assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have to admit, as I do, that these three measures are 
definitely not enough to help our workers. It is not realistic 
considering the age of these workers. 
It is not realistic also because of the current economic context in the 
asbestos industry.

the federal member is to provide for, to plan an improved POWA, a 
program that the human resources development minister himself abolished 
on March 31, 1997. In May, for five weeks, the community of Thetford 
Mines saw no less that nine ministers and the Prime Minister. They did 
not really come to visit the region as tourists. They came very 
regularly, so often in fact that their limousine drivers became familiar 
with all the short cuts to the asbestos region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is strange; the human resources development minister has been as 
silent as the grave since we have needed him on the issue of asbestos. 
Consequently, I wish to inform him officially that on Wednesday, two 
days from now, about a hundred mine workers will be here, in the House. 
If the minister cannot go to Thetford, the Thetford workers will come to 
him. But it is still quite surprising that, during the election 
campaign, he found time on two different occasions to come and beg for 
their votes.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

Canada has been working to assist the affected workers of the 
British Canadian mining plant for quite a while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the mine temporarily shut down in 1995, representatives of 
HRDC did everything possible to help affected workers, including 
becoming involved in the implementation of a joint 
reclassification committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, approximately 50 workers took advantage of this 
work stoppage to start their own company and to avail themselves 
of training opportunities, thus improving their employability. 
These workers have not returned to work at the mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though the plant closure is imminent, representatives from 
the department have been working to address this for a long time 
now and are meeting the needs of affected workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government appreciates that losing one's job is not easy, 
especially when someone has held their position for decades, as 
is the case for most of the British Canadian Mining plant 
workers.  However the Government of Canada wants to assure them 
that everything will be done to help them get through this 
difficult time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To prove this, an important meeting between representatives of 
HRDC and those of the company and the union was held at the end 
of September to clarify what we intended to do. Particularly, 
HRDC has assured concerned mine workers that it would show 
flexibility in the delivery of the following active employment 
measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is using targeted wage subsidies. Thanks to self-employment, 
employment insurance eligible participants who have a viable idea 
to start their own business can be eligible for financial 
assistance, planning assistance and for continued support while 
they set up their business. The mesures uniques de formation 
consolidates all the training purchase measures, including the 
fee payer component. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, the Government of Canada has not let the 
British Canadian mine workers down. For example between 1990 and 
1992 HRDC provided funding assistance of almost $3 million to 
help maintain employment at this mine.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after 
advocating and working hard for years, Canada was one of the 
first nations to sign the law of the sea in 1982 yet we still 
have to ratify it.  Meanwhile fish stocks all over the world, 
including cod on our east coast and salmon on the west coast, 
have been decimated by overfishing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has committed in the red book to ratify. The 
joint committee reviewing Canadian foreign policy recommended 
ratification in its 1994 report.  In 1994 and 1995 the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs said in the House that ratification was 
imminent.  But on April 29, 1996 the Minister of Foreign Affairs 
linked the ratification of the law of the sea convention to the 
precondition of ratifying another agreement on highly migratory 
and straddling fish stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that this tactic is flawed because the 
ratification of the law of the sea is the necessary first step to 
restore Canada's credibility. 
Once our credibility is restored, the straddling stock agreement 
may gather the momentum it is lacking now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here are the reasons in favour of ratifying the law of the sea 
first: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One, the law of the sea contains strong provisions for marine 
and fishery conservation that are far reaching, including 
provisions that set the stage for our efforts to conserve 
straddling stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two, the law of the sea contains sustainability principles and 
their application to oceans, such as the precautionary principle; 
the polluter pays principle; the principle of adjacency, which is 
the one that communities closest to the resource have not only a 
right to the resource, but also an obligation to nurture it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three, at present because we have not yet ratified the law of 
the sea, Canada is left out of important organizations and talks 
related to fisheries management and conservation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know there are two major threats to marine ecosystems. 
One is overfishing and the other is the impact of human 
activities such as oil spills, destruction of estuaries and 
coastal zones, industrial air pollution, and the production of 
nutrients, pesticides and other materials that run off the land 
and pollute the oceans. The law of the sea deals with these 
problems whereas the agreement on straddling stocks deals with 
them only incidentally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, article 66 of the law of the sea sets out the state 
of origin concept for anadromous species, which Canada 
effectively argued in the recent west coast dispute. 
Interestingly, Alaska is now complaining about Russian 
interception of Alaska bound salmon using the same argument. This 
opens new avenues for Canada to generate the support of other 
nations also worried about interception and honouring quotas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, it is worth mentioning that at the recent summit of 
the sea conference in St. John's, Newfoundland, participants 
drafted the summit of the sea challenge which included, as one 
may guess, a call on the Government of Canada to ratify the law 
of the sea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 1, I asked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs when Canada will ratify the United Nations 
convention on the law of the sea.  Unfortunately he did not have 
time to complete his answer.  Tonight I hope it is a positive 
one.  The time has come for Canada finally to ratify the law of 
the sea, considering the fact that 1998 is the international year 
of the ocean.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
who has worked so hard on the law of the sea and environmental 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The timing of Canada's ratification of the United Nations 
convention on the law of the sea must be placed in the context of 
Canada's broader policy regarding high seas fishing.  The 
Canadian government remains committed to the ratification of the 
convention.  Canada has signed the convention and as such is 
committed to respect its object and purpose.  Before ratifying 
the convention however we need to ensure that an effective 
international high seas fisheries enforcement regime is in place 
to protect fish stocks which straddle Canada's 200-mile fishing 
zone and the adjacent high seas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is currently engaged in a number of initiatives aimed at 
putting such a regime in place, the most important of which is 
early Canadian ratification and entry into force of the UN 
agreement on straddling and highly migratory fish stocks.  This 
agreement fills gaps left in the law of the sea convention 
relating to high seas fisheries management.  It considerably 
strengthens the convention's provisions on the conservation and 
sound management of straddling fish stocks.  Canada played a 
leading role in the negotiation of this agreement and its 
ratification is our immediate priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian government is also continuing its relentless 
efforts to reform and strengthen the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries 
Organization, NAFO.  We are determined to prevent any future 
abuse of the NAFO objection procedure which led to overfishing of 
NAFO quotas.  We are also developing a strategy to ensure the 
construction of a comprehensive enforcement regime in the NAFO 
regulatory area beyond 1998.  This is essential to the viability 
and sustainability of the many important groundfish stocks in the 
northwest Atlantic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also examining the usefulness and feasibility on the one 
hand of negotiating bilateral fisheries enforcement agreements 
with flag of convenience states and on the other of seeking 
provisional application of the straddling stocks agreement prior 
to its entry into legal force, on a reciprocal basis with 
like-minded countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although Canada has not yet ratified the law of the sea 
convention, we continue to play a very active role in 
multilateral fora dealing with law of the sea issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The motion to 
adjourn the House is now deemed to have been adopted. 
Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 10 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.39 p.m.)
