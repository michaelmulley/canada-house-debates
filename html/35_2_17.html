<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="FLATTAX">FLAT TAX</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party embraces a flat tax. This is at a time when multimillionaire 
Steven Forbes has been rejected even by the far right of the United 
States in his attempts to convince the American people the logic of 
this tax.
<P>
	A tax which would lower taxes to those earning more than 
$200,000 while increasing the taxes of already overtaxed middle 
class people earning between $35,000 and $65,000 is the agenda of 
the Reform Party. Robin Hoodism in reverse. Taking from the less 
wealthy and giving to the wealthiest is the agenda of the so-called 
Reformers.
<P>
	What else would a flat tax do? It would not tax interest. The 
banks will be very supportive. It will eliminate lower rates of 
income taxes for small and medium size businesses. So much for 
the Reform Party's job creation programs which will reduce small 
business employment while lining the coffers of financial 
institutions.
<P>
	Reform thinking on flat tax is the same as those who thousands 
of years ago believed in a flat earth, the neanderthals of tax reform.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SENTENCING">SENTENCING</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
whatever happened to truth in sentencing of criminals? In Canada 
unfortunately the most obvious truth about prison sentences is that 
they are a fiction.
<P>
	For instance, section 745 allows criminals sentenced to life 
imprisonment the eligibility for release only 15 years into their 
sentence. It is a sure bet for criminals because 78 per cent of those 
who apply for parole under section 745 are granted early release. 
Using section 745, child killer Clifford Olson can apply for parole 
in August this year.
<P>
	I speak on behalf of a growing majority of Canadians who 
believe that early release should only be considered for truly first 
time non-violent offenders. Canadians are telling justice officials 
to bring back the principles of truth in sentencing. You do the 
crime, you do the time.
<P>
	Clearly section 745 must be repealed. On behalf of Canadians, I 
urge the justice minister to do so without delay.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="LABRADOR">LABRADOR</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
prospective privatization of services at the Five Wing Base in 
Goose Bay, Labrador will be a needless blow to Labrador. These 
are not the policies of careful and responsible economic 
management that the economy of Labrador so needs and expects of 
the federal government.
<P>
	Liberals and Reformers have a lot of buzzwords for downsizing 
federal government services. Whether we call it privatization, 
commercialization, contracting out or alternative service delivery, 
it all boils down to the same thing: fewer jobs, lower pay, fewer 
benefits and greater insecurity.
<P>
	The Liberals have called on the private sector to be responsible 
employers and to do its best to provide steady, secure employment. 
Behind this rhetoric the Liberals themselves are mimicking the 
worst corporate offenders with their self-defeating downsizing.
<P>
	New Democrats join with the citizens of Labrador in demanding 
a federal government that sets an example of responsible economic 
citizenship.

	<B>Mr. Andrew Telegdi (Waterloo, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the outstanding volunteer efforts of Mr. Frederick 
Harttrup of Waterloo.
<P>
	Mr. Harttrup, accompanied by his wife Olive, recently travelled 
to Trinidad to advise a government owned forestry company on 
production techniques and total quality management.
<P>
	Mr. Harttrup made recommendations pertaining to log supply 
and quality, sawmill flow systems and layout and the operation of 
the saw show and the planer mill.
<P>
	Mr. Harttrup is one of 7,000 Canadians who have volunteered 
their time through CESO International Services. Since its founding 
in 1967, CESO has been providing volunteer advisers to businesses 
and organizations in Canada's aboriginal communities, developing 
countries and emerging market economies in central and eastern 
Europe. CESO volunteers are skilled Canadian men and women, 
usually retired, who willingly share their lifetime of practical 
experience with those who need it.
<P>
	To Frederick Harttrup and to all the CESO volunteers, we 
express our appreciation and we send them our thanks.

	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, March 21 is the first day of spring. It is also the 
international day for the elimination of racial discrimination.
<P>
	This year's symbol for this day is the crocus, the first flower of 
spring and the symbol of a fresh start. This campaign encourages 
Canadians to break free from the darkness of ignorance into the 
light of tolerance and respect.
<P>
	Thirty-six years ago on this day a peaceful march against 
apartheid in Sharpeville, South Africa turned into a massacre. All 
too often since then this tragedy has been repeated in different 
Sharpevilles around the world. These incidents may not always kill 
the body but racial discrimination destroys the soul and the 
self-esteem of the victim.
<P>
	We in Canada take for granted our peaceful lifestyle, our 
reputation as a kinder, gentler nation. Yet we have our own less 
violent Sharpevilles in many parts of Canada. Each time we deny 
the cultural reality of our neighbour, denigrate his language or her 
costume, we commit an act of discrimination.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANARMEDFORCES">CANADIAN ARMED FORCES</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week my colleague from the Okanagan brought forth 
a motion to encourage this Parliament to think carefully about how 
it defines sedition. This was precipitated of course by the 
outrageous actions of the Bloc defence critic who invited members 
of the armed forces to switch their allegiance in the event of a yes 
vote. This was not a job offer. This was an invitation to desert the 
Canadian Armed Forces.
<P>
	Canadians have expressed disbelief that a government could 
tolerate such an offensive and potentially dangerous act. 
Attempting to undermine the loyalty of the armed forces is 
completely beyond the pale in a democratic country.
<P>
	The Liberal government tried to ignore this matter and it watered 
down the Reform motion to the point where it had no teeth. If the 
defence minister had been doing his job, this matter would not have 
required a special intervention.
<P>
	We hope this has served as a wake-up call to this government.

	<B>Mrs. Eleni Bakopanos (Saint-Denis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
tomorrow marks the International Day for the Elimination of all 
Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is a day for Canadians to reflect 
on the harm racism causes in our communities and to think of what 
we can do to make Canada a more tolerant society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	At this time last year, I really believed we had made progress in 
this area. However, the racist remarks and accusations made by the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="961"> 961 </A></B>
<P>
Bloc and the PQ during the referendum, and especially those 
uttered by the former premier of Quebec, have only increased 
racial tensions in  Quebec. Worse yet, the new premier of Quebec 
never distanced himself from his predecessor's racist comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Part of the solution is admitting that you have done something 
wrong. By refusing to apologize for their behaviour the Bloc and 
the PQ are saying that it is okay to make remarks like this and that 
people will eventually forget anyway. I have not forgotten and I am 
still waiting for an apology.

	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in 1996, the economic, scientific and political reality of 
the Francophonie is 49 countries on five continents.
<P>
	France is the only one of those countries whose only official 
language is French. Elsewhere in the francophonie, French is only 
one of the official languages.
<P>
	In this context, it is up to French speaking countries to give 
French, a favoured communication tool, the place it deserves in all 
areas of human activity, at both the national and the international 
levels. Even if it is generally recognized that, in America, Quebec 
is a beacon for the Francophonie, we are also aware that the 
Francophonie extends beyond Quebec's borders.
<P>
	It is with respect that we salute our cousins in the francophone 
and Acadian communities. We pay tribute to their courage and 
determination in fighting for their rights, despite the provincial and 
federal governments' anaemic political will to recognize in real 
terms the equal status of French in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Mauril Bélanger (Ottawa-Vanier, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today is the Journée internationale de la Francophonie. This day is 
celebrated each year with many activities and festivities that 
highlight the diversity of francophone communities across the 
country.
<P>
	Today is also the second day of the Semaine nationale de la 
Francophonie organized by the Association canadienne 
d'éducation de langue française or ACELF. This is a great 
opportunity to recognize the important contribution made by 
francophones to Canada's linguistic, cultural and economic 
vitality.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament of Franco-Ontarian origin, I am in a 
good position to note the full extent of francophones' contribution 
to society in Ontario and Canada. Ottawa-Vanier boasts many 
organizations that mirror the strong francophone presence outside 
la Belle Province. I am thinking in particular of the Ottawa  campus 
of La Cité collégiale, the University of Ottawa, the many primary 
and secondary schools for francophones and immersion students, 
the Centre francophone de Vanier, the Richelieu service clubs, the 
Patro in Lowertown, Montfort Hospital, the regional ACFO, the 
Caisses populaires, and so on.
<P>
	I urge all French-Canadians to be proud of their mother tongue 
and to contribute to its development.

world must realize how much social and human damage is caused 
by racism and segregation, at home as well as elsewhere in the

own affairs before preaching to the rest of the world about 
respecting human rights. These are extremely serious accusations.
<P>
	What explanation does the Prime Minister have for the fact that 
he has still not kept his promise-despite its being down in black 
and white in the red book, that book he is waving in our faces in the 
House all the time-to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act to 
include sexual orientation among the prohibited grounds for 
discrimination?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first of all, I would point out to the Leader of the 
Opposition that his researchers ought to have checked out the red 
book, because that is not in it. It is a commitment I made myself 
during the election campaign, in a letter, and one I intend to keep.
<P>
	We have been in government for a scant two years and a half. 
This year we passed legislation protecting the rights of the 
individual with respect to sexual orientation in the Criminal Code. 
A bill was passed and another is in the makings. Its time will come. 
It is our intention to keep this promise, which was not in the red 
book. As the Prime Minister has promised it, it will be done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, here we are now with the theory of throwing out crumbs to 
the people. ``One crumb now, and perhaps another before the 
elections''.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister explain the hesitancy of his 
Minister of Justice, if not by saying that his own caucus is deeply 
divided on this question?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, many issues are raised in the House, and each bill is tabled 
in its own time. Priorities must be set and our legislative agenda 
must be organized.
<P>
	As I have just said, one bill on the subject has been passed in the 
last twelve months. When the time is right, we will be introducing 
another in the House. However, in theory, we still have more than 
two years, seven months and four days before we have to call an 
election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that seems a long time to the Prime Minister. He appears 
to be counting the days until it is over. We do not want to wait those 
two years and some months and some days for an answer. People 
are waiting. The human rights commissioner has asked the 
government to move quickly on this.
<P>
	Given that the Prime Minister admits this was one of his 
promises, will he make a formal commitment to settle this matter, 
not only before the next general election but within a few 
months-which may be two ways of saying the same thing?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have nothing more to say. I have indicated the 
government's position and a bill will be brought to this House 
before the next elections.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in its 
annual report, the Canadian Human Rights Commission issues a 
warning with respect to a Supreme Court ruling that, under certain 
circumstances, persons charged with sexual assault should have the 
right to consult the therapeutic records of victims.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Given that the Criminal 
Code has already been amended to prevent accused from 
cross-examining victims on their sexual past, is it not appropriate 
to follow this up and bring in legislation making it illegal to consult 
the medical and therapeutic records of sexual assault victims?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for the question. This is an issue that has 
come before the courts in a number of court decisions.
<P>
	The Minister of Justice in his capacity as attorney general has 
intervened on these issues. This is a matter now under consultation 
and review to see if legislative clarification is needed in light of 
Supreme Court decisions on these disclosures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
talking about decisions already handed down, not those to come. 
Since the Minister of Justice always relies on the courts to make the 
law for him, does the Prime Minister not think that by holding up 
the passage of effective legislation, he is creating a category of 
victims that will be forced to choose between disclosing their 
<P>

<B><A NAME="964"> 964 </A></B>
<P>
therapeutic records and accusing their attacker, or  keeping their 
records confidential and dropping their complaint?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
indicated, the Minister of Justice continues consultations in this 
regard with different individuals and groups interested in this 
question.
<P>
	He is reviewing this for possible legislative change. Certainly it 
is a very difficult issue. One must on one hand balance the rights of 
the accused to a full answer and defence while on the other hand 
ensure victims are properly protected in the trauma of trials they 
need to go through.
<P>
	This is a matter under review. An answer will be forthcoming.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while federal ministers have been jetting around the 
country trying to convince Canadians of the virtues of a $30 billion 
deficit, the separatist government in Quebec has embraced the need 
for deficit elimination.
<P>
	Mr. Bouchard is apparently committing himself to eliminating 
the provincial deficit by 1999 or earlier, after consultation with 
business leaders, labour leaders, federalists and separatists, all of 
whom have told him this is necessary for a Quebec economic 
recovery.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister be convening a get together, a summit 
meeting of Canadian economic leaders to establish a firm date and 
a plan for eliminating the federal deficit and strengthening the 
Canadian economy?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have a plan in the red book which was approved by the 
Canadian people in the last election. We are right on target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have the spectacle of the federal government's being 
now the only senior government left in Canada not committed to 
deficit elimination.
<P>
	This is not just embarrassing to the House, it is a national 
disgrace and it is also dangerous to the cause of national unity. 
Once again the federal government is letting Quebec separatists get 
out in front on an issue, this time fiscal responsibility, which effects 
the attractiveness of federalism and national unity.
<P>
	When will the Prime Minister set a firm date for deficit 
elimination? Is he prepared to let this slide and play catch-up with 
the separatist Government of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. leader of the third party should read the 
newspapers. Since the budget the Minister of Finance  produced the 
Reform Party has had virtually nothing to say against the budget.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	The market has reacted very well. Because we are following our 
target and not trying to talk about the year 2010 and so on, we have 
a goal of 3 per cent for this fiscal year. The interest rate went down 
by three points during the last year.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance had set a target of 2 per cent for the year 
before and as usual he will do better than his target.
<P>
	I think the question of managing the finances of the country is 
handled pretty well by this government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am really talking about the connection between the fiscal 
position of the Government of Canada and the unity issue. Once 
again the Prime Minister is not looking far ahead.
<P>
	In order to win the next contest with the separatists the federal 
government must be, not appear to be, fiscally stronger and more 
fiscally responsible than the separatist Government of Quebec. It 
should be ahead on deficit elimination, it should be ahead on debt 
reduction and it must be ahead on tax relief if it is to win that 
contest.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that by dragging his feet on 
these three issues he is weakening the federalist position even 
before the next contest with the separatists begins?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if we were to rely on the leader of the third party to keep 
Canada united we would not be very secure.
<P>
	I am amazed when I listen to the leader of the third party talk 
about presenting a budget and meeting our target. We heard some

ours but it chickened out.

<P>
requested by Mrs. Harel and all the stakeholders currently gathered 
in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we said, and I said that the funds allocated to manpower 
training, earmarked for manpower training, will be transferred to 
any provincial government as soon as an agreement can be 
negotiated.
<P>
	Regarding all the active measures developed by the federal 
government to create jobs across the country, using the UI fund or 
government funds, these are federal programs under the Canadian 
Constitution and they will remain under our control. But as far as 
manpower training is concerned, I am prepared to sign it over 
tomorrow morning. The problem is that, any time we give an inch, 
they want a mile.
<P>
	Just yesterday, the president of the Conseil du patronat, which is 
part of the consensus, indicated that the consensus was about 
manpower training. We respect the consensus and we are prepared 
to transfer responsibility for manpower training to the provinces 
tomorrow morning, provided the funds really go to providing 
training to the unemployed.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime 
Minister should be better informed. All morning, participants at the 
conference have been saying very clearly that what Quebec is 
asking for is control over all active measures. I therefore ask my 
question again.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister prepared to make a commitment to 
recognize the Quebec consensus and negotiate the transfer of all 
active manpower training policies and relevant budgets 
accordingly?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

they are at it. It is an active measure aimed at the unemployed. As I 
said, as far as manpower training is concerned-the bone of 
contention that has been used in this House for months now-we 
are prepared to transfer the related funds to the provinces, and we 
are waiting for them to come forward.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the current environment minister was in 
charge of immigration he spent $20,000 of taxpayers' money 
producing a booklet that could best be described as the Liberal red 
book, part two.
<P>
	This booklet quotes from the red book on at least 43 separate 
occasions and is even entitled ``Creating Opportunity''. The only 
difference between this booklet  and the red book is that the 
taxpayers had to pay for this copy.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister believe that having the taxpayers pay 
for the red book, part two, is an example of the honesty and 
integrity he promised to bring to government in the red book, part 
one?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, they use the red book in the House of Commons in every 
second question. I guess it is a good document.
<P>
	I have nothing to add to what the minister of immigration said 
yesterday about this.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the former minister of immigration produced 
this booklet despite objections of the bureaucrats in his department. 
It was destroyed by the current minister of immigration because in 
her words it was inappropriate.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister live up to the promise of the red book, 
the original version, and restore a little honesty and integrity to 
government by instructing the Liberal Party of Canada to 
reimburse Canadian taxpayers for the cost of this Liberal 
propaganda exercise?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the minister replied to this question yesterday. When she 
joined the department she decided she wanted to change some

<P>
	Yesterday, the minister stated in this House that consultations 
were under way on the setting of marine service fees. But yesterday 
in Montreal, the commissioner of the coast guard was intransigent 
in refusing to make any changes to his new proposal.
<P>
	Since the commissioner showed no intention of listening to the 
concerns of St. Lawrence stakeholders and simply defended his 
own fee setting plan, does the minister recognize that the 
commissioner of the coast guard is not holding a real consultation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this issue has to be taken in its overall context.
<P>
	I think everybody in the House would agree this is not a simple 
business of deciding on a maritime service fee for all of the 
country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="966"> 966 </A></B>
<P>
	There are a number of options. One was to consider a port 
specific fee structure, but that would not work. Another was to 
consider a national system, but that would not work either.
<P>
	The system we have now considered in this iteration of the 
consultation really looks at three regions: the Pacific, the Atlantic 
and the inland and Laurentian region.
<P>
	If the hon. member says the commissioner of the coast guard was 
not responsive to suggestions, I have to remind him that no fewer 
than 300 people and parties were listened to. The marine advisory 
board has regular consultations with him. He is going on now to do 
more iterations and consultations. While he may not have given on 
major points yesterday, the purpose of the consultations is to have 
one more round before we go into effect.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>]

	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 
minister made a commitment to table impact studies in this House.

the coast guard admitted that the studies mentioned by the minister 
would not be completed before September, while the new fee 
structure would take effect in July.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	How can the minister justify the coast guard's imminent decision 
on the basis of studies that will be carried out after the new fee 
structure comes into effect?

<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is not doing anything to contribute 
to the ease of the particular system.
<P>
	When we are dealing with something this controversial and 
complex across the country and we want to do it within a 
reasonable timeframe, of course there has to be feedback. The 
feedback takes place during the process of consultation, as the hon. 
member knows. He is smiling at me.
<P>
	The imposition of the fees we were hoping would be done by 
April 1; however, it would appear we will not be able to do it until 
June. The $20 million collected on April 1 will now be later than 
that and every month that goes by we will have to collect more.

she said it was not to be distributed and she had her own reasons for 
doing so.

the election and it will again defeat the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
question is who is paying for that red book?
<P>
	The current minister now knows exactly why she shredded them. 
They were nothing more than partisan. Maybe we will at least give 
her credit for knowing that it was wrong and that something 
smelled about it.
<P>
	The reasons are not good enough. I ask the minister that she 
stand up and answer to it. The former minister knew he was 
breaking the rules when he made the document. His departmental 
officials told him he was breaking the rules. His cabinet successor 
was so concerned about it that she tried to destroy the evidence.
<P>
	As I said before, not all of the evidence was shredded and I have 
a copy which I am willing to table.

	Canadians thought this kind of political sleaze belonged only to 
Brian Mulroney, but it has hung over to this Parliament.

Mohawks in Kanesatake is going very well. Ten houses are still 
occupied illegally. Necessary action was taken and formal notices 
were sent to squatters on December 21, 1995.
<P>
	This is an internal issue which concerns the community itself. 
The community has a management housing board which must 
make its own decisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary says it is an internal problem. In the 
meantime however, Hydro-Québec is suffering a loss.
<P>
	I feel that the government purposely refuses to settle the issue. 
Since it is incapable of taking its responsibilities and settling the 
issue of illegal occupants in Kanesatake, could the government, as 
trustee responsible for aboriginal people and as owner of these 
homes, at least pay those hydro bills until the issue is settled? 
Hydro-Québec should not have to suffer the consequences of the 
federal government's carelessness.

	<B>Mr. Bernard Patry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

First, will the $400 million the hopper cars are worth be realized? 
Second, who will be the prospective purchasers? Third, will the

Ontario, and will it protect the ports in Vancouver, Prince Rupert,

Varennes, that the federal government was cutting off its funding 
on March 31, 1997.
<P>
	Does the minister realize, and I hope she does, that by 
withdrawing funding of $7.2 million from the Varennes tokamak, 
she will be depriving Quebec of the only major long term energy 
research project that might benefit the province?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am sure the hon. member knows  that difficult 
choices have had to be made within all programs and all initiatives 
of the government. AECL is no exception. Its budget was reduced 
by one-third in the budget the Minister of Finance announced two 
weeks ago.
<P>
	The priority for AECL in the coming years is to develop an 
export market for Candu reactors. Difficult choices have to be 
made. That is not to suggest this science is not good science. It is 
not to suggest that the people who have done it are not good 
scientists. It does suggest that in this difficult time choices have to 
be made, priorities have to be set and priorities have to be delivered 
on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
speaking of financial choices, I wonder about the minister's 
financial logic in this case when we know that shutting down 
activities at the tokamak facility in Varennes would mean the loss 
of 20 years of development in the field of fusion and $70 million in 
infrastructures, including $11 million in new equipment that will 
never be used, and above all, the loss of approximately one hundred 
jobs in the high tech field in Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I suggested a moment ago, choices have to be 
made, priorities have to be set. Fusion is not an energy priority for 
the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> We've noticed that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLellan:</B> I would like to remind the hon. member that my 
department has created a new research facility in Varennes that 
delivers on the government's priorities of renewable energy and 
energy efficiency.

	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 12,000 people of 
Haitian origin live in Papineau-Saint-Michel. Coincidentally the 
new minister for spending money in Haiti, Pierre Pettigrew, is 
running in the byelection there.
<P>
	First, Pierre toured Haiti, then he picked up a $24 million tab for 
Haitian peacekeeping and spent several million taxpayers' dollars 
on aid to Haiti. Now he has arranged for the president of Haiti to 
visit Montreal this weekend.
<P>
	Is the government prepared to tolerate this blatant influence 
peddling just to win a single byelection?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are very happy that for the first time democracy is 
working 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="969"> 969 </A></B>
<P>
in Haiti. The president decided to  come to Canada. I will be 
delighted to receive him in Ottawa Saturday.
<P>
	We are doing our best to restore good government there. The 
United Nations and the United States have asked Canada to take 
over the role that the United States had there some months ago. I 
am very proud that the people of Canada are willing to help the 
poorest people of the world who live in Haiti.
<P>
	If the president decides to come this weekend, we are not going 
to tell him to go back home until after the election. There is no 
connection at all.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Your nose is getting longer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> There was none.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Saint-Maurice):</B> There was none. Of course, all 
the Reform Party members can ask that question. The people from 
Haiti who live in Montreal have the good sense not to vote for the 
Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the people of 
Canada are sick and tired of old line political patronage. Pierre 
Pettigrew has done everything except hand out free tickets to 
Montreal Canadiens' games in an attempt to win the byelection.
<P>
	Also very interesting was his decision not to invite the Prime 
Minister to visit, but instead concentrate on more locally popular 
politicians like the Haitian president.
<P>
	When the red book talked about governing with integrity, did 
that include unelected government ministers having a blank cheque 
to influence elections?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to inform the Reform member that the President of 
Haiti is taking a trip outside his country. He has decided to visit the 
Dominican Republic, the U.S. government in Washington, and the 
Canadian government in Ottawa.
<P>
	He was not likely to alter his itinerary to accommodate the 
problems of the Reformers. As I have already said, moreover, 
Montrealers of Haitian origin have sufficient judgment not to vote 
for the Reform Party, despite its trying every trick in the book to 
gain a few political points while dwindling away more each day 
from the Canadian political scene.

are a mirror of Canada's history and Canada's values. It is very 
important that they be maintained.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	The traditions of our reserve force must be kept. Later this 
summer, I shall be reflecting on this matter, on the commission, on 
the House report, on the Senate report. In doing so, I should be 
mindful that the disbandment of units must be kept to a minimum, 
that control of the local armouries must be given back to the militia 
units and that there should be more people in the reserve and not 
less.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
their red book the Liberals promised stable multiyear financing for 
the CBC. When Mr. Manera was appointed, the Liberals promised 
that there would be no more cuts other than those imposed by the 
previous government.
<P>
	On November 22, Mr. Beatty stated that any new cut to the CBC 
would lead to a change in its mandate. Well, the budget slashes the 
CBC's funding by $150 million.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Given what Mr. 
Beatty said in November, is the minister in the process of altering 
the CBC's mandate through the budget, that is to say, through the 
back door and without public debate?

	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage upheld the CRTC's direct to 
home satellite policy which is so anti-competitive that not even the 
Prime Minister's son-in-law could make it work.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I would ask members to please stay directly on 
the issues and go to the administrative responsibility of whatever 
minister is involved rather than going off on side issues. I would 
ask the hon. member to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> This dramatic flip-flop occurred 
right after Power DirecTv decided that it wanted to throw in the 
towel.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. What happened to 
the Liberal government's policy of competition in the direct to 
home industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am amazed that the 
member of the Reform Party has the gall to stand up and ask that 
question in the House when the government, in previously 
amending the Broadcasting Act, suffered such derision from the 
Reform Party. If the member wants to talk about flip-flops, the 
flip-flops are on that side of the House.
<P>
	At the moment two companies are licensed to offer direct to 
home, Power Corporation being one of them. A third company is 
ready to come into the arena very soon.
<P>
	In not turning back the decision of the CRTC, the government 
believed, as the CRTC believed, that the people who are currently 
receiving cable in their homes should not have to subsidize the cost 
of the high technology of the new direct to home instruments. 
Current television users should not be subsidizing technologies that 
may be coming in. It should be paid for by the people who want to 
bring in that technology.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that answer 
just is not good enough. Competition in this country is being 
thwarted and stopped by that government policy. It has to change.
<P>
	Other people support that position such as the Friends of 
Canadian Broadcasting. The British and Australian governments 
have made representations to the government saying that the 
current policy should change. The International Federation of Film 
Producers has threatened to take Canada to the World Trade 
Organization because of this type of attitude. Also some Canadians 
do not agree.
<P>
	The government knows of these objections. Why is it continuing 
a policy that was brought about by the CRTC?
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, part of our mandate as the 
Government of Canada is to defend Canadian consumers and not to 
defend American television producers and British and Australians 
who may be making representations.
<P>
	In fact there are currently two companies that have an intention 
to proceed, including Expressvu and the Power Corporation. There 
is a third company that has just recently received a letter from the 
CRTC to hear its application.
<P>
	The message of the CRTC is that Canadians who are currently 
watching television on cable lines they have paid for through their 
cable subscriptions should not have to cross-subsidize satellite 
television. If you want satellite technology, you pay for it.

told that this government is saying that our rights are not a priority 
any longer.
<P>
	Is it clearly the commitment of the Prime Minister that a bill will 
be introduced and passed in this Parliament before the next 
election? This would keep the promise the Prime Minister made in 
writing in July 1993 which I quote: ``The Liberal Party of Canada is 
firmly committed to banning discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation''. Is that clearly the commitment of this Prime Minister 
in this Parliament?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if the hon. member had been in the House at the beginning 
of question period, I replied to that question. I said a bill will be 
introduced. We passed legislation on that matter in relation to the 
Criminal Code a few months ago. The bill amending the human 
rights act will come eventually but not at this moment because we 
have other priorities. It is part of the program. We have passed one 
bill already and the other one will come in due course.

	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will no doubt recall that during question period the 
hon. member for Red Deer, I believe in a question accused another 
member of this House of influence peddling. Influence peddling is 
a serious accusation in the Criminal Code. That kind of accusation I 
suggest cannot be made directly or indirectly in the House.
<P>
	Citation 481(e) of Beauchesne indicates that a bad motive cannot 
be imputed to another member. Citation 487(1) indicates that 
threatening language is inappropriate. Citation 487(2) says that 
indirect accusations are just as inappropriate as if they were made 
directly.
<P>
	This language must be withdrawn. It is not appropriate for such 
language to be used on the floor of the House against any member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would remind 
the hon. party whip that the person I suggested was doing this is not 
a member of this House. As he is not a member of this House, I

<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, as I mentioned earlier in our debate, I 
would ask you to be very cognizant of the words that you use in this 
House. Both in the questions and in the answers some words tend to 
be more inflammatory.
<P>
	I listened to the debates. It was my perception at least with the 
use of the words ``influence peddling'', if they were directed at a 
sitting member of Parliament, surely they would be 
unparliamentary and should be withdrawn.  I go beyond that. I 
would ask that in the use of these words that they be not used in a 
very loose fashion.
<P>
	I will take it upon myself to get the precise meaning by looking 
over the ``blues'' and the use of these two words ``influence 
peddling''. I will come back to the House and make a further 
decision or a further comment if it is needed.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker,

should not be using derogatory adjectives and I certainly would not 
think of doing that. The word ``sleaze'' is a noun.
<P>
	Further to that I also said that I would like to-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> We can consider that one for the Beave, right?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I offered to table at least one copy of the document 
by the former minister that was not shredded. It is called ``Creating 
Opportunity: Fulfilling the Promise of Immigration and 
Citizenship''.
<P>
	I would like to seek unanimous consent to table it so that one of 
the unshredded copies will be kept forever more.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There is not unanimous consent.
<P>

that we could table anything in this House without unanimous 
consent?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I hope I did not because I would have to eat crow

<P>
	A private member may have something tabled in the House with 
unanimous consent. With a minister it is a little bit different. I 
know that is the clarification the hon. member wanted.

	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </B>On 
March 20, all French speaking countries around the world celebrate 
the Journée internationale de la Francophonie.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	On behalf of the minister responsible for the francophonie, who 
will be with us in this House next week, I am pleased to mark this 
event.
<P>
	Canada's involvement in the francophonie is a an essential 
element of its foreign policy.
<P>
	The francophonie is a forum in which all Canadians, and 
especially our 8.5 million francophones, can affirm their sense of 
belonging and develop their culture. It is also a forum that 
highlights the solidarity between the 49 member states and 
governments.
<P>
	At the francophonie summit in Benin last December, the Prime 
Minister outlined Canada's priorities within this forum for the next 
few years. First, consolidate francophone institutions. Second, 
define the francophonie's policy on conflict prevention.
<P>
	In this context, I want to acknowledge two actions recently taken 
by Canada. At the Bordeaux conference, Mr. Pettigrew's proposal 
to create consultation committees on Burundi-a country ravaged 
by civil war-was approved in order to bring back peace.
<P>
	Also, as a result of the work done by the Association des 
parlementaires de langue française in Haiti, my government made a 
commitment to maintain a peacekeeping force in that impoverished 
country. It was a difficult situation, but Canada has remained 
steadfast in its solidarity.
<P>
	The Prime Minister, the Minister for International Co-operation 
and myself will have the honour of welcoming President Préval to 
Canada later this week.
<P>
	Finally, as a third priority, Canada wants to put the francophonie 
on the electronic highway. Its access to and presence on the Internet 
are an essential part of keeping French alive and well in growth 
industries.
<P>
	Canada is in the vanguard of new communication technologies. 
That is why we will host a conference on this subject very soon.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to say a few words on the francophonie's 
huge impact within our borders.
<P>
	Like their counterparts in many French speaking countries, 
French-Canadians speak the same language but with different 
accents.
<P>
	I am thinking, of course, about Quebecers, who set the tone for 
our French culture. I am also thinking about the Acadian and other 
francophone communities across Canada who, by deciding every 
day to speak French, give the Canadian francophonie its full 
significance.
<P>
	I am proud to say that the legislature in my province of Manitoba 
will soon inaugurate a monument in honour of Louis Riel, which 
recognizes the legacy of those men and women who were leaders of 
the Canadian francophonie. They are still inspiring us today.
<P>
	I wish all French speaking nations and all francophiles in our 
country a great Journée internationale de la Francophonie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is 
with great honour and pride that I rise today on behalf of the Bloc 
Quebecois to draw attention to the Journée internationale de la 
Francophonie.
<P>
	This day is especially important for all Quebecers and all 
francophones in the rest of Canada, whose collective future is 
necessarily tied to that of la Francophonie as a whole.
<P>
	Listening to the Minister of Foreign Affairs tell us proudly that 
8.5 million Canadians are French-speaking, I could not help but 
reflect on the sad situation in which francophones outside Quebec 
find themselves.
<P>
	If today we are celebrating this memorable day, this does not 
necessarily mean that we must ignore the bad position the French 
language is in everywhere else in Canada. Contrary to what the 
Prime Minister said, there are no longer one million Canadians 
outside Quebec for whom French is the language spoken at home, 
but only 640,000.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	In actual fact, there are not 8.5 million people in Canada who 
still speak French at home, but only 6.3 million. That is 2.2 million 
fewer than suggested by the minister, if you exclude those who 
barely know the language.
<P>
	In relation to the total population, this also represents a decrease 
in the francophone population in Canada as compared to 1981.
<P>
	Instead of getting better, the situation of the French language 
outside Quebec is deteriorating. No wonder that the minister is 
trying to embellish reality, when in fact francophones outside 
Quebec are being assimilated at an increasing rate. The rate of 
assimilation is even as high as 75 per cent in British Columbia. We 
are pleased-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> It can't be soon enough.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="973"> 973 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Madam Speaker, I must tell you that I just heard 
one of our friends from the Reform Party make a rather 
uncalled-for remark to the effect that it cannot be soon enough, 
that 75 per cent is not enough.
<P>
	We are pleased to learn that a monument in honour of Louis Riel 
will soon be unveiled in the minister's home province. One can 
wonder however if the importance attached to la Francophonie by 
the government in that province is not limited to just that, 
monuments.
<P>
	In Manitoba, the rate of assimilation of francophones is 50 per 
cent. The minister should not be proud, he should be ashamed.
<P>
	More than 25 years of official bilingualism did not stop the 
assimilation of French speaking people outside Quebec. As well, 
there is no indication that, in Quebec, the relative percentage of 
French speaking people will be maintained. The irresistible 
attractive force of English in North America weighs more heavily 
than the progress made by the French language among allophone 
communities.
<P>
	Moreover, the use of French in the scientific field is very 
problematic. Scientific research at the international level is done in 
English. No one can deny that. Indeed, English is by far the 
dominant language within the scientific community.
<P>
	Nevertheless, this does not keep us from hoping that French will 
eventually be used more in the field of science. This is why we 
must increase our efforts to ensure that our scientists can spread the 
achievements of the Quebec and French speaking scientific 
community throughout the world.
<P>
	Our researchers obviously have a responsibility to teach and to 
work in French.
<P>
	As for the information highway, we are pleased that both the 
Quebec and the Canadian governments intend to be very active 
regarding French content. Let us hope that the Cotonou summit, in 
Benin, will have definitely put the French speaking world on the 
information highway.
<P>
	Finally, French speaking states must also try to stop the erosion 
of the French language within international organizations. The 
challenge is, of course, to avoid letting English truly become the 
only language of communication at international forums.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to emphasize the urgent need for 
solidarity between Quebec, francophones in Canada and other 
French speaking nations around the world.
<P>
	Our commitment in Haiti is a step in this direction and is to be 
commended.
<P>
	Finally, I wish to point out that Quebec's sovereignty is now 
more obvious than ever to other countries in the Francophonie. 
There is no doubt that francophone  countries have understood that 
the situation has evolved and that sovereignty is now only a 
question of time.
<P>
	The close results in the last referendum have given additional 
moral weight to Quebec, the weight of a state that will soon 
become sovereign. Quebec will therefore play an increasingly 
important role in the international Francophonie. It has, 
furthermore, been named rapporteur for the Francophonie until the 
summit to be held in Hanoi, Vietnam, in 1997.
<P>
	On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I wish a memorable day to all 
those who cherish this beautiful language.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, before I start 
my response, it is our position that we examine our membership in 
all organizations and certainly the francophonie is one of those.
<P>
	I have listened to the minister say many wonderful things about 
the francophonie. I hope the minister's optimism is justified but I 
certainly have some doubts. My doubts really started last year 
during the francophonie conference in Benin when the member 
countries failed to condemn dictators as the Commonwealth had 
done during the meeting in New Zealand. Nigeria had been 
expelled from the Commonwealth because of its abusive 
government. This was action, not like what we saw in Benin.
<P>
	At the Benin conference there was no action. There were not 
even strong words for the dictators of the world, some of whom are 
members of the francophonie. This made me wonder what this 
organization really does. Is there ever productive action or just an 
endless series of conferences that provides good photo 
opportunities for politicians? Is the francophonie about unveiling 
statutes and making warm, fuzzy speeches when it should really be 
getting things done? Is that not what international organizations are 
supposed to do?
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Canada spends millions of dollars every year on the 
francophonie, but where was the francophonie when it came time 
to bail out Haiti, one of its members? Again there was no action. 
Instead Canadian taxpayers had to open their wallets to save the 
day. Why?
<P>
	When the minister talks about the upcoming visit of the Haitian 
president to Montreal, I am surprised he can talk about it with a 
straight face. On the final weekend before the byelection in the 
riding with the highest concentration of people of Haitian origin, 
can the minister really pretend this has something to do with 
francophonie solidarity? It is about getting Pierre Pettigrew 
elected, plain and simple.
<P>
	In the future the francophonie must shed its current image of an 
expensive forum where dictators mix with democrats to have 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="974"> 974 </A></B>
<P>
banquets and stage photo  opportunities. This does nothing for the 
citizens of the member countries.
<P>
	There are many poor people who live under repressive regimes 
and they deserve to have the francophonie working for their 
interests. These people need action, not meetings, discussions and 
political rhetoric. If the francophonie can provide this action, good, 
but the time for change is now, not five or ten years from now.
<P>
	Being a forum for solidarity is no longer enough. The 
francophonie must become a functional tool to strongly press for 
democracy, peace and human rights.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I wonder if I could have the 
unanimous consent of the House to respond on behalf of the NDP 
to the minister's statement.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is there 
unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Blaikie:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond on behalf of 
the New Democratic Party to the statement by the Minister of 
Foreign Affairs. I would like to add my own best wishes to the 
francophones in Canada and around the world on the occasion of 
this Journée internationale de la Francophonie.
<P>
	In the new world order, or more accurately the new world 
disorder, feelings of solidarity, of shared roots, of world citizenship 
have given way to relationships that are purely commercial. In that 
context it is most timely to celebrate international ties between 
cultural and linguistic communities such as those developed by the 
French speaking countries and communities. In our market driven 
world, we should cultivate communities, and the francophone 
world community helps us in that vital task.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Like the Commonwealth, the francophonie can and does play an 
important role not only in the cultural development of member 
states but also in their political development. Canadians look to the 
francophonie, like they do to the Commonwealth, as an agency that 
can play a creative and positive role in the challenging task of 
building an international community in which basic human and 
democratic rights are respected everywhere.
<P>
	However, the francophonie has a way to go before it fulfils that 
kind of role in the way the Commonwealth has in the past, for 
instance with respect to South Africa. I share the urgings of a 
previous speaker that the francophonie needs to take a stronger 
stand with respect to human rights in its member states.
<P>
	The minister mentioned Louis Riel. As a Manitoban I second his 
sentiments that a francophone was the founder of our province. The 
francophone parish, the  parish of Notre-Dame-de-l'Assomption, 
was a founding element of the community I come from, Transcona.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	In 1911 it was francophones from St. Boniface and from Quebec 
who came to Transcona and helped found the community. They are 
a vital part of it today. Their school formed the nucleus around 
which a very successful French immersion program was built in 
Transcona. It created an opportunity to learn French and also the 
French culture because it was an institution that grew out of the 
French speaking community in Transcona.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Allow me to again express my best wishes to all of the 
francophones of Canada, the francophones of Quebec, the 
Acadians, the Franco-Manitobans in my own riding of Winnipeg, 
and all other French speaking Canadians.

managing the family home and caring for preschool children and

	<B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.)</B> moved

Code (punishment for subsequent and serious personal injury 
offence).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is snowing today in Ottawa but the 
daffodils are up in my riding of New Westminster-Burnaby and 
we have some here today supplied by the radio station CKMW 
from my riding.
<P>
	It is a pleasure to introduce the bill to the House. Too often 
following a serious crime we learn the offender has a long criminal 
record. We need some common sense crime prevention. This bill 
would imprison an offender for an indeterminate period of time 
should they be convicted of a second serious personal injury 
offence.
<P>
	At first glance opponents of the bill say it resembles the three 
strikes and you are out laws currently be used in several U.S. states. 
However, this bill avoids the shortcomings of the American model. 
Stealing a pizza or painting one's name on a bridge or even writing 
a bad cheque, although hurtful and socially disruptive, are not 
examples of a serious personal injury offence as defined in the 
Criminal Code.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	This amendment would operationalize the existing Criminal 
Code sections and protect the community from the few offenders 
who are causing the majority of serious crimes and who are 
unwilling to reform.
<P>
	The way the law currently stands there is little deterrence for 
repeat offenders who commit serious personal injury offences. This 
bill goes to the source of the problem for the safety of the public. 
Most important, it places the victim's concerns before those of the 
offender.

(joint custody).
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, first I would like to thank my hon. 
colleague from Athabasca for seconding this bill.
<P>
	The Divorce Act is discriminatory. It leaves non-custodial 
parents, usually fathers, out in the cold. I know some very good 
fathers who always pay child support but can no longer afford to 
see their children  because their mothers have taken them to live a 
considerable distance away.
<P>
	Statistics show a direct correlation between access and 
non-compliance. Non-custodial parents who get to see their 
children are more likely to make their payments. However, custody 
now goes to one parent unless an application for joint custody is 
made. It should be the reverse.
<P>
	Joint custody of and access to one's children should be automatic 
unless it is not in the children's bests interests. Today I am tabling a 
bill to amend the act to make joint custody automatic.
<P>
	The recent controversy over child support payment taxation 
should not detract from the most important issue to children. In 
most cases that issue is not dollars and cents but guaranteed access 
to both parents.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the GST should be ``killed, scrapped, 
abolished''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, Canadians have been waiting a long 
time to hear this debate in this place. After all, the promise to scrap, 
axe and abolish the GST was one that the Prime Minister, the 
Deputy Prime Minister and the finance minister made at various 
times over the last several years and of course during the election 
campaign.
<P>
	After over two years into the mandate of the government, it is 
more than past time to have this debate. Sadly it is a debate that has 
to come from the opposition  rather than the government which was 
proposing it during the election campaign.
<P>
	It was a major campaign promise. In fact, I would argue that it 
was probably the most important promise that the government 
made during the 1993 election campaign. Some members across 
the way who were on doorsteps throughout this country told 
Canadians face to face that should the Liberals assume power the 
GST would be history, that it would be gone.
<P>
	I am not going to make an elaborate argument against the GST. I 
do not think I have to. Government members have already made 
the argument for me. They made the argument during the election 
campaign and even since then.
<P>
	I would like to run through a chronology of the different quotes 
that have been dug up from various members opposite to 
demonstrate there is a huge weight of evidence that the government 
did promise to abolish, to axe, to scrap, to get rid of, the GST. 
Today it is fudging on that promise.
<P>
	By the way, Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the 
hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	I would like to go back into the public record and point out to the 
House what was said by hon. members on the Liberal side in the 
lead-up to the last election campaign and let Canadians judge for 
themselves and hopefully remind the Liberals and perhaps tweak 
consciences a bit so that when it comes time to vote they will vote 
for their constituents instead of voting for the party whip.
<P>
	Let us go back to 1990. This was in the wake of the GST being 
brought in by the previous Tory government which had its own 
undemocratic ways about jamming bills through. I will go back to 
the Edmonton <I>Journal</I> of March 6, 1990 for the first in a long series 
of quotes that I am going to use this afternoon.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberal Party would scrap the GST, the current Minister of 
Human Resources Development pledged in a nationally televised 
debate with former finance minister Michael Wilson in March, 
1990: ``The goods and services tax is a regressive tax. It has to be 
scrapped and we will scrap it''.
<P>
	Let us go to the Windsor <I>Star</I> of November 9, 1990. This is a 
quote by the current Liberal House leader: ``Not only do the 
Liberals oppose the GST now, that opposition will continue even if 
the bill is passed. We are not interested in tinkering with the GST. 
We do not want it at all''.
<P>
	From an April 4, 1990 article in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>: ``I would 
abolish the GST''. That was stated by the current finance minister. 
The current Prime Minister of Canada said in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I> 
of September 27, 1990: ``I want the tax dead''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="978"> 978 </A></B>
<P>
	Let us look at the chronology to see how things change over 
the course of years. Let us go to the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, February 11, 
1991: ``I say we will replace the tax. This is a commitment. You 
judge me by that''. These are the words of the Prime Minister. 
The words are starting to change.
<P>
	From the Toronto <I>Star</I>, November 7, 1991:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>`Some senators are confused and upset by [the Prime Minister's] inability to 
consistently say that a Liberal government will scrap the GST', a senior Liberal 
source said yesterday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[The current Prime Minister] was accused of flip-flopping after he backed 
away from a promise to abolish the GST on Monday, saying the tax would be 
`fundamentally changed' under a Liberal government. On Tuesday [the Prime 
Minister] was back saying he would scrap the tax after the 88,000 member 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business released a critical report on the 
GST.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I have dozens and dozens of quotes. I will obviously have to 
abbreviate them to get through my entire presentation. Let us skip 
ahead to the 1993 election year. Here is an interesting quote from 
the Toronto <I>Star</I>, February 12, 1993: ``The Liberal leader says it 
could be 1995 before he decides how to keep his promise to scrap 
and replace the goods and services tax''. We certainly wish it would 
have happened in 1995 but 1995 has come and gone.
<P>
	I think a lot of people will remember this quote from 1993, one 
week before the election. I know the member across the way will 
remember this one because these are words that live in infamy in 
the world of the Liberals. This is from the current Deputy Prime 
Minister appearing on a CBC electronic town hall meeting one 
week before the election: ``If the GST is not abolished under a 
Liberal government I will resign''.
<P>
	She said ``abolished''. As the hon. member for York 
South-Weston has been fond of pointing out about his own 
government, abolish is not synonymous with harmonize, which is 
what the Liberals are trying to convince Canadians they were 
saying during the election campaign. However, that is not the case 
and Canadians know better.
<P>
	I want to fast forward a little now to 1994 and then ultimately to 
1995 and 1996. Here is what the Victoria <I>Times Colonist</I> said on 
May 18, 1994:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The federal government will replace the hated GST within two years [the 
current Prime Minister] pledged Thursday.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Revenue minister-predicts that voters will punish any provincial 
government that fails to merge its sales tax with a revamped goods and services 
tax.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Revamped''? That sounds suspiciously like tinkering with the worst tax 
ever imposed on Canadians instead of trashing it. If the voters are going to 
punish any government, it will be the federal Liberals for failing to deliver on a 
clear, specific election promise.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In fact, when [the current Prime Minister] was trying to entice Canadians into 
making him prime minister, he said it was the only specific promise he was 
making.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	The weight of evidence is overwhelming and in the court of 
public opinion Canadians are not only trying this government, they 
are convicting it. I think they will mete out a very harsh penalty at 
the next election.
<P>
	Let us go to the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, August 10, 1995: ``The hated 
GST will be replaced with a new national sales tax in next year's 
federal budget, the Prime Minister promised Wednesday''.
<P>
	From the same day, an interesting quote from the hon. member 
for Mississauga West: ``I think the GST is going to become a hot 
point. I think if we do not do something about it our credibility is 
gone. People in my riding hate the GST. It is not like one of those 
mild we do not like it, they hate it. If the GST is merged with 
provincial sales taxes voters will not be satisfied unless the overall 
tax take is simultaneously reduced. You cannot just do a little paper 
switch or move the shell and hide the peanut''.
<P>
	I think that is a wonderful quote and I think it is a perfect 
analysis of the situation.
<P>
	Here is an interesting quote from the Ottawa <I>Sun</I>: ``In 1993 the 
Liberals promised to scrap the Tories' hated GST but so far have 
not kept their word. That broken promise, stressed the member for 
Broadwood-Greenwood, is going to come back to haunt them in 
an election expected next year. It is one word. It is trust''.
<P>
	The hon. member for York South-Weston said: ``I hope we do 
not try to hoodwink people into thinking our commitment was 
contingent on the provinces agreeing to harmonize their taxes with 
the GST''. That came from a Liberal member, a member who went 
to doorsteps along with all the other members across the way trying 
to convince Canadians that if they voted Liberal they would get rid 
of the GST.
<P>
	Now we have some members who are feeling their conscience. 
They are coming forward to the media and urging their party that 
the GST must be scrapped, abolished, axed, as they said it should 
be during the election campaign. Now we are starting finally to get 
some debate about that in the House thanks to the Reform Party 
because obviously the Liberals have not brought this forward to 
this point and it is not in their interest to do it.
<P>
	This vote is a chance for Liberal members across the way to 
throw off the fetters of party discipline, to vote with their 
constituents and to finally fulfil their promise to get rid of the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, this is a very 
important debate. It has transfixed the Canadian public since the 
previous Conservative prime minister, without consultation with 
the Canadian public,  brought in the tax and barrelled it through the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="979"> 979 </A></B>
<P>
House of Commons. Clearly there are many of us on this side who 
understand the veracity of opinion with respect to this tax.
<P>
	As the hon. member opposite selectively quotes, I remember 
quite clearly in the red book and during the election campaign we 
as a party in waiting, one that was soon to have been given the trust 
of the Canadian public, made it extremely and exceptionally clear 
what our platform was.
<P>
	Rather than having to wait until opposition members with 
selective memories misquoted us, we put down in writing, in black 
and white, what our policies were.
<P>
	With respect to the GST we had said in opposition that it was the 
wrong tax at the wrong time. At that point it was the wrong tax, it 
was the wrong time and it aided and abetted in the deepening of a 
recession caused by the previous government's misguided 
economic policies.
<P>
	At the time of the election it was very clear to us that we would 
be faced with an enormous task to try to balance the books, to try to 
put our fiscal house in order. What we said at the time in the red 
book, in black and white, is that this government would get rid of 
the GST and that we would replace it with a taxation system which 
was easier to administer, fairer to small businesses and which took 
in the same amount of revenue.
<P>
	I know my hon. colleague from the Reform Party is an avid 
reader. He quotes the red book often. It is one of his favourite 
pieces of reading material.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Would his party support today the abolition of the GST if it knew 
it would lead to a $17 billion increase in the deficit? If not, would 
he specifically tell us which programs would be cut which would 
amount to that $17 billion? Which social programs would be laid to 
waste? Which transfer programs would he and his party cancel? 
What would be the impact of those program cancellations be to, for 
instance, the people of Labrador who are in the middle of an 
election campaign and who are wondering which party better 
represents the future for the people of that riding?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member raises a number 
of issues. Let me underline that the confusion about what the 
Liberals said is apparent in his own party. I have quoted things 
which several Liberal members have said in the last couple of 
months. These are people who campaigned door to door under the 
impression that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and 
the finance minister meant what they said and intended to do what 
they said. Obviously they feel they have been let down.
<P>
	The hon. member raised a good question. What would the 
Reform Party do? The Reform Party would wipe out the deficit and 
eliminate the GST in stages, unlike the  government which is 
leaving a $17 billion deficit out there. The only thing that can 
happen when we have a deficit that large is that the government 
would move toward eliminating all kinds of services to seniors. It 
is talking about making more cuts to social programs, which it said 
during the election campaign it would never touch.
<P>
	We see more broken promises. Quite frankly, we are seeing 
hypocrisy from that side equalled only by the government before it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, Reformers do not really know how the Liberals can or will 
deliver on their red book promise to scrap the GST. However, it is 
their problem, not ours.
<P>
	I remember vividly discussions about the strategy which Reform 
should follow during the election campaign. The suggestion came 
up that the idea of scrapping the GST is very popular; it would gain 
us lots of votes. However, cooler rational heads prevailed and said 
we could never deliver on that. It is not responsible to go to the 
people of Canada during an election campaign and say we will get 
rid of tax revenue worth $17 billion when the country is going 
bankrupt. Appropriately, we did the responsible thing and said we 
would eliminate the GST, as the people of Canada want, once the 
budget was balanced.
<P>
	The difficulties in which the Liberals find themselves could not 
have happened to nicer guys.
<P>
	I will address a question which has not been raised. The defence 
on the other side is: ``We did not say we would get rid of it; we said 
we would replace it with something else. We would harmonize it''. 
Harmonizing sounds like a good and interesting idea. However, it 
does not meet the requirements I believe the people of Canada have 
for a taxation system.
<P>
	The general idea of a value added tax is supported widely in 
academic circles. It is a tax which encourages savings and 
investment. At a low tax rate it would not be too onerous and it 
would catch people in the underground economy who do not pay 
taxes. Whenever they spent their money, they would end up paying 
taxes.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	The political process so destroyed the basic idea of a value added 
tax that it is appropriate it is not called a VAT like in Europe, but 
that it is called the GST. It is ironic that the cause for this 
abomination, the GST, this caricature of a value added tax was 
caused by the Liberal opposition members who sat on this side of 
the House. I have heard it told repeatedly how it all came about.
<P>
	In a heated attack by the rat pack, the Minister of Finance of the 
day, Michael Wilson, without thinking through what he did, gave in 
to the incessant demands that at least food should be exempted 
from the value added tax. All the experts who have studied the 
history of  the tax have told us that from that moment on we ended 
up not having a good GST, not a good value added tax. We ended 
up with the current abomination because he opened the floodgates 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="980"> 980 </A></B>
<P>
on exemptions which resulted in all kinds of difficulties which now 
exist. It is they who made it such a hated tax.
<P>
	I sat through many, many weeks of hearings. Nearly a thousand 
witnesses told us what an abomination this tax is. Some episodes of 
how terrible a tax it is stand out in my mind. These difficulties will 
not be eliminated by harmonization; they will be aggravated.
<P>
	The most memorable event was when a gentleman came to 
testify before the finance committee with a shopping bag full of 
cancelled receipts from his store. He runs a used goods store in 
Toronto. His business had shrunk by over one-half. He said: 
``People see a price of $100 on a used refrigerator. They say that is 
what they want and to ring up the sale on the cash register. The 
sales attendant hands a bill of $107 to the individual who says that 
he wants it for $100. We tell the customer there is GST on it. After 
a long debate which really irritated and made all the customers in 
the store mad, the individual gave up and said to cancel the sale and 
take back the refrigerator''.
<P>
	It was a most dramatic representation. The store owner said it 
was not an isolated incident. The receipts he had in the bag all had 
been cancelled within six weeks. He said: ``It has been going on 
like this. My business is being wiped out. Where do these people 
go? They go next door, to smaller stores, to entrepreneurs who are 
less honest than I am and they end up not paying the GST''. This is 
just one example.
<P>
	We remember the difficulties of paying GST when we buy five 
muffins but not if we buy six. There were representations from 
restaurant owners who told us they cannot stand the competition. 
When they sell a pizza they have to charge GST on it. However, 
someone can go next door to a supermarket where the pizza is all 
made for them and all they have to do is pop it into an oven and 
they do not have to pay GST. That is highly unfair.
<P>
	There are other things that are not very well known. The 
municipal sector is given special treatment. That sector does not 
have to pay GST. Fine, but consider that it has been found that 
some functions carried out by municipal workers can be achieved 
more efficiently and cheaply by contracting to the private sector. 
Lo and behold, when municipal employees collect the garbage 
there is no GST but when it is contracted out, there is GST. There is 
a tax on privatization. Is this right? This is highly inefficient.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	We heard horror stories about the way in which the GST 
encourages the underground economy. Many conferences have 
been held and papers have been written on this subject. There are 
stories.
<P>
	We hear about people who order a wing built on their house. 
They are given two prices, one with GST and one without. They
<P>
can pay by cheque if they wish or alternatively, they can pay by 
cash which will cost 7 per cent less. As we heard again and again in 
the finance committee, the people who offer these dealings not only 
fail to pay the GST, but they probably do not report the income 
from their work either.
<P>
	We heard horrible stories about businesses being affected by a 
strange ruling. Natives are not subject to the GST. A store located 
outside the border of a reserve used to be quite profitable selling 
candy to children from the native reserve. It was doing fine, thank 
you. Children coming home from playing baseball would buy 
candy. Now the store is not able to compete any more. Somebody 
has opened a store on the other side of the border and does not pay 
any GST.
<P>
	To summarize my point, the government is holding out the hope 
that all the difficulties existing with the GST, which the people hate 
so much and which we heard so much about in the finance 
committee, can be wiped out by harmonization. That is not going to 
be possible because of the abomination of having so many different 
exemptions to the tax. It is a terrible tax that cannot be saved. That 
is the conviction I have reached.
<P>
	I therefore move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the word ``should''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The 
amendment is in order. On questions or comments, the hon. 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am really baffled. It used to be 
said about communists that the hardest thing about being a 
communist was predicting the past because of revisionist history. I 
see this going on in the Reform Party. It is incredible.
<P>
<B>(1610 )</B>
<P>
	In 1990 the hon. leader of the Reform Party said that his party 
would repeal the GST. In 1991 he reversed and said that it could not 
be repealed immediately because that would increase the deficit. In 
1992 his party changed its position again, that it would reduce the 
GST but in stages and after the budget was balanced.
<P>
	In 1994 in a minority report appended to the finance committee's 
report on the GST, the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound 
said: ``We commend the government on its attempt to harmonize 
the tax with the provinces. While we support the much needed 
harmonization, this would be a very difficult political objective to 
achieve''. I recall he offered his help to achieve that.
<P>
	Now there is a motion that states we should scrap it, end it, 
abolish it. We had a Reform Party alternate budget last year but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="981"> 981 </A></B>
<P>
there is no Reform alternate budget  this year. There is no provision 
for replacing the revenue from the GST that would not come after 
scrapping it.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound, what is the 
position of the Reform Party today on the GST? What will it be 
tomorrow, the day after and the day after that? We have been 
through five different versions.
<P>
	Further, would the member explain what was meant in last year's 
minority report when he and his party said: ``We believe that a 
broadening of the tax base would address many concerns placed 
before the committee. That would also require an increase of the 
current GST rebate''. He was clearly willing to talk about a 
broadening of the base to get a lower rate, including food, drugs, all 
manner of things.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, at stake today is not the Reform 
position on the GST. At stake today are promises made during the 
election campaign which were very influential. When knocking on 
doors I heard all the time: ``Why are you not promising to eliminate 
the GST? Why are you not doing this?'' I said that we could not do 
so responsibly. People said that nevertheless they would vote for 
the people who would get rid of it. 	I won in my riding but I wonder in how many ridings the Liberals squeaked by, especially in Ontario, because they made this promise which they knew they could not keep. That is the issue. It is not an issue of how we m
<P>
	Co-operative as we are with the finance committee, we are trying 
to understand what is best for Canada given what we have known 
all along but what the Liberals had denied during the election 
campaign: We cannot get rid of the GST but how can we make it 
better? Harmonization will be better but it will not solve the 
fundamental problems which are documented in the examples I 
have given. That is the issue.
<P>
	The Liberals continue to claim that they did not say they would 
get rid of it. They have twisted it and said they would harmonize it 
and do something else, as if that would solve the problem. After 
studying the GST more than I ever wanted to, I can say that 
harmonization will not solve the problems that have made 
Canadians unhappy enough to tell me they would vote for the 
Liberals because I would not promise to get rid of it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, perhaps I will be 
better able to get a straight answer from the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	My colleague indicated quite clearly that it is extremely unclear 
what the current position of the third party is with respect to the 
GST. We heard the previous speaker from the Reform Party 
indicate that his party's platform during the election campaign was 
to eliminate the GST after the federal deficit was eliminated.
<P>
	If the motion before us were adopted it would have the GST 
eliminated before the elimination of the federal deficit. Is the hon. 
member trying to tell us that his party would eliminate the GST, as 
was the case in its campaign platform, after the deficit has been 
eliminated? Or, in spite of the deficit, which is going down the right 
way but is not quite there yet, would he still eliminate the GST and 
add $17 billion a year to the deficit?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Debate. The 
hon. Minister of National Revenue.
<P>
<B>(1615 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I was fascinated by this motion which has been 
presented for us to debate here in the House by the hon. member for 
Medicine Hat. It states: ``That, in the opinion of this House, the 
GST should be ``killed, scrapped, abolished''. Period. End. Full 
stop. Nothing more.
<P>
	There is no indication here about how the third party would 
replace the GST; if it would replace the GST; how it would deal 
with the $17 billion in net revenues the goods and services tax 
brings in to the federal government. There is nothing that talks 
about that in this motion, this current, the fourth or perhaps the fifth 
iteration of the Reform Party platform on the GST.
<P>
	I can only conclude that what Reformers must be saying is they 
do not care about those funds. They are taking the position that we 
can walk away from $17 billion and they are prepared to face the 
critics who say that this approach is foolhardy and irresponsible.
<P>
	I said I was fascinated that Reformers would propose such a 
motion for debate today. However, I am really not surprised. Here 
again we have members of the Reform Party using political 
grandstanding to make some kind of point. I am not sure what it is. 
I am sure the last laugh is going to be on them. When we look at 
this, here again they are providing simple answers to very complex 
problems. Their political naivete is showing through yet again.
<P>
	Also, the motion is intellectually dishonest. I sat on the finance 
committee with those members opposite. I listened as they did to 
Canadians right across the country about their concern for this tax, 
their hate for this tax.
<P>
	We heard from large businesses which said: ``If you do not 
harmonize this tax with the 10 provincial sales taxes, we will never 
have interprovincial trade that is free and open''. We listened to 
small and medium size businesses which said: ``If you do not 
harmonize this tax, the administrative nightmare we face daily is 
never going to go away''. They said to us: ``If you do not change 
this tax and make it more flexible so that we do not have to go 
through the same process as large companies do when we do not 
have accounting departments to do that, it is going to kill us''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="982"> 982 </A></B>
<P>
	We listened to individual Canadians who said: ``This tax is 
driving us crazy''. Yes, I remember that very individual, the 
retailer who came to our committee with his bags of tax receipts, 
showing the number of customers that had walked out of his store 
and not completed their transactions because they were not 
prepared to pay the final price. He said to us: ``When you change 
the tax, make sure that the tax is included in the pricing on the 
floor''.
<P>
	We heard from advocates of social groups, social organizations, 
poverty organizations who said: ``We understand that the 
government needs the $17 billion. We understand that you want to 
have a mix of tax regimes: corporate, personal income tax, and yes, 
a consumption tax. But for goodness sake, make sure that the 
notion of progressivity, that the rebate continues on''.
<P>
	I would point out at this time, Madam Speaker, that I am sharing 
my time with the hon. member for Willowdale and will look to you 
for a cue as my time runs out.
<P>
	Let me continue by saying that as a committee we responded to 
these concerns. We made recommendations. As my colleague from 
St. Paul's pointed out, the third party said in its minority report: 
``We commend the government on its attempt to harmonize the tax 
with the provinces. While we support the much needed 
harmonization of the tax, this will be a very difficult political 
objective to achieve''. We agreed that harmonization was 
important, that including the tax in the pricing was important, that 
changing the tax so it was more responsive to individual companies 
depending on their size was important.
<P>
	I bring out the red book and quote directly from our platform, the 
platform we took to Canadians in 1993. It states: ``A Liberal 
government will replace the GST with a system that generates 
equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and small business, 
minimizes disruption to small business and promotes 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization''. We 
went beyond that. We presented a complete package to the people 
of Canada. We told them that we recognized this was a poor tax. It 
was poorly strategized, poorly conceived, poorly implemented. It 
is hard to administer.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	We recognized, as I read from the red book, the answers. We said 
that in the first 12 months of our mandate we would talk to 
Canadians and confirm this with them, which we did as a finance 
committee. Lo and behold, the answer that came back was 
reflective of the position we took in our platform.
<P>
	We know we have to replace the GST. We are committed to 
replacing it. We know that Canadians across the country support 
the strategy the finance committee put forward and which the 
Minister of Finance is working at achieving.
<P>
	We are taking a responsible position here. We need to work with 
the provinces in order to make them understand that their 
constituents are the ones we talked to. The answers the provinces 
would get from the people in Ontario, British Columbia and Prince 
Edward Island are the answers we got as we crossed the country.
<P>
	The answer is to come together, to have a single tax, to respond 
to the needs of the country, to improve our interprovincial trade, to 
respond to small and medium size businesses, which we know are 
the engines to our economic future, and to respond to individual 
Canadians. They do not want a tax but are prepared to pay taxes to 
support our social programs and our seniors benefits, those things 
that make this country unique and which are so important to us.
<P>
	I admire the Minister of Finance for the work he is doing in his 
discussions with the provincial finance ministers. I will work as 
closely with him as I can to ensure that we have success in this 
regard.
<P>
	In the Ministry of National Revenue we have come to the very 
clear conclusion that there is but one taxpayer and we want one tax 
administration. Therefore, in the budget and in the speech from the 
throne we have identified the importance of moving toward a 
single Canada revenue commission. We will consolidate the work 
of the department even more so than we have.
<P>
	I would like to recognize the work of those members of my 
department who have consolidated very disparate branches of 
endeavour and brought them under one administration. We will 
continue to work with other federal departments such as 
agriculture, immigration and transportation to consolidate our 
work, reduce duplication, save money and reduce overlap.
<P>
	We will then, with this agency, go forward and ask the provinces 
to work with us and consolidate the administrations that are dotting 
our country in each province and territory.
<P>
	I am hopeful as we proceed along that agenda that we can clear 
the path and assist the Minister of Finance and draw to the attention 
of the finance ministers in all of the provinces how important the 
harmonization of this tax is, how important including the tax in the 
pricing is and how important it is to ensure that the tax regimes we 
have in effect in Canada are responsive to Canadians and to 
Canadian business.
<P>
	That is the commitment we made as a Liberal Party. That is the 
commitment we continue to maintain and work toward as a Liberal 
government. I would ask members of the third party to remember 
the comments they made in their minority report, the support they 
gave to this position. I ask them to begin to work with us instead of 
continuing with this political grandstanding and flip-flopping to 
position themselves in whatever they view to be in the best view of 
the Canadian public at a certain point in time.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="983"> 983 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to tell the revenue minister that I will be addressing 
the minority report when I give my speech.
<P>
<B>(1625 )</B>
<P>
	Concerning her comments and speech, the issue is twofold: what 
politicians or candidates say when they run for election versus what 
they do once they get into government. That is what is at issue here. 
When the Deputy Prime Minister ran as a Liberal candidate she 
said that if elected, the Liberal government would abolish the GST 
or she would quit. She believed it was time politicians kept their 
promise. She said words to that effect. Now, as Deputy Prime 
Minister the difference is: ``If we do not replace the GST I will 
resign'' and there is nothing about politicians keeping their 
promise.
<P>
	At issue here with the GST is the language and rhetoric used is 
stronger at the door and implies or suggests so that people who are 
listening infer a different concept than what is in the red book. I 
will acknowledge that what is in the red book and always has been 
there is replace, replace, replace.
<P>
	Now let us go to the next promise. In 1993 the current Prime 
Minister said: ``We will replace it by 1995''. What year is it now?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> It is a lot later than that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I think 1995 has come and gone. The government has 
had two years. There are 170 members in the government. When 
the Prime Minister was in opposition he said he would get rid of the 
GST in a day. Well he has been Prime Minister for two years and he 
cannot even keep the promise to replace the GST. He cannot keep 
the promise of the deadline. He has had two years. He said he could 
do it in a day. That is the issue.
<P>
	With that short, short, very factual preamble, my question is: 
When will the Liberal government keep its red book promise and 
replace the GST?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Stewart (Brant):</B> Madam Speaker, I assume there is time 
to answer after that very short preamble. I would just point out that 
we on this side know it is 1996 and not 1950 like members 
opposite.
<P>
	The member is talking about what people said at their doors. I 
remind the hon. member that in 1990 it was the Reform Party 
leader who said while his party was trying to get a new senator and 
its first member of Parliament elected, that the Reform Party would 
rip out the GST if it has been imposed against the will of the 
people. That was in the Reform Party's election campaign.
<P>
	As I said in my comments this tax was conceived of and 
implemented poorly. It is now very difficult to administer as a 
result of the work of the previous government. The last thing I want 
to do is to inflict another ill-conceived replacement on the 
Canadian public. We will take the time needed to get this tax right  
because we are a responsible government. We have listened to what 
the people of Canada have said.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, first of 
all, I wish to thank the hon. members for Capilano-Howe Sound 
and Calgary Centre, who worked very hard with the finance 
committee in preparing the report on the future of the GST.
<P>
	We worked very closely together. We travelled across Canada 
and they really supported our position that the amendments 
suggested by the committee were valid.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In part of the process we went through we looked at 20 different 
alternatives to the GST. It would do us well to recall very briefly 
those tax alternatives we looked at. At the time everybody on the 
committee, Reform, Bloc and Liberals said that we had to replace 
that tax. We could not just abolish it because we needed the 
revenue. So what tax alternatives did we look at? There were 
probably five different categories.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	The first category of tax replacement was that maybe the tax 
could be abolished without replacing it and three scenarios under 
that category were looked at.
<P>
	The first was that maybe the stimulus to the economy from 
getting rid of the tax would be so enormous that the economy 
would prosper simply by eliminating the tax. If that worked, why 
not eliminate more? It was the old supply side, trickle down 
Reaganomics that does not work. It was rejected unanimously by 
the committee.
<P>
	The second alternative was to reduce government expenditures. 
However, to reduce expenditures by $17 billion in one year would 
have been too much for even this economy to swallow. We have 
made tough cuts and have been able to reduce program spending 
over a four year period by about $14 billion. That would have been 
even more dramatic and it would have had a terrible effect on the 
growth of the economy at that time.
<P>
	The third alternative was to cut transfer payments to the 
provinces. At that time the transfers in cash were about equal to the 
net take on the GST. However, look at the implications that would 
have had on spending programs in the provinces. Look at the 
implications that it would have had for the programs that members 
on all sides of the House have asked us to support as a federal 
national government.
<P>
	The next category of replacement was income tax alternatives to 
the GST. We had five of those: a personal income surtax, an 
exchanging of tax bases with the provinces, a flat tax, an additional 
flat tax add-on to the personal income tax, and a corporate income 
tax increase.
<P>
	In essence, abolishing the GST and putting it all into personal 
income tax would have meant a 21 per cent  increase in federal 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="984"> 984 </A></B>
<P>
personal income tax, which would be unthinkable when the top 
marginal rate in Ontario is 54 per cent.
<P>
	There are many who said it could be done with corporate taxes. 
That would have meant an increase of more than 150 per cent in 
corporate taxes in that year.
<P>
	Those are eight of the alternatives at which we looked.
<P>
	The third category of replacement was revenue taxes. The first of 
these was a turnover tax. A tax of 1 per cent to 2 per cent could be 
imposed on every financial transaction, every business transaction, 
every sale which took place. The trouble is that it had been tried for 
many years in Europe. Although the rate is low, it cascades. Every 
time a transfer of goods or services takes place within a corporation 
it would be added on. It would not take account of efficiencies. 
That is why every European country which has used it rejected the 
turnover tax.
<P>
	Then there was the payroll tax. It would take about a 3.5 per cent 
payroll tax to replace the GST. Some people advocated it. It would 
have been simple but who would have been paying it? Only the 
workers. Only the people who are already taxed by way of payroll 
levies and income tax. It would not have hit those who were retired. 
It would not have hit those who were living off enormous incomes 
which were not earned. It would not have been fair. It would have 
been a killer of jobs. We had to reject it.
<P>
	The fourth category involved miscellaneous proposals for 
replacing the GST. We looked at a wealth transfer tax. We looked at 
green taxes. We looked at taxing gambling and lottery winnings. 
However, even if we could get the maximum out of those three 
different taxes, in their total they would not have accounted for 
more than about one-fifth of the GST. A lot of these were taxes 
which had been rejected in the past for very valid reasons.
<P>
	The fifth category of replacement taxes which was looked at 
were the consumption based taxes. Six alternatives to the GST 
were looked at.
<P>
	The first was the manufacturers' sales tax. Parliaments had 
unanimously rejected that in the past. It only applied to about 
70,000 taxpayers. There were hundreds of thousands of exceptions 
to it. It was a very narrow base and it hurt manufacturing. It made 
manufacturers non-competitive.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	A wholesale tax was looked at. It would have had somewhat the 
same impact, although not as bad as the manufacturers' sales tax. 
However it still had many anti-competitive aspects to it.
<P>
	Next we looked at going to a straight federal retail tax, a single 
stage tax. But when we examined all of the provincial retail sales 
taxes which are single stage, a lot of testimony was given about 
how unfair these taxes were  and how non-competitive they made 
businesses. Businesses ended up paying all sorts of retail sales 
taxes when they should not have.
<P>
	Also there were certificates of exemption so that if a farmer 
wanted to buy a hammer to fix his barn he did not have to pay the 
sales tax on it. Many of these sales slipped through the net and 
businesses were being unfairly penalized. No one suggested that 
we go to the retail sales tax.
<P>
	The next one was an addition method value added tax. This is 
where we started to look at the value added tax concept.
<P>
	The 18th alternative that we looked at was a theoretical 
proposition, but only the academics have ever supported it, no one 
ever said it could work in practice and we rejected it.
<P>
	The nineteenth alternative was one that had considerable merit 
potential. It was the business transfer tax. This would have been a 
value added tax that could have possibly worked in an ideal world 
where you did not have a federal state but a unitary state, only one 
level of government, where all governments could come on board 
at the same time, where you tax all the same base but you had a real 
problem accounting for imports and exports which are fundamental 
to our economy.
<P>
	Universally tax experts, the business groups, the small business 
groups, the big business groups, the chambers rejected the business 
transfer tax which had previously looked as if it could have been 
the panacea.
<P>
	The next alternative was to keep the GST the way it is. We could 
not because it imposes such a burden on small business and all 
Canadian taxpayers because they are supporting 10 different taxes 
at the retail level which is totally unfair. We could not support it 
even in terms of big business.
<P>
	The system in Canada is the only system in the world where 
there is more than one tax at the retail level. Canada has 10 
different taxes. Any party that stands in this House and argues that 
this is good for consumers, good for business, good for jobs, good 
for our competitiveness is absolutely insane.
<P>
	We concluded that this system would not work. The only thing 
that could work was a national value added tax where the federal 
GST is eliminated, the nine provincial retail sales taxes are 
eliminated and they are replaced with one national value added tax 
under one administration.
<P>
	This has such benefits for consumers, for ease of compliance by 
small businesses, for doing business across this country, for 
making every business, small and large, competitive. This is why 
we have supported this proposition. This is why we look forward to 
seeing it come in.
<P>

<P>
	It is why I wish to move an amendment to the amendment put 
forward by the Reform Party. The motion reads: ``That in the 
opinion of this House the GST be killed, scrapped, abolished''.
<P>
	I ask that the period be removed out after that and include the 
following words ``and be replaced with a system that generates 
equivalent revenues, is fairer to consumers and small business, 
minimizes disruption to small business and promotes 
federal-provincial fiscal co-operation and harmonization''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is my understanding that any amendment has to be addressed to our 
amendment which was to remove the word ``should'' from the 
original motion.
<P>
<B>(1640 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> I accept the 
point of order of the hon. member and move that this amendment is 
not receivable.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I wish to ask the hon. member who is a well known, 
famous, most competent tax lawyer whether during the 
deliberations of the Liberal Party of which he is an influential 
member, he ever advised his colleagues that it would not be 
possible to get rid of the GST.
<P>
	Was he totally unaware of the difficulties which exist in 
harmonizing and doing all the other things that we had proposed? 
Did he warn his colleagues about this? Was he ignorant about it? 
Did he just say it to himself and not tell them? Was he simply 
rejected? How could a distinguished tax lawyer, with as much 
influence as he has, get his party to accept a resolution which any 
informed tax lawyer would have known could not be kept?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peterson:</B> Madam Speaker, it is quite evident that the 
member for Capilano-Howe Sound is quite right. We realized as 
did he when he was working with us on the committee that the 
essence of getting a streamlined tax system for all Canadians is 
co-operation at the federal and provincial levels.
<P>
	All of us knew this. We do not have the authority to dictate what 
the provinces do. However that does not mean we should not 
endeavour in all parties to try to make our country work better. All 
of us agree. I know the member who just asked this question agrees 
with us that it would be a significant improvement to the system if 
we could get rid of the 10 different existing tax systems and replace 
them with one tax system under one administration.
<P>
	The saving in cost of compliance to small and big businesses 
would probably be in the neighbourhood of $400 million a year. 
The cost to all taxpayers by getting rid of 10 different systems and 
replacing them with one would probably be in the neighbourhood 
of $400 or $500 million each year.
<P>
	The cost in aggravation to consumers of not having tax included 
pricing when they go into the store about which he spoke most 
eloquently would be enormous. Of course it requires the agreement 
of the provinces, as many things in this country does, in order to 
make it the type of country we want it to be. He knew that and we 
knew that when we spoke of it in the red book.
<P>
	We said that we wanted the tax to be harmonized with the 
provinces, that is, we needed their compliance. We needed their 
co-operation. We needed their agreement. That has always been 
part of the understanding and he knows it.
<P>
	While I still have the floor-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I thought I 
saw you rise after the member sat down. I saw you rise and begin to

would think he is out of order.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> That is not a

absolutely right. The amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Willowdale is out of order, as he had finished his speech and we 
were in the midst of question and comment period. Therefore, I 
cannot recognize this amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
motion put forward by the Reform Party reads, and I quote: ``The 
GST should be killed, scrapped, abolished''. The Bloc Quebecois 
will support this Reform Party motion, because the GST should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="986"> 986 </A></B>
<P>
purely and  simply be abolished, although our reasons are different 
from those set forth by the Reformers.
<P>
	How much money does the federal government make with this 
goods and services tax? When it was first established in 1991, it 
brought in $2.5 billion; the following year, in 1992, $15.2 billion; 
in 1993, $14.9 billion; in 1994, $15.7 billion; and last year, 1995, 
$16.8 billion. This is a tax that puts $15 or $16 billion in the federal 
coffers year after year.
<P>
	Our position on the GST is not new. It was elaborated upon in the 
minority report presented by the Bloc Quebecois members of the 
Standing Committee on finance in June 1994. As far as we are 
concerned, this position is still valid, and I welcome this 
opportunity to outline it for the hon. members.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, would you please ask the hon. members to let 
me speak in peace? I notice that certain members are in deep 
conversation in the back.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Will the hon. 
members who need to discuss matters in this House, thereby 
interfering with our listening to the member who has the floor, 
please withdraw behind the curtains to have their conversations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. The liberal 
government is still reneging on its promise to abolish the GST. Let 
me quote a few lines from the March 11, 1996, issue of the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I>, which are very enlightening in that regard. First: ``I have 
already said personally and very directly that if the GST is not 
abolished, I will resign''. That statement was made to the CBC by 
the current Deputy Prime Minister on October 18, 1993, one week 
before the federal election.
<P>
	As for the current Prime Minister, he is quoted as saying, also in 
1993: ``We will scrap the GST''. The red book, published in 1993, 
states as well, and I quote: ``A Liberal government will replace the 
GST''. Again, in March 1996, the Deputy Prime Minister stated: 
``If we do not replace it, I will resign. I really do not have much 
choice. It will be replaced''.
<P>
	You probably remember that the GST and its abolition where big 
issues during the election campaign in 1993.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	It was a major issue and it greatly helped the Liberals get 
elected. Since then, the Liberal strategy has been to downplay the 
importance of that issue, so as to make it easier to renege on their 
election promises.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Liberals made no bones about 
the fact that they were going to abolish the GST. Now, they talk 
instead of replacing it, of harmonizing it with provincial taxes. The 
Liberals are doing that because they are quietly paving the way for 
a national sales tax. Instead of abolishing the GST, they will make 
it even more pervasive.
<P>
	The Liberal government, with its commitment to harmonize, 
now stands exactly where the Conservatives were. Indeed, before 
disappearing from the political map in 1993, the Conservatives 
were thinking of the same thing, harmonizing the federal and 
provincial sales taxes.
<P>
	You have to admit that the Liberals and the Conservatives are 
pretty much one and the same. In addition to proposing a hybrid 
GST which in no way solves the management problems created by 
the GST, the Liberals want to impose this rigid tax to the provinces.
<P>
	In view of this all-out attack against the provinces' authority, the 
Bloc Quebecois totally distances itself from the Liberal position 
and proposes instead to abolish the GST and to transfer to the 
provinces the tax field currently occupied by the GST. We feel this 
is the only way to implement a single tax system that would benefit 
the provinces.
<P>
	As for Quebec, such a transfer would reflect its specificity and 
its fiscal autonomy. Quebec and other interested provinces could 
thus define the parameters of the new tax field, such as the goods 
and services that are taxable and not taxable, as well as the type of 
tax to be applied. This single tax would be administered and 
collected by each provincial government. Finally, this single tax 
should not take more out of taxpayers' pockets than do the current 
provincial sales tax, the QST in Quebec, and the GST together.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois understands that the transfer of this tax field 
to Quebec could result in a significant loss of revenue for the 
federal government and that the latter should be compensated for 
that loss. Without touching transfers of tax points and special 
abatements-a tax field already occupied by the Government of 
Quebec-the federal government could reduce the transfer 
payments it makes under the various provincial transfer programs 
by an amount equivalent to the current GST revenues collected in 
Quebec.
<P>
	This would also reduce federal interference in certain sectors of 
exclusively provincial jurisdiction, thus helping to cut back on 
duplication. In addition, as long as Quebecers pay their income 
taxes to the federal government, an equalization program should be 
maintained, without additional cuts, in order to offset the 
differences in the provinces' fiscal capacities.
<P>
	In practical terms, our proposal would eliminate the duplication 
resulting from the existence of two parallel taxes and would reduce 
administrative costs for businesses, which would have only one tax 
to keep track of.
<P>
	What is the context in which alternatives to the GST have been 
analysed?
<P>
	It is a difficult context financially and economically. Middle and 
low income taxpayers have reached their threshold of tolerance. 
Unemployment rates are high and public finances are in such a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="987"> 987 </A></B>
<P>
poor state that they are  resulting in a risk premium on interest rates 
that is detrimental to investments.
<P>
	The labour market is in a sorry state. Remember that with the 
increase in the population, we need several hundreds of thousands 
of jobs more in Canada, just to return to the level of employment at 
the beginning of the recession in the second quarter of 1990.
<P>
	If we look at the tax statistics by income brackets published by 
Statistics Canada, we see that the increase in the tax burden of 
middle and lower income citizens is indeed real. Between 1972 and 
1992, taxpayers saw a jump in real tax rates of 22.7 per cent. 
During the same period, taxpayers in lower income brackets saw 
their real tax rates go up by 42 per cent.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	The increased tax burden has triggered the emergence of a 
flourishing underground economy. As the Liberal majority report 
states, analysts estimate the underground economy to represent 
somewhere between 2 and 20 per cent of the GDP. Only a total 
revision of the taxation system could make it possible to contain 
and reduce the size of the underground economy, because it is 
linked to the overall tax burden or, in other words, is dependent on 
all taxes paid by the taxpaying public.
<P>
	The question of abolishing the GST and transferring it to the 
provinces arises in this context. All the commotion focussing on 
replacing the GST illustrates, more clearly than anything else 
could, the necessity of a total review of the federal taxation system. 
An examination of that system shows that high income individuals 
and major corporations have the financial means and the legal 
expertise to take advantage of a number of tax loopholes which 
save them considerable amounts of tax.
<P>
	Think, for example, of the family trust scheme by which rich 
families can put off, virtually forever, having to pay capital gains 
tax on the assets held in trust. It is hard to estimate what the tax 
losses are on such tax deferments, because the Department of 
Finance keeps the figures hidden. According to a study 
commissioned by the Canadian Association of Family Enterprise in 
1990, however, tax losses can be estimated at several hundred 
million dollars.
<P>
	In 1993, when the Liberals were the opposition, they-the 
present Minister of Finance included-voted against reinstatement 
of the tax breaks associated with family trusts. Now the Liberals 
are refusing to abolish those same breaks, but they show no 
hesitancy in the least to dump on the unemployed, couples with 
child support agreements, and the pensioners of the future.
<P>
	In fact the Liberals, just like the Conservatives in 1993, have 
given in to the lobby of rich influential families who want to keep 
their assets safe from taxes, while the tax burden on low income 
families continues to spiral endlessly upward.
<P>
	Another example of unfairness are the tax havens. In the Auditor 
General's report in 1992, it was pointed out that the Income Tax 
Act and the tax agreements made it possible for foreign affiliates of 
Canadian companies to avoid paying tax in Canada and to take 
advantage of the lower rates of taxation available in a number of 
countries considered tax havens.
<P>
	In fact, the auditor general estimates that more than $16 billion 
were invested by Canadian companies in tax havens, thus avoiding 
paying millions of dollars in taxes to the federal government every 
year. This means that, in a roundabout way, several Canadian 
companies are declaring abroad revenue earned in Canada.
<P>
	Taking advantage of tax loopholes, many high income earners as 
well as big profitable firms do not pay a cent in taxes. It is to put an 
end to this kind of inequity that the Bloc Quebecois is demanding a 
comprehensive review of the Canadian tax system, not this 
business taxation committee comprised mostly of advisors working 
for firms using tax havens and contributors to the Liberal election 
fund.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is of the opinion that, in order to prevent big 
profitable firms from using complicated schemes to pay 
ridiculously low taxes, the government should impose a real 
minimum tax on the business profits made by large corporations 
instead of an easily avoidable capital tax.
<P>
	The GST is not the only component of public revenue that needs 
to be reviewed and changed. In the minority report on the GST 
tabled by the Liberals in 1989 while they were in opposition, it is 
recommended that the Conservative government abandon its plans 
to introduce a goods and services tax and immediately initiate 
consultations with Canadians and the provincial governments on a 
fair and integrated reform of the tax system as a whole.
<P>
	Now that they are in power, the same Liberals are content with 
trying to harmonize the GST and bring down three consecutive 
budgets that do nothing to eliminate unfairness. It is wrong to 
believe that all federal tax problems can be resolved by merely 
reforming our sales tax.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	Several examples show that the Liberals are victims of their own 
policy of analyzing the GST separately from the other sources of 
federal revenue. Chapter 2 of the report of the Liberal majority on 
the finance committee, tabled in June 1994, states that wealth 
transfer tax cannot be considered as a replacement for the GST as it 
would not generate as much revenue.
<P>
	This kind of reasoning rules out alternatives like a real minimum 
tax on large corporations making profits, the taxation of family 
trusts, the elimination of tax shelters, and so on. They rule out all 
partial solutions that, together, could do the job.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="988"> 988 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, the Liberals are making exactly the same mistake as 
their predecessors by changing their minds about reviewing all 
sources of government revenue. By tackling only one aspect of 
the problem, the Liberals will never arrive at a lasting decision, 
because the tax system is a complex and delicate equation in 
which fair taxation and a balanced budget cannot be achieved by 
imposing a new tax in isolation.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois' proposal would allow the Quebec 
government to put in place a tax that really meets Quebec's needs 
and avoid the mess that would inevitably be created by 11 parties 
trying to negotiate the base, administrative details and 
characteristics of the tax.
<P>
	Our proposal would also make the Quebec government less 
vulnerable to the federal government's unilateral cuts in transfers 
to the provinces. At the operating level, it would eliminate the 
duplication resulting from two parallel taxes, improve control and 
reduce administration costs for businesses, which would have only 
one tax to manage.
<P>
	Some may argue that our position would encourage consumers 
to take advantage of provincial rate differences. In this regard, we 
would like to repeat what the Liberal majority on the finance 
committee wrote in its report, namely that the committee 
recognized that the national VAT might encourage consumers to 
take advantage of rate differences, but no more so than today's 
provincial sales taxes.
<P>
	It must be understood that the Bloc Quebecois' proposal derives 
from the basic principle guiding our policies: Quebec sovereignty. 
Indeed, sovereignty means, among other things, that the Quebec 
government would have full control over all these budgetary and 
economic instruments. It would then be free to use these tools 
based on Quebec's specific needs and Quebecers' aspirations.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois makes this proposal from a Quebec 
perspective. However, it could also apply to any other province 
wishing to take control of the tax field currently occupied by the 
GST.
<P>
	For these reasons, we will support the Reform motion to abolish 
the GST. The Minister of Finance wants to harmonize the GST with 
provincial sales taxes. This is a new centralizing attempt by the 
federal government. Why not harmonize that tax with the support 
of every province? As for Quebec, our proposal seeks, as I said, to 
abolish the GST and to transfer to the province the tax field 
currently occupied by that tax. Abolishing the GST does not mean 
merely changing its name, as the government might think.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with interest to the member from the separatist 
Bloc party. His speech contained many interesting comments.
<P>
	However, we have to get the debate back to the original intent of 
the motion put forward by the member for Medicine Hat to force 
the Liberal government to live up to the promises it made during 
the campaign prior to the writ period.
<P>
<B>(1705 )</B>
<P>
	We want to address the very deceptive campaigning promises the 
government made prior to the election. Its members went around 
door to door, meeting to meeting, rally to rally and unabashedly 
told Canadians that if they were elected they would abolish, kill, 
remove, place six feet under, get rid of the much hated GST which 
they railed against in the House when the Tory government brought 
it in. I do not know how those members can sit here with such 
righteous indignation at our request that they simply live up to the 
promises they made.
<P>
	There is one thing about Liberals that we all must know by now. 
If they say something verbally, we had better get them to write it 
down. They never used the words ``replace'', ``harmonize'' or 
``change'' during their campaign, the verbal part of their campaign.
<P>
	We have a couple of extremists in the Liberal Party, particularly 
the hon. member for York South-Weston. He remembers the 
campaign promise the Liberals verbally made to the people of 
Canada that if the Liberal government did not live up to its promise 
to abolish, kill, get rid of the GST he would vote against the budget. 
We support that member. It is too bad the government will not 
support its members who heard the promises with the true intent 
they were made.
<P>
	The motion of the hon. member for Medicine Hat calls on the 
government to live up to the promise it made to the Canadian 
people before the red book was written and the words magically 
changed. We are asking the Liberals to live up to their promise, do 
the honourable thing and scrap, kill, abolish, get rid of, bury the 
GST like the Canadian people were led to believe they would do 
before the infamous red book came out and magically changed it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am in complete agreement with the 
hon. member who just spoke, because we in the Bloc Quebecois are 
simply asking that the GST be abolished and that this tax field be 
transferred to the provincial governments, and in our case, to the 
Government of Quebec.
<P>
	I suspect that when the Minister of Finance tells us that he wants 
to harmonize this tax with provincial sales taxes, what he really 
wants is a single federal sales tax. He is going to change the name 
of this tax, call it something else. I also suspect the government of 
wanting to conceal this tax in the sales price so that it will no longer 
be noticed by customers. I think that as elected representatives, as 
parliamentarians, we must remain very vigilant, because I am 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="989"> 989 </A></B>
<P>
certain that the government will  never abolish it. It will just give it 
another name and bury it in the price of goods and services sold.

	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Are we on debate or are we still on questions and 
comments?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There is time remaining for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> Mr. Speaker, that is why I appreciate the impartiality 
of the Chair. Government members were yelling at me that I was on 
debate. I wonder why they were yelling that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Discepola:</B> It is because the Chair said ``resuming debate``.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Silye:</B> I stand corrected.
<P>
	I thought the member's speech was very pointed. I thought it was 
an excellent speech and an excellent commentary. It shows us it 
does not matter which part of the country we come from. It shows 
us it does not matter which political party a person supported. The 
members of the Bloc Quebecois stood for something. They went 
door to door and told their people there needed to be change in 
Ottawa and they are here trying to put forth that change.
<P>
	I do not agree with the change they are pushing for. I do not want 
the country to separate. I want them to reconsider. I want them to 
be a part of Canada. Nevertheless, they are here and they are doing 
what they have to do.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	When we told the voters out west and in Quebec what we wanted 
they woke up, smelled the coffee and knew how bad the federal 
government was. They knew we needed to change the system so 
they sent us and the Bloc here and we have kept our promises. We 
backed out of the pension plan, as we said we would. We can be 
trusted to keep our word.
<P>
	We presented a budget to the government and it laughed and 
scoffed at us. It is now whining that it does not have one this year 
that it can throw in our face when it cannot defend its own.
<P>
	It does not matter where you are from in this country, what you 
say you should mean and you should keep your word. I would like 
the hon. member to comment on how his constituents react to what 
was said at the door by  Liberals in his riding versus what they are 
doing now in government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélisle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am completely in agreement with the 
remarks of the hon. member who just spoke. I think that the 
government should permanently abolish the GST and, in addition, 
transfer this tax field to the provinces. The government should 
streamline the bureaucracy, as the Bloc Quebecois has been asking 
it to do for two years. Military spending should be further reduced; 
the boom should be lowered on family trusts; a committee on 
business taxation should be created whose members are 
parliamentarians, not specialists in tax havens; a minimum tax 
should be set on the profits made by corporations and something 
should finally be done about the $6.6 billion in unpaid taxes not 
recovered by Revenue Canada that the auditor general has been 
complaining about for the last two years.
<P>
	If the government did all these things, it would be able to make 
up the $16 or $17 billion it is now collecting in the form of the 
GST.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I quote the 
current minister of fisheries, promoted to his job, from February 
11, 1993, a man who I believe keeps his word, a man who believes 
in what he says: ``Our alternative to the GST is that we are not 
going to have one. We are not going to have a tax that burns the 
individuals and the small businesses which then go broke because 
they cannot afford the people and computers to do it''.
<P>
	The red book states ``replace''. If the Liberals replace it through 
harmonization have they provided an alternative to GST, because 
we will still have the same hierarchy, administrative work and the 
valued added tax in place that we have to collect, get credit, pay 
back, collect, get credit, pay back? Will this problem be solved? 
Will it still burn individuals in small businesses? They will still go 
broke because they cannot afford the people and computers 
required to do the work.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
<P>
	I have another quote by the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood, whom I respect a lot because he stands 
up and says things he believes in and he believes what he says. He 
wants the government to consider tax reform. He wants the 
government to introduce a simplified system of taxation. He 
submitted to the Standing Committee of Finance ideas and 
suggestions supported by 17 of his colleagues on a way to keep 
their election promise, the promise he made at the door, because he 
is a man who keeps his word, to get rid of the GST and replace it 
with a flat tax.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="990"> 990 </A></B>
<P>
	We just heard the chairman of the Standing Committee of 
Finance talk about how that was impossible because there was not 
enough time to consider it. What a foolish statement to make when 
the Prime Minister sat in opposition and said: ``I would get rid 
of the GST in one day''. He has been here for over two years and 
has not replaced it. In 1993 he said he would replace it by 1995. 
It is now 1996 and he still has not replaced it. To me this is all 
about trust, integrity and being held accountable. That is what this 
debate is all about.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood said: ``It is no 
secret that we as Liberals, if we are given, and I say it humbly, the 
trust of the people in the fall, the GST will be scrapped''. The 
Liberals have received that trust. They made those promises to 
replace the tax. They have not achieved, they have not engineered, 
they have not accomplished trust.
<P>
	I have another quote from the current national revenue minister 
who I worked with in the standing committee. She is a person who I 
know has conviction, who believes in what she says and who will 
do what she says. In the <I>Winnipeg Free Press</I>, March 24, 1994 she 
said: ``As Liberals we were elected to change the tax, abolish the 
tax, scrap it''. She said this as an MP.
<P>
	We know that certain members of the Liberal government, one 
for sure, has said publicly that because the government is not 
keeping its promise on the GST, he is going to vote against the 
budget.
<P>
	There is a difference between what Liberals said at the door to 
get elected and with the phrasing in the red book which they are 
now hiding behind. The current minister of revenue, no matter how 
much she tries, and I heard her speech, said that they will change 
the tax, abolish the tax, scrap it or replace it. They still have not 
done it.
<P>
	Now they throw back quotes in our face and say that when the 
Reformers worked on the Standing Committee of Finance this is 
what they said but they are all selective quotes out of context.
<P>
	Let me put it back in context. In our executive summary, and this 
is after the first year we were here, we were trying to show 
Canadians that we were a constructive alternative. If we were going 
to criticize we would come up with some suggestions on how to 
make it better. Of course the government never listened.
<P>
	We have heard bits and pieces of quotes for the last week in 
question period. The master of myth, the Minister of Finance, has 
used little parts of it. The member for Capilano-Howe Sound, the 
member for Lethbridge and myself were responsible for the 
minority report. We said the majority finance committee report on 
the replacement of the GST cannot be fully endorsed by the Reform 
Party. While the replacement goes part of the way in responding to 
concerns presented to the  committee, many of the concerns will 
only be addressed by future negotiations with the provinces. Even 
that the Liberals are not doing in good faith.
<P>
	If they really want this harmonization to work, if they really 
want to meet their commitment to replace the GST, they should be 
giving the provinces an incentive. But they want their 7 per cent. 
They want to leave the provinces with 8 per cent and still charge 15 
per cent.
<P>
	If they really want to have it they should reduce the federal rate 
by 2 per cent. Give the taxpayers a reason, an advantage and show 
that those efficiency costs can be passed on. This government does 
not pass savings along to the taxpayers because it is a tax and spend 
government.
<P>
	The majority report recommendation merely tinkers with the 
current GST and does not live up to the Liberal promise to scrap it. 
That is in the report, that is quoted but then they stop.
<P>
	Reformers are of the view that value added taxes are incapable of 
responding to a significant portion of the concerns raised during the 
hearings. The hon. member for Capilano-Howe Sound pointed 
that out very well in his speech. That is in <I>Hansard</I> if any of the 
members would like to check it out.
<P>
	The third thing the Reform Party recommends is spending cuts 
be the government's first priority. It took the Liberals two years to 
even make a cut when they should have done it two years ago. This 
country would be $10 billion better off in terms of debt and $1 
billion better off in lower costs in terms of interest.
<P>
	As well, the entire current system of personal, corporate and 
value added taxes should be replaced. Here is what the Reform 
Party would do. It would use a simple, visible and fair system of 
taxation that incorporates the principles of fairness at the lowest 
rate possible.
<P>
	In the interim the party will support reforms to the current 
regimes that move in this direction. I am adding today, with the 
staged elimination of the GST once the budget is balanced.
<P>
	We have positions. We have suggestions. This government's 
strategy is to blame the provinces because they will not harmonize 
the tax systems. The government will not even be able to replace 
the GST. It does not want the provinces to agree with it otherwise it 
would have given them an incentive. It would have lowered the 
rates. There is no incentive. Therefore, there is no real desire.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals' strategy is to try to convince Canadians. The 
master of myth, the finance minister, says: ``Let's put this deal out 
there. We'll blame the provinces. Let's throw it in the face of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="991"> 991 </A></B>
<P>
Reform members. We will select sentences from their executive 
summary, put them on the defensive, show that they support our  
harmonization and then we get out of it. We don't have to do it. 
We'll just make that promise, re-elect us and then we'll do it''.
<P>
	I predict that is what the Liberals are jockeying for. That is what 
they are trying to do, put themselves in a position so they do not 
have to keep that promise. Even in that promise of replacing the 
GST, Canadians will not be fooled. Canadians are smarter than the 
government thinks they are. Canadians should be given more credit 
than what the government gives them. They are not going to be 
fooled. They are going to see through this duplicity.
<P>
	Talk about the intellectual dishonesty, of which the revenue 
minister accused us, of saying one thing to somebody face to face 
at the door: ``If you elect me, I'll scrap something, I'll abolish 
something, I'll get rid of something, I'll kill something'' and then 
not really point out to them that all they really said was they would 
replace it with something that generates equivalent revenue. That is 
not the rhetoric they used.
<P>
	The Liberals said: ``Elect me. I'll replace the GST''. How would 
it have sounded if they had said: ``Elect me. I'll replace the GST 
with something that gets just as much money out of your pockets as 
we are now''. Would that not sound great? Would that not be the 
best way to get elected? That is why they will not keep this 
promise. That is why they cannot keep this promise.
<P>
	I know I have a minute left, but I have said enough. I am sure 
everyone gets the message. I am sure the Liberals now realize that 
their intellectual dishonesty is going to come back and haunt them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the constituents 
in my riding would not forgive me if I did not tell a story about 
what happened in my riding, in answer to the member for Calgary 
Centre.
<P>
	A meeting was held there. There were 6,000 people in the 
Centrium and the message they gave to their member of Parliament 
at that time was: ``Do not vote for the GST. The GST is a bad tax''. 
That message came through loud and clear. Their member came 
back to this House and said: ``The people of my constituency 
support the GST''.
<P>
	I remind the government about that. I remind government 
members that the same fate could befall them when they promised 
they would get rid of the tax. They said they would kill the GST. 
They said they would get rid of it and they did not deliver on their 
promise. Canadians know that and will reward them accordingly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, ``axe the tax''. That was mantra of Liberal members 
before they were elected.
<P>
	Who am I? I am opposed to the GST. I have always been opposed 
to it and I always will be opposed to it. Who am I? I am the Prime 
Minister of Canada, Mr. Jean Chrétien, on October 29, 1990.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member will know that none of us is 
to refer to another member by his or her name.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Thank you very 
much, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	Who am I? We hate it and we will kill it. The hon. Prime 
Minister of Canada, May 2, 1994.
<P>
	Here we are in March 1996. When we go to the store, what do we 
pay? We pay the GST. It may as well be called the ``get stuffed tax'' 
because that is what the Liberals are saying to the Canadian public. 
They did not get rid of this reviled tax.
<P>
	When I talk to the people of this country, when I talk to the 
people of my riding, when I talk to the businesses, no single tax is 
more reviled than the goods and services tax. It is complicated, it is 
expensive and it is inefficient. It was misleading for the 
government before it was elected to promise the people something 
that they so desperately wanted but which it has not given them. 
This tax provides $18 billion to the public coffers every year. How 
much of that actually gets to be used? Two-thirds. One-third of the 
tax goes into administration. How inefficient can we get? That is 
completely inefficient.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	What the Canadian public needs and wants is tax relief. Reform 
members want the GST to go and we have a plan. What is that 
plan? The plan is to balance the budget. We simply cannot provide 
tax relief and get the GST down without doing that.
<P>
	What has the government done? When I was elected two years 
ago, the government had $120 billion to spend on programs such as 
health care and education. What has it done? It has dropped it to 
$103 billion because it cannot balance the budget, something 
everybody here has to do in our private lives. Otherwise, we would 
go bankrupt. That is what is happening to Canada. We are going 
bankrupt.
<P>
	It does every Canadian a great disservice to continue with the 
mythology that we can spend more than we take in. Two years ago 
Reformers put forward a specific, sensitive plan that would 
preserve the core of our social programs, that would preserve the 
core of health care and education to get the deficit down to zero and 
bring the debt down which is the true ogre.
<P>
	We gave the plan to the Liberals and said, use it. Take it for all 
Canadians. Did they do that? Absolutely not. They continue to 
mortgage the future of all Canadians and compromise the lives of 
their children. That is reprehensible.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="992"> 992 </A></B>
<P>
	We have been accused of being the slash and burn party. I 
submit that we are the only political party that is committed to 
preserving social programs. We are the only party that has a plan 
on getting the deficit to zero, bringing the debt down so that we 
can preserve spending and give the public the desperate tax relief 
that they demand.
<P>
	I challenge the members opposite to go into their communities, 
to speak to people about how they are overburdened by taxes. The 
GST is but one. Before they decrease the GST, we should get our 
spending down.
<P>
	There are actions that the government can take today, and that 
includes simplifying this odious tax. It is absolutely absurd that the 
GST in its complexity exists. We can simplify it by businesses only 
putting in one submission every year. It would also diminish the 
amount of money that has to be spent on administration which is a 
complete and utter waste of money.
<P>
	It shows a deplorable lack of trust and integrity on the part of the 
government that it will promise things purely to get elected. 
Reformers have not done that and the public finds it absolutely 
reprehensible that any political party does that. They will see 
through this at the time of the next election.
<P>
	My hon. friend has put forward a brilliant way of simplifying the 
tax system. The government has done absolutely nothing to 
simplify a tax system so that the average person can fill out the tax 
forms.
<P>
	Reformers are going to provide this year a simplified tax system 
for all Canadians to use so that they can fill out their own tax forms. 
Ultimately we will provide a way in which all Canadians will be 
able to get tax relief. That is the name of the game. We will provide 
it through a simplified tax system.
<P>
	Once again I feel it is falling on deaf ears for some strange 
reason. Tragically for all Canadians the government failed to 
co-operate and use our constructive solutions to help all Canadians 
across the country.
<P>
	Once again I challenge members across and I challenge the 
government to use our good suggestions. Nobody has a monopoly 
on suggestions for the country. However, we have a lot of good 
ones but the government has ignored them, to its peril. These 
suggestions come from the grassroots of the country.
<P>

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-221, an act to amend the Competition Act (illegal trade 
practices), be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to lead off the 
debate on my private member's Bill C-221, an act to amend the 
Competition Act.
<P>
	The bill would amend the Competition Act by making it an 
offence for manufacturers and distributors of motor vehicles and 
farm equipment to engage in certain marketing practices with their 
dealers. In the great majority of cases in Canada franchise 
agreements provide that a dealer shall not carry any other line, or 
dual, without the written permission of the manufacturer. In 
practice permission is rarely forthcoming.
<P>
	There are generally two sets of consequences arising from this 
restrictive arrangement. In the first, the dealer's investment in one 
line of motor vehicles or farm equipment very often substantially 
exceeds the investment actually required to efficiently supply the 
sales and servicing demands faced by a particular a dealer in his or 
her market. In the second, a dealer may be forced to own several 
facilities selling different lines and may desire to amalgamate those 
brand lines under the same roof, thereby saving overhead and more 
efficiently utilizing his or her resources.
<P>
	Because of the current prohibitions on dualling found in 
Canadian dealership agreements in neither of these cases can the 
dealer take the sensible course of action he desires to take. Further, 
if the dealer proceeds to attempt to dual his facilities without 
manufacturer approval, which is rarely granted, his action would 
constitute cause for immediate termination by the manufacturer of 
his dealership rights.
<P>
	I believe all Canadian vehicle and farm equipment dealers aspire 
to having available to them the option of dualling, which their 
counterparts in so many U.S. states enjoy. Roughly 50 per cent of 
American automobile  dealers operate their dealerships as duals, in 
some cases with more than two lines. Why should anti-dualling 
provisions which prevent that right in Canada be lawful?
<P>
	By compelling manufacturers and distributors to allow their 
dealers the choice to offer one or more new lines of motor vehicles 
or farm equipment I believe two positive results would follow. 
First, the investment of the dealer would be utilized more 
efficiently and effectively. Second, the public in the dealer's 
market would be better served through a wider array of products 
and services.
<P>
	As it stands now, in virtually 100 per cent of motor vehicle and 
farm equipment franchise contracts in Canada the manufacturer 
has the authority to terminate the contract if the dealer does not 
abide by the manufacturer's rules of dealer purity. This whole issue 
was brought to my attention shortly after the last election.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	A constituent of mine who is a dealer in new and used farm 
equipment, and who has contracted with the Ford-New Holland 
company, wrote to me:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>While it is true we have all signed agreements alluding to the sale of 
competitive products, it should be noted that for many of us we had no option 
but to sign this agreement, for our ability to stay in business hinged on the 
exclusive availability of the Ford-New Holland line. If I chose not to sign, I 
would have lost the business my father and I worked 40 years to build. It is true 
that Ford-New Holland is not restricting the number of agencies we represent as 
long as they are housed in separate facilities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, most of the lines Ford-New Holland deems competitive do not 
represent enough volume to operate as a stand alone dealership. Therefore the 
demand for exclusivity leads to lessening and even elimination of competition. 
This policy has far reaching consequences to our customers as well. By reducing 
the number of agencies willing to handle a line, you also reduce availability of 
service and repair parts. Our farmers today do not need a further erosion of 
service.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why should rural dealers and farmers be denied reasonable 
access to all lines of agricultural equipment? As far as I am 
concerned, it is essential that dealers be given the freedom to carry 
more than one line of equipment to be of service to their farming 
customers.
<P>
	All major farm equipment associations across Canada have been 
lobbying the federal government for years to have this onerous 
restriction on their livelihoods loosened.
<P>
	The same is true of motor vehicle dealers. A 1993 survey of 
Canadian car dealers showed that about 50 per cent of the dealers 
would try to add another line if wide open dualling were permitted.
<P>
	Presently the Competition Act provides that exclusive dealing 
can be prohibited by the competition tribunal in very limited 
circumstances. Subsection 77(1) of the act defines exclusive 
dealings as any practice whereby a supplier of a product, as a 
condition of supplying the product to a customer, requires or 
induces a customer to  deal only or primarily in products 
designated or supplied by the supplier, or requires or induces the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1000"> 1000 </A></B>
<P>
customer not to deal in a specified products except as supplied by 
the supplier.
<P>
	Under subsection 77(2) of the act, the director of investigation 
and research can apply to the tribunal for an order to prohibit a 
supplier from continuing to engage in exclusive dealing only if 
three conditions are met: first, if the supplier is a major supplier or 
if the practice is widespread in the market; second, if the practice of 
exclusive dealing is likely to impede entry into or expansion of a 
firm in a market, or to impede the introduction of a product into or 
expansion of a product's sale in the market; third, if as a result of 
exclusive dealing competition is or is likely to be lessened 
substantially, that is, in a major way.
<P>
	In my opinion current anti-dualling provisions in Canada do 
fulfil elements one and two. However, element three, the 
substantial lessening of competition test imposed by the act for the 
director to be able to move against restrictions on competition 
occasioned by anti-dualling provisions, is unlikely to be clearly 
presented in the case of most vehicle and farm equipment 
dealerships in Canada.
<P>
	To be really affective and fair, an amendment to the act should 
not only allow for enforcement action against anti-dualling 
provisions in franchise agreements but should also be framed in 
such a way that a dealer or a member of the public injured by the 
existence or the enforcement of such a provision will have the right 
to take private action against the restrictive provision.
<P>
	Bill C-221 would effectively solve the problems created for 
dealers and the public through a simple prohibition of anti-dualling 
provisions in the franchise agreements. I also believe the bill has 
the benefit of brevity and clarity while identifying the restrictive 
conduct in those provisions as against the interests of the Canadian 
public.
<P>
	By utilizing a prohibition to deal with the anti-dualling 
provisions, Parliament would be enabling dealers and members of 
the public who suffer loss or damage to take legal action for 
recourse independent of any action which the Bureau of 
Competition Policy may or may not be able to undertake.
<P>
	Bill C-221's proposed prohibition of anti-dualling provisions 
will permit the crown to choose to proceed against an accused 
manufacturer by way of a summary conviction or by way of 
indictment. Typically the crown would proceed with a summary 
offence in less offensive cases and in the case of a first offender 
while reserving the potential for harsher penalties for cases of 
outlandish breaches and repeated violations by a manufacturer 
which has shown contempt for the law. This dual approach is seen 
in the act's treatment of misleading representation and has proved 
to work well.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	In the process which led to the drafting of this bill, some have 
questioned whether it is not unusual to be proposing legislation 
amending the Competition Act that would only apply to just one 
segment of the economy. Not at all. There are a number of industry 
specific provisions in the act. For example, section 5 deals with the 
exemption from the conspiracy provision of the act for security 
underwriters. Section 6 deals with amateur sport in relation to the 
act. Section 48 deals with conspiracies in professional sport. There 
is even a subsection which deals exclusively with soft drink 
franchisers.
<P>
	I suggest that the restrictions faced by dealers in motor vehicles 
and farm equipment are unique and particular to these types of 
dealerships.
<P>
	We do not see the same restrictions applied to dealers in 
electrical appliances or musical instruments. Though each may 
specialize in one particular brand, each is free to carry other brand 
names as he or she may sees fit.
<P>
	I am of the opinion that in the great majority of cases, when 
business is left alone, it tends to thrive when it is allowed to find its 
own solutions to problems that confront it. In that respect, I agree 
with the viewpoint that the role of government is to construct a 
framework that allows businesses to operate with the least amount 
of constraint.
<P>
	However, there are instances when government is called on to 
correct an inequity which threatens the livelihood of certain sectors 
of the economy. Over the past two years I have become convinced 
that the constraints faced by dealers in automobiles and farm 
equipment must be properly addressed.
<P>
	I feel it is very important that we give the small business 
community a break. The Prime Minister said a few days ago that it 
is time corporate Canada released its iron grip and did its part in 
allowing small businesses to expand and provide employment 
opportunities for Canadians.
<P>
	I believe my bill echoes that sentiment and I ask for support from 
all members.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
be able to speak this evening on Bill C-221, proposed by the hon. 
member for Lambton-Middlesex. This is a bill which regulates, or 
perhaps deregulates. It stops a manufacturer of motor vehicles, 
farm tractors or farm implements from preventing any dealer from 
selling other lines of products.
<P>
	Examining this deceptively short bill, I became aware that there 
were very serious consequences to accepting something like this. I 
wonder, in fact, whether the hon. member even took the time to 
examine the consequences to any extent.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1001"> 1001 </A></B>
<P>
	We are aware that this country has a debt load of approximately 
$600 billion at this time, and we also have our own individual 
debts. We each of us have fairly considerable debts ourselves, we 
are even probably more in debt than ever before. In other words 
consumer buying power is very low.
<P>
	The automobile and farm equipment industries are barely viable 
at this time. Many dealers are having trouble keeping their heads 
above water; many are losing money even. Changing the way 
dealerships and sales of farm and automotive products are 
organized too rapidly would be very problematical.
<P>
	We in Quebec-and I believe the same goes more or less for the 
rest of Canada-have a network of dealerships in place. In the past 
20 or 25 years, many new car dealerships have sprung up, and we 
have invested considerably in them. We have invested some 
$500,00 to $2 million in buildings and showrooms.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	Highly specialized equipment was bought, as required to 
perform automotive and tractor maintenance. As we all know, this 
kind of equipment is becoming more and more sophisticated, with 
state-of-the-art mechanisms, thus requiring sophisticated 
maintenance, which means that dealerships must invest substantial 
amounts to provide good customer service. Sales people must also 
be trained to sell specific makes of cars, tractors or farm 
machinery.
<P>
	All this means a great deal of expense for car and farm 
machinery dealerships and manufacturers. Very large sums 
amounts of money are spent on marketing this expensive and 
sophisticated equipment. Obviously it would be out of the question 
to change the whole marketing system overnight.
<P>
	Personally, I think it would be very dangerous and expensive to 
decide overnight to allow a car dealership to sell other makes of 
cars for example. That would probably be too easy.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. Say a dealership signs an 
agreement with a manufacturer to sell a line of cars with several 
models but later realizes that the models do not sell well or that it is 
unable to market the product properly. Because these models do not 
seem to sell, the owner decides, overnight, to start 
selling-assuming this was a GM or Pontiac-Buick 
dealership-Nissan or Toyota cars.
<P>
	I do not think the Nissan or Toyota dealer would be very pleased 
to see a GM dealer selling his products. He would probably choose 
the top-selling models to the detriment of those that are less 
popular and thus hurt his competitors.
<P>
	I am neither for nor against this bill, but after examining it, it 
seems to me that there are serious risks to passing this type of bill. 
It would certainly be very  important to allow a period of 
adjustment. Certainly, five or ten years, and maybe longer should 
be allowed to change this marketing structure, which has been in 
place in Canada and the United States-but we are concerned here 
with Canada-for years, and particularly for the last 25 years, 
during which automobile and farm equipment dealers have 
invested large amounts of money.
<P>
	I am sure that if we began to upset this marketing approach, 
chances are there would be a considerable number of bankruptcies, 
and many jobs lost. That is why I mentioned at the beginning of my 
speech that we are not in a period where we should make changes 
too quickly. A lot of jobs could be lost. What we need now is to 
create jobs, but I think that we would risk losing a lot of jobs if we 
turn the existing marketing structure for automobiles and farm 
equipment upside down.
<P>
	I would suggest that the hon. member continue to examine and 
work on her bill. She could try to form a small committee to 
analyse, to question witnesses from the makers, for example, to ask 
them their opinion.
<P>
<B>(1840)</B>
<P>
	What do consumers think of it? What do dealers think of it. They 
should be asked because I am not even sure that a consumer would 
feel very secure if he saw a large car dealer, in Montreal or Toronto, 
selling a dozen lines of automobile and a hundred or so models. I 
cannot see the consumer being reassured, knowing the complexity 
of the service and the guarantee.
<P>
	Would he feel secure about after sales service? The consumer 
might also perhaps have doubts. Can certain monopolies arise 
among automobile dealers? Large dealers could sell several makes 
and decide on the prices, as if they had a monopoly. Prices would 
then increase.
<P>
	The hon. member said that prices might go down, but it could 
also be the reverse. In the long term, prices might go up, because 
there would monopolies in the distribution and sale of motor 
vehicles or farm equipment. This could indeed be a danger in the 
long term and should be thoroughly examined.
<P>
	It may be that remote areas need dealers selling several makes of 
cars or tractors. It might be a good thing in this case. However, 
would dealers selling several makes of cars or tractors be in a 
position to adequately service the vehicles bought by consumers 
for a rather large sum of money?
<P>
	A farm tractor costing $100,000, $150,000 or $200,000 is a 
major investment. I think that consumers would be concerned if a 
dealer sold too many makes of tractors.
<P>
	I can understand a dealer in a remote area saying that he will not 
survive if he can only sell one make of tractors. That may be the 
case. But then again, perhaps that dealer should have a smaller 
franchise that better reflects the size of the local market.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1002"> 1002 </A></B>
<P>
	Again, I am not opposed to this idea, but I feel that this bill 
could cause major upheaval. The marketing structure that has been 
in place for many years works rather well and seems to meet the 
demands of consumers. Changing that structure could be quite 
risky.
<P>
	It would also set a precedent. For example, suppose that a 
Saint-Hubert BBQ restaurant in Quebec does not do very well. 
Could the manager of that restaurant start selling burgers from 
McDonald's to improve sales?
<P>
	If we agree to do that for motor vehicles, people in the food 
industry might want the same. When you think of it, a person 
becomes a dealer of his own free will. He signs an agreement with 
the maker of a car or farm tractor of his own accord, whereby he 
agrees to sell only certain models and makes.
<P>
	In that sense, the current act gives a person the opportunity to 
choose the products he wants to sell. If, some day, that person 
realizes that the products he sells no longer meet his expectations, 
he can always sell his business to someone else.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to take part in the debate this evening on Bill C-221.
<P>
	As a former machinery dealer and one who was involved in the 
industry for a good many years, I can tell the House that the bill has 
significant importance to me, as I believe it does for most of us in 
the House.
<P>
	I am in complete support of this private member's bill as 
proposed by the hon. member for Lambton-Middlesex, which is a 
neighbouring riding to mine. I would like to commend my 
colleague for her efforts to amend the Competition Act.
<P>
<B>(1845)</B>
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to put an end to a restriction in almost 
all franchise agreements that does not allow car or farm equipment 
dealers to sell a competitor's product. This practice is known as 
dualing.
<P>
	As members will know, dealers are only allowed to display and 
sell the products of the manufacturer or distributor with which they 
have a franchise agreement because the agreement contains 
anti-dualing clauses.
<P>
	In some cases the franchise agreement states that a dealer cannot 
dual without the written permission of the manufacturer. In 
practice such permission is rarely given. Franchise agreements can 
be cancelled and torn up by the manufacturer or the distributor if a 
dealer sells another line of products. For example, a John Deere 
dealer cannot sell New Holland tractors.
<P>
	I have talked to the local farm equipment dealers having a part in 
those organizations over the years in my riding and in other areas of 
the province and country.  They basically support this bill. They 
want to be able to sell more than one line of product.
<P>
	Dealers with a franchise agreement are also required to invest 
large sums for facilities, equipment, personnel and training in order 
to provide the sales and servicing deemed necessary by the 
manufacturer. Sometimes the dealer's investment in inventory and 
overhead required by the manufacturer is more than economically 
practical, thus tying up funds that could potentially be used to sell 
and service a competitor's line if the dealer was allowed to do so.
<P>
	In small rural areas it makes sense to offer variety. A Case IH 
dealer, for example, may not be able to go it alone but if allowed to 
combine with another product, could stay in business.
<P>
	Franchise agreements with anti-dualing provisions are 
restrictive and should be trashed. Dealers are unable to provide 
their customers with the choice from more than one line and 
consumers are not given the advantage of being able to compare 
and chose between competing lines of product. This problem 
becomes more significant in communities and markets not big 
enough to justify a dealer making a large investment to sell only 
one line.
<P>
	It is interesting and ironic to point out that franchise agreements 
with anti-dualing provisions are illegal in many American states 
such as Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire and others. The threat of 
termination of an agreement is grounds for a civil suit in the U.S.
<P>
	If American dealers have operated successfully for years without 
anti-dualing provisions, there is no justifiable reason whatsoever 
that Canadian manufacturers and distributors can argue to maintain 
them in this country. On top of that, many of these American 
companies, such farm equipment dealers, are allowed different 
products in the U.S., but these same dealers in Canada are not. This 
is a farce.
<P>
	Canadian laws do not protect our car and farm equipment dealers 
from unfair franchise agreements. Current laws are not adequate in 
their terms or satisfactory in their enforcement to strike down 
anti-dualing provisions. Bill C-221 proposes an amendment to the 
Competition Act that will disallow anti-dualing provisions in 
franchise agreements. It will put us on a level playing field with the 
U.S. and help our small business people compete in our own 
markets.
<P>
	Last year one automaker in Canada recognized that sales were 
plunging and agreed to allow its dealers to sell cars from other 
companies. Mazda Canada Incorporated was the first to do so, but 
others are sure to follow. Mazda had built a very large dealer 
network but it was not selling enough cars to justify it.
<P>
	Today's market calls for diversification. Consumers will head to 
the dealer with the most selection. Competition is healthy. I believe 
it is the government's responsibility to provide a climate that will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1003"> 1003 </A></B>
<P>
end  anti-dualing provisions in franchise agreements to allow 
dealers to sell products from competing manufacturers.
<P>
	Manufacturers, distributors or suppliers can argue that scrapping 
anti-dualing rules is not the way to go. First, they may suggest 
dealer loyalty will be diluted if they are allowed to sell products 
from more than one producer. Dealer loyalty should be earned by a 
manufacturer, not forced or coerced by the threat of termination of 
an agreement. Imagine if a grocery store were only allowed to sell 
one brand of peanut butter.
<P>
	Selling competing brands allows the consumer to choose. Again 
this is a capitalist system. This bill will strengthen and enhance the 
free market system.
<P>
	Second, manufacturers may argue customer loyalty will be lost 
if dealers are selling products from competing manufacturers. I 
submit that customers will remain loyal to a dealer as long as they 
feel they are being dealt with fairly. I also submit a customer will 
remain loyal to a dealer that does offer them the choice of more 
than one product. Service and selection are the two main reasons 
for shopping for and buying any product, whether it is a car, a seed 
drill, a planter or a new suit.
<P>
<B>(1850)</B>
<P>
	Third, manufacturers may threaten to take away exclusive 
distribution of their parts from dealers. That is exactly what this is: 
a threat that could be used by a manufacturer against a dealer that 
takes legal action against anti-dualing provisions.
<P>
	Fourth, a manufacturer may claim if anti-dualing is prohibited 
that a car or farm equipment dealer would or could become a 
monopoly supplier in the local market. But, on the other hand, is 
that not what a manufacturer is promoting if he argues that no other 
product line can be sold out of that dealership?
<P>
	Another argument that could be brought forward if an end to 
anti-dualing practices is put into effect is that the number of dealers 
will decrease. However, we have to recognize that this is reality in 
today's marketplace. Companies are diversifying in order to 
survive. Today, as many MPs from rural areas will know, the farm 
equipment dealers are gone. There used to be five in the town of 
Dresden, a town of 2,800, and today there are no dealers left in that 
community.
<P>
	In summary, Bill C-221 will allow for automotive and farm 
equipment dealers to sell products from competing manufacturers. 
This is diversification. The more selection dealers have to offer 
consumers, the more likely their businesses will prosper. The 
amendments in the bill are good for business and they are good for 
the consumer, who will benefit from more selection.
<P>
	I applaud my colleague from Lambton-Middlesex for coming 
forward with this bill. She truly represents her constituents from 
her mainly rural riding in southwestern Ontario. As was mentioned 
last night during private  member's hour on Bill C-201, partisan 
politics has no place during Private Members' Business.
<P>
	I urge all members from all parties to support Bill C-221. It 
makes sense, it will enhance competition and it will put our small 
business entrepreneurs on a level playing field with those in the 
U.S. That is the direction in which we should be going.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe there are three or four members 
who wish to speak. Unfortunately, we are going to be short of time. 
I would ask members if they would be so kind as to keep their 
remarks a bit shorter than they might otherwise intend.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to observe your request.
<P>
	I would like to commend the intent which the hon. member for 
Lambton-Middlesex has presented in Bill C-221. The intent of 
trying to create more competition and providing a more 
competitive marketplace is a good idea. Some of the things which 
the hon. member is trying to achieve are laudable and worthwhile.
<P>
	I certainly agree with the previous speaker that this is not a 
partisan issue. It is a good idea to observe that, especially when we 
are debating Private Members' Business.
<P>
	I would like to look at this from the perspective of the principle 
of legislation. The legislation should be supported by principle. 
The principle which is involved in this legislation is that it should 
encourage and maintain competition and entrepreneurship, as well 
as providing a level playing field.
<P>
	Another characteristic is that it should be enforceable. That 
means it has to be clear, it has to be reasonable and, of course, it has 
to enjoy general public support. Those are rather significant 
matters of principle which any bill should have.
<P>
	I would like to briefly refer to the provisions in the current 
legislation. It is very interesting what section 77(2) states. It states 
that the the director of investigation and research can apply to the 
tribunal for an order prohibiting a supplier from continuing to 
engage in exclusive dealings, if the supplier is a major supplier or if 
the practice is widespread in the market, and if the practice of 
exclusive dealing is likely to impede entry into or expansion of a 
firm in a market, or to impede the introduction of a product into or 
expansion of a product sales in the market, or to have any other 
exclusionary effect on the market, and if as a result of the practice 
of exclusive dealing competition is or is likely to be lessened 
substantially, that is, in a major way.
<P>
<B>(1855)</B>
<P>
	I would respectfully suggest that the provisions in the current 
legislation are adequate. Their enforcement however is very 
inadequate. The hon. member in this legislation is trying to find a 
way to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1004"> 1004 </A></B>
<P>
have the provisions  that are contained in the existing legislation 
enforced more equitably and a little more easily.
<P>
	If that is the issue, then the bill goes too far. It applies exactly the 
same way as the bill is being proposed to urban situations where 
there are very dense centres of population and to areas where there 
is sparse population. The problems of doing business are different 
in a highly concentrated population centre as compared with a 
sparsely settled area.
<P>
	The intent of her legislation would definitely appeal and apply to 
the sparsely settled population centre. I could not agree more. I am 
not sure however that the same universal application would be 
equally well supported in large cities like Edmonton, or Toronto, or 
Ottawa for that matter.
<P>
	Perhaps the question is, should we not provide for a more 
effective enforcement mechanism of the current legislation? I do 
believe, and the hon. member for Huron-Bruce indicated this, that 
Mazda had recognized that they should allow dual lines to boost the 
sales of their Mazda line. It is great. It is wonderful. That is the 
kind of line that the market will provide.
<P>
	The legislation should allow for that freedom to exist. Where 
that freedom is interfered with, the director under the existing 
Competition Act should be allowed to interfere. The reason why he 
does not interfere is not totally clear to me. In the background 
information the indication was made that resources are inadequate 
for the director to actually pursue these kinds of deviations from 
the intent of the law.
<P>
	I would respectfully suggest to the House that the appropriate 
resources be made available to the director so that he or she can 
prosecute those people who are not meeting the intent of the 
legislation. We need to be very careful about that sort of thing.
<P>
	Something else exists in the current legislation which I believe is 
very inadequate. I would like to refer to some of the notes that the 
hon. member did make available to my office, which I really 
appreciate. I would like to read this into the record: ``The exclusive 
dealing provision of the act gives exclusive jurisdiction to the 
director to move against restrictions on competition such as those 
inherent in anti-dualing provisions''.
<P>
	That is correct. That exclusive prosecution capability ought to be 
included in the dealer's ability to go to the tribunal and alert them 
that there is a problem. I would agree.
<P>
	Perhaps the amendment includes that. But the amendment would 
have been more appropriate if that could have been expanded so 
that dealers could do that.
<P>
	The next paragraph goes on: ``Therefore individual dealers 
whose businesses are injured by the restrictions contained in 
anti-dualing simply do not have the right to instigate proceedings''. 
That is the point and I agree  completely with it. I know the hon. 
member said the amendment does that but I am not quite convinced 
that it does. Section 77(2) or earlier sections which give the 
director that exclusive right have not been eliminated. Therefore a 
different set of litigation laws has to be appealed to in order to 
make happen what the hon. member suggested would happen.
<P>
	Finally, to be really effective and fair, an amendment to the act 
should not only allow for enforcement action against anti-dualing 
provisions in franchise agreements but also should be framed in 
such a way that a dealer or a member of the public-we are adding 
the member of the public now-who is injured by the existence or 
enforcement of such provisions will have the right to take private 
action against the restrictive provisions.
<P>
	Those are the kinds of things that I believe should be included in 
the amendment to the current Competition Act. I agree with that 
and support it.
<P>
<B>(1900)</B>
<P>
	I find myself not in opposition to the bill but suggesting that 
some changes could be made that would make it a little more 
effective and that would make a distinction between the sparsely 
populated centre versus the densely populated centre because the 
problems are different. I know the sparsely populated centres are 
the ones where the current anti-dualling provisions handicap the 
dealers tremendously. They do not do the kinds of things the 
member is trying to do with this bill. I agree completely with that.
<P>
	Perhaps this will improve it a little. Maybe the next time we 
come at this we will have it put together the way we need it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is indeed a great honour for me to support private 
member's Bill C-221 presented by my esteemed colleague from 
Lambton-Middlesex. The issue at hand is a grave one for many of 
my constituents. I will digress for a moment to respond to the 
member from the third party with regard to three of the 
observations he made.
<P>
	The first is in relation to sparsity. The city I come from was so 
sparse that all the dealers left, that is 10,000. We must be careful 
when we talk about sparsity. What does sparsity mean? For people 
in rural Saskatchewan everything is fairly sparse. We have to 
ensure that dealers have a place and that they are protected.
<P>
	Let me go one step further and consider a company like 
McDonald's. Anyone who competes against McDonald's wants to 
be located right next door because he likes the competition. Yet 
within the framework of these large companies they are telling the 
John Deere dealer not to move beyond the scope of John Deere.
<P>
	People travel hundreds of miles to get parts and this dealer who 
is having trouble competing in the world  around him adds one or 
two parts to provide that level of service, and they are prepared to 
see him lose his dealership. On the other hand if they were really 
competitive and open minded individuals they would say: ``No, 
John Deere we want you to handle that and we want you to handle 
Case as well. If our machinery is the kind of machinery we say it is, 
ours will be selected over Case anyway''. I appreciate what my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1005"> 1005 </A></B>
<P>
hon. friend from Huron-Bruce who was in that business had to 
offer on this very important topic.
<P>
	With regard to the proposal in Bill C-221, the machinery dealers 
are now saying they are prepared to go along with the proposal on 
this type of thinking: ``We will step in and allow you to sell 
combines, but we will not allow you to sell tractors''. They are 
going to move in and add additional pressure on the people who are 
providing that service on their behalf.
<P>
	I support the bill. I think the bill is well framed. We do have to 
look at it. The question was raised of why does somebody not move 
in and take some action against this inappropriate behaviour? That 
small dealer is not going to go against his company because his 
survival is based on that company's supporting him with that 
machinery. If he loses that line, he is out of business. In rural 
Saskatchewan when someone comes to pick up his machinery, he 
picks up his fuel, he picks up his food and he picks up his mail. It is 
another way to ensure that rural Saskatchewan, rural Manitoba and 
rural Canada in general will eventually die.
<P>
	It is incumbent on all of us to do something as we speak on this 
very important private member's bill. Again I commend the 
member for Lambton-Middlesex for having the courage to come 
forward and say there is something in this private member's bill 
that we want everyone to look at. The time has come for us to set 
aside our personal feelings and ask: Is it good for Canada? Is it 
good for rural Canada? Is it good for all of us? Can we support it? 
In my opinion, we can support it and we will support it.
<P>
<B>(1905)</B>
<P>
	I sincerely thank my friend opposite for allowing me the 
privilege of taking part in this very serious discussion. I look 
forward to the statements from my fellow MPs from 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important 
private members' initiative.
<P>
	I too wish to congratulate the member for Lambton-Middlesex 
for her dedication to this issue. She and her office have worked 
diligently with some in the industry to achieve a goal. I am very 
happy to spend time in support of her work.
<P>
	I was very pleased to hear the interventions of the other members 
this afternoon which indicated that there is a great need to make 
changes in the Competition Act  to support the communities we 
represent and the economy of our country. At the same time, the 
debate indicates there is considerable support for the bill and the 
ideas that go along with strengthening the bill.
<P>
	The member for Huron-Bruce gave us a good indication about 
what someone from within the industry thinks of the need for the 
bill. I was grateful for his intervention because it strengthened my 
confidence in the overall outlook on the bill.
<P>
	For the benefit of those who are hearing about this for the first 
time, Bill C-221 is an act to amend the Competition Act, which 
creates an offence for manufacturers and distributors of motor 
vehicles and farm equipment to engage in certain marketing 
practices with their dealers. In virtually all cases, franchise 
agreements provide that a dealer shall not carry any other line or 
``dual'' without the written permission of the manufacturer. In 
practice we know that permission is rarely forthcoming.
<P>
	I come from a farming area in northern Saskatchewan where the 
communities are very small. The people who farm in those 
communities have great distances to travel for their support. In the 
past, farm dealers have driven throughout our area as they do in 
other parts of Canada. Over the years, the economics of rural 
Canada with a sparse population with decreasing incomes from the 
farm have led to a lot of changes in the way in which the agriculture 
industry is serviced. Where we once had many dealers, we now 
have a handful.
<P>
	It makes it very difficult because there are many different 
product lines and there is a lot of loyalty to the original product 
lines on the farms scattered throughout northwest Saskatchewan 
and elsewhere. Fewer dealers and a great number of product lines 
results in many farmers finding it difficult to obtain the parts and 
service for the equipment they originally bought.
<P>
	This private members' initiative gives the opportunity to some 
of the dealers currently carrying single product lines to recognize, 
understand and support the marketplace within their area. Many 
different product lines are not able to be serviced under the current 
arrangements. It would be marvellous if the local single product 
line dealer in one community could provide parts and service for 
many of the product lines that exist within that dealer's community. 
It would be of great benefit to the whole region.
<P>
<B>(1910)</B>
<P>
	At the same time, there might be an opportunity for new 
dealerships to open their doors, servicing not just one product line 
but several product lines. They could service the entire community. 
Rural Saskatchewan, particularly the remote rural part where 
several members of this House come from, is currently so 
underserviced by the equipment dealers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1006"> 1006 </A></B>
<P>
	I am very proud of the equipment dealers that currently function 
within northwest Saskatchewan and Saskatchewan in general. 
They have had a very difficult time throughout the past 10 years 
with the decline in farm prices. They have stuck with their 
communities and they work hard in them. Quite often they and 
their staff volunteer their time in the communities for everything 
from coaching minor hockey and baseball through to calling some 
of the church bingos that still exist throughout the riding. I am 
very grateful that those people are able to contribute to the 
communities in the way they do. This legislation offers greater 
opportunities for those people to remain in our communities and 
for others like them to find themselves there as well.
<P>
	I do not want to go on at great length because there are others 
who wish to speak to this bill. The restrictions that have been put in 
place have certainly increased costs and reduced availability within 
the marketplace. I hope that this bill has the support of the 
members of the House.
<P>
	The member for Lambton-Middlesex has certainly done her 
homework with regard to this bill. She has talked to everyone in the 
industry from the Ontario Farm Implements Dealers Association 
through to dealers across Canada. I know they have contacted her 
because some of them from Saskatchewan have contacted me 
asking to whom they can direct some of their information, concerns 
and support.
<P>
	I am also aware that the Minister of Industry has tried to address 
this issue through the competitions bureau and that earlier this year 
the competitions bureau was to hold hearings and should have 
reported on this. I would have been happier to be standing here 
today supporting a government bill that I knew was going through 
all three readings in this House and that I could vote in favour of to 
ensure that with government support the legislation would go 
through and this would have full government support.
<P>
	In the absence of government support and in the absence of a bill 
presented by the Minister of Industry, I am very happy to be able to 
stand today and support the private member's initiative by the 
member for Lambton-Middlesex. As I said earlier, I commend 
the bill to the House. I would hope that members of the House will 
find it in their power to put some pressure on the government to see 
that this type of legislation finds its way into reality.
<P>
	The member's diligence, dedication and hard work in this regard 
should have its rewards. I only hope that they are forthcoming.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak on private member's 
Bill C-221 as introduced by my colleague representing the riding of 
<P>
Lambton-Middlesex. I congratulate and thank my colleague for 
the work and research she has put into this bill.
<P>
<B>(1915 )</B>
<P>
	This bill proposes to amend the Competition Act by making it a 
criminal offence to prohibit manufacturers and distributors of 
motor vehicles and farm equipment from engaging in certain 
marketing practices with their dealers.
<P>
	As I understand it, the purpose of the bill is to improve the 
efficiency of dealer operations. The view has been expressed by my 
colleague that restrictive arrangements between manufacturers and 
dealers prohibiting the the practice of dualling may result in 
inefficiencies for dealers in the sales and servicing of motor 
vehicles and farm equipment.
<P>
	The objective of increasing efficiencies is a valid one in the 
context of competition legislation. Promoting efficiency and 
adaptability of the Canadian economy is specifically cited at 
section 1.1, the purpose clause of the act, as one of the principle 
purposes of the legislation. The provisions of the Competition Act 
have been created with this objective in mind.
<P>
	The second objective addressed in Bill C-221 is to protect and 
encourage franchise dealers operating throughout the country by 
allowing them greater opportunity to realize gains in efficiency in 
their operations. Small and medium size businesses are at the very 
heart of our country and their success is key to the growth of the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	Accordingly, this objective is equally as important and 
noteworthy and is also recognized in existing competition 
legislation. It is recognized throughout the specific provisions of 
the Competition Act, which have been created with this purpose in 
mind, and more specifically in the purpose clause which provides 
that the purpose of the act is to ensure that small and medium size 
enterprises have an equitable opportunity to participate in the 
Canadian economy.
<P>
	While the objective of the proposed legislation to control the 
anti-competitive consequences of prohibitions against dualling is 
worthwhile and should be supported and encouraged, the proposed 
bill is not the most appropriate for ensuring this objective.
<P>
	A provision which addresses the very same objectives and 
conduct as the proposed bill attempts to address can already be 
found in section 77 of the act. This section deals with the issues of 
exclusive dealing. In order to understand why the existing 
provisions are more appropriate than those found in Bill C-221 to 
address the conduct complained of, it is important to consider the 
Competition Act and the structure under which it has been created.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1007"> 1007 </A></B>
<P>
	The current legislation is a framework law of general 
application. It applies with some notable exceptions to all sectors 
of the Canadian economy, namely manufacturing, resources and 
services. The law touches on the everyday life of all Canadians 
by maintaining and encouraging competition in the marketplace 
with the objective of providing consumers with competitive prices 
and a variety of choices in the goods and services they buy.
<P>
	Competition policy is a fundamental element in the 
government's economic framework aimed at fostering efficiency, 
adaptability, innovation and growth in the Canadian economy.
<P>
	Bill C-221 would create criminal offences punishable on 
summary conviction or on indictment with the possibility of a fine 
in the discretion of the court or imprisonment for a term of up to 
five years. It is important to remember that criminal law is a 
powerful legislative tool, one that ought to be used with restraint.
<P>
	In particular, this is a legislative tool that ought to be invoked in 
limited circumstances. It should be invoked in respect of conduct 
that gives rise to clear, serious harm and in respect of types of 
conduct that are likely to be harmful across a wide variety of 
economic conditions and business circumstances.
<P>
	This is why the Competition Act has been drafted to include both 
criminal prohibitions and civil reviewable matters. Criminal law 
should be reserved for the most serious acts where it is clear that a 
particular conduct should be outlawed. Offences of the act which 
fall into this category include conspiracy and bid rigging.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Competition Act contains other matters 
which are not criminal prohibitions but are categorized under the 
legislation as matters that may be reviewed by the competition 
tribunal, an administrative body under a civil standard of proof.
<P>
<B>(1920 )</B>
<P>
	The tribunal may make remedial orders to overcome the effects 
of such practices but penal consequences are not imposed for a 
violation of these provisions.
<P>
	Bill C-221 would create an absolute prohibition and declare 
certain conduct undesirable in all circumstances without 
recognizing that circumstances may equally exist which would 
make the conduct pro-competitive or competitively neutral.
<P>
	This issue will certainly be raised in committee when we discuss 
the amendments to the Competition Act once they are introduced.

<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 deemed 
to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="SECURITIES">SECURITIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in this 
House, on March 13, I questioned the President of the Treasury 
Board about his intention to establish a Canadian securities 
commission. I pointed out to the minister that the various 
provincial securities commissions were already busy setting up the 
system for electronic document analysis and retrieval, commonly 
known as SEDAR. This new system, which should be operational 
in a few months, will ensure a true integration of financial markets. 
The funniest part of it is that the minister seemed totally unaware 
of the very existence of the system.
<P>
	On this issue as on many others, the federal government is 
showing that good intentions do not necessarily give good results.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois understands that a degree of harmonization 
is required between the various provincial commissions for the 
sake of efficiency and effectiveness. The private sector also came 
to that conclusion, and that is why, in a very near future, SEDAR 
will make the issue of securities easier between provinces.
<P>
	The system that the federal government intends to establish, on 
the other hand, has nothing to do with wanting to simplify the 
process; chances are it is yet another attempt at centralizing and 
interfering. The idea is not new, by the way. Aggressive action to 
create a Canada-wide securities commission was undertaken as 
early as in 1964 by a royal commission. In 1979, another attempt 
was devised in the form of a draft bill. Finally, less than three years 
ago, the premiers of the maritime provinces also called for the 
establishment of a Canadian securities commission.
<P>
	As is its custom, the federal government is once again 
duplicating what the provinces are already doing, without worrying 
about costs or effectiveness. To add insult to injury, it wants to 
interfere in an area in which the private sector is about to 
harmonize the rules in co-operation with the other provinces. 
Federal-provincial overlap? Totally out of the question, Mr. 
Speaker.
<P>
	At a time when socio-economic stakeholders in Montreal 
deplore the serious economic problems plaguing Quebec's largest 
city, the federal government is once again trying to steer financial 
operations toward Toronto. Brokers, lawyers, accountants in the 
financial sector might be forced to leave Montreal for Toronto.
<P>
	This is the effect the creation of a Canadian securities 
commission would have, by centralizing financial activity  on that 
Ontario metropolis. It is not, moreover, mere happenstance that the 
English speaking provinces, and Ottawa, are trying to isolate 
Quebec and to force its commission to be subservient to the 
Canadian one.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1008"> 1008 </A></B>
<P>
	The government must put an end right now to its centralist plans 
for the Montreal region, which are prejudicial to that region. Let us 
keep in mind that, only days ago in the throne speech, the federal 
government announced its intention to face up to the realities of the 
20th century, and to withdraw from areas of provincial jurisdiction 
as much as possible.
<P>
	Now, only a few days later, it makes a complete about face and 
wants to interfere in an area where the provinces and the private 
sector are managing very well.
<P>
	We see clearly what is going on now; those old ghosts of 
centralization are still haunting this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has asked a question 
about the system for electronic document analysis and retrieval, or 
SEDAR.
<P>
	It would perhaps be useful to tell the House what SEDAR does. 
SEDAR makes it possible to transmit documents electronically to 
securities commissions and to create an electronic data base 
accessible to the public.
<P>
	Rather than being mailed to each of the provincial 
administrations, as is now the case, documents would go out once 
electronically. For us and for those involved in the securities 
market, this is clearly a welcome measure. In fact, if we were to set 
up a Canadian securities commission, SEDAR would be an 
essential part of it.
<P>
	With the advent of SEDAR, the Canadian securities commission 
is not superseded. In itself, SEDAR does not eliminate the overlap 
in the present securities regulation system in Canada. It does not 
solve the problem of approving prospectuses and registering 
brokers. The approval of at least 12 regulating bodies is still 
required.
<P>
	It does not eliminate the inconsistencies in the application of 
provincial rules, the discrepancies in execution, or the time and 
effort necessary to co-ordinate the policies of provincial 
administrations.
<P>
	The commission would promote the effective application of 
regulation and improve access to Canadian financial markets. As 
financial markets are increasingly linked to foreign markets, we 
must increase the efficiency of our markets in order for our 
businesses to be competitive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The motion to adjourn the House is now 
deemed to have been adopted. Accordingly, the House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m.
