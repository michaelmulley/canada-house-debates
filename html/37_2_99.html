Before I get into the main part of my speech I want to congratulate the government and the special legislative committee on Bill C-17 for passing 25 amendments that deleted the expression “inexplosive ammunition component” from part 7 of Bill C-17.  We worked very hard in  trying to get rid of these particular parts of the bill.  It was just absurd that they were being put into legislation.  It would have created another mess, probably  similar to the firearms fiasco.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular I would like to thank the office of the member for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam for working with my office to identify, draft and submit the amendments for consideration by the committee. I must also recognize the member for Churchill, as her office also submitted identical amendments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee owes a debt of gratitude to James M. Hinter, national president, and David A. Tomlinson, legal chairman, of the  National Firearms Association, as well as Tony Bernardo, the executive director of the Canadian Shooting Sports Association, for appearing before us and encouraging us to stop short of “criminalizing brass and lead”, in Mr. Hinter's words, and, in the words of Tony Bernardo, “regulating little bits of margarine containers,  little pieces of cotton fabric and fishing sinkers”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee must also thank those members of Canada's film and television community who wrote to committee members to inform us of the negative impact, especially on the production of action movies, of including the term “inexplosive ammunition component” in part 7 of Bill C-17.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words “inexplosive ammunition component” first appeared in part V of Bill C-42. That was  the first predecessor of Bill C-17 which we are debating today. They appeared on November 22, 2001.  That bill was so flawed that the government withdrew it four months later, but in the interim, a Library of Parliament research paper prepared on January 18, 2002, by Gérald Lafrenière, pointed out the potential problems of regulating inexplosive ammunition components.  Naturally, when the Liberals brought back Bill C-42 as Bill C-55 on April 29, 2002, I hoped that   they had read the Library of Parliament report.  They had not and on May 9, 2002, exactly a year ago today, I told the House the following:</p>

The government has not told us how it thinks anyone can make an explosive from an inexplosive ammunition component.  The definition in the act states “inexplosive ammunition component” means any  cartridge case or bullet, or any projectile that is used in a firearm as defined in section 2 of the criminal code.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was exactly a year ago today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-55 died on the Order Paper on September 16, 2002, and was brought back in slightly modified form as Bill C-17 on October 21.  Again the Liberals missed the opportunity to delete the term “inexplosive ammunition component” from the bill.  On Monday, November 18, 2002, I spoke on Bill C-17 at second reading and once again called for removal of all references to “inexplosive ammunition components” from the bill.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am glad to note that some of the members of other parties were listening.  I believe that the hard work of members of the firearms community, the film and television community and  various members of the committee, including the members for Port Moody—Coquitlam—Port Coquitlam and Churchill, as well as some of the Liberal members, helped to convince a majority of Liberal members of the committee that this particular change was essential to making Bill C-17 more acceptable to Canadians, and I thank them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite clear that the committee state version of Bill C-17 is a definite improvement over Bill C-42 as first presented 17 months ago, but more changes, particularly in the area of increased parliamentary scrutiny, are required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Canadians were prepared to sacrifice their liberties for the promise of increased security in the aftermath of September 11, that feeling has faded in the intervening year and a half. For this reason, the government would be wise to carefully consider increased parliamentary scrutiny on the same level as the Emergencies Act if it wants opposition parties to support Bill C-17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report stage of Bill C-17, an act to amend certain Acts of Canada, and to enact measures for implementing the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, in order to enhance public safety,  otherwise known as the Public Safety Act, will be the subject of the rest of my speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to divide my remarks in the remaining time I have into three general categories:  general comments on the bill, continuing concerns about the bill's broad use of interim orders, and our reaction to what the committee did. I have already done the third part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to trace a little of the history of the bill because those watching and reading the <i>Hansard</i> record will of course probably forget how this all began. There are many parts of it that go to trying to make Canadians feel safe in a post-September 11 world, but that is part of the bill's problem.  It was first drafted in reaction to the terrible terrorist attack on the United States on September 11, 2001.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I end my remarks today, I would like to make this point.  If the true measure of a man is what he does rather than what he says, then the measure of a country must be in part its reaction to times of trial and stress.  In the United States 10 days after the September 11 attack, Senator Fritz Hollings was on his feet to introduce America's reaction,  S.1447, “a bill to improve aviation security, and for other purposes”.  With lightning speed, and despite an anthrax scare on Capitol Hill, both the House of Representatives and the Senate quickly passed the legislation and President Bush signed it on November 19, 2001.  That is right: from the time the first airplane hit the first tower to the moment President Bush signed his approval of the new bill, barely 10 weeks passed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the same 10 weeks this Liberal government slept. In fact it was a full three days after President Bush signed the U.S. law that this Liberal government tabled the first version of the public safety act, then called Bill C-42, on November 22. That bill lived for five months, never went to any committee and was withdrawn on April 24, 2002.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five days later, the Liberal government introduced Bill C-42's replacement, Bill C-55. It was so complex that a special committee was struck on May 9 solely for the purpose of studying it, but that committee never met. Bill C-55 died on the Order Paper on September 16, 2002, when Parliament prorogued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think we can get the drift.  Inaction is what marked this government.  In fact, the current legislation, Bill C-17, was not tabled in the House until October 31, 2002, fully 13 months after the September 11 attack and nearly 11 months after President Bush signed America's aviation and transportation security act into legislation as public law 107-71.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is now May 9, 2003, and this bill is just coming back to us from a special legislative committee. There will be debate and hopefully further amendments, and then votes. Then the bill will presumably be referred to the Senate for deliberation. It is unlikely that Bill C-17 will be ready to receive royal assent before October.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 11 happened and the U.S. had a law signed by the President and in place on November 18, roughly two months later. Canada will not have its law in place until nearly two years have passed. That is simply unacceptable. If it takes a Liberal dominated Parliament two years to react to a major crisis, that is a strong argument for a change in government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to conclude by making people aware that the government should be judged by what it does, not by what it says, and that this bill is a clear indication of the inaction of the government in the face of a crisis.</p><A NAME="Int-541498"></A><a HREF="#Int-541511"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541489"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Steve Mahoney (Secretary of State (Selected Crown Corporations), Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, before I was given the opportunity to work on my current responsibilities for crown corporations, I was parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Transport and assigned the task of trying to shepherd this bill through committee. I have been away from it for a little while, but I am pleased to have an opportunity to comment on some of the issues that people are concerned about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members opposite, particularly the Canadian Alliance, tend to want to hold up the United States as the way to do things. The previous speaker said that President Bush did this and he did that following September 11. One of the things that is interesting about the U.S. system is that when a crisis occurs, the American people, the congress, the senate, and everybody in Washington tends to get behind the president regardless of his political stripe. They tend to rally around the flag. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the differences in our situation, for better or for worse, is that no such thing ever happens. In fact, I find that the opposition use every opportunity it can to somehow blame the government for everything from the weather to whatever we can imagine. It is an interesting approach.  We give the member what he wants.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said at the beginning of his remarks that he was pleased that the government had eliminated certain issues. Some witnesses who appeared before the committee, and I was there for many meetings until this recent appointment, expressed their strong concerns about the effect of the inclusion of inexplosive ammunition components in part 7 of the bill.  This is an issue that this member, in his zest to fight anything to do with ammunition or gun control, was very adamant about. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not the government's intention to burden lawful shooting activities within part 7, and the witnesses from Natural Resources Canada indicated that in their testimony before the committee. The government listened closely to the concerns that were expressed by the stakeholders and decided to introduce motions to remove all references to inexplosive ammunition components from Bill C-17. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is like people here cannot take yes for an answer. We listened, we heard, and we removed the references. While the member did say at the beginning of his remarks that he appreciated it, he then went on with other areas that I would suggest are not related to this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the government react? Let me tell members that the current Minister of Transport, who was the minister on September 11, reacted by immediately closing down the skies. There were 5,000 aircraft flying around the skies over North America. Members should remember what happened in Gander. We should give credit to the people of Gander, and rightly so, for opening their hearts and their homes, their churches and their community halls to help these stranded people. However, do we think that all those planes were diverted to Gander miraculously and landed without incident? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all saw the pictures in the news of the planes on the tarmac, lined up one after another. When they finally had to leave, just the management of the air traffic control aspect of that was incredible. Is there any thought how some 5,000 aircraft, which were diverted and many of which landed in various airports in Canada, including Gander, were managed? Did the pilots just talk it over among themselves and say, “let us go to Gander, I think it is safe there”?</p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be fair  and give credit where credit is due.  The government gave the direction.  It is not up to the government to actually physically do it.  We have professionals in place  in NAV Canada and Transport Canada.  But it is up to the government, in this case the Minister of Transport, to set the tone, to give the direction, and to give the order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I recall that this minister was on a cell phone in a car, driving from Montreal back to Ottawa, when this crisis occurred.   Within minutes he took action that I would say could have saved lives; we will never know.  But the fact   that it was handled so professionally and so smoothly, members should at least be fair and say that it was an issue that happened on the watch of the government.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not need to stand and crow that we did it all because that is not true.  We relied on the professionals in our employ and on the people of Canada to respond in such a positive way.  But what do we hear?  We hear members in the House saying we need to change the government because it did not act quickly enough.  It is just such nonsense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be reasons that members opposite think we need to change the government.  There may be reasons why Canadians think we need to change the government.  Who knows?  They might change the government.  That is why we have such a great democratic country because that option is there.  However that is the wrong issue.  We should be getting behind the government on this critical bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was much debate in committee about whether or not we were going too far.  Concerns were expressed by the Privacy Commissioner.  The bar associations that were before us were saying that if we found information on a person travelling from Vancouver to Toronto and the indication was that person was a terrorist, their position was that we should not be able to go further  in terms of reviewing the passenger list.  However,  if we did that and discovered that there was someone else onboard that aircraft who had an outstanding warrant for a crime that had been specified in this bill, a crime that would result in a sentence in excess of five years--and in this country that is a crime such as murder, kidnapping and  that kind of thing, the most serious of crimes that one can imagine--we would not have the right to arrest that person when he or she got off the aircraft according to the bar associations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember asking the lawyers who were there representing the bar associations to help me understand this.  They were suggesting that I tell my constituents that even though, as a result of our work against terrorism and as a result of our work in following up on information provided by CSIS and the RCMP,   we discovered a third party on an aircraft with an outstanding warrant for having murdered someone that we had to let them walk off the plane. Their answer was, yes, that is what they were saying, in the aid of privacy rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe the  official opposition was onside with our   position in that particular area.  But we have members standing in the House objecting to criminals being given the right to vote and all of these issues.  Yet, we are supposed to allow people to walk free when we have an outstanding warrant for their arrest for murder or for kidnapping or for some other vile crime.  It just makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill has taken time.  Let us review the process.  The government responded very quickly after we took the initial action on this bill.  The initial action was to provide safe haven for tens of thousands of people.  We did that, we did it well, and our officials acted responsibly. Our next step was to bring in a bill that would deal with some of the concerns around Bill C-17. Bill C-42 was introduced and there was a big furor over the bill. A lot of concern was expressed  about that bill.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 11, 2001, many say that nothing is the same, that the world is changing, as evidenced by the recent events in Iraq. Obviously, although the world  often changes for the better, we must recognize that, in this case, it is changing for the worse.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody agrees that logic is essential to the drafting of any bill, and the government must listen to that logic. However, it seems that the government is hard of hearing, and I am very sorry about that.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are certainly happy that controlled access military zones have been removed from the bill before us, but does this mean that we should stop being vigilant? Absolutely not. We must see that the decisions being made today respect the balance between the three branches in our society, namely the executive, legislative and judiciary branches.    In its current form, Bill C-17 poses a threat to the balance between the executive and the legislative branches, since it includes specific provisions allowing ministers and officials to make interim orders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interim orders are exempt from the application of section 3 of the Statutory Instruments Act. An order is considered to be a statutory instrument; therefore, it should undergo a preliminary check by the Clerk of the Privy Council. His role is precisely to ensure that the proposed regulation does not, and I quote:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—trespass unduly on existing rights and freedoms and is not, in any case, inconsistent with the purposes and provisions of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we should ask ourselves the following question: if the purpose is not to trespass unduly on the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, why are we exempting the interim orders from the proper examination that would prove they are in compliance with the charter? By chance, would the government have the secret intention of transgressing the most basic rules of our free and democratic society by infringing on the fundamental rights of those individuals who form that society?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not question the importance of preventing all possible terrorist acts, and we do not question the necessity of equipping ourselves with all the tools we need to expose those who would threaten the security of citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is one inescapable fact and that is that in order to fight against terrorism, we must fight against its main cause, and that is the extreme poverty of hundreds of millions of people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we all agree that it is important to eliminate the conditions that breed terrorism, we also agree that we must fight against those who would come to our borders with the intent of committing terrorist acts. Once again, however, this cannot be done at any cost.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One price we must refuse to pay is waiving the right to privacy. In the past, we made choices. We made the choice to live in a constitutional state instead of a police state. We must be careful not to open the door to this style of governance where police are everywhere, always checking what everyone is doing. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would any of us blindly agree to have personal information relating to us processed and used for purposes other than those related to the fight against terrorism? Should the simple fact of taking a plane warrant the RCMP and CSIS having a record on a person? No. That has been made abundantly clear in the debates on Bill C-55. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is interesting to know what the Privacy Commissioner thinks of Bill C-17. First, it would appear that his concerns about the defunct Bill C-55 were and are still being completely ignored. The ministers and top government officials have failed, so far, to provide him with an appropriate response. I believe he is still waiting. This is why he is now calling on Parliament to ensure his concerns finally receive the attention they deserve. </p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall quote his words:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>But my concern is that the RCMP would also be expressly empowered to use this information to seek out persons wanted on warrants for Criminal Code offences that have nothing to do with terrorism, transportation security or national security.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we must guard against is the risk of creating a precedent that would eventually open the door to increased police control over various areas of our daily lives. For example, if we allowed special powers intended primarily to protect national security and to counter terrorism to be made available to the RCMP with respect to air passengers, who is to say that this special situation will not be extended to rail, bus or metro passengers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, for example, a suicide bomber were to blow himself up on a crowded train, would we go so far as to flag train travellers and use this same opportunity to look for people with outstanding warrants? There is always a tendency to be overzealous. There is always a point of no return when it comes to overzealousness, a point beyond which we must not go for fear of destroying the fragile balance required to maintain a free and democratic society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioner also raises another point that we must not lose sight of. The right to anonymity with regard to the state is a crucial privacy right. With Bill C-17, that right to anonymity will be set aside the moment we are unwise enough to set foot aboard a plane. If it were set out in the act that personal information can be used only in the case of persons representing a true threat to national security, we could feel a bit reassured, but that is not the case. Obviously, the right to privacy will be meaningless as soon as Bill C-17 comes into force, if the government maintains its position. We have confidence, Mr. Speaker, that you will not have to reserve passage on a ship in order to visit your girlfriend overseas. It is likely that your name would end up on a file somewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Bloc Quebecois are here to serve the interests of the public, and so they will fight energetically to see that the right to privacy is respected. We share the Privacy Commissioner's view that there are some major changes needed in Bill C-17. What we  have before us today could not be called major changes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Privacy is one of our basic rights. We are entitled to expect information on us to be used sparingly, at the very least. For the government to confer upon itself the right to collect information on air travellers is one thing, but the right to exchange and distribute that information is quite another. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, Bill C-17 gives the minister the right to disclose the information to the whole world. Not only that, but it allows the minister to disclose and release the information but does not provide a detailed framework for such activities. That is what I call increasing ministerial authority without proper monitoring.    </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have said before, maintaining a balance is crucial to a healthy society and the risks of a faux pas are too high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the new powers that the bill would give the minister, he could be authorized to disclose to U.S. authorities information on applications for refugee status made in Canada. Do we have the right to authorize the release of personal information like this? One thing is clear, as soon as information is shared with another party, we lose control of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is naive, idealistic and even rash to believe that we could control a situation when we have not established sufficient limits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, the government cannot always defend the indefensible. The same goes for the protection of privacy. </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me quote a short sentence from Khalil Gibran, and I dedicate it particularly to my colleagues in the government. This is my gift for today. He said, and I quote:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This sentence is food for thought. I hope that it will lead to conclusions that are worthy of the Canadian society, which is, as everyone knows, the best in the world.</p>

I listened with interest to the government representative, the Secretary of State for Selected Crown Corporations. I  would like to congratulate him on his new appointment and I look forward to debating him and pushing him a little on the question of the need for affordable housing in this country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In listening to his comments on Bill C-17, he was maybe a little defensive but he was also very aggressive in his defence of the government's position on this bill. He took us back to those tragic events on September 11 and put forward a picture that this bill was essential and necessary because of the horrific events that took place. In fact he asked  the opposition members in the House  why they would blame the government for everything, even the weather.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us be clear. Maybe the government would like to take blame for the weather but in this  instance we are holding the government to account on this legislation because there are very significant concerns about the impacts and the long term consequences of the so-called public safety act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to begin my remarks by quoting from one of the organizations that presented at the committee, the Coalition of Muslim Organizations. In their presentation, just to give this some context, they said:</p>
<p>

In many ways, the looming, ubiquitous spectre of terror and fear gave rise to legislation that struck the wrong balance between security and civil rights.

However, the distance of time allows us to reflect on the important issues of public safety and civil rights from a more sober vantage point.</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While I was not on the committee that went through this bill in detail, I know  my colleague, the member for Churchill, very much focused on these comments and the need to have some sort of reflection and avoid the impetus to rush into yet another piece of security legislation that would have incredible long term impacts and consequences for Canadians and for our society in the values we hold of democracy, civil liberties and the right to privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In looking at the bill, the NDP has been firmly opposed  to it because we are very concerned that the very broad powers contained within the bill to collect information on passengers who travel by air, internationally and domestically,  information to be amassed and controlled by CSIS and the RCMP, is very serious. I would bet that most Canadians have no idea that this kind of procedure and data gathering is about to take place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The brief from the Coalition of Muslim Organizations clearly raises the importance to have a reflection about where we are in balancing the need for security, about  which everybody is concerned. We are all concerned about the security of our country, the security of our individual families and communities, but clearly that has to be balanced with the rights  we have to privacy and our rights to civil liberties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  read through some of the transcripts of the committee and noted the comments of Mr. Radwanski, the privacy commissioner of Canada. I have always appreciated his reflection on a number of the bills that have come before the House. In connection to this bill, commenting on the provisions that would allow this collection of information about individual passengers to be stored, collected and used, he said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When that information is made available to the police, as it will be under Bill C-17 to the RCMP under proposed section 4.82, the effect is exactly the same as if we were required to notify the police every time we travelled so it  could check whether we were wanted for any number of Criminal Code offences or an outstanding warrant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find these very sober thoughts coming from the privacy commissioner of Canada.  With the passage of the bill, we will be setting up a whole series of steps, a whole apparatus that will allow the collection of information.  When used in concert with other bills, which regrettably have been approved by the House, they will transfer enormous powers to  policing authorities, such as the RCMP, CSIS and the intelligence service. This information collected about Canadians can be used in any variety of ways.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One concern we have about the bill specifically is that the information collected by the RCMP and CSIS can be moved down the line and provided to local authorities.  It could be used to make decisions about outstanding warrants.  This is precisely the point  the privacy commissioner is getting at.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all agree that laws should be enforced.  However in Canada I hope we still have the right to go about our business without having to self-identify, to check in and to produce mandatory ID that can then be used to determine various situations. If passed, Bill C-17 will fundamentally change that.  It will have created an environment, along with the other bills which have been passed, to allow that kind of information to now be gathered and used against people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know from the organizations  I have spoken to, particularly in my riding of Vancouver East where we do have a very diverse multicultural community, there are many people who are very fearful about how the bill will impact on their ability to freely travel, even though they have no connection with any terrorism or with anything that could be suspected in terms of a security risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact one of the amendments that was sought in committee, which was unfortunately rejected, was the need to have independent oversight, likely the privacy commissioner, to ensure that there were annual reports from the minister responsible, from the RCMP, from CSIS, which would have to go to the privacy commissioner.  We want somebody to look at what is going on in terms of the data being collected and the files that are being established based on information drawn from passenger lists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose we end up with a situation where we knew that 2% of the passengers flying in Canada, or maybe 1%, were Canadian Arabs or from a Moslem background.  If we had information which showed us that 20% of the files were being kept based on this legislation, would that be cause for concern?</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know  I and my colleagues have brought forward examples in question period about how racial profiling and how targeting is beginning to take place at border crossings and airports.  I have even debated the question of a national identity card and how that too is now part of this very fundamentally changed environment, where having a national identity card can actually be used in a very negative way to pull people over and to target people because of how they look or because of their racial background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say most strongly that we in the NDP have been following the bill, as have other opposition parties and members.  While we recognize the need for public security, the words of wisdom from the Coalition of Muslim Organizations calling upon us to have reflection post-September 11 are things  we need to heed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I urge members to reject the amendment that is before us,   to reject the bill and   to send it back because  this bill  on public safety  will undermine the democratic civil liberties and values that we  hold so dear.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-541530"></A><a HREF="#Int-541547"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541519"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to say a few words to Bill C-17. Like my colleague who just spoke, I also have concerns about whether   we should push through a bill such as this after such a prolonged period of time.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When September 11 hit everybody with the awareness of how ill-prepared we were to deal with acts of terrorism, everyone, not only across the country but around the world, reacted immediately.  Within days we were told massive legislation would be brought forth to address the problem so  that  nothing like that would ever happen again. We needed to be  much  more aware of what was going on in our own country and around the world. We also needed to  become aware that this would have some effect on our own personal freedoms. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time most people said that they would have no problem with infringements on their freedom if it benefited the security and safety of their  country. However quite a lot of time has elapsed since that occurrence and perhaps it is time to assess our response to such an act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In situations like that quite often people overreact    out of concern and when they are all hyped up and think they could be next. Now that we have  had time for sobre second thought, perhaps it is  time to go through the bill and ask ourselves how much of it is  relevant now and how much of it is really necessary now.  In retrospect, I think we would find   many clauses in the bill which go above and beyond what is required now to deal with the issue of security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me take a different tact because to talk about each clause in the bill,   its effect,  the transfer of power and the loss of personal freedoms would take possibly months.  I would like to talk about security from a different aspect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will all remember that fateful day of September 11. I am sure there are  two or three events in all our lives for which we remember   what happened, where we were at the time and who we were with when it happened.   In my own case I remember  the day   President Kennedy was shot, the day Henderson scored the great goal for Canada in 1972, and of course September 11.  There may be other significant days with some personal impact, but general widespread events such as these are enshrined in our memory never to be forgotten.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, on Septemeber 11, when we watched the second plane hit one of the towers in New York, we began to realize that something was drastically wrong. We also found out that a couple of other planes were involved and heaven's knows how many more were prevented from getting into the air because of the quick action that was taken.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I was not in Newfoundland on that day because, like many members,  my party was having a caucus meeting in western Canada.    Having to wait for taxis and being on waiting lists, it took us a few days to get home, but we  finally  managed to  get back home. However I was told that the people In Newfoundland   who had not turned on the television or the radio that morning to hear about what had happened were amazed at the number of jets flying overhead.  </p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we get nice clear blue skies, as we always do in Newfoundland, the white streaks are quite visible, and on that day they were very visible.  People were wondering what was happening.  What was happening  was that many of the trans-Atlantic flights were being diverted to airports in Newfoundland. Places like Gander, St. John's, Stephenville and Goose Bay were  crowded, particularly Gander, with flights arriving  from all over the place.  Even though many of them had been closer to   larger areas, such as Toronto and Montreal,   they were diverted to Newfoundland for whatever reason.  I guess we can argue with the fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However  that event  showed clearly the need to have specific landing sites, specific bases as such, in such areas in the country.  During the war, in the late 1930s and early 1940s,   Newfoundland was still an independent country.  Perhaps a lot of people are saying today that we should have stayed that way. However during that time we had   large, strong, efficient naval and air force bases in places such as Gander, Goose Bay, Stephenville and St. John's.  They provided a place of security for all our allies, for Canadians, Americans and the British.  We still have countries from all over the world doing some minimal training at some of our sites, particularly in Goose Bay.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the present government, once Canada joined us in 1949, allowed the stature of these bases to diminish and in fact closed most of them.   The recent confrontation in Iraq illustrated to us quite clearly that we never know when confrontations can happen around the world.  We strategically should have secure areas, our own bases, well-equipped to   respond to any kind of a situation, whether it be our involvement in some confrontation or whether it be fallout from the involvement or fallout from something completely disassociated with our own country, such as the events  that happened in New York. We were there to help out, luckily, because we had some of the infrastructure that was necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a government that over the last 15 to 20 years has allowed  infrastructure in the country to  fall completely apart.  I am sure that what is true in Newfoundland is true in other parts of the country.  If we are going to talk about security let us make sure   we play our part in making sure the country is secure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is nice to bring in a bill half an inch thick and talk about taking away personal freedoms and the hypothetical ideas of what might happen down the road, but in reality let us start putting some concrete plans in place to strengthen our country and  to make sure   we are strategically positioned to   handle ourselves, whether it be in peacekeeping times or   in times of confrontation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have the infrastructure throughout the country.   Newfoundland and Labrador is   strategically located, with the basic infrastructure already there, but we need to   revive and strengthen  the infrastructure, not only for the good of the province involved but   for the good of the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill,   undoubtedly, after being on the table for practically a year and a half now, needs to be revised.  In light of that perhaps we could do something worthwhile for the country.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are approximately 23,000 primary reservists in Canada. To train, take courses or serve in operations, these reservists need their employers' support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In return, these employers benefit from the solid work ethic, leadership training and special abilities that  reservists bring to their civilian jobs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to congratulate Canadian Pacific Limited of Calgary, for being named Canada's most supportive employer. I also want to thank all the employers who have won an employer support award in their respective province, or the support to Canadian Forces operations award. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reservists devote part of their free time to serving this remarkable country. I therefore invite  hon. members to join me in saluting these cooperative employers and the dedicated reserve force personnel of Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To bring attention to the plight of opposition MPs who are frequently in danger of arbitrary arrest or of personal injury at the hands of Mr. Mugabe's thugs, Amnesty International has twinned a number of Canadian and Zimbabwean MPs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past year I have been twinned with David Mpala, who is the member of parliament for the riding of Lupane and a member of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 31 several MPs, including Mr. Mpala, were  arrested without legitimate cause. Their condition is uncertain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada cannot stand idly by as Mr. Mugabe transforms Zimbabwe from a multi-racial democracy into a Stalinist terror state. If Canada refuses to take leadership within the Commonwealth to oppose Mr. Mugabe, then courageous men, like David Mpala, will have risked their lives and their liberty for nothing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-three  years ago, as a candidate in the 1980 federal general election , I was faced with the same debate. It is interesting to note that the arguments made then are still the same arguments today.  They include: marijuana is widely used in Canada; there is no victim; we cannot keep up with the court cases; it ruins people's lives to have a criminal record; the police are not enforcing the laws; et cetera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has changed is that marijuana today is 1,500 times more potent than it was in 1973 and yet we continue to discuss penalties based on weight rather than the potency or THC content of the drug.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marijuana is a gateway drug which usually leads to the use of other stronger more dangerous drugs and it sends the wrong message to our youth and all Canadians about drug use and smoking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decriminalization of marijuana is a confusing measure that  will not solve the problems some see and certainly will  open up other problems. All I can say is that decriminalization is not the solution to our problem.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hepatitis is the most common disease in Canada, and Canadians should know the consequences and take the necessary measures to protect themselves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the availability of vaccinations against hepatitis A and B, thousands of people  contract these diseases each year because they are unaware of the risks associated with certain types of behaviour, for example, sexual activities, tattoos, body piercing and the injection of drugs.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadian Liver Foundation is on the forefront of efforts to reduce the incidence and impact of hepatitis and all liver diseases.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a situation that illustrates more than ever the urgency of changing the Canada Labour Code to include anti-scab measures, like those which have been in place in Quebec for 25 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we want, and what the workers continue to demand as well, is for the Canada Labour Code to make it possible to hold civilized negotiations that foster industrial peace and establish a fair balance of power.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister must assume his responsibilities and make it known to the Minister of Labour that he will be supporting the anti-scab bill introduced by my colleague, the hon. member for Laurentides, so that this unfair situation may be remedied. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mixtures of hazardous materials, including chemicals and paints,  were ablaze.  Despite these hazards the firefighters showed courage, dedication, conviction and commitment in containing the fire so it would not spread, jeopardizing other buildings on that site and also other homes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fire departments were on site in numbers for over 20 hours.  It was a community effort in that  fire departments from neighbouring communities came to be of  assistance.  Crews from eight communities, including Rothesay, Nauwigewauk,  Norton, Long Reach, Upham, Belleisle and Kingston joined Hampton firefighters at the scene.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last February at the Moffatt farm, volunteer firefighters again showed the same amount of dedication when they were on that particular site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These events are stark illustrations of the courage and commitment that volunteer firefighters offer their communities.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is currently estimated that one out of every five Canadians requires the services of an emergency department each year.  MedicAlert provides immediate and reliable emergency medical information through custom engraved bracelets or necklets linked to a medical record through a 24 hour emergency hotline.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Government of Canada recognizes the vital role of the Canadian MedicAlert Foundation in    Canada, the emergency health care system, and extends best wishes for a successful MedicAlert Month.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were some fairly contentious issues in the debate that took place yesterday.  In looking at the comments that were made by the member for Saint John in her reference to gays and lesbians in this country, I found that her comments were very disrespectful. They were  offensive,  they were  hurtful and frankly, I think they were very homophobic.  Her comments were offensive to me personally and offensive to other members of the House.  Is she saying to the member for Burnaby--Douglas and the member--</p><A NAME="Int-541845"></A><a HREF="#Int-541848"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541844"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>Order.  The member has indicated her disagreement with what the hon. member for Saint John said, but she has not said anything to indicate that any member's privileges have been breached.  In fact, members do have a privilege in this House, that  of freedom of speech.  I recognize that members sometimes say things that are hurtful to others or perhaps inappropriate, but we do have freedom of speech in the House.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I had heard the hon. member say that in some way her privileges as an MP had been breached, I would be inclined to hear this, but I have not heard that at all.  I heard a list of adjectives referring to the words as unacceptable.  That is not a question of privilege.  If the hon. member has a genuine point of privilege, I want to hear that, not a debate on what the hon. member for Saint John said.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am aware that the matter was discussed yesterday in the House, but I do not think there is a question of privilege here since members do enjoy freedom of speech in the House.  The hon. member for Vancouver East will want to frame her question of privilege, if there is one, on those terms.</p><A NAME="Int-541848"></A><a HREF="#Int-541920"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541845"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Libby Davies: </b>Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your comments.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments that were made by the member for Saint John where she suggested  that people should shut up and go hide themselves are something  I take personally in terms of my ability to speak in this House.  That is why I believe that my privileges have been violated and abused by the member in the comments that she made. They impact upon my ability and the ability of other members of the House to speak out in a way that we know  will be respected such as we expect to see in the House.  I think it is a question of privilege, Mr. Speaker, and I would ask you to consider it from the point of view that we do expect a certain level of respect among members.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have basically been told to shut up and go hide myself, as well as   other members, such as  the member for Burnaby--Douglas or the member for Kings--Hants or the member for Hochelaga--Maisonneuve. Is this what we are being told by a member of the House?  I find it completely unacceptable.  I find it is infringing on my rights as a member in the House to speak freely about same sex marriage and about my situation. I find it intolerable.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would ask you, Mr. Speaker, to consider it on that basis.</p><A NAME="T1210"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1210"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1205"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1210)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-541920"></A><a HREF="#Int-541854"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541848"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker: </b>I think what is clear here is the hon. member disagreed with the comments of the hon. member for Saint John, and others may very well disagree as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>An hon. member:</b> And do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Speaker:</b> As the hon. member says “and do” and that is fine. Sometimes members disagree with one another in the House, but the fact that the hon. member for Vancouver East could get up on a question of privilege and object to this, the fact that the former leader of her party asked a question of the hon. member yesterday during the course of the debate, indicates that members are free to express their views, and stand up and express their views. The fact that the hon. member for Saint John may have suggested, to quote the hon. member for Vancouver East, to “shut up”, may be her view, but it is a view that was expressed in debate and I do not think that it obviously has had that effect on the hon. member or on other hon. members, nor should it. It is a matter of debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Saint John expressed her views, unacceptable as they may have been to some other hon. members, but I do not think the hon. member has to take to heart her suggestion that she shut up. She is entitled to speak her piece too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chair is here to ensure that all hon. members enjoy the opportunity for freedom of speech in the House. That is part of the job that the Chair is here for, and I am pleased to be able to afford that opportunity to the hon. member for Vancouver East. I am sure that on another occasion she will have an opportunity to debate the whole issue with the member for Saint John, something I am sure that many hon. members will look forward to hearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not think there is a question of privilege in this case, however regretful the comments may have been from the point of view of various hon. members, but I think our opinions of one another's views is brought out by the diversity expressed in the House, which each one of us is free to do.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House resumed consideration of Bill C-17, an act to amend certain Acts of Canada, and to enact measures for implementing the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, in order to enhance public safety, as reported (with amendments) from the committee, and of Motion No. 6.</p><A NAME="Int-541880"></A><a HREF="#Int-541916"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541962"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to speak to Bill C-17 today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we can see and as listeners will be able to see at report stage, this bill is similar to previous bills, namely Bill C-55 and Bill C-42.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At second reading of this bill, the Bloc Quebecois voted against it. Despite the outstanding work my colleague from Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel did during of this bill, by pointing out and tackling serious problems, the government has refused to listen and to accept any amendment. Yet amendments could have been a step in the right direction, for the government, but as usual, it ignored the opposition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the government is still doing what it has done since it was elected several years ago. Everything that comes from its side is perfect, while it does not want to listen to anything that opposition parties want to suggest to enhance, clarify and improve their bills in committee. The eight government members always adopt a common stand against the opposition members. Often, despite the fact that several government members do not even know what they will be voting on, they always agree with the government's amendments and are automatically against opposition parties' amendments, even though these  amendments would improve the bills. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not forget that, when this government introduces a bill, opposition members do their homework. We consult people and ask them what they think and what they would like to have improved in the bill. We connect with the reality in our communities. But we see that, while we are doing our homework, this government takes the bills that its bureaucrats provide it and endorses them unquestioningly. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has happened once again with Bill C-17. Moreover, despite all the amendments and motions brought forward by the opposition, this bill goes against the privacy commissioner's proposals. There is a part of this bill that deals with everything that affects privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the study of the second version of this bill, Bill C-55, the privacy commissioner said that he had major objections. When that bill was withdrawn, we thought that, when it was reintroduced as Bill C-17, the government would take the privacy commissioner's objections into consideration. But the opposition is unable to change the government's position. Even the privacy commissioner, who was appointed to protect Canadians' privacy, is unable to do so. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like those listening to know how important it is that this government listen to the Privacy Commissioner. He believes  that the provision  in question, section 4.82 of both bills, would give the RCMP and CSIS unrestricted access to the personal information held by airlines about all Canadian air travellers on domestic as well as international flights, and this worries him enormously. </p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is he worried? He is worried that the RCMP would also be expressly empowered to use this information to seek out persons wanted on warrants for Criminal Code offences that have nothing to do with terrorism, transportation security or national security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we in the Bloc Quebecois wish Quebec to become a sovereign nation, at present we are still part of Canada. In Canada, it is well established that we are not required to identify ourselves to police unless we are being arrested or we are carrying out a licensed activity such as driving. The right to anonymity with regard to the state is a crucial privacy right. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are required to identify ourselves to airlines as a condition of air travel and since section 4.82 would give the RCMP unrestricted access to the passenger information obtained by airlines, this would set the extraordinarily privacy-invasive precedent—and invasive it is—of effectively requiring compulsory self-identification to the police.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, there is a very serious problem with Bill C-17. We share the opinion of the privacy commissioner, who says that the proposed amendments are an insult to the intelligence of Canadians. It is serious when a privacy commissioner tells the government that, in Bill C-17, clause 4.82 is an insult to the intelligence of Canadians. The government has turned a deaf ear, and I am dumbfounded. The amendments proposed under this  new bill present  no new solutions to the  fundamental issues regarding the principle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government is now proposing regulations limiting the Criminal Code offence warrants under which the RCMP will be conducting searches. However, it does nothing to address the fundamental principle that the police have no business using this extraordinary access to personal information to search for people wanted on warrants for any offences unrelated to terrorism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privacy commissioner is so discouraged that he is appealing to parliamentarians, because this is insulting to Parliament; he says that it is now up to Parliament to explain to these people that privacy is a fundamental human right of Canadians that must be respected, rather than treated with the apparent indifference that the government is showing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the privacy commissioner's statements reflect the values that the Bloc Quebecois is defending. We agree with his words and utter them in turn, because people's privacy is at stake.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why the Bloc Quebecois is asking that the government's proposed amendments on the powers of the RCMP and CSIS to collect information cease to exist, and  that this bill be taken back to the  drawing board to ensure that privacy is respected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For now, Canada is not a totalitarian state. We enjoy freedom of expression in this country, where privacy is one of the most important things we have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I join my hon. colleague for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel in telling the government that the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against this bill. Furthermore, I will go further than my colleague and ask the government to withdraw Bill C-17.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to put a little bit of context to my comments before I address some the concerns that have been raised. First, how do Canadians feel about the government dealing with their rights for the sake of fighting crime and preventing terrorism? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadians understand that privacy is extremely important, that it is one of the fundamental tenets on which our democracy is built, but they also understand that public safety, individual safety is also a very important issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2002  the Ipsos-Reid poll showed 66% of those Canadians surveyed felt that the police should be given more power to fight crime even if it might be seen as an infringement of some individual rights. Some 66% felt that terrorism threats outweighed the protection of privacy rights. As of September 9, 2002, the Ipsos-Reid poll indicated that 59% of Canadians felt that the federal government had not done enough to ensure that the police had the necessary tools to fight terrorism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At times government has to lead public poll. I do not believe that the government has not done enough and I certainly do not believe that we should willy-nilly infringe on individual rights to privacy, and the government does not either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now  let us address some of the issues that were raised by some members of the opposition. They said that there was a problem on disclosure to third parties when if the information that is retained from the airline passenger manifests, that the RCMP or CSIS could disclose to a third party and there would be no control over respecting privacy rights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member from the Bloc just talked about how they have consulted their communities and the public and that they have taken into account the consultation with their communities and their public.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I think that all federal MPs have an obligation to hold public consultations on this issue. I think that those members, on both sides of the House, who take an interest in this issue have held consultations. It is not the exclusive privilege or the exclusive responsibility or the exclusive duty of members of opposition parties to consult their community, their constituents and the general public regarding a bill or a motion, whether it comes from the government or from the opposition. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can say that members on the government side have held consultations. Indeed, we have seen the results of these consultations in the questions that Liberal members sitting on the legislative committee that studied Bill C-17 asked of witnesses who made representations and presented briefs to this committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would even say that the most relevant and the most difficult questions that were put to the RCMP, to CSIS and to officials from the departments of transport, immigration, revenue and the solicitor general came from government members. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not want to deny the fact that difficult questions also came from opposition members. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I believe that anyone reviewing  the transcripts would see that Liberal members generally asked more difficult questions  than did opposition members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Questions were asked and statements were made by the privacy commissioner during the legislative committee hearings.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During those hearings the privacy commissioner  raised some very important issues.  He said  that he had concerns, if subclause 4.8(2) were to remain  as it is  laid out, about the RCMP's ability to scan passenger information to search for persons wanted on warrants.  He had very serious concerns about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the government do?  The government took those concerns seriously and, therefore, the “identification of persons for whom a warrant has been issued” was removed as a primary purpose for collecting passenger information.  What does that government amendment, which was approved and adopted in committee,  actually mean?  It  means   that the RCMP would now only be able to access passenger information for the purpose of transportation security.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a clear concern of the privacy commissioner.  The privacy commissioner had no issue with  the RCMP being able to access airline passenger manifests for the purpose of transportation security.  His problem was with  subclause 4.8(2) which, as it was originally written, the RCMP, as a primary purpose, would have   been able to   search for people for whom warrants had been issued.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subclause 4.8(2)  has now been amended and, hopefully, when the vote in the House at report stage happens, the House will adopt the amendment,  which  was approved and adopted in committee,    that would limit the RCMP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We took the privacy commissioner's concerns on that issue very seriously but we obviously needed to retain the aspect of transportation security in the regime because it is necessary for public safety.     That is the raison d'être of the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was one of the other privacy commissioner's concerns?  He had a concern that as Bill C-17 was initially written  there were outmoded offences for which warrants had been issued, such as fraudulently altering brands on cattle or other offences that,  we could almost guarantee, would not put public safety at risk  nor     public transportation safety at risk, such as municipal corruption.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privacy commissioner made a big point about that and said that it was ridiculous. Many of the offences that were listed under this clause   would have allowed   the RCMP to detain a passenger if it found that the  passenger was wanted for an outstanding warrant.     We     changed that  definition and  narrowed it substantially to  apply to only serious offences.  Those offences  would be directly related to terrorist or transportation security threats, such as the use of explosives or participation in a terrorist group.  I give that as an example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privacy commissioner raised his concerns at committee  and the government took those concerns seriously.  The last  point  I want to make is that the privacy commissioner stated clearly in committee that he had all the oversight mechanisms required for him to ensure that the application of this legislation, once it is adopted, will  be respected by the RCMP and by CSIS.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

	 </b>Madam Speaker,  I am very pleased today to speak to Bill C-17 on public safety. Hon. members will recall that this bill, while containing some changes, has basically already been C-42 and then C-55.  Today we are looking at a new version which, as I will explain a little later, has been modified based on Bill C-42.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially, I took part in the debate on Bill C-55, particularly in connection with three fundamental aspects of that bill.  I spoke about the matter of the controlled access military zone, which the bill stipulated established a security perimeter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second aspect I addressed during the debate on C-55 concerned the matter of interim orders, which are still there in Bill C-17, although some changes have been made.  These include the time lapse between the making of the interim order and the time it is tabled.  Despite the changes in deadlines, I will explain how the essence and the very bases of the verification process for the use of these orders are still flawed.  We would have liked to have seen a verification on the use of these orders within a broader framework that would  include the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and not just the enabling legislation.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect I addressed, which has to all intents and purposes undergone no change whatsoever in becoming Bill C-17, is the matter of the exchange of information.  In Bill C-17 there is still a significant role played by the RCMP, no longer necessarily in gathering the information, but Bill C-17 still retains the  possibility of being able to pass on certain information, to law enforcement officers among others. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We might have expected  the government to respect not just what the Bloc Quebecois was calling for, but also the opinion voiced by the Privacy Commissioner. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, of course, as to the controlled access military zones, we have to admit that the Bloc Quebecois won the battle. Indeed, members will recall that, at the time, we opposed such a zone that would create a perimeter. However, last October 31, the government took this change into account after repeated demands by the Bloc Quebecois, and this provision was deleted from Bill C-17.   We essentially wanted to maintain the necessary balance between security and freedom. The controlled access military zone did create a fundamental  imbalance, which was not consisten with a democratic society. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was also another aspect to this issue because the government could certainly have abused its power, the minister having a clearly established discretionary power. We felt that by granting such power to the minister, the government had gone too far. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with this security perimeter that would have been established—I say “would”, because it is not provided for in Bill C-17— the government  had, to all intents and purposes, stripped the population of rights they were entitled to expect to enjoy. Indeed, this controlled access zone denied people living within its boundaries and perimeter some basic democratic rights that  Canada has always proudly advocated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luckily, we won the battle thanks to the efforts of the member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel. We clearly stated on October 31 that we  had won. However, I will remind the House that we will monitor this issue very closely, because this balance between security and freedom must be maintained. </p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another important aspect is the issue of interim orders. Again, we saw that the bill contains provisions to this effect. Of course, in terms of tabling in Parliament, the period between the tabling of the order in Parliament and the moment it comes into force was reduced. We would obviously have liked it to be reduced to five days. The government decided instead to keep a 15 day period, as in Bill C-55. Remember that in Bill C-42, the order took effect immediately upon being tabled in Parliament. So, this is a bit of an improvement over Bill C-55. Of course it is better than C-42, but we would have like the order to come into force within five days of being tabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only is the time lapse a problem, but it is also important that there be a preliminary check for compliance with the enabling legislation and with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-42 contained nothing to this effect, and nor did  Bill C-55. However, we would have liked to see this preliminary check included in Bill C-17. However, there is nothing of the sort. Several motions to that effect were moved, but unfortunately they were all rejected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third aspect of the bill I would like to talk about, after the controlled access military zone and after the interim order, is the issue of information exchange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I do not have much time left, but it is important to recall that what the Bloc Quebecois was calling for was that the right to privacy be protected. Incidentally, on November 1, 2002, the Privacy Commissioner gave his interpretation of the bill, with respect to this issue of information sharing. On November 1, 2002, he said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—my concern is that the RCMP would also be expressly empowered to use this information to seek out persons wanted on warrants for Criminal Code offences that have nothing to do with terrorism, transportation security or national security.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also said:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The implications of this are extraordinarily far-reaching.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two aspects to this exchange of information. The first is that even if we are quite satisfied with the fact that the RCMP will no longer be responsible for the collection of data, we are still concerned about the powers the RCMP to pass on information to peace officers, among others.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not forget that in a democracy, the right to privacy is a fundamental right. In Canada,  it is established that people are not  required to identify themselves to the police except if they are arrested or doing something that requires a permit, such as driving a motor vehicle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will conclude by saying that, with regard to the three iaspects of Bill C-42, Bill C-55 and Bill C-17, which is before the House today, the Bloc won its case on the issue of controlled access military zones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the issue of interim orders, we would have preferred a shorter  time lapse  between the tabling of these interim orders in the House and their coming into force. We would have preferred that it be shortened from 15 to 5 days. Moreover,  we would have preferred that a preliminary check be made under the enabling legislation, and also the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, concerning the exchange of information, we would have preferred that the RCMP not have the power to pass on certin information on people.</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-541966"></A><a HREF="#Int-541967"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541934"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>I would like to remind members that cellular phones are not allowed in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member for Joliette. </p><A NAME="Int-541967"></A><a HREF="#Int-541984"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541966"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, unlike some previous speakers, it is with a lot a frustration that I rise on Bill C-17.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the third time that the government has introduced a public safety bill. We first had Bill C-42, which contained a whole series of safety measures that were clearly excessive in terms of rights and freedoms. Then, marginal corrections were made with Bill C-55. And now, the government has introduced Bill C-17, which is essentially identical to Bill C-42 and Bill C-55. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, the government did not learn from its mistakes. As with Bill C-35—which was passed—as with the airport security tax, the government has adopted or is proposing a whole series of measures, in the aftermath of the tragic events of September 11, 2001, which ultimately do not seem to be of any use in the fight against terrorism. I remind the House that Bill C-35, which was passed despite the Bloc Quebecois' opposition, contains all kinds of threats and injuries to rights and freedoms and has not been of any use whatsoever in the fight against terrorism in Canada since it was passed.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would now like to talk about the air security charge; the government has been unable to demonstrate that this tax contributes in any way to paying for the equipment and technologies necessary to ensure airport security. While the airline industry, both in Canada and in the United States, is going through a catastrophic crisis, an additional tax does not help matters. There was so much government improvisation on this issue that, in the last budget in February, the Finance Minister had to reduce the tax significantly; yet, he kept it, which akes no sense whatsoever. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, the government has been unable to demonstrate that this tax was needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On several occasions I have wanted to make this point in the House. Bill C-17 now gives me that opportunity. We have been led to believe, in Canada and in the United States, that a person taking a taxi, a bus or a train is considered as a customer, but the Canadian and U.S. governments consider airport or airline customers as potential criminals or terrorists. No wonder people are staying away from the airlines and airports: they are being treated as potential terrorists and criminals.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-17 is very much a part of all this. I think this act is of no use whatsoever in the fight against terrorism. Members will recall that this was the purpose. The government should have realized, since the tragic events of September 11, that it should have found another way to fight terrorism. As months passed by, one would have expected the government to understand that such measures dare of no use in the fight against terrorism, and it should have dropped the idea after Bill C-55 died on the Order Paper. Yet, the government introduced a new bill, Bill C-17, which, except for one element as I said, goes along the exact same lines as Bills C-42 and C-55.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was raised by the hon. member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, and I think that it must be stressed. Bill C-17 dropped the excessive idea of controlled access military zones, or military security zones as they were called in Bill C-42.  In large part, this is a Bloc Quebecois victory. We will recall that these  zones could be of unlimited size, without any control being exercised, that the RCMP could declare them without providing any justification, without having to check with or be accountable to anyone, and that this could be done without the   consent of the affected provinces.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think, for example,  of the Quebec City summit. The federal government could have unilaterally decided to declare a controlled access military zone for the whole of Quebec City, the national capital of Quebeckers. The purpose would have been to prevent   the potential arrival of terrorists, and particularly to prevent citizens concerned with the current negotiations on the free trade zone of the Americas from coming to express their concern to the     leaders and heads of state of the 34 countries that are parties to these negotiations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said, this idea of this kind of controlled access military zone was dropped. Still, the new proposal to  establish zones through orders is cause for concern to us. Nowhere does it say that the consent of the affected provinces will be required for these military security zones to be created. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois would have liked for all of this to just disappear, but we will remain extremely vigilant, even though, as I said earlier, the fact that the initial idea of controlled access military zones was dropped must be regarded as a Bloc Quebecois victory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two other elements that worried us and that still worry us: everything related to the interim orders as well as everything related to sharing information on airline passengers, who are now viewed by the Canadian government as potential terrorists, as I was saying earlier, regardless of whom they may be. These are concerns that also have to do with the protection of privacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say more about both of these matters, the interim orders and the exchange of information, particularly between the RCMP and CSIS. I know what I am talking about with regard to CSIS because when I was the president of the Conseil central de Montréal of the CSN, we realized that we had been infiltrated by  CSIS. This occurred even though everyone knows that the CSN and all unions in Quebec are institutions that are not only recognized, but extremely democratic and transparent. So, I may have more apprehensions than others when it comes to giving special powers to the RCMP and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to interim orders, the new bill stipulates—or it will if, unfortunately, it is passed—that, “The Minister may make an interimorder that contains any provision that may becontained in a regulation made under this Actif the Minister believes that immediate actionis required to deal with a significant risk,direct or indirect, to health, safety or theenvironment”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In subsection 4, we read the following, “An interim order is exempt from the application of sections 3, 5 and 11 of the Statutory Instruments Act and published in the <i>Canada Gazette</i> within twenty-three days after it is made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, under the new section 30.1 and subsection 4, proposed interim orders will not be required to comply with the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Canadian Bill of Rights. It is quite significant and worrisome  that a minister could decide to issue an interim order without first having to ensure it complies with instruments that are supposed to protect the rights and freedoms of Canadians and Quebeckers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These provisions are extremely dangerous. Unfortunately, I  have just one minute left, and I have addressed only the matter of interim orders. We believe that these interim orders must be required to pass the test of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I want to say that the privacy commissioner is extremely concerned by the possibility that the RCMP and CSIS could exchange information on airline passengers, and we believe that the legislation should be much more restrictive than this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, I am not only somewhat frustrated, but I will be voting against Bill C-17.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-541984"></A><a HREF="#Int-542004"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541967"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Mario Laframboise (Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, BQ):
	 </b>Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak today as the Bloc Quebecois critic and a member of the legislative committee that analyzed Bill C-17, clause by clause, proposing amendments to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Quebecois, which I represent, introduced 49 amendments to this bill.  Believe it or not, the Liberals retained not a single one.  I am therefore disconcerted to hear Liberals, including the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, who has been telling us that the  Liberal members were the ones to ask the hardest questions of the RCMP, CSIS and Transport.  With all due respect to that member, regardless of the questions she may have raised, the bill was nevertheless not changed.  That is the reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can say in this House that they were hard on the RCMP and CSIS representatives, who I am sure quaked at the questions asked by the Liberals.    At any rate, we knew very well that there would not be any major changes made to the bill.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Bloc Quebecois introduced 49 amendments and we did not just pull them out of a hat.  They reflect the proposals made to us by witnesses before the committee. I am not referring to those from Transport, CSIS, the RCMP and the police organizations anxious  to have a police state in Canada and in Quebec. I am referring to the representatives of civil society.  I will reserve for the end the independent commission members, who are supposed to be independent individuals appointed to defend our interests, that is the Canadian Bar Association, the Law Society of Upper Canada, the Barreau du Québec and all the other civil organizations which came and told us that this was the greatest encroachment on civil liberties that Canada has ever known.  That is the reality. I will read some of the comments and representations from the Canadian Bar Association shortly.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, I want this to be clearly understood. In the name of terrorism and the war on terrorism, subjects we all agree on, the RCMP and CSIS, hand in glove with the Department of Transport, have given us a bill that will threaten our civil liberties. That is the reality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am simply going to quote the words of the privacy commissioner, who is independent and appointed by the government explicitly to protect people's rights. He is not there to protect the rights of the Bloc Quebecois or the members of the Bloc Quebecois. He is there to protect the rights of the whole population. This quotation summarizes in two or three paragraphs what this bill is all about. Thus, the commissioner says, in a letter addressed to the government, and I quote:</p>
<p>

Section 4.82 would entitle the national police force and the national security service to demand personal information about all Canadian air travellers without any judicial authorization.</small></td>

</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That means, as things stand, that when this bill becomes law, the airlines will provide information—Bill C-44, which was passed last year, already authorizes them to provide information and exchange such information with our neighbours to the south—but the RCMP and CSIS will be able to use it for other purposes. That is what those terrible questions that the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine says she asked of the RCMP and CSIS boils down to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After my colleagues and I asked our questions  and got answers, it became clear that finding terrorists is not the only purpose of this bill. At the same time, they are going to try to do what they cannot do now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that means those who use air transportation will be more closely monitored than travellers using any other means of transportation in Canada. Of course, this is the result of September 11, because that was a horrible event we never want to see happen again. Unfortunately, people travelling by air will pay the penalty and a databank on frequent flyers will be created.</p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what will happen.  Information on frequent travellers will be kept in the  data banks monitored by the RCMP and CSIS.  That is why the Bloc Quebecois supports the recommendations of the privacy commissioner, who wanted to add the following to paragraph 4.82 (14).  I will not read 4.82 in its entirety; the part that the privacy commissioner wanted to add is clear enough on its own.  He wanted to add this: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—and a copy of this record must be provided within seven days to the PrivacyCommissioner of Canada unless the Privacy Commissioner waives this requirement inwriting to the Commissioner and/or the Director. </small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the nature of the information that will be kept by the RCMP and CSIS, for whatever reason, the privacy commissioner was saying that since there was injury to rights--and this is an historical precedent--there must be some guidelines.  Businesses are not allowed give out private information on their clients.  According to the legislation, the RCMP and CSIS can keep the information for seven days.  After that, they may keep it longer if it is required for security purposes.  The privacy commissioner    simply said that if information is going to be kept longer than seven days, he would like a copy of the files to ensure that it was being kept for reasons of protection and security, to fight terrorism for example, so that he could determine that it was not being used for purposes not consistent with the legislation?  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe or not, CSIS is against that, as are the RCMP and Transport Canada.  The Bloc Quebecois amendment requesting that this be added to the act, as requested by the rivacy commissioner, was rejected.     </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A member of the Liberal caucus who was on the committee said that the members of her party had some very hard-hitting questions for RCMP and CSIS witnesses. In spite of their answers, I know very well that this legislation was drawn up by the RCMP and CSIS  for their own ends and that the transport department did not have a say.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, police organizations dream of turning Canada and Quebec into police states. This is terrible. It would be to lose the fight against terrorism when the very thing that terrorists want to do  is undermine our rights as a free and democratic society. That is what the terrorists were trying to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are letting them win by allowing our police organizations, such as the RCMP and CSIS, to collect information on  frequent passengers from independent data bases. It will be possible to use this information without the privacy commissioner being able to check the data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, there is a clause that says that this information will not be subject to the provisions of the Access to Information Act. Certain provisions in this act say that, for security reasons, the information commissioner is not required to respond to certain requests. However, despite these provisions, the bill before us and air passenger information are totally exempt from the Access to Information Act. In other words, we will never be able to know the contents of a file kept by the RCMP or CSIS. It is even worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this issue, I will let the information commissioner and those who will ask questions make up their own mind. However, the commissioner's report was very clear. To him, it was the worst decision, the worst bill or the worst recommendation ever brought forward in  Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, I must point out that the information commissioner and the privacy commissioner are independent persons appointed by the government to defend the interests of Quebeckers and Canadians.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the Canadian Bar Association and the Barreau du Québec support the privacy commissioner request for access to information, it means that all of civil society is critical of this bill. Again, I am sorry that Liberal members did not understand civil society's message.</p><A NAME="Int-542004"></A><a HREF="#Int-542010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-541984"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ): </b>Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate my hon. colleague on the job he has done on Bill C-17, which was not an easy one.

Unfortunately, the government rejected them all, as is often the case      here, in this Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to set things in context for the benefit of listeners. It is not the first time that this kind of a bill has been introduced in the House of Commons. The current bill is    a new  version of Bill C-55 on  public safety introduced in 2002, itself a new version of Bill C-42.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last spring, our remarks on Bill C-55 focussed on three major areas: controlled access military zones, interim orders and information sharing. These are three vital areas.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the controlled access military zones, we could claim victory, given that these were completely dropped from the bill. The bill does, however, still contain provisions concerning interim orders, although the timeframes for their tabling in Parliament and approval by cabinet have been considerably reduced. And our main concern, namely the lack of advance verification for consistency, remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have here a press release from the  information commissioner. I am sure that no one has read all of it. Let me do so, because it is important and it will help members understand why  we have such concerns about this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news release was written November 1, 2002 by the Privacy Commissioner of Canada. I quote:  </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Madam Speaker, here we have the commissioner's fundamental reaction and it is serious; he has gone to the trouble of analyzing this entire issue in depth. Therefore, I am very much afraid of seeing this bill pass. I hope that there is still some chance, as we are now at the report stage, of amending the bill and ensuring that no one's rights will be injured.</p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know  Bill C-17 is the son and daughter of Bill C-42 and Bill C-55 respectively.  It is a public safety act.  Some people would claim it to be a public relations act.  We are concerned because  the sweeping powers that were in the earlier bill are in this reincarnation, a sense that government, officials and authority can do whatever they want, whenever they choose.  The privacy commissioner says that the police have all the powers they require  now to arrest and detain people whom they suspect, and therefore this is not necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of us lived through the War Measures Act.  Some of us were at the Quebec summit in Quebec City in 2001. To me,  people who are proposing this bill seem to be saying that security trumps privacy, and we have some grave concerns about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine commented on public opinion polls which said that Canadians in the aftermath of September 11 were prepared to forsake some of their privacy for additional security.  I would say respectfully back to her that for a  lot of hard-working Canadians that may in fact be a reality. However  it is even more incumbent on those who Canadians elect to places and chambers, like  the House of Commons, the  legislators and parliamentarians, to ensure  that our safety and security laws are there, but that they are there in balance to ensure guaranteed privacy when and where Canadians need it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bill itself, because there are a number of different acts that roll into this legislation, the transport minister's regulations concerning the Aeronautics Act, making powers concerning aviation safety, I concede are better defined than they were in Bill C-42.  The lack of specifics in this area was one of the concerns  we had about the original bill, specifically our transport critic, the member for Churchill.  Therefore we regard this as a mild improvement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, in a feeble attempt to address the concerns of the privacy commissioner, the clause allowing RCMP designated officers to access passenger information to identify those individuals with outstanding arrest warrants has been removed and the bill would now only allow RCMP and CSIS officials to access passenger information for national or transportation security purposes.  This too is an improvement.  However they may still use this information to pursue individuals with outstanding arrest warrants if the crimes they are wanted for carry a potential sentence of five years or greater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The privacy commissioner has stated publicly that this change is insufficient  to protect the right of  Canadians to privacy.  In our opinion there are still insufficient safeguards in this current legislation to prevent intrusion, particularly since this information can be shared with American customs officials who currently have a racial profiling policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me just stop there and, as an aside, tell the House that I recently travelled in company with the secretary treasurer of the Canadian Labour Congress, who is of Arab descent and who travels quite extensively in his job.  According to  Hassan Yussuff, when he travels through the United States and looks at the people who are pulled aside at the airports for particular and thorough security checks, it is always people  of Muslim and Arab descent.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The House heard from my colleague earlier today, the member for Vancouver East.  She outlined the concern expressed by the Muslim organization, COMO, with regard to this.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We not only want to protect and ensure that  citizens in Canada and people who are travelling here   are protected,   we also want to ensure  they are not singled out, which  seems to be the case in some other countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of our major points of opposition     to the bill was the clause  concerning the military security zones, and it has been   repealed. I congratulate  the government. In its place the government will use existing legislation to establish controlled access zones to protect naval vessels at three ports: Halifax  on the east coast, and  Esquimalt and Nanoose Bay on the west coast. These three locations already have military facilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the interim order powers,  it now requires an order to be approved by the governor in council within 14 days, not 90 days. It must also be tabled in Parliament within 15 days regardless of whether Parliament is in session. We do not oppose these changes but they are rather insignificant and, in our opinion, do not address sufficiently the concerns   we have about potential abuse in this area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With regard to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority Act,  this act received royal assent after Bill C-42 was tabled.  This is updated to reflect that the act was passed. If the government had its act together this section  would have appeared in Bill C-42 as a conditional amendment. The fact that it did not, further underlines how the government seems to have been making up its security policy on the fly for many months now. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marine Transportation Security Act is another area that  was not contained in Bill C-42.  It would have  empowered the government to contribute funds to port authorities to help pay for new security measures, something that our caucus supports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Criminal Code broadens the scope and  we will continue to support that clause of the bill. We can also give our support to a couple of other minor clauses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to go back and conclude with the points that were made by the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine about the fact that with the changes the privacy commissioner   can now support what is before us. I am troubled that the bill, which would enact measures for implementing the biological and toxin weapons convention, that there were amendments put forward by my colleague, the member for Churchill, that specifically impacted on the privacy commissioner and which were defeated at committee.  Because they were defeated at committee they were not allowed to be debated here in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just want to pick out one of them.  Motion No. 1    stated: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">

<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Privacy Commissioner may review all material received in respect of the transactions described in subsection (1) to ensure that section 4.81 has been complied with.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To follow up on the argument that was advanced by the member for  Notre-Dame-de-Grâce—Lachine, it would seem to me   that if   the committee has looked at this and the privacy commissioner has been satisfied, then I fail to understand why a reasonable amendment, such as the one that I have just read into the record that was advanced by the member for Churchill, would have   been defeated by the Liberal majority on the committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are some improvements in Bill C-17 over its earlier incarnations, this caucus, along with others on the opposition side,  cannot support Bill C-17 and we will be voting against it.</p><A NAME="T1330"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1330"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1330)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Madam Speaker, first, I want to thank the member on the other side who brought to the attention of the House the fact that Sunday will be Mother's Day. </p>

<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to rise to speak at third reading of Bill C-249; it has been a few years.  It deals with a substantive, important change to the Competition Act.  I would like to thank the industry committee, including its chair, the member for St. Catharines, as well as my colleague the vice-chair, representing the Alliance, and members of all other parties for their work in making this such an important milestone as far as private members' bills are concerned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill has as its origins the need to ensure that the loophole created in 1986, which in effect allows anti-competitive activity, not occur unless factors other than efficiency are considered. The case that was before the House dealt with Superior Propane and that issue saw a potentially damaging merger take place. The reality is that the language of the act was in dire need of change as a result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased that Bill C-249 as amended has the support of the competition commission, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and a substantial number of consumer groups across the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the competition commissioner said at committee on March 31:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>The bill seeks to ensure that consumers are not left out of the equation when considering mergers involving efficiency claims. It would also safeguard competition to the benefit of consumers and the [Canadian] economy.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to point out that nowhere else in the world is there an efficiencies defence that is used to promote a potentially damaging merger that would see consumers and the competitive process harmed, not in the United States, not in Europe, not  in Australia, nowhere around the world.  Other competitive processes always try to at least balance the interests of consumers and the interests of those who are trying to create certain types of innovations and efficiencies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the act was left wide open for interpretation. It is correct and appropriate, as the committee quite rightly pointed out rather substantially, not only for this Parliament, that the issue be fully addressed.  The commissioner also suggested that the act in itself is an important public knowledge document that allows consumers to certainly be aware of the fact that any quantifiable efficiencies would be treated appropriately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Former Federal Trade Commission chair Robert Pitofsky pointed this out on the question of efficiencies:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>My view is  that the acceptance and clarification of the role of efficiencies in defense of mergers has been, on balance, a useful development in the United States.  If there are no significant efficiencies, enforcement agencies and judges can be much more comfortable finding that particular mergers are anti-competitive--</small></td>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His concern, which I think speaks very much to the concern we have here in Canada, was that benefits can only happen if they are likely to be passed on to consumers and efficiencies cannot be achieved in a substantially less anti-competitive way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More important, I believe that the position taken for some years by groups and organizations that have tremendous concern with this precedent and with the wording of the act agrees that efficiencies in terms of merger review should not be stand-alone, that in fact they should be compared to all other factors.  The amendment prescribed by the industry committee is appropriate and correct and I believe that Parliament must pass this bill.  More important, I am pleased to have the support of my government as well as the Competition Bureau on this matter.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-542075"></A><a HREF="#Int-542087"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-542057"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance): </b>Madam Speaker, I want to commend my colleague for introducing this bill and for taking such an active interest in competition law. As he mentioned, his own government is supporting this so I expect we will see the bill become law fairly soon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do want to raise some concerns about this piece of legislation, because we in the Alliance and I in particular have decided after reflection not to support this particular bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to begin my talk here today with a few thoughts on economics, efficiencies and the distribution of wealth. The purpose of the Competition Act, whether we like it or not, is to create wealth. Obviously society would like to have some checks and balances on wealth and wealth distribution, but largely we depend on the market to regulate itself. What makes this subject complicated is that it raises the issue of distribution of wealth. The interesting thing about this bill is that it would set in motion a new purpose for the competition commissioner, that is, to make decisions about wealth distribution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of wealth distribution or dividing up pieces of the pie is inherently a political question. Who deserves more? Who deserves less? Who does the distributing? Surely these are issues for elected and accountable representatives, not civil servants or quasi-judicial tribunals. The other thorny issue with wealth distribution is that once we begin to consider it, efficiencies are cast aside. If we think of all the time and effort that goes into redistribution in government, if we look at some of the regional development agencies, and if we look at Technology Partnerships Canada, the politicians basically focus on who gets the money, not on keeping the underpinning or the economy healthy to balance that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others will give their interpretation of the bill and now I will give mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Competition Act, the competition commissioner has the ability to challenge mergers that likely would lessen or prevent competition. The parties to the merger can defend their merger based upon what presently is called the efficiency defence. Such a defence can be made where the merger is likely to bring about gains and market efficiency that will be greater than, and therefore offsetting, the supposed anti-competitive effects of the merger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is this technical economic theory an issue? Mainly because of one prominent case. When Superior Propane proposed a merger with ICG in 1998, it was found that the new company likely would achieve a national market share in propane of 70%. This would have enabled it to become virtually a monopoly propane provider in 16 local markets, mostly in Atlantic Canada. The Competition Bureau deemed this merger to be anti-competitive and therefore challenged it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superior and ICG defended their merger using the efficiency defence. The efficiency defence is technical and cumbersome. It falls under section 96 of the Competition Act. It assesses the social benefits of a merger: whether or not a marginally higher price passed on to the consumer outweighs the market efficiencies gained by the creation of a new company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end, the Superior-ICG merger was allowed because the efficiencies resulting from the merger increased the competitiveness of Canadian propane by reducing duplication and allowing the firm to engage in more efficient production. In other words, the increase in productivity resulting from the merger was seen to outweigh the possible costs to the consumer; the costs were not known for certain. They actually did come up with a number for this case. It was found that the impact on low income Canadians possibly could be as high as $8.6 million. The benefit of the merger, from greater efficiencies of scale and other positive impacts, was found to be $29 million.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-249 attempts to clarify the efficiency defence by limiting the application of this efficiency defence. However, the sponsor of Bill C-249, the member who just spoke, has just explained that he has amended his own bill, something that does not typically happen. He sought to amend it because he thought it would be much better than the current form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either in its original form or amended as it is, we in the Canadian Alliance simply cannot support Bill C-249. There are several reasons why we cannot support the bill, which I would like to outline.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, throughout hearings over the past three years on the issue of competition, the Canadian Alliance members of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology consistently have put forth the view that Canadian consumers and producers are best served not by a tribunal or by government intervention in the marketplace, but by genuine business to business competition.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of competition policy should not be to protect individuals or individual companies but to facilitate competition itself. Therefore, another intervention into the marketplace as outlined by both the bill and the amendment would not necessarily promote competition but could allow for ways for government bodies to interfere with competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the industry committee recommended in April 2002 that a task force of experts be established to study the role of efficiencies in the Competition Act. One of the reasons the standing committee made this recommendation was that the efficiency defence has caused a problem within the Competition Bureau itself. Just when the tribunal came to agree with the bureau's guidelines on the treatment of efficiencies according to the total surplus standard, the bureau abandoned its guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The standing committee also heard from witnesses concerning the problems in accurately calculating efficiencies. Obviously there are not too many members of the House who are experts in econometrics, but this is something where we are looking into the future of efficiencies and predicting. Even those people who are experts in this area have a difficult time doing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would note here that the Competition Bureau commissioned and received a comprehensive study by experts on the treatment of efficiencies in merger reviews. However, that was a study on different international jurisdictions, where the standing committee requested a study of the role that efficiencies should play in all civilly reviewable sections of the Competition Act. In our view, this is a subtle but critically important difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason why the committee would like to have this issue studied on a broader level is historical. To quote from the Canadian Bar Association when it appeared before our committee:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>It's our understanding that the inclusion of section 96 in the package of amendments to the law enacted in 1986 was a response in part to concerns which had been raised by the business community about the then new merger provisions. It is particularly important to modify [the efficiency defence] only after due reflection has been given and an opportunity for broader public discussion. There is a constituency out there that thinks that was part of an understanding about how the act would have been amended.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third reason why we in the Alliance cannot support the bill has to do again with interference in the marketplace by government, specifically for the purpose of what it calls wealth distribution. No matter how one looks at the bill or the amendment, it will change competition law by asking the Competition Bureau to play a role in wealth distribution. This is a role for which it is ill suited. There are other mechanisms, for example a taxation system, that are better suited to wealth and income distribution. The intent of the amendment is consistent with the intent of the original bill where the sponsor wanted “gains in efficiency to be passed onto customers within a reasonable time in the form of lower prices”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Canadian Alliance believe the marketplace can sort out these issues better than any formula proposed by Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 96 is designed, in theory, to help Canada create a more productive economy. To quote the Canadian Chamber of Commerce: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Unlike the United States anti-trust laws which aim to directly protect and benefit consumers, our [Competition Act] seeks to ensure that marketplace frameworks are in place to promote competition and the efficient operation of markets. This in turn will lead to benefits for all segments of society.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, in our view Canadian consumers are best served not by a tribunal or by government intervention in the marketplace but by genuine business to business competition. The focus of competition policy should not be to protect individuals or individual companies but to facilitate competition itself. The Minister of Industry should recognize business to business competition as one of this government's highest priorities and the Liberals should make a concerted effort to reduce regulation and government interference in the marketplace.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I remind the House that this bill would amend the Competition Act to clarify the Competition Tribunal's powers to make an order or not in the case of a merger when gains in efficiency are expected or when the merger would create or strenghten a dominant market position. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it is important, to be able to assess the changes proposed by this bill, to keep in mind the current text of subsection 96(1) of the Competition Act. It says something like this:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small> The Tribunal shall not make an order  under section 92—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this section is to  dispose  of assets or any other measure.</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—if it finds that the merger or proposed merger in respect of which the application is made has brought about or is likely to bring about gains in efficiency that will be greater than, and will offset, the effects of any prevention or lessening of competition that will result or is likely to result from the merger or proposed merger and that the gains in efficiency would not likely be attained if the order were made.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the current act, we see that if the parties before the tribunal are able to demonstrate that the merger would have the effect of creating gains in efficiency that would be greater than the gains which would result from a lessening of competition, the tribunal cannot require dissolution of a merger, even in the case of very significant adverse effects on competition. That is the section as it now reads, and we see that there is not much leeway regarding the evidence  related to gains in efficiency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the proposed amendment—I shall read just a little of it—in order to determine whether section 92 applies:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>—the Tribunal may, together with the factors that may be considered by the Tribunal under section 93, have regard to whether the merger or proposed merger has brought about or is likely to bring about gains in efficiency that will provide benefits to consumers, including competitive prices or product choices, and that would not likely be attained in the absence of the merger or proposed merger.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see that in the amendment proposed in Bill C-249, the Competition Tribunal is being asked to evaluate whether a merger might have the effect of bringing about gains in efficiency that would benefit consumers, and then to decide whether or not to make an order under section 92.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spirit of the bill is to identify who will benefit from these gains in efficiency. The Competition Tribunal is being given much more specific guidelines than under the current section of the Competition Act. Already, there is a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four positive elements in  Bill C-249. First, the bill lessens the importance, as determined by the Competition Bureau, of gains in efficiency  attained through mergers. The bill places limits on the use of the efficiency defence that is allowed under the current wording. It is limited to gains in efficiency that benefit consumers and not solely shareholders or foreign consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Superior Propane case, the company had, in relation to a merger, pleaded gains in efficiency without specifying for whom. When the committee met, my friend and colleague, the hon. member for Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques asked Thomas Ross, of the Competition Bureau, if passing Bill C-249 would have allowed the tribunal to make a better determination in  the case. In the end, the bureau decided not to appeal the Competition Tribunal's decision, even though it felt that there were numerous negative impacts from the proposed merger. Mr. Ross responded that, in fact, if Bill C-249 had existed, they would have been better able to set limits and perhaps prevent this merger as the gains in efficiency, while they do exist,  apparently will not benefit consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the first advantage of this legislation is that it lessens the importance of gains in efficiency and also lessens the defence allowed under the interpretation  of the current section.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, and clearly specified in the bill, is that what is used to judge whether a merger is acceptable is not all pertinent factors, but specifically that gains in efficiency must provide clear benefits to Canadian and Quebec consumers, not just any consumers.  The previous speaker said that the Competition Act is primary aimed at creating wealth.  It seems to me that the ultimate purpose of the Competition Act must be not to create wealth but to ensure that consumers have access to a variety of quality products at a competitive price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that this element introduced by Bill C-249 comes far closer to the primary purpose of the Competition Act.  It is therefore the second argument, we feel, in favour of passing Bill C-249.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third is that it strikes a better balance between the interests of consumers and of shareholders when a merger is planned.  This is not the case with the present provision, there will be checks to see  who will benefit from the gains in efficiency.  This is, of course, an exercise that will be extremely difficult, but one that is necessary. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you probably know Madam Speaker, I am a member of the Standing Committee on Finance. We just tabled a report on bank mergers. Underlying all the recommendations  made to  the Minister of Finance in that report is the idea that bank mergers, through the development of international activities, can certainly serve the interests of shareholders; however, as members of Parliament and representatives of the people, we must ensure that Canadian and Quebec investors and communities also benefit from these mergers.  We all know that, although they are private businesses,  banks provide services of a quasi-public nature. For example, the accounts in these banks will have to remain accessible. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our recommendations, we ask the government and the Competition Bureau, during its review,  to make sure that the improved efficiency and economies of scale benefit not only shareholders, but also consumers, communities and investors, and especially small and medium-size businesses.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that if Bill C-249 were passed, it would reflect all of  the concerns of the Standing Committee on Finance regarding bank mergers. We know that this will be an extremely hot topic. I do not expect that it will be dealt with before the end of the Liberal leadership race, because this would obviously be an extremely sensitive issue for the candidates. However, we know that once the race is over, and maybe after the next federal election—let us not fool ourselves—bank mergers will be proposed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is in everyone's best interest that Bill C-249 be passed to set guidelines for the Competition Bureau when it comes to proposed bank mergers. That was the third argument.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth and final argument is that the Competition Act, as amended by Bill C-249, would better reflect  the objectives of public policy.  What is the purpose of legislation? It is there to serve the public interest, not private interests, and to defend the majority of citizens. In the present case, it seems to me that Bill C-249 would make for public policy that better reflects the objectives it is meant to fulfill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I will say, as I said earlier, that the Competition Act is aimed at thwarting a common  tendency in our capitalistic markets. In terms of the concentration of activities resulting in oligopolies or monopolies, we have laws to regulate monopolies and the situation regarding oligopolies is being monitored. As we know, there has been a lot of debate around oil companies and refining costs. But why do we have laws? Because we know that the concentration of businesses affects productivity. At the end of the day, when there are no more competitors, there is no need to be productive. That in turn affects the quality of both services and products. It also affects prices and economic growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competition serves not only consumers but also economic growth and, in that sense, Bill C-249 must be passed. As I mentioned at the very beginning, the Bloc Quebecois will support the bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I too wish a happy Mother's Day to every mother in Quebec and Canada.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

I  want to congratulate the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for his diligent work in bringing this particular private member's bill forward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-249 is about the balance of power between companies and consumers, big people and little people.  It seeks to amend the Competition Act to clarify the powers of the competition tribunal when making orders in the case of a merger that would, if approved, create a monopoly or near monopoly situation at the expense and detriment of consumers and competition in the marketplace.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill would have the effect of giving the competition tribunal more flexibility in approving or disapproving mergers.  It is the opinion of the member who put the bill forward that section 96 of the current Competition Act is outdated and needs to be amended to protect consumers against mergers that would allow monopolies or near monopolies with all of the negative consequences that flow from that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We in the Prairies know a little something about monopoly or near monopoly situations because prairie history is rife with protests that have occurred as a result of the stranglehold that the big railroads and grain companies have had, at present and in the past, over our farming communities and other primary shippers.  That is why I was particularly intrigued to hear the member from the Alliance talking against this bill.  The Alliance purports to speak for western Canadians, but is sadly out of touch on this particular piece of legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That near monopoly on the Prairies still applies to a great extent and our farmers continue to pay the price.  They are seeing freight rates on grain rise dramatically, whether it is grain companies, equipment manufacturers, the people who produce tractors, combines and sprayers, et cetera, or the commercial fertilizer companies.  These situations have arisen mainly because Ottawa has walked away from its responsibility to regulate these near monopolies in the public interest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, our smaller cities have also suffered as a result of the merger of Air Canada and Canadian.  In that transaction Air Canada argued that it would make the airline industry more efficient.  However, the question always remains,  efficient for whom, for the company or for the passengers and consumers the company is supposed to be serving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 36th Parliament we had to deal with the threat of mergers among the big banks that claimed this would create new efficiencies.  Sadly, that issue may not be very far away from being back in the House again. The question remains, efficient for whom, the bank or the elderly pensioner whose local branch is closing;  the bank or the teller who loses his or her job?  Our party and caucus was in the forefront of the campaign, including  my colleague from Regina—Qu'Appelle, against bank mergers, and it was a campaign that succeeded, at least temporarily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish to point out to the member proposing Bill C-249 that I do not see in his literature or testimony before committee any reference to workers.  He talks about consumers,  and rightly so, but every large merger almost inevitably means lost jobs and that has a negative effect on individuals, families and communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-249 has been before the industry, science and technology committee.   One of the witnesses who appeared before that committee on this bill was Konrad von Finckenstein, the Commissioner of Competition.  The commissioner said in testimony that he believed the bill before us today was, “a workable alternative to the status quo”.  I   interpret this to mean that the competition commissioner thinks that the current bill is too merger friendly and that he would welcome an opportunity to modernize the legislation around the Competition Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously he believes that Bill C-249  would  be helpful in that regard because it would ensure that consumers and not just companies must benefit from any gains and efficiencies being predicted due to business mergers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no unanimity in the business sector.  I note that the Canadian Federation  of  Independent Business does support the bill, while the Canadian Chamber of Commerce does not.  That again may speak to market solutions and the Canadian Alliance refusing to support this bill. </p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect that the Canadian Federation of Independent Business is opposed to this because it speaks for smaller businesses likely to be harmed by big business mergers, while the chamber speaks mainly for big business in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, I believe   Bill C-249 would  improve the Competition Act by protecting people against the most cynical and voracious business mergers.  I am happy to support the legislation.</p><A NAME="Int-542109"></A><a HREF="#Int-542111"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-542093"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.): </b>Madam Speaker, I appreciate the   comments that have been made and I extend to all my colleagues my sincere congratulations and gratitude for the work they have done on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know that  legislation is often imperfect  but we do try, as a Parliament, from time to time to change the directions in terms of the support that exists for this bill.  I am pleased to say that it is   worth the challenge that will be presented by the House at an appropriate time.  It is my hope that we can pass this bill as soon as possible so that the dangerous precedent that has been set in the status quo is not used at any time soon.  I think that would be responsible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I point out to my hon. colleague from the New Democratic Party that this would be as important for consumers as it is for workers.  It is an important bill for Canadians and certainly speaks loudly to the point that members of Parliament can and do become involved in issues with which the  government normally does not have an opportunity to involve itself.  The private member's process does indeed work.</p><A NAME="Int-542111"></A><a HREF="#Int-542113"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-542109"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos): </b>Is the House ready for the question?</p>
