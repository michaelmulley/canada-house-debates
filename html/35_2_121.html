	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, it is my duty to inform the House that 
a vacancy has occurred in the representation, namely Mr. Stephen 
Harper, member for the Electoral District of Calgary West by 
resignation effective January 14, 1997.
<P>
	Pursuant to section 25(1) (b) of the Parliament of Canada Act, I 
have addressed on Monday, January 20, 1997 my warrant to the 
Chief Electoral Officer for the issue of a writ for the election of a 
member to fill this vacancy.
<P>
	Also, today is the anniversary of the fire in 1916 which 
destroyed our original House of Commons. It is the wooden Mace 
but it will serve, of course, today as always our symbol of our 
authority to make laws.

	The House resumed from November 25, 1996 consideration of 
the motion that Bill C-300, an act respecting the establishment and 
award of a Canadian volunteer service medal and clasp for United 
Nations peacekeeping to Canadians serving with a United Nations 
peacekeeping force, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
good to be back again for another session. I am sure you have had 
many anxious moments over the last few weeks wondering just 
what was going to greet you when you got back to the House. To 
think that I would be the first person to wish you a happy new year, 
what a way to go. Happy new year, Mr. Speaker. It is only going to 
get better after this in this parliamentary session.
<P>
	This bill before us, Bill C-300, is a fascinating one which has 
gone through Parliaments before. One of my colleagues, the 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands, thought that it was important 
enough to bring it up again and finally do something about it before 
the turn of the century. Therefore I am pleased that hopefully we in 
this House will find unanimity and be able to move forward on this.
<P>
	When we talk about peacekeepers we talk about an amazing 
group of people willing to put their lives on the line, perhaps not in 
active duty but in what we would call a safe zone. One wonders if 
there is such a thing as a safe zone in this world. It is one thing for a 
peacekeeper to say ``I am going in there to try to hold two groups 
apart'', but when there has been strife and a great deal of human 
pain and tragedy, it is very difficult to be the person who walks into 
the middle to say ``here I am to try to keep peace''. It is essential to 
make peace at the beginning but it is also important to be able to 
keep the peace.
<P>
	Canadian peacekeepers have an incredible reputation around the 
world. Therefore to honour them and give them a medal for their 
service is something that is long overdue. Hopefully we will be 
able to put this bill through the House very quickly.
<P>
	This medal would provide a distinct Canadian recognition for all 
Canadians who have served with the United Nations peacekeeping 
force by awarding a Canadian volunteer service medal for 
peacekeeping, which is what we are focusing on today.
<P>
	If we want to talk about the difference between active soldiers or 
those who are involved in a fight, we may consider that 
peacekeepers may not necessarily be involved in active fighting. 
However, when the question is asked whether peacekeepers fight, I 
think the answer is yes, they do. They fight for many things. They 
fight for justice, order and maintaining the peace. One may say that 
they do not have weapons in their hands but I think they have an 
even more tenuous task because they do not have those defence 
mechanisms but they do fight.
<P>
	They fight fear and terror. There is no guarantee that they are 
going to be safe in a safe zone. They may be lunged upon from 
either side or both sides. Therefore when we say they are not active 
fighters I would have to disagree with that. They fight fear, terror 
and the unknown. The unknown is probably more frightening than 
anything else.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7548"> 7548 </A></B>
<P>
	Those of House sitting in the House of Commons came in here 
for our first day at one point, whether it was two or three years 
ago or whether it was eight, nine, twelve or even thirty-three years 
ago, but there was a first day for all of us and it was unknown. 
It is the same for any student or teacher going into a new school 
or someone going into a new business. It is the same for a 
peacekeeper going on to a peacekeeping mission. They have a fear 
because they are fighting the unknown. They are not sure what 
is going to meet them there.
<P>
	It is one thing to come in here and face adversaries in the House 
of Commons but surely that is not as terrifying, although some 
days it seems like it, perhaps even uncivil. However, to know that 
you are there on the line trying to hold peace and being there as a 
Canadian peacekeeper, one of the proudest in the world, not 
knowing if either side that you are trying to hold apart is going to 
go after each other, that is unknown and it is fear. It is also very 
difficult.
<P>
	Probably the most important fight that peacekeepers have is the 
fight of loneliness. Perhaps they are not engaged in active battle, 
but they battle loneliness. I believe that is one of the most insidious 
forms of fighting that anyone ever faces. For those peacekeepers 
who are thousands of miles away from home, family and friends 
they do not have a cell phone at their beck and call to just ring 
someone up and say ``Hi, I just wanted to tell you I love you 
today''. They fight that loneliness of knowing if and when they will 
ever get home again.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you are not terribly far from this place, but for 
those of us who come from a great distance I think we have the 
same analogy in this House as well.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	I have drawn parallels to that in some of these other areas, about 
fear and the unknown, something which is a new situation. We 
battle that as well here in the House of Commons. We battle and 
fight against loneliness because we are thousands of miles from 
home. We are away from friends. We are away from the people 
who support us. That plane ride every Sunday is difficult for all of 
us to take. We could multiply that for every peacekeeper who has 
left our country's soil and gone on a UN peacekeeping mission. 
Imagine how we would feel as we climbed on that plane.
<P>
	I want to take my hat off today and talk about how important it is 
that we recognize these peacekeepers.
<P>
	Probably first and foremost, peacekeepers need to be honoured 
because they have to work with a government which is unfocused. 
The peacekeepers are not sure exactly what it is they are supposed 
to be doing. How do they know they are doing their job when their 
job description is not clearly laid out? They need to know what 
their mission is. They need to know what their support system is. 
They need to know what their staffing is. They need to know what 
their equipment level is. If we were to ask many of them, they 
would probably shrug their shoulders and say they are not quite 
sure, but because they have pride and passion in what they are 
doing to defend their country they are going to go ahead anyway 
and do as much as they can.
<P>
	Without trying to sound cynical, maybe it is harder for the 
peacekeepers to work for and deal with the government than it is to 
work in their peacekeeping situations. Maybe they deserve a medal 
for that.
<P>
	There are many veterans on the government side. It is important 
for them to finally realize that we could give ourselves credit in the 
35th Parliament for being the group of people who had the nerve 
and the fortitude, the parallels, to be able to say yes, let us honour 
these peacekeepers.
<P>
	There are members in the House today who are nodding in 
agreement. They are saying yes, we have watched this for several 
years. As we get closer to the turn of the century it is important that 
we finally do it. We should not just think about it and talk about it; 
we should do it.
<P>
	Let me say again that the last Parliament supported this initiative 
through the introduction of two private members' bills and the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Defence and Veterans 
Affairs. They talked about the Canadian volunteer service medal 
for United Nations peacekeeping. Some wars have begun and 
ended while we have been talking about this in these hallowed 
halls.
<P>
	Let us do it. As we get closer to an election, the government has 
the mandate to get this done now and put its stamp of approval on 
it. Also, as we get closer to the turn of the century, we will be able 
to say to our Canadian peacekeepers ``way to go, well done, you 
have done a super job''.
<P>
	At a time when the military has been going through such pain, 
this would be a way of saying ``we celebrate you and we appreciate 
the many things that you have done on our behalf''.
<P>
	I want to talk about another thing that went through this 
Parliament in June of 1991. At that time the Canadian voluntary 
service medal for Korea was approved for the Canadian military 
personnel who participated in that conflict. It was in addition to the 
UN medal awarded to the veterans of the Korean war. It was a 
terrific job and certainly something we needed to see action taken 
on.
<P>
	We are speaking specifically of our Canadian peacekeepers. 
They have done a superb job in their United Nations peacekeeping 
missions. They have fought well. They have fought nobly. They 
have fought fear. They have fought terror. They have fought the 
unknown. They have fought loneliness. They have fought the battle 
for all proud and passionate Canadians when they were not quite 
sure what their mandate was. I take my hat off  to them. I trust that 
all of us in the House will take our hats off to them today. I urge the 
government to move ahead quickly and say ``yes, we will bind 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7549"> 7549 </A></B>
<P>
together in this House, regardless of political background, 
regardless of political persuasion''. We are Canadians. Let us join 
together under our Canadian flag, link arms and say ``yes, 
peacekeepers, you have done a good job, we will award you with 
the Canadian volunteer peacekeeping service medal''. We rejoice 
because we trust that is happening.
<P>
	I am a woman of faith. I am a woman of optimism. Therefore I 
trust it will happen in this House today.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for Beaver River 
for her kind words in support of this medal. I would also like to 
recognize the person whose bill is on the table, the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, for his hard work to produce this program.
<P>
	This medal has a lot of merit. It is long overdue. The thought that 
is behind it is genuine. It is universal in nature and will certainly 
fill a gap in the rights of those who serve to receive a medal.
<P>
	Some things regarding the design elements will have to be 
corrected, but that does not mean we are against the bill. Some 
small amendments have to be made. Some of the design elements 
of the bill are a little too specific, aside from usurping the authority 
of the chancellery which it would like to maintain. The final design 
needs to ensure that it will serve for some time and that it will not 
just create another problem in a couple of years.
<P>
	We want to see that this bill passes. The hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands has put his whole heart into this. Without 
question the intent is honourable.
<P>
	There are some the things we would like to see which could be 
corrected very simply. If this bill could be moved to committee, the 
committee could make the minor amendments that would be 
necessary to take it forward. Then it could be brought back to the 
House where I am sure it will receive passage on its return.
<P>
	Certain things have to be looked at and I will pick up on them 
more specifically: the protocol dealing with the chancellery, some 
of the design elements which are minor and would require minimal 
discussion. The rightful place to do that would be at the defence 
committee. When the bill is brought back to the House with those 
minor details amended, I am sure it will have the support of the 
whole committee and of the whole House.
<P>
	Other features this bill has deserve a lot of commendation. It fills 
a gap. It recognizes the winning of the Nobel peace prize. It 
recognizes actions thereafter. We would have to look at this being 
fundamentally a base medal because Canada is getting so many 
volunteer service medals or related medals that we would like to be 
able to indicate the theatre, the area specifically. This medal would 
continue to be given with a clasp designating the theatre of 
operation. People could have the basic medal and pick up a fair 
number of the theatre operation designations.
<P>
	I commend the hon. member for bringing this forward and I hope 
he will understand that if we could make these small changes the 
House will give the bill speedy passage.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
excited to be back here. I am as excited as I can possibly get to 
come back to Ottawa. I am so comfortable when I go back to my 
riding, if I can use those terms, that it definitely feels like I am 
away from home when I come back to Ottawa. I will get on with 
my presentation, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	It is encouraging to hear the parliamentary secretary support the 
creation of this peacekeeping medal. I trust he will follow through 
with his suggestion of just looking after some minor amendments 
to make it happen.
<P>
	It is my distinct honour to speak to Bill C-300 which is the 
design of my colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands. I support 
without reservation the spirit and the substance of the proposed 
legislation before the House today.
<P>
	It has been said that this bill seeks to correct a wrong, to correct a 
very serious omission of not awarding recognition in a formal 
sense to the tremendous contribution that Canadian peacekeepers 
have made. The bill asks that the Canadian government make 
available a medallion and clasp in recognition of the bravery of our 
peacekeepers.
<P>
	If there is any question of the appropriateness of bestowing such 
recognition one should consult history. I quote Commander 
General Guy Simonds in 1942. He surmised: ``The final criterion 
of a good or bad award is the reaction of the troops. If the troops 
feel it is a good award, it is a good award. If the awards are 
criticized by the troops, they are bad awards''. He goes on to say: 
``Before forwarding any recommendation, at each level the 
commander should ask himself the question `would the front line 
soldier, if he knew the facts, consider this well deserved?'''
<P>
	In light of General Simonds recommendation for the criterion 
one should use in consideration of an award to the peacekeeping 
personnel, there can be no question of the course of action we, as 
parliamentarians, should pursue. We know that it was input from 
the Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans Association that moved my 
colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands to introduce Bill C-300.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7550"> 7550 </A></B>
<P>
	I suggest that everyone in this House has a friend, an 
acquaintance, who has served on a peacekeeping mission. In fact, 
in my own riding, I have a consistent visitor, Mr. Ron Howard, 
who has conversed frequently with the Department of National 
Defence over this peacekeeping initiative. He has been keeping 
me up to date on the feelings of the veterans, those who really 
laid their lives down to make this world a better place. I respect 
him for his persistence. I respect him for his consideration of his 
fellow soldiers, his colleagues. I certainly respect him for his 
dealings with myself in pushing me forward and keeping me 
abreast of the concerns that many of the veterans have, especially 
the peacekeeping veterans.
<P>
	They appreciate their United Nations medals and it is their hope 
and desire that Canada provide a distinctive recognition for their 
peacekeeping efforts. It is therefore only fitting that a volunteer 
service medal be awarded by the Government of Canada to 
peacekeepers who have served our nation well. This legislation 
would authorize the issuance of such a medallion.
<P>
	I would also like to state for the record that there can be no 
question that Canadians soldiers are the bravest in the world. Time 
and time again our personnel have demonstrated ability and 
courage under difficult circumstances and in perilous situations. I 
think of Bosnia and some of the very tense moments when our 
peacekeepers were nailed down and sequestered, even entrapped in 
some areas in a very dangerous situation. They are recognized for 
their bravery and courage.
<P>
	It is noteworthy that in this legislation there are provisions for 
the recognition of members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
and other Canadian citizens who qualify. This is a significant and 
proper recognition, given the increasingly perilous situations 
RCMP officers find themselves in overseas.
<P>
	I had the opportunity to ride back on a plane with a troop of 
RCMP officers who had served in Bosnia. I do not think it is well 
known that we have RCMP officers serving in that capacity, 
teaching the rule of law to those in other nations where there is 
conflict. Of course there is more recognition in Haiti.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	It is a tough situation to be in an area of conflict without any 
weapons. Those officers inform me that often they were 
sequestered in one room with really nothing to defend themselves 
because of the conflict raging on around them. That is a tough 
situation to be in. I believe that it is fitting to recognize them for 
those brave acts. They are jeopardizing their lives by falling into 
those circumstances.
<P>
	The RCMP troops were sent over overseas to train fledgling 
police departments the principles that are central to our democracy, 
for example, the fair and unbiased application of the law and the 
separation of politics from policing, something that is 
unfortunately  deteriorating in this part of the world. For that 
reason the RCMP officers should, for their contribution to 
Canada's peacekeeping efforts, be recognized.
<P>
	In summary, I would like to state some of the obvious. There is 
justification for looking at history and bringing it forward in a 
manner so that it can be recognized by the public that there is a 
need to recognize our soldiers. Among the reasons for supporting 
this legislation is providing a distinctive Canadian recognition to 
all Canadians who have served with the United Nations 
peacekeeping force by awarding a Canadian volunteer service 
medal, and to give recognition for the September 30, 1988 Nobel 
peace prize awarded to Canadian peacekeepers signified by a clasp 
on the medal's ribbon.
<P>
	The 34th Parliament supported this initiative through the 
introduction of two private members' bills. The standing 
committee on defence and veterans affairs in a peacekeeping report 
called for the establishment of a Canadian volunteer service medal 
for United Nations peacekeeping. Another reason for support is the 
endorsement of a distinct Canadian recognition for our 
peacekeepers comes from the Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans 
Association and the Canadian Association United Nations 
Peacekeeping Chapter.
<P>
	There is a lot of support at all levels. Other countries, Belgium, 
the Netherlands, Ireland, Ghana and the United States already have 
distinctive national medal awards for peacekeeping. We would not 
be alone.
<P>
	Parliament set a precedent in June 1991 by approving the award 
of the Canadian Volunteer Service Medal for Korea to its Canadian 
personnel. This is, in addition to the UN medal, awarded to 
veterans of the Korean war and a Canadian medal worn with a 
ribbon shared with the Commonwealth countries of Great Britain, 
Australia and New Zealand.
<P>
	Recognition would not be limited to the Canadian forces but 
would include the RCMP and other Canadians who qualify. I 
believe that would be a wonderful addition because so many others 
within our different agencies are risking their lives to support world 
peace.
<P>
	Finally, other nations such as Sweden and Finland are 
establishing a medallion award for their peacekeepers. New 
Zealand and Australia are also considering such an award. It is 
therefore only fitting that Canada not be left out.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues on the opposite side of the House to quickly 
rush through whatever amendments would be deemed necessary to 
quickly finalize this initiative by my colleague for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by welcoming everyone back 
to the House. I am sure we have all enjoyed a tremendous break and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7551"> 7551 </A></B>
<P>
look forward, as the hon. member who just spoke, to very eagerly  
returning to the House and working together in an enthusiastic and 
co-operative manner.
<P>
<B>(1130 )</B>
<P>
	Before I address the matter at hand I would like to congratulate 
the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands for reaching this far 
with his private members' bill. I know full well the hurdles one has 
to jump in order to get this far. Mr. Speaker, let me tell you it is not 
easy.
<P>
	Moreover I would like to pay tribute to the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands. As I understand it he will not be seeking 
re-election and I am sorry to hear that. He certainly is an 
honourable member and a good friend. I enjoyed working with him 
while serving on the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs, particularly on the Special Joint Committee on 
Canada's Defence Policy. He has been a competent adversary and a 
diligent politician. The House will miss him.
<P>
	We know the member for Saanich-Gulf Islands put forward the 
same bill in the previous session of Parliament. Unfortunately, like 
so many other worthwhile private members' bills, it never reached 
the end of the legislative process. As many members also know, I 
spoke in favour of that bill then and I am happy to say that I support 
this bill now.
<P>
	However, I must qualify that by saying that the bill before us 
now is not perfect. The concept behind the bill is commendable and 
I agree with it. Our troops need to be treated with respect and as 
such should be decorated for their service.
<P>
	As we all know, Canada is world renowned for its international 
efforts. That reputation has been over a century in the making. 
Moreover since the second world war our participation in 
international peacekeeping missions has enhanced our reputation, 
as was said earlier here. I am not ignoring the recent revelations 
about several incidents but I do think our entire Canadian forces 
should not be marred by it.
<P>
	The high quality of Canada's troops is envied around the world. 
In fact it mirrors the quality of life in Canada in general. When 
travelling abroad Canadians are welcomed more than people of any 
other nation. The reason for that is our outlook on life. By nature 
Canadians are fair, patient people. This applies equally well to our 
troops.
<P>
	We should not forget the accomplishments of the Canadian 
forces. We should embrace them. A nation proud of its military is a 
strong and united nation. I am not suggesting that we become more 
like the Americans. I do not want us to look at our forces as flexing 
our muscles. We leave that to the thinking of others. But we should 
look at our forces as an example of what we can accomplish if we 
agree to work together.
<P>
	We should look at our forces as one common attribute. Our 
military is a joint effort by Canadians from coast to coast to coast. 
Without the participation from all regions, from all provinces and 
yes, even from all communities, we have no national military.
<P>
	Our reserves play a major role in providing a link between our 
communities and our Canadian forces. This particularly was an 
important aspect which received a lot of attention in 1995 when the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
reviewed the report by the commission on the restructuring of the 
reserves. Numerous members of this House spoke out on how the 
reserves expose the community to the military. Without it 
Canadians would think less of the military than they do now.
<P>
	Our military can be the foundation to rebuilding our national 
unity. We should not look down upon them; in fact, we should look 
up to them. They are willing to risk everything for the sake of not 
only their country but someone else's.
<P>
	Millions of Canadians during our history have given their lives 
to protecting their country, but there have also been countless 
Canadians who have given their lives going further than that. They 
have given their lives to protecting not Canada but a foreign 
country. It would be hard enough to put one's life on the line for 
one's own country, but to put it on the line for a foreign country, a 
foreign land, is an entirely different thing. For that reason we 
should ensure that we properly decorate that service.
<P>
	Some may say that there are a multitude of medals to award the 
services of our forces. However there still exist some missions that 
have yet to receive the proper decoration. Certainly our troops 
serving abroad in UN led missions do receive United Nations 
medals and ribbons, but I ask and the hon. member across asks, is 
that enough? Should we ourselves not recognize that service in the 
name of this country? Is it not appropriate for Canada to do like 
other United Nations member countries and present its forces with 
a distinctive Canadian medal for service in the United Nations 
peacekeeping missions?
<P>
	What is proposed here today can alleviate that problem. But as 
legislators it is our privilege and duty to ensure that we do not 
create one problem while trying to resolve another. Rarely is 
anything as simple as it first seems, and this is no different. It is for 
that reason that I am suggesting that we refer this bill to the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs or 
better yet, to a subcommittee thereof.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	It has been said before in the House and elsewhere that this bill 
has the support of various associations representing current and 
retired members of the Canadian forces. I need not list them all for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7552"> 7552 </A></B>
<P>
I believe their names have already been mentioned. But suffice it to 
say that if these organizations and all the members within support 
this bill, then perhaps it does deserve a thorough study.
<P>
	This is further evidence for why the bill should be referred to the 
committee because it deserves that. It deserves a close examination 
of its objective, the process of achieving that objective, and 
whether it will have the intended result.
<P>
	With the indulgence of the House I would like to spend a few 
moments providing some positive criticism of the bill. The 
member's bill as it now stands dictates a very specific medal as was 
mentioned earlier. However it does not include missions that are 
not UN led. This may exclude people who I am sure the hon. 
member intended to include.
<P>
	What about our troops who have participated in NATO led 
missions such as IFOR, the peace implementation force in Bosnia? 
That, as we all know was a very difficult mission. It has been said 
the mission was to uphold a very fragile peace. In fact, it has been 
said that there was no peace at all at the time. However, I will leave 
that debate to another time.
<P>
	Nevertheless I think we have to be very careful not to exclude 
some members of our forces who have participated in 
peacekeeping missions led by either the United Nations or the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization. I firmly believe that if this bill 
were to be adopted and such a medal awarded, it would be a grave 
mistake to exclude some soldiers because their mission was led by 
NATO and not by the UN and I do not think we should bias 
ourselves on this issue.
<P>
	Another aspect of the bill that we can improve is the detailed 
specifications of the design of the medal. I mean the hon. member 
for Saanich-Gulf Islands no disrespect when I say he has put too 
much into this bill. The design of the medal as contained in the bill 
is too specific. I hope the hon. member is open to some alternative 
design specifications. This could be further examined during 
committee hearings and a mutually agreed to compromise can be 
achieved. There the committee members and the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands himself could hear testimony from various 
witnesses and the list could include many people.
<P>
	I also appreciate that several members have given consideration 
to the cost of such an initiative, but I do not think we should lose 
sight of why we want to do this. We should not let money 
considerations prevent us from doing this properly. Yes, we should 
look at ways of keeping the cost down but not to the extent of 
negating the whole exercise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would also like to speak in support of Bill C-300 and commend the 
hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands for bringing it forward. I 
hope that, as has been  suggested, it will pass second reading 
possibly without a vote, if we can all agree to send it off to 
committee in a spirit of unanimity, to be studied there and possibly 
improved.
<P>
	However, to echo some of the concerns I have heard expressed, I 
hope this is not a means by which the government, or at least some 
members on the government side, hope to bury it in committee. I 
hope it is a genuine desire to see the bill improved to address some 
of its alleged imperfections and have it come back to the House and 
passed so that indeed we can as a Parliament express through the 
establishment of this medal the fact that as a Parliament and as a 
country we appreciate and want to recognize Canadians who have 
served in Canadian peacekeeping operations and perhaps in other 
operations which are perceived in the same way but which may not 
be technically peacekeeping or technically UN peacekeeping.
<P>
	I hope we can do this quickly because we do not want to see a 
situation that other veterans have found themselves in. It was not so 
long ago, at the beginning of this Parliament, that I had a private 
members' motion, not a bill, calling for the awarding of a medal 
that would recognize the service of veterans of the Dieppe raid, 
who for a variety of reasons did not receive the medal other 
veterans received for serving in World War II. They waited for over 
50 years for this kind of recognition. It eventually came as a result 
of my private members' motion. It was not exactly what the motion 
called for but it was a form of recognition.
<P>
	It may indeed be the case that a similar thing will happen here 
where the outcome will not be exactly what the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands has in mind. However, hopefully it will be 
close enough or perhaps even improved in such a way that we will 
all be satisfied with the result.
<P>
	I commend the member and express my support and I am sure 
the support of my colleagues in the NDP caucus. We look forward 
to seeing this matter expeditiously dealt with.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> It is my duty to inform the 
House that if the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands speaks 
now, he will close the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as you will no doubt detect, there is a substantial amount of support 
for Bill C-300 in this House. It is my fervent hope that the bill can 
be referred to committee taking into account the thoughtful and 
constructive criticism that has been presented not only in this 
House but from people across the country who have familiarized 
themselves with the bill and that we can bring it to fruition before 
the 35th Parliament is dissolved for the election.

	As my colleague from Beaver River mentioned, this bill has 
been proposed on a number of occasions by the Standing 
Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs and by two 
private members' bills in the previous Parliament. I think it would 
be absolutely abhorrent to have this bill die before it was passed 
into law.
<P>
	With that I will conclude my address and seek the support of the 
House for Bill C-300.

	The House resumed, from December 13, 1996, consideration of 
Bill C-60, an act to establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
and to repeal and amend other acts as a consequence, as reported 
(with amendments) from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 24, 
25 and 26.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
very pleased to have an opportunity this morning to speak to Bill 
C-60 at report stage.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	I think we need to refresh our memories, because it has been 
more than a month and a half since we last discussed Bill C-60, a 
bill that will have the effect of creating a Canadian food inspection 
agency.
<P>
	It will be a parapublic agency, rather like those school boards we 
have in Quebec. This parapublic agency will be responsible for 
setting standards for the safety, quality and manufacture of food 
products.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill is to consolidate the food inspection 
services of three departments, which are the departments of health, 
fisheries and oceans and agriculture and agri-food.
<P>
	You will probably recall that in December, there was an aspect of 
the bill that bothered opposition members, and I mean both the 
Reform Party and the official opposition, the Bloc Quebecois. I am 
referring to the manner in which the executives of this parapublic 
agency will be appointed. The president and the vice-president will 
be appointed by the governor in council, and the president can 
appoint an advisory board of 12 members.
<P>
	You know as well as I do that the government of the Prime 
Minister, the member for Saint-Maurice, will appoint a Liberal, 
and that the president will appoint a vice-president who will be a 
Liberal as well. I hardly need to tell you what political affiliation 
the members of the advisory board will have. So we have a nice 
little board which the minister of agriculture or the governor in 
council, in other words, cabinet, will be able to control.
<P>
	This parapublic agency is a very important body because it will 
employ some 4,500 people. I remind you as well that, to properly 
prepare everything, under Bill C-60, the hiring rules would be 
suspended for a period of up to two years. So the new agency, 
which in theory is to begin operations by the first of April, is being 
readied as a patronage haven.
<P>
	We in the Bloc Quebecois have proposed amendments that 
would significantly improve it, because there is obviously some 
merit in the objectives. We do not, however, agree with the 
government's underhanded approach to achieving its ends. I hope 
the government takes a lot of interest in passing our amendments, 
for the welfare of our fellow Canadians across the country.
<P>
	By combining the food inspection services of these three 
departments, we could save a lot of money. Overlap is often 
criticized, but with this measure, if it is well administered, we 
could save up to $40 million annually. That is a significant amount. 
We salute the initiative, but not so much the way of going about it. 
There is the issue of transparency.
<P>
	The aim of the amendments we proposed in group No. 8 is to 
have the new food inspection agency submit its business plan 
annually to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7554"> 7554 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-60 provides for the president of the new agency to submit 
his business plan to the minister of agriculture, who will have to 
approve the plan within 15 days. In  other words, the minister may, 
as I said earlier, pull some strings in order to concoct a business 
plan to his liking.
<P>
	So, here is what we propose to do to amend clause 22. I would 
like to read it to you so that all elected members of this House can 
realize how important this debate is.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As soon as possible after the Agency is established and at least once every five 
years after that, the Agency must submit a corporate business plan, for study, to such 
committee of the House of Commons as designated or established to consider 
agricultural matters for study by that committee.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	After reviewing the agency's business plan, the committee 
referred to in the subsection I just read either approves or rejects 
the plan.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture should not fear the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture. Do not think for a moment that the 
agriculture committee is controlled by Quebec sovereignists, or by 
Reformers from western Canada; this committee is made up of 
eight members of the Liberal Party, two members of the Bloc 
Quebecois and two members of the Reform Party. Simple 
mathematics indicates an easy Liberal majority of eight against 
four, not to mention the fact that the Chair is also a Liberal. That 
makes nine Liberals against four opposition members. It would not 
be such a big deal, since it would involve not just a single 
individual, but the committee as a whole. So we are dealing with 13 
members. This way, the committee could become less of a 
babysitting service for members and more useful as a place where 
members of the various committees can take their responsibilities 
and provide thoughtful advice to their-I am talking about Liberal 
members of course-Minister of Agriculture, who is, 
unfortunately, often out of touch with the realities faced by farming 
communities across Canada.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture, who hails from Saskatchewan, is 
familiar with the particular difficulties associated with farming in 
that western province. But when it comes to a highly diversified 
agriculture like we have in the maritimes, in Ontario and in 
Quebec, we have to forgive the minister because he really does not 
know much about that type of agriculture.
<P>
	So, this is the amendment I proposed in this House with the 
support of the hon. member for Matapédia-Matane.
<P>
	Another suggestion we are making here also has to do with 
clause 22, but at line 9. I will read the amendment that we propose 
and I hope Liberal members will consider it. I also hope they will 
not follow the party line dictated by their minister and will not all 
vote against the amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>any person from the agriculture, fisheries, food processing, food distribution and 
public health sectors whom the Agency considers appropriate to consult;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The agency would not have to ask the minister's authorization to 
consult groups other than those  scheduled to be included in the 
new agency. It would also be in a position to consult any provincial 
government that makes a written request to that effect to the 
agency.
<P>
	All these reasons should convince hon. members opposite to 
support these motions in amendment, which seek to improve Bill 
C-60.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to join the debate on Bill C-60, the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency Act, and to lend our support to the credible 
proposals put forward by our colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	While we do not always support them, and in fact object to many 
of the principles for which they stand, it is enlightening to hear they 
want to participate in amending legislation to make it good 
legislation for the benefit of all Canadians. Therefore, we like to 
see these types of proposals coming forward from our colleagues in 
the Bloc.
<P>
	In general terms, Bill C-60, the Canadian Food Inspection 
Agency Act, unfortunately is another smoke and mirror policy by 
the federal government where it says that it is doing something but 
when you take a real good close look at it you find that it has done 
next to nothing other than shuffle the numbers.
<P>
	I think back to when the government created NavCan, an agency 
to handle air navigation in Canada. It cost $200 million to provide 
severance pay to the civil servants who lost their jobs on Friday. 
Each and every one of those civil servants was hired back by 
NavCan on Monday morning. The Canadian taxpayers came up 
with $200 million in severance pay for those people and not one of 
them lost his or her job.
<P>
	The President of the Treasury Board could stand up in the House 
and claim: ``We have reduced the size of the civil service by 6,400 
people. That is a great and wonderful accomplishment''. In fact 
nothing really changed except the name on the letterhead and the 
name on the pay stub of the cheque. This is what I mean by smoke 
and mirrors.
<P>
	Once again an agency is going to be set up and these civil 
servants are going to lose their jobs. They are no longer going to be 
civil servants. They are going to get severance pay on Friday and 
start working for the agency on Monday. Nothing will be changed 
except the taxpayer will be poorer. We have been taken to the 
cleaners once more courtesy of the policies put forward by the 
government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7555"> 7555 </A></B>
<P>
	The motions we are debating at the moment call for a business 
plan to be put before the agricultural committee to tell committee 
members how the agency wishes to follow through. Since the 
agency is a creation of this House it seems only appropriate that 
agency would come  back to the House and tell us its business plan 
because this House is going to be giving the agency or has been 
giving the agency about $300 million a year to do its job.
<P>
	With that kind of money we expect to know what the agency 
intends to do and how it intends to do it. How is it going to do the 
job better than it did it in the past? How is it going to be more 
efficient? How is it going to be more productive? How are the 
farmers going to be better served by this agency? If we, as 
parliamentarians, are being asked to vote on this bill to give the 
authority to spend taxpayers' money in some new way, then surely 
we would expect the agency to come to this House and tell us how 
it can do it so we can pass comment.
<P>
	It seems to me, since this is a motion being put forward by the 
opposition party, that the Liberals in a knee jerk reaction are going 
to say no we do not want to hear about this. We do not want to see if 
there is common sense or a lack of common sense in the way this 
agency is being run. We do not want to know if there is waste, 
mismanagement and incompetence in this organization. But there 
will be because I have not seen accountability built into this 
organization.
<P>
	A group of farmers came to me some months ago complaining 
about the way the government is building in the cost recovery to 
these situations. I agree that if the government, through its 
agencies, is providing service to a group of people, there should be 
some element of cost recovery thought about and maybe built into 
the system. That cost recovery program dealt with farmers. The 
situation was the approval and the licensing of animal feed to 
ensure that it met the appropriate standards.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	I have no problem with our regulating to ensure that the feed we 
give to animals will not harm individuals as it flows through the 
food chain for human consumption. However, on the cost recovery 
methodology that is built in, there is a huge bureaucracy that they 
wanted to recover the cost of. If they had five applications a year 
for a new feed to be licensed, the cost of this huge bureaucracy was 
spread over five applications. If they had 50 applications in another 
year the cost was spread over the 50 applications. The size of the 
bureaucracy did not change whether it was five or fifty 
applications. They were just going to pass their cost on to the 
unfortunate consumer of their service who happened to pick a bad 
year for applying for a licence.
<P>
	That is not being accountable to the consumer. That is being 
arrogant in the way we can dictate and legislate what people have 
to pay. It means that they do not give a hoot about the service they 
provide. They are just going to legislate that everyone will pay for 
their costs but will have no input into their cost. People will pay the 
bill because they cannot avoid the service being provided by 
government. That is wrong because we need accountability.
<P>
	The private sector has accountability through competition. I 
have attended seminars in Victoria where we had public accounts 
committees from across Canada and representatives from the 
United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and 
various other countries to try to wrestle with the issue of 
accountability.
<P>
	I found that in other areas of the world the capacity to create the 
kind of competition in a market where civil servants have to ensure 
that they are delivering a competent service, that the price is 
reasonable, that the quality is good in order for them to keep their 
job, because that is how it works in the private sector, it does not 
matter what service or product one produces or sells, if one does 
not provide good service and quality at a reasonable price they will 
not be in business.
<P>
	Government has to learn the same attitude. We need to have 
good quality, good prices and good services. However, it comes all 
the way back to what we have talked about here for the last three 
years, the lack of accountability in this House, the lack of 
accountability by the government over there and the fact that it has 
ignored the needs and desires of Canadians, the lack of integrity 
that we have seen from over there, the fact that it has not been 
responsible in managing the affairs of this country with the $600 
billion debt that we have accumulated.
<P>
	We see it more again in the way the government has addressed 
this bill. Accountability, integrity and responsibility are three 
individual words that this government has not heard of, has not 
thought about and has no intention of living by. However, if we 
were to have that in the legislation that has been brought before this 
House we would have a government that listens to the people and 
meets the needs of the people in food inspection, in eliminating the 
GST, in expense accounts that are proper and just everywhere, in 
inquiries that are set up because the government wants to shuffle 
paper and bad press on to an inquiry and then when the inquiry-I 
am thinking of the Somali inquiry-becomes an embarrassment, 
the government shuts it down.
<P>
	Accountability, integrity and responsibility, the overarching 
theme that every government should think about but which this 
government has never thought about. We see it again in Bill C-60. I 
cannot think of anything more accountable for an agency than to 
have a business plan brought before Parliament for our opinions 
and input in order that we can see that it is going in the direction 
that we had anticipated when we gave it this authority. That speaks 
volumes in the way this government, even in the small things, 
ignores the wishes of Canadians. That is why we need to see real 
change. If there is not a change in this government then let us 
change the government at the next election.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-60 at report stage. 
Members will recall that this is the bill that will establish the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	Before we broke for the holidays, we saw that under this bill the 
federal government's involvement in this sector would be reduced 
from three services to a single agency. Members will also recall 
that this sector comes under provincial jurisdiction. It was 
nonetheless felt that at last the federal government was doing 
something constructive after years of being urged to take action.
<P>
	The bill needs to be improved, however. It is with this in mind 
that the Bloc Quebecois has presented the series of amendments 
regarding the corporate business plan and the form of consultations 
to be held in connection with the plan.
<P>
	Why is the corporate business plan important? It is important 
because the Canadian Food Inspection Agency must submit to the 
minister a multi-year plan outlining what it intends to do, its 
planning strategy. In the bill as it appears, without the amendments, 
this plan is submitted to the minister. There is no other form of 
consultation. It is not submitted to the House of Commons, or even 
the agriculture committee. Nor is there any obligation to consult 
industry or the provinces. There is not, in our view, sufficient 
consultation of the auditor general.
<P>
	Often, viewers wonder what the purpose of this consultation will 
be. It must be remembered that the agency will play an important 
role in the competitive aspect of the agri-food industry in Canada. 
Now that we have an increasing number of international markets, 
and the prospect of increasing trade in agri-food products, the way 
the government structures its inspection activities will have a direct 
impact on the entire industry's production costs.
<P>
	It is therefore important that this corporate business plan meet 
more than just the agency's criteria of efficiency and effectiveness, 
perhaps very, very stringent standards, which is desirable, but 
which would not, however, necessarily take into account the 
situation in the various regions of Canada, and of Quebec. It would 
also not take into account comments from industry. This can be 
seen in a number of sectors.
<P>
	I will give you an example that I think is significant. In the dairy 
production sector, the milk subsidy is quietly being phased out. 
More and more pressure is being put on the dairy industry to be 
cost-effective, yet there are fewer and fewer positive federal 
government programs. Such programs will be absolutely necessary 
where inspection is concerned.
<P>
	When the Food Inspection Agency submits its action plan to the 
government, it will be important for that plan to take into account
<P>
that, yes, cost savings must be made, but our industry also needs to 
be given sufficient support. A balance must be struck between 
these two elements.
<P>
	The present wording of the bill does not do this. It does not, for 
instance, allow the agriculture committee, on which all parties, as 
well as all regions of Canada, are represented, to gather input from 
MPs who have been given all manner of comments and suggestions 
by their constituents. If the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's 
business plan were tabled in that committee, that would be the time 
for this to be done.
<P>
	Let me take the question of slaughterhouses as an example. The 
Food Inspection Agency will, perhaps, have a Canada-wide view. 
There may be a regulatory approach to slaughterhouses which 
meets the requirements of the major ones in Canada, but 
consultation with the MPs might perhaps provide a different point 
of view, a view of the particular situations of regional 
slaughterhouses. This type of consultation by the agriculture 
committee would, in our opinion, make a substantial positive 
contribution to the quality of the Food Inspection Agency's 
business plan, which would then clearly reflect the reality in all 
parts of the country.
<P>
	The provinces are another sector it is important to consult. Let us 
keep in mind that both levels of government are involved in food 
inspection.
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	Years ago, provincial governments, and especially the 
Government of Quebec, did their homework and established 
adequate systems for monitoring the quality of food inspection 
services.
<P>
	The federal government is restructuring, but if there is no proper 
consultation when the corporate business plan is drafted, as there is 
in any system, this may cause the following problem: the federal 
agency will want to expand and take its responsibilities very 
seriously, and there will be areas of friction with the provinces. If 
these areas are not cleared up before, as part of a consultation 
process that is not necessarily costly, this may lead to legal 
problems, court proceedings and confrontation.
<P>
	The agency may also be in a situation that often makes no sense 
at all, where you have two inspectors at different levels of 
government doing a job that is practically the same or very similar. 
The private sector is sick and tired of this duplication.
<P>
	I think that with proper consultation before the corporate 
business plan is implemented, we could avoid a lot of grief. 
Quebecers and Canadians would certainly be better off with food 
inspection services that reflect the real situation.
<P>
	Elected representatives should be asked about the situation that 
exists in their ridings, the provinces should be consulted to avoid 
friction between the federal government and the provincial govern-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7557"> 7557 </A></B>
<P>
ments and we must ensure that all programs that are supposed to 
assist companies are helpful and not a source of red tape.
<P>
	Look what happened in England with mad cow disease. Since we 
may face a similar emergency in the future, the agency's corporate 
business plan must allow for such contingencies. Because of 
financial constraints, the plan may tend to overlook such situations 
and fail to provide for these exceptional cases, but it is important to 
allow for such occurrences and include provisions in the agency's 
action plan.
<P>
	Why can we not rely on the minister alone? This is no reflection 
on the competence of the minister or on any person who will be in 
that position. Open consultation on food inspection is just as 
important as the heart of the question.
<P>
	This is an area where the appearance of justice and equality and 
the fair handling of situations are just as important as the essence of 
the issues. We must make sure that Canadians and Quebecers have 
faith in their quality control system, know it is closely monitored 
and understand that it is beyond the grasp of political meddling.
<P>
	If the agency submits its business plan to the minister only, 
obviously, the minister will try to protect the government and its 
interests. He does not necessarily always have all the information 
he needs to monitor a sector like this one countrywide. Our 
international reputation is at stake. We must make sure that at any 
given point our system is beyond reproach and provides a 
satisfactory guarantee to consumers not only in Quebec and Canada 
but around the world. It has an impact on various other sectors. We 
must not forget that food inspection is part of an industry's 
development programs.
<P>
	We often speak of genetics programs and of research and 
development. If the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's corporate 
plan makes minimal provision for research and development and 
the sector's monitoring methods, we risk, in the medium term, 
running into problems.
<P>
	Some things are not of primary concern to the people in food 
inspection-that is as it should be-but they are to the people in 
research and development in the agri-food sector. These people 
must be given the opportunity to express their views and the fact 
that experiments may need to be conducted, but not necessarily 
under the same rules as a product to be marketed.
<P>
	There are all sorts of considerations like this, which, in our 
opinion-and I think the Reform Party shares our opinion-point 
to the fact that consultation as planned with the minister only is 
inadequate. This bill requires considerable improvement. It 
requires improvement to ensure that Canadians who see the 
agency's business plan can say: ``This plan has been seen by 
members of the  standing committee, the industry and the 
provinces. The result is truly the product of a consensus and of the 
actions proposed by the entire population''.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I consider the amendments very reasonable and I 
hope the Liberal majority will accept them so that, in the end, we 
will have a better bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I commend the 
opposition for bringing forth amendments which they feel will 
improve the bill. That being said, there is a little misinformation 
about what the roles in Parliament are and the latitudes each has.
<P>
	When we look at the bill and the agency which is being formed 
in this case, the ultimate person responsible is the minister. There is 
absolutely no question that if there is a problem with the agency, if 
corrections have to made, if budgets have to be altered and if some 
things have to be changed, the ultimate responsibility falls on the 
minister and the government. In the amendment the suggestion is 
that the House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture 
and Agri-Food be the committee to deal with the approval of the 
administrative budgets and the approval of the annual reports.
<P>
	Quite frankly, it is the responsibility of the committee of the 
House of Commons to examine every aspect of operations in 
government affairs. Very clearly, the standing committee on 
agriculture can bring forth any issue. It can bring forward the issue 
of a business plan. It can deal with that with every industry across 
the country. It can deal with that with every provincial government 
across the country. And it can clearly deal with the agency. It is the 
standing committee's authority given by the House to deal with 
those issues and bring them forward to the public, discuss them and 
allow public input.
<P>
	In fact what is being suggested in the bill goes beyond the 
latitude of standing committee operations. It is being suggested 
that the standing committee must approve government operations 
for which it is not responsible if something goes wrong. It is 
responsible to the House to investigate issues and make 
recommendations to the ministry and to the House. There is a 
misconception about the responsible role of each person in this 
type of government. That is unfortunate. Again I would point out it 
is extremely important that the final approval be given to the 
minister so that the minister can act very quickly.
<P>
	Food inspection is very, very important to that industry in this 
country. There is no question that when we ran into some 
difficulties over food inspection, the minister and his ministry 
acted very quickly and immediately to make certain the problems 
were dealt with properly. That is why it is important for the 
minister  to be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7558"> 7558 </A></B>
<P>
ready to act at any time. We do not put other vehicles in the way of 
swift action.
<P>
	The Canadian government has always put food safety as a 
priority and will continue to do so. There is no question that we 
have a worldwide reputation for dealing with issues swiftly and 
conclusively and making certain that Canadians have the safest and 
best food supply in the world. The minister and his ministry are 
responsible for that.
<P>
	If it happened that the House of Commons standing committee 
would deal with those issues as has been suggested by the 
opposition, we would have to set up a very large portion of full time 
staff to deal with consultations across the country, with added 
expenses to the government and to make certain that hearings are 
held across the country.
<P>
	This has been particularly well set out in Bill C-60. It is my 
understanding that every province in the country supports the fact 
that this agency will be of crucial importance to the agricultural 
community in those provinces. All industries across this country 
support our position with regard to agencies. When we look at it, 
we have consulted with all of the provinces and the industry. We 
are accountable through the minister and through the questioning in 
this House as well as the public hearings that are carried on in the 
House of Commons standing committee.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	Clearly, the support of the provinces and industry in this agency 
is very important. I might underline the fact too that there is no 
question that outside reporting agencies such as the auditor general 
have to comment on the concerns within this bill. Therefore, there 
is no question that the accountability for this agency is there 
through the minister's office, through the auditor general's office, 
through the processes of public consultation, through the 
department as well as through the standing committee.
<P>
	I cannot see how we can support this motion. It certainly does 
not fulfil what I would suggest is the role of responsible 
government.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> After a break of several weeks, 
Mr. Speaker, the names of the various ridings do not come to us as 
easily. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to wish 
you happy New Year.
<P>
	The three motions made by the Bloc Quebecois regarding this 
bill, which are part of Group No. 8, are very worthwhile motions. 
Why is that? Because as the legislation stands at present, all that is 
required is for the agency to submit a business plan to the minister. 
That is not enough in our opinion because these provisions have  
caused considerable controversy within the industry. There is a 
distinct lack of transparency.
<P>
	This is why, concerned with improving the bill and making a 
positive contribution to the legislative process, the Bloc Quebecois 
asks that everything be submitted to the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture. This seems to be the thing to do because this is all 
new: three former federal inspection services amalgamated into a 
single one coming under the agriculture minister's authority. 
Granted, that is a good thing. And the opposition did not object to 
the consolidation of three federal agencies. That is not the problem.
<P>
	In this whole process, it is clear that the Minister of Agriculture 
wants to retain as much power as possible. This is a tendency we 
have been noticing for a few months with this government, a 
tendency to have responsibility rest with a minister instead of with 
the governor in council. You know as well as I do that the 
expression ``governor in council'' means cabinet.
<P>
	Now, under Bill C-25, I think, for what had been the normal 
process so far to be operative, the phrase ``by order of the governor 
in council'' will have to be included, for particular matters to be 
discussed in cabinet from now on. More importantly our motions 
seek to ensure that they at least be submitted to the members of this 
House who sit on the agriculture committee so that they can 
examine whatever changes the minister may want to make from 
time to time.
<P>
	We will support the good ones; opposition members do not sit 
either on the various committees or in this House to object to 
changes that may be positive, worthwhile. There is a another 
condition however, and that is the drift of the second motion. The 
agency should be required to consult both the farming industry or 
the agri-food sector as a whole and the provinces; in fact, all 
concerned.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	Should this amendment be rejected, there is currently no such 
guarantee provided in the legislation. We believe such a measure 
would protect the future of the agri-food industry. It also concerns 
the health sector, however, since the inspection of food has an 
impact on health.
<P>
	I am a now member of the Standing Committee on Health, and I 
care a lot about public health. It is necessary to inspect food. Just 
think of what happened in certain countries, Great Britain, for 
instance, with the whole problem of the mad cow disease. An 
agency such as this one must be able to protect public health; it 
must have public health as its main concern. This is why it must 
operate properly and have credibility. And in order to have 
credibility, consultation and transparency are required.
<P>
	We could make other analogies. When it comes to controversial 
issues relating to health, such as the tainted blood scandal-and I 
am not only thinking of Canada, but of the western countries-any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7559"> 7559 </A></B>
<P>
process relating to health, including the inspection of food, must be 
credible and transparent. People must have confidence in it.
<P>
	We are not trying to be aggressive. We are not proposing things 
to make a big fuss. We want the public to feel confident about the 
food it consumes, thanks to the presence of a federal agency. I am 
from Quebec and I am still a sovereignist, but I care about public 
health.
<P>
	Again, we do not oppose the agency, particularly since such a 
change was made in Quebec in 1978. I know what I am talking 
about because at the time I was the press secretary of Quebec's 
agriculture minister, Jean Garon. I can name him, since he does not 
sit in this House. Jean Garon set out specifically to eliminate 
duplication.
<P>
	Before the holiday season, I rose in this House, not to lambast 
the government, but to express a regret that the proposed change 
had not yet taken place. As I said, such a cleanup was done almost 
20 years ago, by merging responsibilities in the food inspection 
sector.
<P>
	This is basically what I had to say to support the amendments 
proposed by the hon. member for Frontenac who, like the hon. 
member for Lotbinière, also a member of the Standing Committee 
on Agriculture and Agri-Food, made an extraordinary and 
sustained effort. These two members often raise this issue within 
our caucus and with members from other parties, to make people 
more aware of the agriculture and agri-food sector, because it is 
sometimes forgotten. A large number of us live in urban centres. 
However, the agri-food industry is very important for all of us, 
since it has to do with our food, with good food and good health.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you and I wish you a long and healthy life.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to speak to Bill C-60. The federal Liberal government is giving the 
minister the power to appoint the president, the vice-president and 
the 12 members of the advisory board. In addition, the president 
has the right to review the direction and policies of the agency.
<P>
	If the minister is allowed to appoint the agency's president, its 
vice-president and the 12 members of its advisory board, he can 
also control the agency as well, by influencing its overall policies. 
None of this is very reassuring when it comes to the transparency of 
our federal government.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois's amendment quite rightly suggests leaving 
it up to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, a 
committee of this House, to appoint the 12 members of this 
advisory board and to see that the agency is run properly.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	This will ensure impartiality and transparency, since this 
committee, like the others, is made up of members of the various 
parties.
<P>
	In addition, our partners would be invited to recommend 
appointees, our partners being the provinces, or representatives 
from the agricultural sector, in short people for whom agriculture is 
paramount and who have a stake in the sector.
<P>
	While we are on the topic, why do we not think the advisory 
board would be representative of the weight of each province? 
Democracy means one person, one vote. But in the Canadian 
confederation, one province does not necessarily mean one vote. 
Not all provinces carry the same weight. Since the province of 
Quebec represents 25 per cent of the population of Canada, ought it 
not to have three representatives out of the twelve on the advisory 
committee? It would be common sense for there to be 
proportionality, and therefore greater fairness. Let us not forget that 
Quebecers who make up this 25 per cent pay 25 per cent, or some 
$30 billion, to the federal government.
<P>
	For as long as we are part of Canada, I will defend the interests 
of my fellow citizens of Quebec. We will come here to seek what is 
due to us, to demand what is ours. In short, then, Quebec is fully 
justified in calling for three representatives on this advisory 
committee and in demanding to be consulted on the other 
appointments. In business terms, some would say Quebec is a 
major shareholder, with at least one-quarter of the shares.
<P>
	I would like to draw your attention to another aspect of Bill 
C-60: allowing the minister to approve the business plan. Again, 
why would this not be submitted to the members of the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food? This would lend more 
vitality to that committee, which plays a lead role in drawing up 
government policies. I say this without a great deal of enthusiasm, 
since we all know that what Liberals want is to pull a fast one on us. 
The Liberal government is in a hurry to get its bills passed, so that 
it can then do favours for its friends.
<P>
	What we want to see, obviously, is for the positions of president 
and vice-president, and the others jobs in the agency, to go to those 
who are best suited for them. Provinces and organizations 
representing the interests of the farming community should submit 
candidates for these positions to the committee, and be consulted 
de facto.
<P>
	Unfortunately, in this area, as with the Constitution, the 
approach is unilateral. That is the lesson to be drawn from this. I 
trust that historians, when dealing with the reign of this current 
Liberal government, will speak out on this.
<P>
	We are fed up seeing the federal government use its 
constitutional prerogative, royal prerogative even, to make 
appointments. This is not always a good thing. One needs only to 
look at the unsavoury situation resulting from the appointment of 
Jean-Louis Roux as Lieutenant-Governor of Quebec. Now we 
know the disastrous results of that decision, and I shall say no more  
on the matter. I am not using examples from the time of Sir John A. 
Macdonald or Sir Wilfrid Laurier, but from the current term of the 
Liberals. Wait and see the critical analysis of the Liberal years 
historians will be making a few years from now. It will be a real 
hoot to read them on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7560"> 7560 </A></B>
<P>
screen, for nothing will be on paper any more by that time. We are 
entering the era of the information highway, McLuhan's global 
village.
<P>
	Still in the same vein, the purpose of our amendments is to give 
more power to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. We want the committee to advise the minister on all 
matters relating to the mission of the Canadian food inspection 
agency. We also want the advisory board to respond to all questions 
submitted by the standing committee of this House.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	We think it is very important that not only the minister but also 
the committee be able to examine the agency's action plan. If two 
heads are better than one, why rely on what one minister has to say? 
This is no reflection on the minister, and I am sure he understands 
that.
<P>
	To achieve maximum transparency in what the agency does, it is 
imperative to involve the Standing Committee on Agriculture and 
Agri-Food. Why is the government afraid to give this committee a 
say in the agency's appointments, its business plan and what it 
does? If we want transparency, if we want everything to be crystal 
clear, we must be prepared to do what is necessary to achieve this. 
It is all very well to preach, but we must also practice what we 
preach.
<P>
	Consider also that putting the agency's plan before the members 
of this House may make the public more aware of the meaning of 
democracy. It is often said that people are losing interest in public 
affairs, and the result is a lack of involvement. Did you ever 
wonder why? Could it be because we fail to tell our fellow citizens 
what we are doing? Because we keep them out of the 
decision-making process? Because we want to go too fast and 
consulting them or delegating authority would slow down the 
process? Sometimes when a decision has to be made by a group, 
everyone in the group tends to look after his own interests.
<P>
	Briefly, in addition to its insistence on transparency, the 
amendment we are seeking is quite straightforward and logical: the 
corporate business plan is to be submitted to the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food and not only to the 
minister. Second, the business plan should come before the House 
of Commons so that the people's elected representatives can give 
their final approval.
<P>
	Regarding Motion No. 25, the Bloc's amendment suggests that, 
before submitting its plan to the minister, to the agriculture and 
agri-food committee and to this House, the agency should consult 
its partners, that is to say the farming industry, the provinces and 
the appropriate unions. This will give a better product, or business 
plan.
<P>
	I do not have to remind you that, this way, we will ensure that the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency's corporate business plan will 
have a much better chance of striking a consensus. Without these 
consultations, the public and those who use these services are 
likely not to be well served.
<P>
	After all, we are here to serve the public and, furthermore, the 
agency will reassure Quebecers and Canadians about compliance 
with food safety regulations and, to a point, about their health.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, pursuant to the order made on 
Thursday, December 12, 1996, motions in Group No. 8 are deemed 
to have been put to the House and the recorded divisions deemed to 
have been requested and deferred.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The House will now proceed to debate on Group No. 9.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, you are 
absolutely right. We are now debating the motions in Group No. 9, 
which were proposed by the opposition and which seek, as I 
pointed out earlier, to improve Bill C-60, an act to establish the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	The clerks at the table in front of you have included four motions 
in Group No. 9, namely motions Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 30, which 
impact on clauses 24, 26 and 27.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	For the benefit of government members, I will discuss each of 
these motions. I will try to show their merits and also ask members 
opposite to support these motions which, again, seek to improve 
Bill C-60.
<P>
	Motion No. 27 deals with clause 24, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>24. (1) Subject to the regulations, the Minister may fix the fees to be paid for a 
service or the use of a facility provided by the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The goal here is cost recovery.
<P>
	In committee, government members and senior officials told us 
that it was not their intention to recover every penny spent on the 
inspection or monitoring of premises, such as a bakery, a fish 
processing plant or any other similar business.
<P>
	No details are given in this clause, to which we in the Bloc 
Quebecois are proposing to add, in lines 5 to 8:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>24.(1) Subject to the regulations, the Minister may, on January 1, 2000, fix the 
fees to be paid for a service or the use of a facility provided by the Agency.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7561"> 7561 </A></B>
<P>
	If we are to take seriously what we were told, to the effect that 
they were not after cost recovery immediately, why not spell it 
out? Our amendment stipulates that the Minister of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food may not institute new cost recovery mechanisms 
before the year 2000. That is what they want, but they do not want 
to put it in writing.
<P>
	We are proposing that it be included in Bill C-60. If you are 
serious, if you mean what you say, do not be afraid to include it in 
the bill. This is what we are proposing. We will support you.
<P>
	The senior officials responsible for establishing the agency told 
us, when they appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, that it was not their intention to collect 
fees before the year 2000.
<P>
	I understand that, on the eve of an election, the agriculture 
minister would not have public servants go after individual or 
corporate users for every last cent of the cost of inspecting their 
facilities and their procedures. But after the election, given the 
finance minister's obsession with eliminating the deficit, this same 
minister who is making cuts right and left, who is sparing no one in 
his quest for money, will surely look for some little way to recover 
user fees. We are therefore asking that clause 24 state that no 
recovery may be attempted before January 1, 2000. This is what we 
were clearly told in committee.
<P>
	The second motion, Motion No. 28, involves clause 26. We are 
proposing that, before fixing a fee under section 24 or 25, the 
minister consult with the advisory board.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	As I have just said, the advisory committee is appointed by the 
President, and the President is appointed by the Governor in 
Council. So, we have the following chain reaction: a Liberal 
President is appointed; the Liberal President appoints a Liberal 
Vice-President; the President and Vice-President, both Liberals, 
create an advisory committee which will, I can well imagine, be 
composed of 12 Liberals.
<P>
	Something similar has, moreover, already happened in my riding 
just recently, when the new returning officer was appointed, a 
member of the federal Liberal Party, a director of the Quebec 
Liberal Party, as well as a key organizer of the last Quebec 
referendum on the future of Quebec. Of course, he got his reward 
for this. He was André Pomerleau, whom I had the pleasure of 
meeting last week, when he recommended I start looking for 
enumerators, since the national enumeration ought to start in 
mid-April. A good Liberal, as you see.
<P>
	Also appointed was the daughter of Dr. Lecours, the head of the 
unemployment insurance board of referees. Dr. Lecours sat for 
three years in the Quebec National Assembly, on Premier 
Bourassa's Liberal team of course.
<P>
	I could list dozens and dozens of other appointments, like the 
one involving the former Liberal member for Lotbinière, Jean-Guy 
Dubois, who sat in this House from 1980 to 1984, and then Brian 
and his team came along in 1984, and the Liberals took a serious 
drubbing. You will remember, Mr. Speaker, how your majority in 
your riding of Kingston and the Islands melted like the snows in 
springtime.
<P>
	After four years, Jean-Guy Dubois was dumped by the voters, 
but he was appointed to the Superior Court. It is also a nice reward 
for him. The only inconvenience, as he told reporters, is that he will 
have to leave Victoriaville et reside in the fine city of Longueuil. 
Moving to that city is what he finds the most difficult, and this is 
not much of a compliment for the population of Longueuil.
<P>
	I now come back to Motion No. 28 amending section 26.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>26.(1) Before fixing a fee under section 24 or 25, the Minister shall consult with 
the advisory board and may consult with any persons or organizations that the 
Minister considers to be interested in the matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is what we propose to add to this clause.
<P>
	We suggest that the president and the minister be empowered to 
consult with other persons before fixing the costs to be recovered 
from the user-payer. They should, for instance, consult with 
industry, fishers and farmers, but also with consumers since at the 
end of the user-payer chain, consumers are always the ones who 
have to pay the extra cent for what the federal government is 
getting.
<P>
	This is precisely what happened when the federal government 
announced, in the 1996-97 budget, that it would cut the subsidy to 
producers of industrial milk. It was then said: ``If you cut it today 
you will have to pay 10 cents more per pound of butter, 30 cents 
more per pound of cheese''. It has already begun.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to talk about Motions 
No. 29 and 30, but one of my colleagues will probably do so.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the amendments we are suggesting in this group are along 
the same lines as those in the previous group.
<P>
	As you may recall, the food inspection agency will replace three 
government services with somewhat overlapping responsibilities. 
There is a concern on the part of the government to clarify these 
roles.
<P>
	However, much remains to be improved in this bill. I hope the 
government will listen to our suggestions on how to make this 
legislation the best of its kind. The purpose of the group of 
amendments now before the House is, first of all, to ensure these 
changes are not sprung without warning on the agri-food industry 
and thus ensure there will be no cost recovery before the year 2000, 
so that companies have time to adjust, to consider the
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7562"> 7562 </A></B>
<P>
changes that will be made and make their operating costs reflect the 
fees to be introduced by the food inspection agency.
<P>
	I think it would be very wise on the part of the government to 
include such an amendment in the bill. Just look at what is 
happening in another sector where cost recovery has been 
introduced in a way I would call somewhat ruthless. I am referring 
to all the fees connected with navigation, especially on the St. 
Lawrence.
<P>
	In this sector, the government decided to recover the cost of 
de-icing, of navigation aids, buoy maintenance, and so forth. The 
government proposed certain measures which were directly 
opposed to what the industry wanted, by obliging the industry to 
absorb year after year additional costs which had not been included 
in their planning.
<P>
	In the food inspection sector, we have a wonderful opportunity to 
avoid this kind of mistake. Let us send a message to the agri-food 
industry, telling them that until the year 2000, there will be no 
recovery of additional costs. Tell them they will receive fair 
warning and there will be consultations. That is what we are 
proposing in the other amendments requested by the Bloc 
Quebecois in group 9, in other words, to ensure that consultations 
are held on service fees and on facilities, products and the rights of 
the agency, so that everyone who has something to say on the 
subject can do so. We must not end up with absurdities like we have 
in the case of ice breaking fees, where the industry says it is quite 
prepared to pay the cost, but perhaps things ought to be cleaned up 
a bit first.
<P>
	I think that the food inspection agency in its first year, just 
starting out, and having to integrate the three government 
authorities that existed before, would have a hard time increasing 
fees and asking people to pay more in its start up year, when things 
have to be amalgamated and operational decisions made.
<P>
	As there was a certain desire to privatize food inspection, we 
must make sure that market rules are obeyed and that when 
agri-food businesses are asked to pay they receive a quality 
product, guaranteed at the best price, without the fee structure 
being used to justify an inflated cost. Once the three government 
authorities involved in this sector are integrated, there should 
necessarily be economies of scale. Otherwise, the entire bill would 
be a waste of time and nothing would be settled.
<P>
	We must make sure that savings are made where there were three 
authorities in the same sector or in parallel sectors, with similar 
functions. Let us give the industry time to adjust. Let us send it a 
clear message.
<P>
	Let us tell it that, as of the year 2000, significant changes will be 
made and that there will be consultations  on the matter so that, on 
both sides of the table, industry, government and consumers are 
clear about the standard for services in food inspection, what their 
cost will be and who will pay for them. Industry may have some 
interesting suggestions.
<P>
	We might perhaps even contract out to the industry the 
inspection of certain products and then monitor afterwards, while, 
in other sectors, the monitoring should come first. There should be 
a daily production. It depends on the agri-food industry sectors.
<P>
	I think the government would come out ahead if it set itself a 
period for consultation to ensure that the fee structure reflected 
what people want.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	We must ensure that there is adequate consultation of another 
group, the provinces, because the establishment of the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency does not change the fact that both the 
provincial and the federal levels are involved here. We have 
already congratulated the federal government for having said that, 
from now on, at least there will be only one player instead of three, 
but there are still a lot of areas where both levels of government 
will be working in very close proximity, and it would be utterly 
ridiculous to end up with completely different fee schedules for 
similar tasks. It would be illogical, for example, for a province to 
charge $100 for one type of activity while the government charged 
$150 or $200 for the same type of activity; the industry would have 
difficulty understanding such a thing.
<P>
	Moreover, consultations could lead to one of the two levels of 
government dropping its activities in one area; for instance, there 
could be only one inspector acting on behalf of both governments, 
and, by completing the proper forms, a firm would not have to 
provide information simultaneously to both governments on 
different forms, as is now the case for the environment. We must 
make every effort to avoid this type of situation. The way to do so 
is to hold proper consultations with provinces. Once the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency is created, it will integrate the various 
government services in its first year of operation. It should 
therefore be given enough time to consult with provincial 
stakeholders to ensure the industry's interests are protected.
<P>
	The last amendment seeks to ensure that the proposed 
regulations will be studied by a parliamentary committee. In the 
area of food inspection, it is not enough to be right and to conduct 
the inspections properly; the process must also appear to be fair so 
that the general public can have confidence in the tools they are 
given. For the people's representatives, that is, the members of 
Parliament, parliamentary committees are a very good forum for 
this type of consultation.
<P>
	We believe that, when the government thinks about proposing 
regulations concerning tariffs, for example, these regulations 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7563"> 7563 </A></B>
<P>
should be submitted to a parliamentary committee so it can express 
its views as a public advocate. It would present its arguments for or 
against the proposed tariffs and consider the benefits of having 
different tariffs for different regions or different products. These 
are some of the issues that the people's representatives, or 
members of Parliament, can discuss. They can ask questions and 
cast a critical eye on the government's actions and on tariffs, so that 
consideration of the relevant views expressed will give greater 
legitimacy to the government policy on tariff regulations. This will 
prevent any subsequent criticism. It will also prevent legal battles 
because the fee structure will have been submitted to the public 
through the consultation process; therefore, when it takes effect, it 
will be impossible to accuse the government of having acted 
unilaterally.
<P>
	I ask the government to look at this group of amendments from 
the same viewpoint as the previous one, where we said we must 
ensure that food safety standards are adequately covered in the 
agency's corporate business plan, and that proper consultations are 
held with regard to this corporate business plan, to ensure its 
credibility throughout Quebec and Canada. Moreover, in the 
context of that corporate business plan, the present group of 
amendments is more precise on the subject of fees because it deals 
with the issue of whether the corporate business plan will ensure 
that no one will pull a fast one on the processors, that people will 
not be surprised by a fee structure causing such cost increases that 
businesses could question their own future.
<P>
	Let us say for example that we propose an inadequate fee 
structure for regional slaughterhouses which would make these 
businesses non competitive; will we have helped the agri-food 
industry with such a measure? I think not. The way to prevent such 
a situation is to submit the fee structure to public scrutiny.
<P>
	Let us hope the government will support our amendments on this 
point.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise for the second time to speak to Bill C-60, an act to 
establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency. As agreed with my 
colleague from Frontenac, our critic in this area, I will deal with the 
amendments in Group No. 9.
<P>
	But first I would like to extend my best wishes to my colleague 
from Champlain, currently hospitalized in the Hôpital régional de 
la Mauricie, who is quite concerned by this kind of issues dealing 
with agriculture. Farming is the mainstay of a good part of his 
riding, especially the whole area north of Cap-de-la-Madeleine, 
and I know that he too would have liked to speak to the bill again 
today.
<P>
	I particularly want to send him my greetings as he is to undergo, 
maybe today, a major operation for which he is well prepared. He is 
very confident and we are looking forward to welcoming him back 
here.
<P>
	I also want to mention my colleague from Frontenac, the Bloc's 
agriculture critic, who has done a tremendous job on this issue, 
working long hours and making numerous amendments to try to 
improve this bill we do not support.
<P>
	We disagree on a fundamental point, namely the food inspection 
issue, and I would like to digress a moment to show how important 
this issue is, even though it is not a spectacular one. It concerns the 
health and safety of every Canadian, every Quebecer, on a daily 
basis.
<P>
	When we talk about food, we are talking about everybody's daily 
life. We should probably pay more attention to this bill than we 
have so far, because it will have an impact on all of us in our 
everyday life. This is a public health issue. When we are talking 
about food, we are talking about public health and the ability to 
achieve one's full potential. Unfortunately, right now, a food 
inspection agency is still the privilege of so-called developed 
countries.
<P>
	That is why any change we make should be made after 
thoughtful consideration, because they will reflect on our so-called 
developed society. We must remember that three persons out of 
four in the world, perhaps even four out of five, do not have 
well-paid public servants to inspect or otherwise monitor what they 
eat everyday. It is hard enough for them to get any kind of food, 
even something not subject to the controls provided for in this bill.
<P>
	Yet, we still disagree with this bill, because we consider that it is 
not the business of the federal government. According to the 
Canadian Constitution, this area comes under provincial 
jurisdiction, especially in Quebec, where food inspection was 
reorganized in 1978, in much the same way as proposed in this bill.
<P>
	Indeed, when we talk about this food inspection agency, we are 
talking about a merger of services which already exist within the 
Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food and the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. They will 
now come under a single agency and be the responsibility of a 
single minister and department, namely Agriculture and 
Agri-Food.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I remind you that this has already been done in Quebec: there 
was a consolidation so that there would be no duplication, to 
prevent a restaurant from having, within two or three days or 
during the same week, one, two or three inspectors come in, disrupt 
things and invade the place by demanding, with all the paperwork 
and energy this implies, that such and such document be filled out, 
always for the sake of the public interest. Except that, while the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7564"> 7564 </A></B>
<P>
restaurant owner or other manager is doing this, he is not doing 
something else, and this may jeopardize service.
<P>
	This is a jurisdiction that already belongs to the provinces, and 
which Quebec, in particular, has assumed very well, and we cannot 
see why the Government of Canada would get involved, when the 
public interest is already well protected by the Constitution.
<P>
	It is all the more annoying to see how the minister is going about 
managing this agency. Like the Liberals and their proverbial 
solidarity-we know how the Liberals can help each other in all the 
provinces of Canada-the bill provides that the president, the 
vice-president and all the members of the advisory board working 
within the agency will be appointed by the minister, without any 
mention of an adequate representation for Quebec, that is, 25 per 
cent of the membership-and this could have been written into the 
bill-or the representation of some groups, such as the UPA, that 
are greatly involved in agriculture or food on a day-to-day basis.
<P>
	The minister has taken upon himself to make discretionary 
appointments, using criteria that may be his own. We know how the 
Liberals think, how their feelings are deep when they want. The 
Liberals have credentials in that respect; just think of the outdated 
mechanism by which returning officers are appointed in Canada. 
These days, and you know it as well as we do, the basic 
requirement is past or present membership in the Liberal Party of 
Canada or service as association president or vice-president, and 
we will not name names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Is that still going on?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rocheleau:</B> Yes, it is. You know that this kind of criterion 
no longer exists in Quebec. Competitions are held and there are 
several selection stages; as a result, out of x number of candidates, 
one is selected on the basis of the applicable criteria and this is as 
neutral a process as can be, while in Canada, the selection method 
used is a toss between antiquated and imperialistic. To know that 
the Liberal Party is present in every backroom of the Canadian 
government is to understand why, today still, positions as 
influential in our democratic system as that of returning officer are 
being filled by individuals whose main qualification is the fact that 
they belong or used to belong to the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	This in itself is reason enough to voice any concern we may have 
about the establishment of an agency with an advisory committee 
whose president and vice-president are appointed directly by the 
minister.
<P>
	It is also baffling to realize that the entity created by merging 
these three departments responsible for food inspection will 
operate on a $300 million budget, according to our information. 
This represents a $44 million reduction, probably to please the 
Minister of Finance, whose objectives you know as well as I do.
<P>
	So we end up with $44 million less and 600 fewer inspectors 
who used to work in the fisheries, agriculture and health 
departments. If I remember correctly, there used to be 3,400 
inspectors, 600 of whom will be eliminated. How can we be 
expected not to worry about the quality and quantity of services 
that will be offered in the public interest, in an area essential to the 
very functioning of any society, especially against our claims of 
being a civilized and developed society, when faced with cuts of 
600 jobs and $44 million, affecting, as I said earlier, all Canadians 
and Quebecers in their daily lives?
<P>
	I hope this kind of comment will be heard so that the public 
interest can take precedence over any other interest in this matter.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very clear 
from the comments of the last speaker that he shares the same 
concerns as our ministry, the safe food supply for Canadians. There 
is no question that issue will never be compromised by this 
government or any other group of people who represent people in 
this country. I would certainly say that we have shown a record in 
the past and we continue to show a record that the safety of 
Canadians is number one.
<P>
	However, only in government would someone suggest that the 
people responsible for a whole operation, the people responsible 
for the operation of government, are not the people who should be 
setting fees, looking at the costs and looking at the expenses. But 
that they would take the setting of fees, they would take the 
operations and push them off to somebody else on a side group. I 
find that suggestion quite disconcerting.
<P>
	There is no question that the minister must retain the 
responsibility of setting fees to any operations in government, not 
just this agency, but all other operations of government because 
circumstances change, times change and with those changes there 
need to be adjustments. Who better than one who consults with 
industry, the provincial parliaments across this country, with every 
part of the country to make certain they are up to date with all 
actions? Who better than the minister to set the fees and set a 
proper structure in place?
<P>
	I certainly question the thought raised here that the minister 
should give up the whole operation of setting fees and making sure 
that our operations are efficient. At the same time I must point out 
very clearly that there were concerns raised about how quickly fees 
would be changed and therefore the minister made a very clear 
commitment that once the agency is up in operation, in order to 
study and analyze what is happening, internally with our fee 
structure, the kinds of consultations that are required, he would not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7565"> 7565 </A></B>
<P>
alter or change those fees until  the year 2000, which is a pretty 
strong commitment by the minister.
<P>
	The minister therefore has said once we have the agency up and 
operating we will look very carefully at how the system operates 
and we will take a long time to consult with people, making certain 
that the abuse of industry, other governments in the provinces and 
others who are affected across this country, namely the consumers, 
all have their voices heard and brought forward to the ministry.
<P>
	It is consistent with our policies in health, in industry and in 
heritage. We have similar processes in place. As a result, the 
processes that we are talking about here are consistent with the 
other government agencies and therefore I believe it makes our 
whole operation in government much easier to understand.
<P>
	The amendment to the bill suggests consultation is an important 
part of fee structuring. It suggests in that change that every group 
affected be consulted before any changes occur. Imagine the legal 
ramification if someone comes forward and says ``I am a consumer 
and I was not consulted, therefore any change to that fee structure 
is illegitimate''. It certainly does not make sense to say that every 
person who possibly could have a concern must be consulted.
<P>
	At the same time, consultation is extremely important and we 
have various vehicles by which we do that consultation on a daily, 
monthly, weekly basis all weeks of the year.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	There is no question we try to make certain the industry is kept 
aware by newsletters we send out, by professional publications and 
by gazetting information. We make certain we have face to face 
meetings with the people who are affected. Certainly if we make 
changes within any industry, we have consultations with them. We 
take their concerns into account. We definitely make certain that 
the consumer organizations are involved in these processes. There 
is no question the government takes very elaborate steps to make 
sure the consultation process is always ongoing and that the 
concerns of industry, governments and consumers are always 
filled.
<P>
	I must say that this consultation has proven to be very good for 
the government. As I stated before, with this legislation coming 
forward we know we have all provincial governments onside, we 
have the industry itself onside. We have allowed it to come and 
consult. We also had open hearings at the House of Commons 
agriculture committee in which all kinds of concerns came 
forward. The government acted upon those concerns and tried to 
make certain that those concerns raised were dealt with properly in 
this legislation.
<P>
	There is no question we look at this in a very serious way. We 
want to make certain that everyone in this country who is affected 
is treated properly with open information and that we act upon their 
concerns. There is no question the minister places a priority in 
making certain that the health of this industry is maintained. 
Through his consultations he takes into account their concerns and 
acts upon them in a very quick and important way.
<P>
	When we deal with issues that affect public safety though, we 
must make certain that all cautions are there to make certain we 
still maintain as a world reputation food safety and we make certain 
that the supply of food is there. From our track record over the 
years, we have and are looked upon as the best food production 
country in the world. That is why we can ship products anywhere in 
the world. Certainly they are well respected and well received 
everywhere they go. There has never been a question nor will there 
be a question because we put a top priority on inspection and 
safety.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is always 
interesting to listen to the comments of the parliamentary secretary 
on how this government is so accountable to the people it serves.
<P>
	We are talking here about the right to be consulted when the 
government wants to increase fees regarding the agency that is 
being set up. The parliamentary secretary went on at great length 
about how everybody cannot be consulted. I read the motion and it 
did not say he had to consult with everybody but only with the 
advisory board and he may consult with other interested parties. 
That gives a great deal of latitude which the parliamentary 
secretary just rejected out of hand by saying why should he bother.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> They only consult 
with the Liberal membership.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> That is right. I was interested in one of the quotes 
he made. Let me quote the parliamentary secretary who was talking 
about the consumers who would say: ``I am a consumer and I was 
not consulted on this issue''. That was the rationale he gave for not 
allowing this motion. He would be required to consult with 
everybody. He said that rather than being required to consult with 
everybody, why not consult with nobody? He said that if people 
thought they had not been consulted as consumers, they would be 
outraged, and rightly so.
<P>
	Let us replace the word consumer with the word taxpayer. 
Taxpayers are not being consulted by this government and they are 
outraged. During the last election they were told that the GST 
would be axed, scrapped and abolished and they now find that this 
harmonized HST is being imposed upon them. The taxpayers were 
not consulted by this government. Their opinions were absolutely 
ignored. They were trashed.
<P>
	The government said: ``Your opinion does not count. We decided 
that you did not understand what axe, scrap and abolish meant. 
Therefore you are going to have an  HST or a BST rather than a 
GST. This still means you are going to pay 7 per cent plus 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7566"> 7566 </A></B>
<P>
provincial tax, plus more tax through harmonization''. The 
taxpayers were not consulted.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	Now the parliamentary secretary says: ``I do not want to consult 
the consumers who are going to be affected by this organization 
because they may have an opinion that is different than the 
government's. That is why I do not want to listen to them. That is 
why I do not want to hear from them''. Do we call that being 
accountable? Do we call that integrity in government? Do we call 
that being responsible to the taxpayers? I do not think so.
<P>
	That is why this type of arrogance demonstrated by the 
government in Bill C-60 has got to stop. That is why ramming 
other legislation through this House by using time allocation has 
got to stop. That is why this government has got to start listening to 
the people who say: ``What about me? What about me and my 
family? Do I not deserve to be heard?'' They deserve to be heard. 
They deserve to be heard every time this government introduces 
legislation or makes a major initiative.
<P>
	When the parliamentary secretary says: ``I am not that excited or 
interested in talking to the consumers. I do not need to consult 
them'', the arrogance contained in that type of statement speaks 
volumes. That is why I hope this government will listen to the 
objections being raised on this side of the House so it can realize 
that there are valid and necessary changes to this piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	The situation is that as soon as a bill is introduced in this House, 
the government whip says: ``What is on the table is what you vote 
for. We are not interested in hearing what goes on in this House. We 
are not interested in hearing what MPs on the other side of the 
House bring back from their constituents who say there are some 
valid and responsible changes that can be made to this legislation''.
<P>
	These are the types of things this House is supposed to debate. 
We find that this process is a sham in that the bill as tabled is the 
bill as proclaimed because this government will not tolerate a 
contrary opinion expressed in this House even though that contrary 
opinion is a valid opinion that has come from the people on the 
streets, the taxpayers of this country who are being squeezed to 
death every day, more and more to pay for this type of legislation 
that we know is smoke and mirrors. It is not designed to improve 
efficiency. It is not designed to downsize government. It is not 
designed to ensure that service is improved. It is just the idea that 
the government can say it is doing something when in reality when 
we look behind the scenes it is doing nothing.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Pursuant to order made on 
Thursday, December 12, 1996, all questions on the motions in 
Group No. 9 are deemed to have been put and the recorded 
divisions deemed demanded and deferred.
<P>
	The House will now proceed with the debate on Group No. 10. In 
accordance with the motion adopted as aforesaid on December 12, 
1996, all the questions are deemed to have been moved, seconded 
and put to the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
now debating motions in Group No. 10, which seek to improve Bill 
C-60.
<P>
	I see that members opposite are smiling, but they should listen 
instead, they should read our motions and take a close look at them, 
because these motions are aimed at ensuring the well-being of 
consumers, who are the ones at the end of the food chain. 
Consumers are the ones who are paying and who will continue to 
foot the bill.
<P>
	The clerks at the table in front of you have included three 
motions in Group No. 10, namely Motions Nos. 31, 32 and 33. In 
the nine minutes that I have left, I will try, for the benefit of all 
elected members of this Parliament, to explain each of these 
motions originating from the official opposition, the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	We seek to amend clause 31 by replacing line 29 on page 9. The 
minister may remit all or part of any fee fixed under section 24 or 
25 or under any act that the agency enforces or administers by 
virtue of subsection 11(1), and the interest on it.
<P>
	Incidentally, we would also like to see in this clause a provision 
requiring the president of the food inspection agency to submit a 
report to the Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food, 
within a period of one year. I can hear government members sitting 
on the committee say: ``He is raising this issue once again''. I am 
raising this issue once again because, among the elected members 
of this Parliament, those who sit on the Standing Committee on 
Agriculture and Agri-Food are the ones who have the best 
knowledge of this issue, given that most of them used to farm in 
just about every sector and region in the country. Some used to 
grow grain, others were in the poultry or the beef industry, while 
others still, such as the very knowledgeable member for Malpeque, 
were active in the dairy industry.
<P>
	Given its membership, our committee has the required expertise, 
knowledge and know-how. This is why we would like to see Bill 
C-60 state clearly that the president must submit his annual report 
after 12 months at the latest, because under Bill C-60 as written, the 
he could wait 4 or 5 years before doing so. No precise date or year  
is given. We pointed this shortcoming out to the senior officials 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7567"> 7567 </A></B>
<P>
who appeared before the standing committee, but no deadline was 
deemed necessary. Adding one would definitely improve the bill.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	We move on to Motion No. 32, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-60, in Clause 32, be amended by replacing lines 40 to 42 on page 9 
with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(c) provide a report to the President, the Minister and such committee of the 
House of Commons as is designated or established to consider agricultural matters 
on the audit, opinion and assessment.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Thus, it is clearly mentioned to whom the president must submit 
his annual report.
<P>
	Motion No. 33 also refers to clause 32. We are proposing to 
improve subsection 32(1) as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``32.1 Before providing the report under paragraph 32(c), the Auditor General of 
Canada shall consult (a) any person from the agriculture, fisheries, food processing, 
food distribution and public health sectors whom the Minister considers appropriate 
to consult; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is not clear in the bill, as it says: ``any government of a 
province that has advised the Auditor General of Canada, in 
writing, of its wish to be consulted''.
<P>
	Bill C-60 is a major bill, and it will have a decisive impact on all 
Canadian consumers. The purpose of our amendments seek to set 
deadlines for submitting the documents outlining the agency's 
management and administration. It must be remembered that, 
knowing the finance minister, he will require the agency to recover 
its operating costs. You can see where this all leads: what might 
cost 1 cent to begin with will end up costing 10 cents, and the 
consumers will have to pay.
<P>
	I see here some of my colleagues who seem to be smiling when 
they hear me say that there will be an increase of 10 cents a pound. 
I am well aware that, for some of us, the weekly food basket does 
not make a big dent in the family budget, but for most of our fellow 
citizens, putting food on the table eats up a very large portion of the 
weekly pay cheque of one or both bread winners.
<P>
	These amendments also seek to revitalize the role of the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food by giving it 
priority with regard to assessment and consideration of the 
agency's accounting documents, and most of all the role of the 
auditor general.
<P>
	Therefore, we want to require the auditor general to consult the 
groups directly involved with the agency in order to ensure that 
senior management or the agriculture minister are not trying to 
hide disturbing facts.
<P>
	You will find me tiresome about this, I know, but I must insist. I 
come back to the make-up of the Food Inspection Agency.
<P>
	The president will be a Liberal; the vice-president, another 
Liberal; on the advisory board, the 12 members will be Liberals 
and, moreover, hiring rules are being suspended for two years. So 
you can imagine who will fill the management positions. In the ten 
provinces and the two territories, the management positions will be 
filled-and I see you do not seem to be surprised by this 
statement-by more Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I would remind the House that, last week, three judges were 
appointed to the Quebec Superior Court. One of them comes from 
the beautiful area of Victoriaville, in the wonderful riding of 
Lotbinière. I see that my hon. colleague from Lotbinière is smiling; 
he will be losing one of his constituents, with little regret if any. 
The appointee made some commendable efforts during the last 
referendum, but met with little success, since he was well known to 
the voters. Jean-Guy Dubois is being raised to the bench in 
recognition of his long-standing service.
<P>
	I know full well, Mr. Speaker, that being on the bench is not one 
of your wishes, but I think you would make a good judge with that 
smile of yours; and you have the right political stripes.
<P>
	Finally, I want to say that one can never be too careful when 
putting forward amendments, since patronage could become 
rampant within the agency, which would not, of course, be in the 
best interests of the consumers of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak on this first day back from 
the Christmas break to the very important issue of food inspection, 
specifically Bill C-60 and the amendments that are before the 
House.
<P>
	We are debating group No. 10 which is comprised of motions 
Nos. 31, 32 and 33. I have heard it said that no issue is more 
important for the government and the Canadian Parliament to deal 
with than the issue of food and food inspection. Along with such 
things as the air we breathe, the water we drink and shelter in our 
harsh northern climate, food is one of the staples which maintains 
life. It is an important subject.
<P>
	I would like to say at the outset that the Reform Party, in dealing 
with these three motions, supports motion No. 31. It would add 
more accountability. As everyone knows, Reform Party members 
in the 35th Parliament have stressed accountability of government 
in its operations on an ongoing basis. Therefore, anything that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7568"> 7568 </A></B>
<P>
could be written into the legislation that would bring about a  
greater degree of accountability is certainly supported by members 
on this side of the House.
<P>
	During an intervention on this bill by one of my colleague's 
some government members from the far end of the House, from the 
so-called rump section of Parliament, said: ``What about us? Do 
not forget about us down at this end''. He was referring to the fact 
that the government consistently does not listen to people on this 
side of the House. I would add that those in the rump section are not 
listened to as well. They are possibly even more annoyed than we 
are. It shows us the value of being a Liberal backbencher, 
especially those who are sitting in the rump section of the 35th 
Parliament. They are never listened to. It must be incredibly 
frustrating.
<P>
	We support the intent of motion No. 32 as well. However, we 
oppose motion No. 33. We are not opposed to the intent of the 
motion, however, it deals specifically with outlining how the 
auditor general should do his job. We feel that should be left to the 
auditor general. We have supported everything which that office 
has done in the past and we will continue to support the 
involvement of the auditor general in all aspects of holding 
governments accountable. We support the intent of the motion, 
however, we feel that motion No. 33 goes a bit far in instructing the 
auditor general in the way he should do his job. We think he is 
doing a terrific job already and does not need that type of 
interference or direction.
<P>
	Reform members oppose the bill. The intent is quite admirable. 
The government wishes to consolidate and enhance the efficiency 
and effectiveness of federal inspection services related to food, 
animal and plant health, and to increase the collaboration with 
provincial governments in this area. It is certainly an admirable 
goal. It is one which all Canadians would support. However, we do 
not see the details of that in the bill.
<P>
	My concern is that, once again, the government, as it has time 
after time in the past, is passing umbrella type legislation and will 
bring in the details and the regulations later. We are supposed to 
take the government at its word and trust that it will accomplish 
those stated objectives and goals. We have very deep and grave 
concerns about that because all too often in the past that has not 
happened. The government has a grandiose plan of how it is going 
to accomplish certain things. It brings in umbrella legislation, 
passes it, and then we are stuck with regulations that do not work, 
which are simply shuffled through by order in council. That is why 
we are in opposition to the bill.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	No provision for a detailed breakdown of the cost savings has 
been provided by the government. We do not see how a decision 
can be made about such an all-encompassing bill without that type 
of detail being brought forward.
<P>
	We heard statements by the parliamentary secretary earlier when 
he was speaking about group 9 amendments that the government 
will make a commitment to take a long time-he emphasized the 
word long-to consult with all the stakeholders and that the bill is 
consistent with Liberal policies. I suggest that is because the policy 
of the government is the status quo. It is taking a long time to bring 
in legislation which Canadians have been demanding and insisting 
upon. That is certainly a concern.
<P>
	While the government seems to move at a snail's pace in some 
areas, in others when it finally makes a decision it shuts down 
debate, as was indicated by my colleague earlier. It brings in time 
allocation or closure and shuts down the democratic process in this 
place once it decides the direction it wants to go.
<P>
	Since this is our first opportunity to speak since returning to this 
place after the Christmas break, it is very interesting that the 
minister for defence invoked closure on the Somali inquiry. He 
shut down any further debate.
<P>
	I made a comment in a newspaper column which I write back in 
my riding of Prince George-Peace River that I think the hon. 
minister confused the operations in the House of Commons with 
the operations outside of the House of Commons. The government 
has become accustomed to bringing in time allocation and shutting 
down debate in this place. Now it wants to elevate that one step 
further and do it across the country. I find that despicable and I 
believe most Canadians are concerned about that type of operation.
<P>
	As I have said on this group of amendments, we support the first 
two amendments and oppose the third. That is the official position 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Since it is just about two o'clock we will proceed 
to statements by members.

	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Laval West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
take this opportunity to offer my condolences to the family of 
Father Guy Pinard, who was tragically killed Saturday while 
celebrating mass in his parish of Kampanga, in Rwanda.
<P>
	This news has caused great sadness in the whole country and 
particularly in Quebec where Father Pinard was well known. We 
have lost a man of exceptional courage and dedication.
<P>
	His assassination is even more tragic considering that it 
happened in the country to which Father Pinard had dedicated a big 
part of his life. He was so attached to that  country and to its people 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7569"> 7569 </A></B>
<P>
that he had gone back there last year in spite of dangers he was 
fully aware of.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	We deplore this barbaric act which has aroused indignation 
everywhere. The people of Rwanda, who knew how good a man 
Father Pinard was, share our feelings.
<P>
	I ask everybody to pay tribute to this missionary, for whom a 
commemorative service will be held next Wednesday at the White 
Fathers' chapel, in Montreal.

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I would like to express our profound 
sadness on learning of the assassination yesterday morning in 
Rwanda of Father Guy Pinard, a Quebec missionary from 
Trois-Rivières, who had worked in that country for 37 years. Father 
Pinard was parish priest in Kampanga parish.
<P>
	He was the third Quebecer belonging to a religious order to be 
killed in Rwanda. Father Claude Simard was killed because he 
apparently knew too much about the 1994 genocide, and Brother 
François Cardinal was killed in 1992 after speaking out publicly 
against the diversion of Canadian aid to benefit the Rwandan 
government.
<P>
	This tragic event is a reminder to us of the devotion and, in 
particular, the courage of all those working abroad to help the 
poorest inhabitants of this planet.
<P>
	In my own name, and on behalf of my colleagues in the Bloc 
Quebecois, I would like to express our sincerest condolences to 
Father Pinard's next of kin.

	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, POWA, the program for older worker adjustment, 
provides monthly financial support for older workers unable to find 
work a year after a major permanent layoff.
<P>
	The mine in Port Hardy, B.C. closed in 1995. Seventy older 
workers in good faith and after years of hard work and faced with 
no job prospects in the North Island immediately made application 
for program assistance. They qualified as a group.
<P>
	In October 1996 it was announced that federal support would end 
for any new applicant. However, now it is unclear that the funding 
commitment to approved applicants from 1995 and early 1996 is in 
play.
<P>
	I want to put the government and the Minister of Human 
Resources Development on notice that retroactive cancellation of 
financial support is  unacceptable. These older miners qualify for 
and have a longstanding expectation to receive the benefits of the 
program. If the government offers a program it must fund it.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when Brian Mulroney negotiated the Canada-U.S. Free Trade 
Agreement he said ``don't worry, Canadian culture is exempt from 
free trade''. When the Liberal government signed on to NAFTA 
and the World Trade Organization, it said ``don't worry, Canadian 
culture is exempt from free trade''.
<P>
	The World Trade Organization has ruled that culture is not 
exempt from free trade, a conclusion not surprising to anyone who 
ever honestly analysed these agreements and the agenda they serve. 
But the Minister for International Trade, about this stunning defeat 
of decades of effective public policy, gives the usual Liberal 
answer: don't worry.
<P>
	This defeatist answer has led to much speculation about who is 
in charge of Canadian cultural policy, Canadians or American 
business interests. But when we look at the surrender on trade 
policy, at the decimation of the CBC, at the sale of the RCMP's 
image to Disney and the appearance of Disneyland on Canadian 
postage stamps, it is clear why we have such a Mickey Mouse 
cultural policy: Mickey Mouse is actually in charge.

athletes from over 80 countries who are taking part in the sixth 
Special Olympics World Winter Games.
<P>
	The World Winter Games is the largest multi-sport event that

honour of hosting the athletes and the games. These games are 
about the triumph of the human spirit. Everyone who competes in 
these games is a winner because winning is not just about medals, 
breaking records or beating your opponent. In these games winning 
is about having the chance to compete, feeling the joy of the sport

January 10 the Saugeen River flooded, affecting the people of 
Durham, Ontario in my riding of  Bruce-Grey. Thankfully no

courage during that flood. I want to pay special tribute to the 
volunteers and the relief workers who offered the victims both the 
good work of their hands and the comfort of their spirits. Durham 
Mayor Kris Kennedy is also to be commended for taking swift and 
decisive action to protect public safety. I also want to thank the 
soldiers from the Militia Training and Support Centre at Meaford

Roger Moore, otherwise known as 007, James Bond. Roger Moore 
is honorary chairman of the UNICEF/Kawanis campaign to combat 
health problems caused by a lack of iodine in one's diet.
<P>
	Iodine deficiency is for the most part a problem in developing 
countries. It is the source of cretinism, which impairs physical 
development, and can lead to serious mental disabilities. 
Approximately 655 million people suffer from goitre and 43 
million have preventable brain damage from an iodine deficient 
diet.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	Roger Moore praised Canada for the humanitarian work this 
country has demonstrated to date. Since 1991 CIDA has 
contributed $28 million in order combat iodine deficiency 
disorders, making this country one of the largest international 
donors for this very important cause.
<P>
	But governments cannot do it alone. That is why we all wish 
UNICEF/Kiwanis much success on meeting its objective of 
eliminating IDD by the year 2000.

older Canadian women are encouraged by their doctors to get a 
mammogram every second year because mammography screening 
is the best technique we have for the early detection of breast

of the voluntary program's existence only 37 per cent of these 
units have passed the standards.
<P>
	This is not good enough. We need national standards for quality 
assurance in mammography. Canadian women need to know that 
the mammography unit they visit is accredited or certified and 
meets the highest possible quality assurance standards. Canadian 
women deserve nothing less.

happy to see the government members too, because we have a lot of 
questions for them.
<P>
	This government's behaviour has been odd for the past three 
years. The matter of contaminated blood is one example. The 
Prime Minister says he wants the entire situation brought to light, 
but he refuses to initiate the process giving Mr. Justice Krever 
access to the documents that would allow him to get to the truth. In 
the matter of the GST, despite what the Prime Minister's cronies 
say about not keeping the promise, the Prime Minister keeps saying 
he has met his commitments. In the matter of Somalia, the Prime 
Minister, on the one hand, agrees to get at the truth and, on the 
other, denies the Somalia inquiry the time accorded it.

<P>
	My question is this: By cutting off testimony in the Somalia 
inquiry on March 31 and by denying Mr. Justice Létourneau the 
time he must have to complete his inquiry, is the Prime Minister 
not telling the army its days in the hot water it got itself into are 
almost over and telling the rest of Canada, Canadians, that they will 
never get to the bottom of the Somalia affair?

more time so that what must be done at national defence may be 
done as soon as possible.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister need not delight in the fact that he 
will be losing me as his opposite. I will counsel my successor well 
on how to get him to put his foot in it regularly.
<P>
	More seriously, we have learned that senior officers of Canada's 
military-and this is very serious-blackmailed the former 
minister of defence, who was in the race to become Prime Minister 
at the time.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	It is extremely serious when members of the command staff can 
put pressure of all sorts on the minister of defence in order to cover 
up certain information they do not want make public.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that, in the light of the 
seriousness of the events that have occurred in the relationship 
between the army and the minister of defence and the army and the 
government, his government is making a terrible mistake in cutting 
off the testimony that may be heard before the Somalia inquiry as 
of March 31, which is approaching very quickly?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as you know, 
and as the hon. member knows very well, we have never 
commented on whom should called by the Somalia commission. 
We have never commented on the testimony given before this 
commission.
<P>
	The commission's mandate was extended to the end of June, 
which means it will have worked for over two years. If, for its own 
reasons, the commission wants to hear testimony reflecting the 
concerns of the hon. Leader of the Opposition, it may do so.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, how does the government reconcile the statements of the 
Prime Minister that they absolutely want light to be shed on the 
Somalia affair, and the statements by the minister of defence, who 
said on his appointment that everyone could be heard-he was full 
of good intentions-with the attitude of the government today, 
where it is limiting the time available to the commission, despite 
the opinion of Mr. Justice Létourneau?
<P>
	Essentially, how can they reconcile their words of a few months 
ago with their hurry today to put the lid on the pot as quickly as 
possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, clearly what 
counts for the government is getting on with things rather than 
spending years studying a situation that occurred in 1992-93.
<P>
	A historical document can have a certain value at a given point. 
For us, and for most Canadians I think, it is time to act. We have to 
take steps to try to avoid repetitions in the future.
<P>
	We could have waited. A number of people think it might have 
been interesting for the government to leave the thing under cover 
until the end of the year, or some time next year or even two or 
three years from now. What counts for us is to make sure that the 
Canadian forces, which receive a lot of support from the public, 
may continue to do the fine work its members have been doing for 
100 years and are still doing around the world.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, observers 
are unanimous in saying that, since the government decided to 
impose a deadline on the Somalia commission of inquiry, witnesses 
from the armed forces seem much more at ease before the 
commission, knowing that, come March 31, everything will be 
over, and that they only have to hang on until then. Yet, we now 
know that the military blackmailed the former defence minister. 
And now, the Prime Minister is gagging the inquiry.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that, by refusing to give the 
commission enough time to shed light on this scandal, he is 
condoning the actions of senior army officers regarding this whole 
issue, including the blackmail to which the former defence minister 
was subjected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, let us not forget 
that people involved in this issue have an opportunity to express 
their point of view.
<P>
	As I said earlier, it is absolutely not our intention to suggest to 
the commission that it should call one witness instead of another.
<P>
	However, it seems rather farfetched to refer, as the hon. member 
did, to someone who not only was the Minister of National Defence 
but who went on to become the Prime Minister of Canada. It does 
not help much to suggest that people of that stature can easily be 
gagged or forced into situations they do not accept.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the 
Létourneau commission was set up, we had questions to ask and the 
new defence minister told us: ``We want to find out exactly what 
happened in Somalia. The commission's mandate is very clear: it 
must look into every aspect''.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister of Canada. If the Prime 
Minister wants to show in a concrete manner that he does not 
condone what occurred, will he agree today to extend the 
commission's mandate, as asked by Mr. Justice Létourneau, and as 
needed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7574"> 7574 </A></B>
<P>
by the commission to  shed light on what happened before, during 
and after the events in Somalia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is interesting 
to listen to our friends opposite who sometimes tell us, quite 
correctly, that a lot of money was spent on commissions. I will not 
name them all, but we sometimes hear opposition members tell us 
that the government has spent enormous amounts of money on such 
commissions.
<P>
	But the hon. member must realize that the government has 
already granted three extensions to the Somalia commission. When 
the commission was first set up, its deadline was the end of 
December 1995.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member is more interested in a historical 
document that could be produced in two or three years. As for us, 
we felt it was very important to take action and to start 
implementing policies and procedures that, hopefully, will prevent 
a repeat of such things in the future.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when this Prime Minister came to power in 1993 he 
promised he would establish a higher standard than the Mulroney 
administration with respect to accountability, integrity and 
responsibility.
<P>
	Since that time he has broken the GST promise, denied that he 
broke it, has botched the Airbus investigation, has gagged the 
Somalia inquiry and has stonewalled the tainted blood inquiry on 
which human lives depend. The trust of the Canadian people in 
their government has been abused in each of these instances.
<P>
	Given this record of abuse, why should Canadians trust either 
him or his government any longer?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last three years and three months this government 
has offered the Canadian people a good government, a competent 
government and in all circumstances we have done our best.
<P>
	That is why while I was travelling with the premiers in the 
Pacific and later on in France, people were asking me how we 
managed to turn things around in Canada in a way that all these 
countries envy Canada today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, good government includes keeping your word.
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised to scrap the GST, then he denied 
making that promise. He promised Canadians jobs, jobs, jobs and 
there are 1.5 million unemployed. He promised the Somalia 
inquiry would be allowed to get to the truth. He stood in this House 
and said that was the case and yet last month the government 
decided to shut it  down. The litany of broken promises, denial of 
responsibility and abuse of trust goes on and on.
<P>
	How can Canadians believe what the Prime Minister says in the 
future when they cannot believe what he has said in the past?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, most of the matters to which the hon. member referred, 
for example the inquiry, we gave some very good answers. You 
may not be satisfied but the people of Canada believe that the time 
has come on the Somalia inquiry for the Minister of National 
Defence to restore the confidence in the armed forces and to make 
sure that they can do their job properly. That is exactly what the 
Minister of National Defence is doing at this time.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member can talk about all these things, but I remember 
his party talking about the standards it wanted to use in the House 
of Commons. I hope the leader of the third party will read the 
memo about disturbances in the House of Commons and not ask 
questions which require answers which may make the government 
look bad. With the recipes that they have put forward today, if there 
is a group that has gone down in the last three years and three 
months, it is the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do not have to make the government look bad. It is 
doing an excellent job on its own.
<P>
	On June 12, 1991 in this House, when he was in opposition, the 
Prime Minister promised that every minister in his cabinet would 
assume full responsibility for any bungling in their departments. 
When we question the conduct of his ministers, the Prime Minister 
has said again and again that the buck stops with him.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister now assume responsibility and hold 
these ministers accountable today in this House-the defence 
minister, the health minister, the justice minister-for the serious 
blunders they have made in the last two months?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I watched the debates. The ministers answered all the 
questions very well. When the press asked them questions they 
took full responsibility for their departments. When there was 
something that needed to be remedied, they moved very quickly.
<P>
	The leader of the third party accused the government a few 
months ago of wanting to postpone the inquiry on Somalia until 
after the election. Now he is complaining because we are assuming 
responsibility right away. He should make up his mind.

about the Airbus affair, the less we understand.
<P>
	What do we have here? A justice minister who claims not to be 
involved, but apologizes anyway; a solicitor general who admits 
having known for eight months, but takes no responsibility and did 
not inform any of his colleagues; the Clerk of the Privy Council, 
Jocelyne Bourgon, who denies knowing anything in spite of 
information to the contrary; a commissioner of the RCMP who 
denies any responsibility because he did not see the letter until 
January 1997, when the letter was written two years earlier; and a 
Prime Minister skirting the whole issue by saying it is none of his 
concern.
<P>
	How will the people of Canada know who is responsible for the 
mistake that will cost them millions of dollars?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what is very clear in all of this are 
the first principles. There was no political interference in the police 
investigation in the Airbus matter. That is a principle of real 
importance to this government and to Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member talked of responsibility. According to 
parliamentary tradition, ministers have a responsibility to address 
weaknesses in the system openly and directly. That is exactly what 
we have done. The justice department has already changed its 
procedures so as to address the weaknesses and improve both the 
system and the procedures. To act responsibly is to make the 
changes required to improve the system, and that is what we did.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if there is one principle this House recognizes, it is that of 
government accountability.
<P>
	In this case, the Prime Minister has denied any responsibility. So 
have his ministers and the commissioner of the RCMP. But the 
decision to write the Swiss authorities and denounce a former 
Prime Minister was nonetheless made by someone somewhere in 
this government.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said, we have acted 
responsibly. We have changed the procedures. We have been 
accountable to the public and to Parliament. We have addressed the 
weaknesses in the procedures. That is what being accountable is all 
about, under parliamentary tradition. We have been and continue to 
be accountable.
<P>

<P>

is no ultimate cover-up in the Somalia inquiry, will the Prime

be made fully public before the next federal election?''
<P>

<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Eaton's 
would have had those documents delivered in a catalogue.
<P>

It is no coincidence that the inquiry will not have enough time to

<P>
	Brian Mulroney's former chief of staff, Norman Spector, stated 
that he had informed the present Clerk of the Privy Council, 
Jocelyne Bourgon, about an RCMP investigation of former Prime 
Minister Mulroney, one month before <I>The Financial Post </I>made 
this information public. Yet Mrs. Bourgon continues to deny that 
she obtained this information and passed it on to the Prime 
Minister or his advisers.
<P>
	How does the Prime Minister explain the contradictions between 
the version given by Mr. Spector and that of Mrs. Bourgon?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Mrs. Bourgon briefed me fully on this file, as was stated 
in a document released on November 20, when I was in Asia with 
the Commonwealth and at the APEC meeting.
<P>
	Mrs. Bourgon's statement to the press was very clear. And I am 
completely satisfied with the answer she gave when questioned.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
in a somewhat special situation. Mr. Spector apparently passed this 
information on to Mrs. Bourgon in September 1995. Mr. Spector 
and Mrs. Bourgon have one thing in common: they both enjoy the 
confidence of the Prime Minister. The latter appointed Mrs. 
Bourgon Clerk of the Privy Council and Mr. Spector head of the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency.

	In light of the circumstances and in light of the mess, what is the 
Prime Minister waiting for to set up an independent commission of

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr.

cabinet. He has always promised that every one of his ministers 
will have to take full responsibility for bungling in their 
departments. Well this has turned into a national joke.
<P>
	Who is taking responsibility for the botched investigation into 
Airbus? The justice minister says he is not responsible, even 
though the letter to the Swiss authorities was written by his 
department and signed on his behalf. The solicitor general says he 
is not responsible; it is all the fault of an RCMP sergeant.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Is blaming RCMP 
sergeants his interpretation and understanding of ministerial 
responsibility?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a very well known practice that when there are 
criminal investigations the political part of the government is not 
informed. It has always been that way.
<P>
	Yesterday it was confirmed in a debate on TV between two of the 
most respected public servants who have served this country for a 
long time, Gordon Robertson and Arthur Kroeger. They said that 
everything was conducted according to tradition. When there is a 
criminal investigation it is for the police to conduct the 
investigation and the prime minister and the ministers are not 
involved in the investigation. This has been a very clear practice 
for a long time.
<P>
	I do not believe it is the business of a minister or a prime 
minister to give instruction to the police to investigate one guy and 
not investigate another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the evidence 
shows very clearly that the justice minister knew what was going 
on and what the content of the letter was back in November 1996 
and he chose to do nothing about it.
<P>
	When I look across at the Liberal cabinet, all they seem able to

to be accountable themselves and refuse to demand accountability 
from senior officials. I ask the Prime Minister: When will he stop 
making speeches about accountability, integrity and responsibility

<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General

address the problems in the system squarely, quickly and 
effectively. That is exactly what I have done. To be sure, there were 
problems in this system. To be sure, there were weaknesses to be 
overcome. We have done just that.
<P>
	The very month this letter became public, I directed that there be 
changes made in the system for sending letters of request from the 
Department of Justice. In the past year we have made a variety of 
changes to minimize the risk of such a thing ever happening again. 
Two weeks ago I engaged the services of a former justice of the

look at the changes we have made, to examine the entire system 
and to recommend any other changes that he thinks should be made 
to improve the system.

ago, the information commissioner severely criticized Health

	We prefer to have airports in the hands of not for profit 
corporations similar to those in Vancouver, Calgary and Edmonton. 
It is an approach that has proven its worth. We now have that type 
of organization in Toronto, and I look forward in co-operation with 
it to making the airport in Toronto the best airport east of the 
Mississippi.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the courts 
have proven that that deal was a good deal for the taxpayers and 
that it was cancelled strictly for partisan reasons. The only question 
remaining about Pearson is how much it is going to cost the 
taxpayers for nothing. Thirteen million dollars have already been 
spent and hundreds of millions more are at stake. Who is going to 
be held accountable for this waste of taxpayers' dollars? Who in 
this government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what we want at Pearson is to have an airport which will 
serve as the funnel for the eastern seaboard of North America for 
Europe, just as Vancouver now is beginning to serve as the point of 
transfer for all Asian, North American and indeed South American 
flights.
<P>
	I would like to say to the hon. member that certainly this 
government would be happy to have this settled for substantially 
less than the sums he is talking about and fully expects it to be 
settled for substantially less, if in fact the people who have 
concerns on the other side wish to settle.
<P>
	I should say that it is quite, quite unacceptable to the Canadian 
taxpayer and it should be quite unacceptable to  members of the 
third party and their Tory senator friends to settle it for anything 
more than the taxpayer should pay. In other words, that is for 
reasonable expenses incurred in the preparation of the bid 
submitted and nothing, nothing, nothing for unearned profit or for 
lobbyists fees.

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, like millions of Canadians, I was both appalled and 
embarrassed when Irving Abella of the Canadian Jewish Congress 
told the television program ``60 Minutes'' former Liberal Prime 
Minister Pierre Trudeau would not prosecute war criminals living 
in Canada.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Does this reprehensible 
abdication of responsibility continue to be the Liberal government 
policy as evidenced by recent botched deportation proceedings and 
foot dragging?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the record of this government is 
clear. Unlike the last government, from the beginning we have 
committed ourselves to acting decisively and effectively where 
there are people in respect of whom there is evidence of complicity 
in war crimes or crimes against humanity to have them removed 
from the country.
<P>
	In January 1995 a few months after the Supreme Court of 
Canada had decided the Finta case, that it is very difficult to 
proceed through the criminal law, this government committed itself 
to starting by April 1997, 12 deportation and denaturalization cases 
where there was evidence of complicity in war crimes. We have 
now started 10 of those cases. The other two will be started by our 
target date of April of this year. That is evidence of this 
government's commitment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Canada should never again be a haven for any war 
criminal.
<P>
	My question again is for the Prime Minister. Is the Prime 
Minister doing anything to ensure that no other war criminal will 
ever find a safe haven in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this government fully agrees with 
the sentiment expressed by the hon. member.
<P>
	Canada cannot be a safe haven for war criminals, for those who 
commit crimes against humanity. Every effort is made to ensure 
that does not happen. Indeed in recent months we have succeeded 
in having just such a person sent back out of the country where the 
evidence justified it.
<P>
	The hon. member should also know that Canada very proudly 
contributed one of its best judges, the hon. Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour, to serve as chief prosecutor for the International War 
Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, and that notwithstanding the 
opposition in various quarters.

	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is rather 
unfortunate on this first day that we return that I have to invoke 
Beauchesne's 481(e) which states talks about imputing bad motives 
or motives different from those acknowledged by a member.
<P>
	I am referring to the remarks by the minister of defence during 
question period. He quoted <I>Hansard</I> regarding the leader of the 
Reform Party. To give the picture, I will also repeat what the leader 
of the Reform Party said from <I>Hansard</I> September 17, 1996:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, to ensure that there is no ultimate cover-up in the Somalia inquiry 
will the Prime Minister guarantee to this House that the results of the inquiry will be 
made fully public before the next federal election?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is a direct quote from <I>Hansard</I> from the leader of the 
Reform Party. However, in the next breath after quoting these 
words the minister of defence went on to put words in the leader's 
mouth, saying that he demanded the Somalia inquiry be shut down. 
That is not in any way, shape or form the proper interpretation of 
the quote.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the member for bringing this up but in my 
view this would be a matter of debate, how one member sees it and 
how the other member sees it.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="QUESTIONPERIOD">QUESTION PERIOD</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
point of order has to do with the way question period proceeded 
today and the fact that it was completely dominated by the three 
official parties in this House and there was no place for the New 
Democratic  Party, the Progressive Conservative Party or 
independents.
<P>
	I had a question on medicare I would like to have asked which I 
think a lot of people would like to have had asked. I did not get to 
ask it because three official parties were allowed to dominate 
question period by going on and on and on.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona 
for bringing up this point of order. It gives me the opportunity to 
appeal to all hon. members. During question period we do have 45 
minutes and I would appeal to both the questioners and those who 
are to give the answers to please be as brief as they can.
<P>
	It is of course the intention of the Chair to accommodate as many 
members as possible. It was pointed out to me earlier that only one 
member of the government posed a question today.
<P>
	I would hope that the questions tomorrow and in the days ahead 
will be a little shorter as well as the answers. In that way we should 
be able to accommodate the independent members of the House as 
well as the members from the government. It is a point well taken 
and I do thank the hon. member for Winnipeg Transcona for 
bringing it up.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
same point of order. I do want to support my colleague from the 
NDP in his point of order.
<P>
	May I just add a comment that the Chair may wish to take into 
consideration in the way question period is conducted. Mr. 
Speaker, with regard to members on the government side, since you 
have expressed some concern about the fact that only one member 
from the government side was allowed to rise, one of the things we 
know about this place is that the members on the government side 
have full access to members of the cabinet and their colleagues 
through caucus, which is not the case for members on the 
opposition benches. Question period is clearly designed, as far as 
we know from its practice and traditions, to enable the government 
to be questioned and to allow the opposition to make the 
government accountable. I submit that maybe one question for the 
government side would be enough.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for his suggestion. On 
the same point of order, the hon. member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Nunziata (York South-Weston, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it seems to me it is more than a point of order. It in fact ought to be 
considered a question of privilege.
<P>
	Government members, NDP members of Parliament and 
Conservative members of Parliament are treated differently in 
terms of question period than Bloc members of Parliament and 
Reform members of Parliament.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7581"> 7581 </A></B>

	They are treated differently in the sense that government 
members, independent members, Conservative members and NDP 
members are permitted only a single question, normally at the end 
of question period. The other registered parties are entitled to a 
question and a supplementary.
<P>
	It seems the Chair has to give some plausible and reasonable 
explanation for why there is that distinction, for why I as a member 
of Parliament am discriminated against in terms of question 
period-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, we could get more members of 
Parliament posing questions if both the questions and the answers 
were shorter. The Chair has taken note of this. I will proceed to the 
hon. member for Parkdale-High Park.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you 
reminded the House at the opening of today's session of the 
wooden Mace in front of you. I would remind all of us that you 
have the authority under that Mace, and if any question is too long 
or if any answer is too long, you have the authority to cut it short.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I thank you for reminding me of my authority. I 
am not sure but I think I heard the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona say something. Were you addressing your remarks to 
me?

that you have authority and-

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on January 10, André Caron, member of  Parliament for 
Jonquière, died after a long battle with cancer. He was our friend, 
and we were profoundly saddened by this loss.
<P>
	Mr. Caron was deeply religious and looked forward to a full 
recovery, in spite of his condition. He fought with all his might to 
the very end. His courage in facing his illness was an example to us 
all.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Caron was born in Jonquière in 1944. After studying 
educational counselling and teaching at Laval University and 
theology at the University of Quebec in Chicoutimi, he worked for 
the greater part of his life for the Jonquière school board as a 
guidance counsellor.
<P>
	His political career started in 1990 when he became president of 
the Parti Québécois riding association in Jonquière. Then, in 1993, 
he was elected to the House of Commons as a member of the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	Mr. Caron was ordained a deacon in 1988 before becoming 
responsible for all deacons in the diocese of Chicoutimi and 
serving on the provincial executive of the diaconate. A member of 
Amnesty International and the Civil Liberties Union, Mr. Caron 
was involved in a number of organizations throughout his life and 
was unstinting in his desire to help others.
<P>
	André Caron was a sensitive man, a good listener, a man with 
great tact, a man who was very human, modest and generous. He 
strongly believed wealth should be shared, and he felt it was his 
mission to speak for the most vulnerable, the poor and those who 
are not always able to defend themselves. He was a citizen with a 
cause.
<P>
	Mr. Caron is an example to all members of this House. He 
wanted to represent the people of his riding as well as he could, and 
his views show he was a man of ideas. His convictions were more 
important to him that his personal interests. Quebec and Canada 
have lost a parliamentarian of integrity.
<P>
	André Caron was a staunch sovereignist. He never doubted the 
ability of Quebecers to build their own future. The people of 
Jonquière trusted him. He was respected by everyone because of 
his commitment to his constituents, and many people mourned his 
passing. Our thoughts go out today to those who loved him and 
supported him in his long battle against illness.
<P>
	On behalf of all members of the Bloc Quebecois, I wish to offer 
his wife Marie Lévesque and his sons, Jean-François and 
Louis-Philippe, our sincere condolences. With them we mourn the 
loss of our friend André Caron.

are gathered here today to honour the memory of one of our 
colleagues, Mr. André Caron. On behalf of the Government of 
Canada, I speak for all of the members of the government in 
offering our most  sincere condolences to Mrs. Marie 
Lévesque-Caron and her two sons, Jean-François and 
Louis-Philippe.
<P>
	The House will remember André Caron, elected to this House by 
a region of Quebec that is proud of its roots and origins as a 
building force in this country. There have been Bouchards and 
there have been Tremblays, but there has been only one André 
Caron, a man of the people, a man close to his people, as all elected 
members must be when representing a riding.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I did not have the pleasure of seeing André often 
in settings other than the House of Commons. Divergent political 
leanings make those of us who are parliamentarians often 
philosophically distant from each other because of our political 
choices, but we share a common goal: the interests of our 
constituents, our fellow citizens, the population as a whole. His 
straightforwardness and courage earned him the respect of all us 
parliamentarians engaged in the federal political arena.
<P>
	On the personal level, all those coming in contact with him will 
attest to his profound moral values. He acknowledged only God as 
his master. This candid and frank man will leave a great gap in all 
the lives of all those around him.
<P>
	André's political career was too short to do more than hint at his 
profound and intense dedication to the causes he espoused 
throughout his career.
<P>
	He was particularly committed to our young people and to his 
faith.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	Many young people came to know André as one of those devoted 
souls who gives without reserve, but others will unfortunately not 
come to know him, for his Father has called him away.
<P>
	I would like to repeat, in closing, the words used by Mgr. 
Jean-Guy Couture in André Caron's funeral eulogy: ``Even if he is 
called away before his time, the just man will find his rest- 
Wisdom surpasses grey hairs-A spotless life is the equal of a long 
one''.
<P>
	All of us will mourn the passing of the parliamentarian but, most 
of all, we will mourn the passing of a man with a mission, part of it 
accomplished and part of it yet to be accomplished, the ambassador 
and diplomat from Jonquière.
<P>

years helping young people choose a career that would be both 
successful and fulfilling.

	On behalf of all my colleagues here, I repeat what we have 
already said, and it comes from the bottom of our hearts. We offer 
our condolences to Mr. Caron's family. We know it is always sad to 
lose a member of the family. Mr. Caron was a member of our 
parliamentary family. He will be missed dearly.

	<B>Hon. Don Boudria (Minister for International Cooperation 
and Minister responsible for Francophonie, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I want to talk to you about international development week but 
before, I wish to offer my condolences to the family and friends of 
Father Guy Pinard, who was assassinated yesterday while 
celebrating mass in Rwanda.
<P>
	A native of Shawinigan, Father Pinard spent several years of his 
life helping the poorest of the poor in Rwanda. I had the 
opportunity today to speak with the Rwandan minister, Dr. Charles 
Muringande, who indicated his government's intention of ensuring 
better safety in the area of the country where this crime was 
committed and to make sure that such reprehensible acts can be 
avoided in the future.
<P>
	Be that as it may, Father Pinard's death is a great tragedy. With 
him we have lost a courageous man. He will be greatly missed in 
Rwanda as well as here in Canada.
<P>
	I will now talk to you about international development week. In 
the next few days, Canadian men and women will have the 
opportunity to learn a little more about the outstanding efforts 
made by our fellow countrymen and countrywomen and their 
partners in developing countries.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	Every first week of February, we have an opportunity to thank 
the international development workers for the future they are 
preparing for our children and all the children of the world. Until 
February 8, throughout the country, community and educational 
activities will highlight the challenges facing developing countries 
and the opportunities development represents for Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This year's theme, ``The World Ahead'', is about our shared 
future. It is about a world where better health, education and 
economic opportunities in developing countries mean increased 
peace and increased prosperity for all, for the world. It is about 
seeing today's development partners not only as tomorrow's 
trading partners, but also as today's neighbours in the global 
village. It is about the hundreds of thousands of men, women and 
children worldwide who are creating that shared future right now.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	An increasing number of Canadians, particularly young men and 
women, are getting involved in  international development. During 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7584"> 7584 </A></B>
<P>
recent visits, I met with people and discussed with them the work 
they do in developing countries.
<P>
	By setting up medical clinics, building water supply systems, 
cleaning up the environment or enacting human rights legislation, 
they create links that bring nations of the world closer to one 
another. Their action has an immediate impact but also contributes 
to ensure a better future.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Every day Canadians are making a contribution to development: 
innovating, adapting and learning from their partners. Throughout 
international development week we will see and hear about the 
exciting work that they are doing. It is work worth recognizing and 
worth celebrating. I invite all hon. members of the House to join 
me this week to reflect on the challenges of international 
development and to salute the Canadians who are helping to build 
the world ahead. As I said previously, that is the theme of this 
year's development week.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During international development week, I invite my colleagues 
in the House and all Canadians to ``Think of the World''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
International Development Week gives me an opportunity, as the 
Bloc Quebecois critic for international co-operation, to recognize 
the outstanding contribution of non-governmental organizations in 
this area. Efforts made here and abroad, in the north as well as in 
the south, to promote sustainable development deserve to be 
recognized and encouraged.
<P>
	Over the years, Canada has established a very good reputation in 
development thanks mainly to the excellent work of our nameless 
ambassadors who sometimes put their life on the line like Father 
Pinard did.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the official development assistance budget has 
been cut by 28 percent over four years, including the cuts that will 
be made during the present fiscal year. We have to confess that the 
present Canadian foreign policy emphasizes trade and not 
co-operation. Moreover it is ironic that the minister should talk 
about public education activities during this week, when CIDA has 
cut by 100 percent the subsidies to NGOs whose mandate it was in 
the public participation program.
<P>
	Since the international cooperation minister urges us to think 
about international development issues, I am taking this 
opportunity to emphasize that the level of poverty throughout the 
world is rising, as mentioned in the report of the UN development 
program made public last October. Sustainable development is the 
very basis of a lasting solution for millions of people. Let us keep 
that in mind, especially during this week.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would also like 
to address the death of Father Pinard and extend condolences on 
behalf of the Reform Party to his family and friends.
<P>
	Father Pinard was tragically murdered while delivering 
communion in Rwanda. This senseless and shameful act has 
shocked Canadians and has reminded us all of the dangers faced by 
many Canadian men and women who work abroad under very 
difficult and uncertain circumstances to relieve human suffering.
<P>
	Father Pinard fought for decades to bring hope and love of God 
to the people of Rwanda. Even in the face of other recent shootings 
he did not abandon his parishioners. He served them to the very end 
and this will not be forgotten by Canadians.
<P>
	On behalf of the Reform Party it is a pleasure to respond to the 
minister's statement on International Development Week 1997. For 
decades Canadians have made a great contribution in the area of 
international development. Thousands have volunteered their time 
and millions have donated money to aid the cause.
<P>
	Given this commitment by Canadians, it is also important that 
the federal government do its part and support the priorities of 
grassroots Canadians by matching the contributions raised 
privately by non-governmental organizations and church groups. I 
believe that Canadians prefer this approach rather than spending 
large amounts of aid dollars on government to government 
handouts. By working with grassroots organizations our aid dollars 
will more effectively help the world's poorest people by providing 
for basic human needs such as primary education, basic health care 
and sanitation. Canada will help to bring an end to the cycle of 
poverty and dependency that is common in many parts of the 
developing world. This is a worthy goal.
<P>
	In addition since the minister mentioned human rights, I would 
argue that his government should act, not just simply talk. When 
Reformers consulted our grassroots membership on this topic at 
Assembly 96, they voted overwhelmingly to oppose giving foreign 
aid to governments that abuse basic human rights. This is a good 
idea and I am sure that most Canadians would agree with it.
<P>
	Canadians have already done a great deal to foster international 
development but we can do better. We can make sure that our 
shrinking aid budget is spent more effectively and we can expect 
greater accountability for that spending from CIDA which should 
be given a true legislative mandate. If we do all this, then our 
development program will be on track for the 21st century.

a petition with regard to breast milk substitution.
<P>
	The petitioners feel that a child has the best opportunity for life 
when breast fed and that breast milk substitutes should be 
discouraged. Indeed, we have endorsed that at the United Nations. 
The petitioners feel very strongly about this.
<P>
	Since children are our best products and the best attributes that 
our country would have, we have much better health situations 
when they are breast fed. We try to pursue that policy. I agree with 
the petitioners and will table the petition on their behalf.

questions on the Order Paper last September and that, according to 
our Standing Orders, the government has 45 days to answer this 
type of questions. We are now at the beginning of February and I 
am still awaiting answers to my questions, which concern family 
trusts.
<P>
	I can assure you that during the holiday season, I met many 
people from my riding and from other ridings as well and that, 
generally speaking, taxpayers from Canada and Quebec are very 
much interested in these questions.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	I find it deplorable that the hon. parliamentary secretary has 
already told me here in the House that the government was 
preparing to respond to this type of question on the number of 
family trusts, a ranking of categories of family trusts by size, the 
impact on the Canadian taxation system of the creation of family 
trusts in 1972, and the number of trusts transferring their assets out 
of the country, about which we have learned recently after 
revelations by the auditor general.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am counting on you to ensure that the government 
answers these questions, which are of major public interest. 
Judging by the reaction of the parliamentary secretary, there is 
something to hide.

Question No. 52-<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-For each of the last 10 years, how many seized firearms have been destroyed by 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and (<I>a</I>) how many of these firearms could 
be described as firearms commonly used for hunting and sporting purposes, including 
how many prohibited weapons, restricted weapons,  rifles and shotguns, and (<I>b</I>) what is 
the fair market value of these firearms with collectors, hunters and sport shooters, and 
(<I>c</I>) why did the RCMP Forensic Laboratories, Firearms Section, destroy approximately 
2,617 firearms in 1994 rather than offer these firearms for sale to individual firearm 
owners who are authorized by the RCMP to own these types of firearms?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> In so far as 
the Ministry of the Solicitor General of Canada and its agency are 
concerned, the answer is as follows:
<P>
	ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE (RCMP)
<P>
	Part a:
<P>
	The requested data are being provided for 1994 and 1995. The 
data are held in electronic form and were relatively easy to 
assemble from all the regional sources. The data for previous years 
would have to be compiled manually and would require significant 
time and effort. The requested data are set out below in table form.
<P>
	Firearms Received by RCMP Forensic Laboratories for 
Destruction
<P>

<IMG SRC="tables/nen1213x03_r0.gif"  ><BR>
<BR><BR>
	Comments with respect to part <I>a</I>) vis-à-vis the above data: The 
rifles and shotguns, almost without exception, were firearms 
commonly used for hunting and sporting purposes; the handguns 
are restricted weapons; the submachine guns and machine guns for 
the most part would have fallen into the prohibited category, 
although some may have been only restricted; and firearms, such as 
sawed off shotguns and rifles, are prohibited weapons, however,for 
RCMP Forensic Laboratory purposes they are recorded according 
to the actual make, model, etc. Barrel and overall lenghts are key 
factors in determining if a particular firearm is a prohibited 
weapon, however, these are recorded only if the firearm is an 
exhibit in a laboratory case. If it is simply received for destruction, 
neither is recorded for inventory purposes and cnsequently there is 
no way of determining how many of the rifles and shotguns listed 
above actually fell within the ``prohibited weapons'' category.

	Fair Market Value
<P>
	Rifle: $175.00 ea
<P>
	Shotguns: $200.00 ea
<P>
	Handguns: $250.00 ea
<P>
	For inventory and destruction purposes the actual condition of 
the firearms as received is not recorded and therefore the values 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7587"> 7587 </A></B>
<P>
given are an average based on the  overall general condition for the 
various categories of firearms received for destruction.
<P>
	Part c:
<P>
	The ``approximately 2,617 firearms'' stated as destroyed in 1994 
by the RCMP Forensic Laboratories, Firearms Sections, would 
have come from three sources:
<P>
	1) The vast majority of these firearms were received from 
Canada Customs. These were disposed of in accordance with the 
Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Canada Customs 
and the Firearms Section at Central Forensic Laboratory, Ottawa. 
Available options are listed in Laboratory Services Manual, chapter 
21, paragraph G.7.c.10. Specifically the options are: retain in a 
Forensic Laboratory Services Directorate (FLSD), return to the 
contributor (Canada Customs), dispose of according to written 
instruction from Canada Customs, or destroy. There are no other 
options with respect to the firearms received from Canada 
Customs;
<P>
	2) Of the total, a number were destroyed in accordance with a 
Court Order. This category forms the next largest portion, and 
usually are representative of the firearms seized during 
investigation of criminal matters. Their disposition is nearly 
always at the direction of the courts who direct that either they be 
destroyed or forfeited to the Crown. Those forfeited to the Crown 
are then disposed of (destroyed) according to the wishes of the 
various provincial Crowns and/or their representatives. This group 
would also include firearms turned in during the various amnesty 
periods which have been proclaimed over the past few years; and
<P>
	3) A smaller portion were destroyed as an assistance to the 
general public. Firearms are turned into local detachments by 
either the owners, or in many cases, by executors of estates, who 
wish to have them destroyed. Others, such as firearms used in 
suicides, are destroyed in accordance with family wishes. Selling 
any of these firearms may undermine public confidence in the 
RCMP, other police services, and the justice system as a whole.
<P>
	With respect to the first portion of Q-52, information provided 
pertains only to firearms destroyed by the Forensic Laboratory 
Services Directorate of the RCMP and not by any other unit of the 
RCMP that may have destroyed seized firearms during the years in 
question. The vast majority of firearms seized by the operation 
units of the RCMP are disposed of through being ordered forfeited 
by the applicable court for the provincial Crowns. These firearms 
are then disposed of, generally by destruction, by the provincial 
Chief Provincial Firearms Officers (CPFO'S) or other provincial 
authority.

Board and from what countries (please give the amount for each country); (<I>b</I>) how 
much interest is being paid on these long-term debts or liabilities (please give details for

and for each of them, what dollar amount do they represent?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> a) The long term debts or liabilities owed to the 
Canadian Wheat Board, CWB, by individual countries is 
commercially sensitive information and public disclosure would be 
considered a breach of customer confidentiality. However, the 
volume of CWB's credit sales by country is regularly disclosed in 
the CWB's annual report.
<P>
	b) The total value of outstanding debt owed to the CWB from 
sales made under credit arrangements is approximately $6.7 
billion. The interest accumulated for the period between August 1, 
1994 and July 31, 1995 was approximately $444.5 million, which 
is included in the total value of the outstanding debt and hence in 
the government guarantee. Non-payment of principle or interest, if 
it occurs, does not represent a cost to farmers.
<P>
	c) The Paris Club is the institution through which major creditor 
governments reschedule or refinance credits they have extended to 
public or private sector borrowers in developing countries and 
which enjoy the sovereign guarantee of the borrowing country.
<P>

Question No. 94-<B>Mr. Caccia:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What are the reasons the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption Act, passed by both 
Houses of Parliament in the early 1980's, was not proclaimed into law?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> In 1982, 
during the time when the Motor Vehicle Fuel Consumption 
Standards Act, MVFCSA, was being considered by Parliament, the 
motor vehicle industry  agreed to meet the provisions of the 
proposed act voluntarily under the existing joint 
government-industry voluntary fuel consumption program, 
including the company average fuel consumption, CAFC, 
requirements. The government felt that all the benefits of a 
mandated program could be realised at a lower cost to government, 
industry and consumers through the voluntary approach. This 
option was therefore chosen and the MVFCSA was retained as 
contingency legislation should the voluntary program fail.
<P>
	The Canadian company average fuel consumption for new 
passenger cars has been consistently better than the annual CAFC 
goal and overall program effectiveness has paralleled that of the 
legislated U.S. program.

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, while I am on my feet perhaps I could be permitted 
to reply to my hon. colleague. While I understand he is losing some 
patience on this issue, he has asked a comprehensive question. It is 
a very detailed question and is a question that requires a good bit of 
information to come from one of the government departments that 
is very consumed with getting his information.
<P>
	I assure him that we are working on the question and I can assure 
the hon. member we are doing everything we can to have the 
answer as soon as possible.
<P>

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-60, an act to 
establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to repeal and 
amend other acts as a consequence, as reported (with amendment) 
from the committee; and of Motions Nos. 31, 32 and 33.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was about to indicate 
that, if no one else speaks, debate on Group No. 10 is completed 
and we can move on immediately to Group No. 11.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Pursuant to an order made Thursday, December 
12 1996, all questions on the motions in Group No. 10 are deemed 
to have been put and the recorded divisions deemed demanded and 
deferred.
<P>
	The House will now proceed to consideration of motions in 
Group No. 11.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
Group No. 11 contains but a single motion and that motion comes 
from the government party, I wonder if it might not be appropriate 
to ask my colleague to speak first. I would then speak after him.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The parliamentary secretary is not on his feet.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I believe that the 
government does support Group No. 11, the technical amendment 
to Bill C-60. The amendment ensures that any money authority 
appropriated to existing departments, food inspection, health or 
other departments will be transferred to the agency early in 1997.
<P>
	This is a technical amendment which is necessary for the 
parliamentary budget to be put in place. There is absolutely no 
question that when an agency is being set up it needs funding. It 
will be receiving its funding from the Departments of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, Health and from other moneys which have already 
been put into the budget.
<P>
	Some questions brought forth by the opposition suggest that new 
money is being placed within the system. That is totally not 
accurate. We have reassured everyone that the funding in this case 
is a technical  amendment which will allow the moneys which have 
already been allocated in government departments to go into the 
agency so it will have funds to operate. As a result, we need to have 
the amendment passed.
<P>
	I would again reassure everyone here that we are not talking 
about new money coming into the system. We are talking about 
transferring already approved funding into the new agency.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike 
the Secretary of State, I think the motion in Group No. 11, Motion 
No. 34, is just window dressing.
<P>
	The minister is trying to recover sums of money and use them 
again, as he sees fit, in the agency's operations. I keep coming back 
to the setup we have with the president and the vice-president of the 
advisory board appointed by the party in power. You will agree that 
since the past offers no guarantees for the future, we cannot support 
this motion.
<P>
	I am reminded of the lieutenant-governor your party appointed, 
yes, your party, Mr. Speaker-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear colleague, I am the Speaker, and as such, 
I have no party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should say 
that our friends recently appointed a lieutenant-governor in the 
person of Jean-Louis Roux and soon found this was a mistake. To 
err being human and to recognize the fact divine, the 
lieutenant-governor managed to step down from this prestigious 
position at the right time, but that will not always be the case.
<P>
	Here, the chief executive of the food inspection agency will have 
a very sizeable budget. For two years regular hiring practices will 
be suspended. The president will be able to hire and fire at will. 
This is a very serious matter.
<P>
	He will be given a sizeable sum of money. If surpluses are a 
problem, less money should be given to ensure there will be no 
surplus, if that is what the Secretary of State is saying. Give them a 
very small operating budget so they will have to come and ask for 
their monthly allowance to operate the agency, at least during the 
first year.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Since the government's aim is to recover costs sooner or later, 
we will then be able to better manage this new parapublic agency.
<P>
	Since it is always the end users, that is to say the consumers, who 
end us paying for this government's famous promises, I would ask 
my colleagues to be very vigilant. By creating this agency, we are 
really opening the door to abuse, to the risk of shameless public 
spending by the government.
<P>
	In the hope of saving $40 million, we are running the risk of 
spending much more if my fears are confirmed. I  hope the 
government will allay my fears by improving the appointment 
process, by appointing to the posts of president and vice-president 
or as one of the 12 members of the advisory committee not the best 
<P>

<P>
Liberals in Canada but the rare gems, those who have the skills, the 
experience needed.
<P>
	The past is not always an indication of what the future will be 
like. The Airbus affair, for example, will probably cost in the end, 
as we will eventually find out through the information access 
commission, God knows how many millions of dollars as a result 
of mistakes, of ignorance, or even because they tried to pull a fast 
one on the Conservative Party. How much will Canadian taxpayers 
pay in the end? We will never know how much money was paid to 
the 29 legal experts who worked to defend the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	On the other hand, we know how much the Mulroney group must 
have spent because there will be an agreement, soon I believe, to 
pay the people who worked on the former Prime Minister's defence 
team. It was, of course, the first time a government went before a 
court of law with false, hastily prepared charges in order to obtain 
information from the Swiss government, charges which came from 
the General Solicitor and the Minister of Justice and which 
tarnished one man's reputation. I hope the present Prime Minister 
will not be treated the same way. You will not remain in power for 
the rest of your life. When you cross over to the opposition side, I 
hope the party that will take your place will not treat this Prime 
Minister the same way-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I remind the hon. member that he must always 
address the Chair, and not other members. If he has something to 
add, he can say it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, you are absolutely 
right. I was wrong in addressing directly the whip of the official 
opposition. I must address the Chair, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	In closing, we are debating the last group of motions aimed at 
improving Bill C-60 and we, in the Bloc, do not think MotionNo. 34 put forward by the government side is an improvement. 
Consequently, we will vote against it.
<P>

	<B>The Speaker:</B> Pursuant to an order made Thursday, December

	The House proceeded to the consideration of Bill C-57, an act to 
amend the Bell Canada Act, as reported (without amendment) from 
the committee.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (for Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.)</B> moved 
that the bill be concurred in.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> When shall the bill be read the third time? By 
leave, now?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Irwin (for the Minister of Industry)</B> moved that the bill be 
read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-57, an act to amend the Bell Canada Act, 
is an important part of the government's efforts to stimulate 
investment and innovation in advanced technology and to promote 
new services on the information highway.
<P>
	By repealing section 7 of the Bell Canada Act, the amendment 
takes us another step closer toward the realization of a truly 
Canadian information highway. Those of us who want to see 
Canadian industry compete and grow in the information economy 
will be the first to assent to the progress of this bill. I am pleased 
that members of the House share this view, as was reflected by the 
speedy passage of this bill at second reading stage and by the 
Standing Committee on Industry.
<P>
	Let me quickly review exactly what the legislation will do. The 
amendment will permit Bell Canada to hold a broadcasting licence, 
enabling it to compete with cable television companies. The 
government's convergence policy allows for a balanced approach 
to competition in telecommunications and broadcasting services. 
That is why the government has established a no head starts 
approach.
<P>
	Once the rules for competition in local telephone services have 
been implemented, Bell and its Stentor partners will be able to 
provide broadcasting distribution services. Competition could 
begin as early as the end of 1997.
<P>
	I should note that broadcasting distribution and programming 
services will continue to be regulated by the CRTC under the 
Broadcasting Act no matter how or by whom they are delivered. 
The key result of this bill will be to open the developing informa-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7592"> 7592 </A></B>
<P>
tion highway to  competition. This will benefit consumers who will 
be able to choose who provides their services.
<P>
	Why this bill now? First, the rationale for keeping Bell Canada 
out of the broadcasting business is no longer valid. The prohibition 
against Bell Canada holding such a licence dates back to 1968. At 
that time, Bell was kept out of broadcasting and especially cable 
television, in order to give the young cable industry a chance to 
grow. As we know, the cable television industry in Canada is now 
very well established.
<P>
	Second, the convergence of previously distinct technology 
means that telephone and cable television distributors will be able 
to compete with each other in offering a full range of services. 
Soon we may not only be getting cable service from the telephone 
company but also telephone services from the cable company. This 
convergence will bring businesses and consumers a host of new 
products and services and it will change the way we work, 
communicate with each other, do business and entertain ourselves.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	Finally, because both telephone and cable companies are seeking 
to offer integrated services over their networks, consumers will be 
the beneficiaries in this competitive environment.
<P>
	If you will permit, Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a few 
moments to provide a brief chronology of the initiatives taken that 
have brought us to this point.
<P>
	In 1994 the government formulated a vision for the Canadian 
information highway, one that saw it as an integral part of the jobs 
and growth agenda. At that time the Information Highway 
Advisory Council was set up to examine key public policy issues 
related to Canada's transition to an information society and 
knowledge economy.
<P>
	Following this, the government released an order in council 
outlining its policy on convergence. This policy focused on 
network facilities, Canadian content and competition in facilities, 
products and services. The order in council requested the CRTC to 
hold public consultations and report on issues related to the 
implementation of this policy.
<P>
	In response, the CRTC held public proceedings in 1995. Over 
1,000 public submissions were received and 78 parties participated 
in the public hearings which were broadcast live on cable TV 
channels across Canada.
<P>
	On the issue of convergence, both the CRTC and the Information 
Highway Advisory Council supported the move toward greater 
competition. They also supported policies and regulations that will 
allow cable companies to compete in the local switched telephone 
market and telephone companies to compete in the broadcasting 
distribution market.
<P>
	The CRTC's report ``Competition and Culture on Canada's 
Information Highway: Managing the Realities of Transition'' came 
out in May 1995. In this report, the CRTC said: ``Given the 
commission's view that Canadian telephone companies have the 
potential to contribute to the objectives of the Broadcasting Act, 
and that they should be allowed to do so, the commission 
recommends that the government amend the Bell Canada Act to 
permit Bell Canada to hold broadcasting licences''.
<P>
	The Information Highway Advisory Council concluded its 
comments on the CRTC's report in its own final report 
``Connection, Community, Content, the Challenge of the 
Information Highway'' released in September 1995. The council 
said that in liberalizing its regulatory framework for 
telecommunications, ``the government should act to remove 
outdated and unnecessary barriers to competition and implement 
safeguards against anti-competitive practices''.
<P>
	These two reports provided insight and precision to the 
government's policy objectives.
<P>
	Last May the government released its report ``Building the 
Information Society: Moving Canada into the 21st Century''. Part 
of the action plan in that report was a commitment to finalize the 
policy on convergence.
<P>
	In August the government issued the final text of its convergence 
policy in which it confirmed the policy objectives announced in the 
1994 order in council and set out the principles for implementing 
these policies.
<P>
	The policy statement and implementation principles cover three 
major areas: facilities, content and competition. Obviously an 
essential element in the implementation of this policy is to allow 
Bell Canada to hold a broadcasting licence.
<P>
	The policy statement included a commitment to amend the Bell 
Canada Act to remove the prohibition on Bell Canada and its 
subsidiaries from holding broadcasting licences. The bill before us 
today will implement that policy by repealing section 7 of the Bell 
Canada Act.
<P>
	Technology is changing our world daily, eliminating barriers and 
bringing people together, offering new services and other benefits. 
We can help this process by expediting the passage of Bill C-57.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this bill, 
which seeks to amend the Bell Canada Act, repeals section 7 of that 
act. The purpose of this change is to allow Bell Canada to hold a 
broadcasting licence and to compete directly with cable 
distributors. Let us not forget that section 7 dates back to 1968.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7593"> 7593 </A></B>
<P>
	The government announced its intention to amend the Bell 
Canada Act last August with the release of the Minister of 
Industry's policy on convergence. This policy allows cable 
distributors and telephone companies to compete with each other in 
their basic operations.
<P>
	Bell and its partners at Stentor will be able to provide 
broadcasting services, as soon as the government has regulated 
competition with respect to local telephone services, including 
rates, so that cable distributors and other companies will be able to 
set up competitive local telephone services. This convergence of 
technologies prompted the Minister of Industry to state, and I 
quote: ``The real winners are consumers, who will ultimately have 
a choice in who provides their services''.
<P>
	This government policy on convergence is an integral part of the 
federal plans respecting the development of Canada's information 
highway, as described in the report tabled by the Minister of 
Industry last May, entitled ``Building the Information Society: 
Moving Canada into the 21st Century''.
<P>
	Has the federal government kept or will it keep its promise to 
protect Quebec's and Canada's interests in developing the 
information highway? These are important issues, on which I will 
try to shed some light and find some answers. It should be 
remembered that the first reading of this bill goes back to October 
29, 1996.
<P>
	To start with, I will talk about convergence. As I said earlier, this 
bill is the result of the report entitled ``Building the Information 
Society: Moving Canada into the 21st Century'', which was made 
public on May 23 of last year. The Minister of Industry informed us 
in this regard that a convergence policy would soon be developed. 
On August 6, 1996, the Minister of Industry and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage unveiled their so-called convergence policy.
<P>
	This policy set the stage for competition between telephone 
companies and cable distributors in their respective areas. This 
policy prompted the Minister of Industry to announce in a 
September 19 press release that, and I quote: ``The real winners are 
consumers, who will ultimately have a choice in who provides their 
services''. If I take the liberty of quoting this press release, it is 
precisely because we are still waiting to see the benefits for 
consumers.
<P>
	On the other hand, the Minister of Canadian Heritage said on 
August 6, in a news release, that they had ``decided, concerning 
Quebec Telephone and BC Tel, to change the foreign ownership 
rule so that these two big companies serving British Columbia and 
Eastern Quebec can take part in the competitive market of 
communications systems just like any other telephone company''. 
Hence, the Minister of Canadian Heritage agreed with the Bloc 
Quebecois, that wanted the government to safeguard the vested 
rights of these two companies.
<P>
	In fact, strictly speaking, Quebec Telephone and BC Tel are 
foreign owned companies. GTE, a U.S. company, has a 51 per cent 
stake in Quebec Telephone. We know, however, that Quebec 
Telephone is deemed to be a Quebec company because its 
headquarters are in Quebec, it is managed by Quebecers and French 
is the only working language of employees. It was becoming 
imperative, considering convergence, to adapt the rule to give more 
freedom to Quebec Telephone.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	It has been six months since the heritage minister made this 
statement on the changes to the orders regulating Quebec 
Telephone and BC Tel. During the first reading debate on this bill, 
my colleague, the member for Rimouski-Témiscouata said, and I 
quote: ``We are concerned that this bill was tabled without any 
order being made regarding Quebec Telephone and BC Tel''.
<P>
	My colleague from Rimouski-Témiscouata went on to say: 
``Madam Speaker, I ask you to remind the government that it would 
be greatly appreciated if the order was made before the final vote 
on this bill, so as to give equal treatment to all telephone 
companies.''
<P>
	Today, as the House is dealing with this bill to amend the Bell 
Canada Act, have the orders been made? No, they have not. So I 
took upon myself to check with a few people in the know at 
Industry and at Canadian Heritage and I was assured that the 
drafting of these orders would be completed in the very near future.
<P>
	We can only thank my colleague, the member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata, for her hard work in favour of the rights 
of Quebec Telephone and indeed of the people in Quebec who are 
serviced by this excellent company.
<P>
	I will now go back to the claims made by the industry minister, 
this unabashed advocate of unfettered competition. As I mentioned 
before, he said, and I will repeat it to show how wrong he is, that 
the real winners of convergence, or competition, will be the 
consumers.
<P>
	Let us look at the real consequences we have been seeing for 
some time now. The deregulation of telecommunications started 
about ten years ago, but the CRTC authorized competition in long 
distance services only in 1992. This measure put an end to a long 
standing tradition of monopoly in telecommunications. That 
decision was supposed to generate significant savings for the 
consumers. But what happened in fact?
<P>
	As shown in the report on long distance savings by the coalition 
for affordable telephone services, filed in February 1996, most 
residential subscribers of companies that are members of Stentor 
have enjoyed no substantial reduction in their long distance bills 
since the CRTC opened up the area to competition in 1992.
<P>
	Let us look at page 2 of the coalition's report; it reads as follows: 
``Last December, the members of the  Stentor group convinced the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7594"> 7594 </A></B>
<P>
federal government that they should be allowed to keep the 
increases and not have to reduce basic rates. If residential 
subscribers remain customers of Stentor for long distance services, 
they will pay no less than $700 million in 1996 and 1997, and over 
a ten-year period up to $4.5 billion'', an amount that would go to 
the telephone companies without giving the subscribers our 
honourable industry minister referred to the benefit of discounts on 
long distance calls they should have received according to all the 
promises we have heard. The Coalition concludes that this is unfair.
<P>
	The coalition goes on to say that long distance rates have gone 
down, but significantly so only in the case of wholesale users, 
mainly large corporations.
<P>
	Now about local telephone rates. In ruling 94-19, the CRTC 
announced that it would, among other things, authorize a 
rebalancing of rates between long distance and local services and 
would therefore allow three increases of $2 each in the monthly 
basic service rate over the next three years. In exchange, the 
telecommunications companies would commit to reducing the long 
distance bills of residential subscribers and small and medium size 
businesses by the same amount.
<P>
	However, Bell Canada and the seven other telecommunications 
companies that are members of the Stentor group objected to this 
restriction and filed a petition with the government asking that the 
restriction be withdrawn.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	Obviously, and unfortunately, the Minister of Industry 
responded favourably to the expectations of the Stentor Group by 
maintaining a portion of the increase in local service charges, i.e. 
$2 in 1996, $2 in 1997, with a $2 reassessment in 1998, while 
allowing long distance charges to continue to be dictated by 
so-called competition in the marketplace.
<P>
	Yet, public notice 95-49, tabled by the CRTC on November 22, 
1995, that is before the government's rejection of rulings 94-19 and 
95-21, states, among other things, that ``the CRTC feels local rate 
increases, over and above the ones that would result from the rate 
rebalancing referred to in ruling 95-21, raise concerns about the 
maintaining and affordability of local services''. The Minister of 
Industry does not seem to share these concerns, since his only 
policy is a belief in uncontrolled competition.
<P>
	Paradoxically, while consumers could look forward to an 
increase in local rates and no decrease in long distance rates, the 
president of Bell Canada told <I>Le Devoir</I> on December 21, 1995 that 
this government decision would not result in a reduction in costs or 
maintaining the same rates for consumers but in a 1 per cent 
increase in the yield on shareholders' assets for 1996.
<P>
	The Fédération nationale des associations de consommateurs du 
Québec, also known as FNACQ, said in the same article that 
Canadian households would have to pay more than one billion 
dollars over the next three years in increases in local rates so the 
telephone companies could make the desired profits.
<P>
	An analyst with FNACQ, Marie Vallée, added that the CRTC's 
original decision would have led to the first substantial decrease in 
low and medium volume long distance rates for residential users 
and small businesses. We now know that the exact opposite is 
happening.
<P>
	On September 6 last year, Bell made a new submission to the 
CRTC regarding residential services. This submission was in two 
parts. The first part concerned updating the telephone network for 
about 490,000 customers in Quebec and Ontario. The second part 
proposed compressing the rate scale from 19 levels to 11, which 
would result in an average increase of $1.11 for 850,000 Quebec 
households.
<P>
	This request by Bell Canada has just been approved by the 
CRTC. As regards the $2 increases already announced for 1996 and 
1997, it seems to me the government could be more attuned to 
customers' need for affordability, but it did nothing.
<P>
	Not only are Mr. and Mrs. ordinary consumer affected, business 
rates are affected as well. In the spring of 1996, Bell Canada 
submitted a proposal to the CRTC to harmonize the rates paid by 
business customers, in other words, another rate increase. 
According to Bell, business customers in small communities, that 
is customers in rural communities, will have to pay between $44 
and $54 for their lines, whereas businesses in major centres will 
pay between $39 and $44 only. The increase would take effect in 
July 1997.
<P>
	If we are trying to tell small business to move out of the rural 
community to the city, we could not put it better. What a poor 
message to be sending to an economy that wants nothing more than 
to get back on track.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	In its press release of September 11, the Canadian Federation of 
Independent Business indicated that the Bell Canada telephone 
company had justified its application by alleging that small 
businesses outside Montreal and Toronto were subsidized and, 
therefore, not paying their fair share of the real costs of such lines.
<P>
	However, Catherine Swift, president of that organization, 
responded that only a minority of businesses were getting such 
subsidies and that last August's rate increases had in fact 
eliminated these subsidies.
<P>
	As for the vice-president of the federation from Quebec, Pierre 
Cléroux, he said that small businesses are the biggest job creators, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7595"> 7595 </A></B>
<P>
that several of them had a precarious status, and that such an 
increase in telephone  rates would affect not only their 
performance, but could even threaten them in some cases.
<P>
	I would now like to tell the House and the public which costs will 
affect some ridings. I hope that the constituents who are watching 
us today will draw the obvious conclusion regarding the 
government's concern about protecting the rights of consumers as 
opposed to its eagerness to meet the endless, insatiable needs of 
large businesses.
<P>
	Let us talk about the riding of Sherbrooke. Bell Canada's 
application in the riding of the leader of the Conservative Party 
represents a 50.8 per cent increase for the city of Sherbrooke alone.
<P>
	In Laval West, the monthly fee for a business line will rise from 
$42.20 to $54.75, or a 21.1 per cent increase.
<P>
	In Brome-Missisquoi, rates will go up by 32.8 per cent in 
Clarenceville and 50 per cent in Magog. The people of Bedford, 
Bromont, Cowansville, Dunham, Farnham, Frelighsburg, 
Henryville and Sutton are looking at increases of between 60 and 
62.5 per cent.
<P>
	In Gatineau-La Lièvre, the increases will amount to 41.8 per 
cent in Thurso, 52.2 per cent in St-Pierre-de-Wakefield, and 50.3 
per cent in Buckingham; and in Gatineau, each line will cost $63.20 
per month instead of $38.75, a 63 per cent increase.
<P>
	In Hull-Aylmer, a riding represented by the minister 
responsible for the Outaouais, rates will increase by 41.3 per cent 
in Hull and 63.1 per cent in Aylmer.
<P>
	In Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, the municipality of Luskville 
will see the cost of business lines rise by 41.9 per cent, while 
Maniwaki and other municipalities in the area will be facing a 60.1 
per cent increase. Chelsea will be one of the hardest hit in Quebec, 
with business line rates rising from $38.75 to $68.80, or a 77.5 per 
cent increase.
<P>
	In Saint-Maurice, the venerable riding of Saint-Maurice, the 
people of Grand-Mère and Shawinigan are facing a 50 per cent 
increase.
<P>
	As you can see, small businesses outside the greater Montreal 
and Toronto areas will suffer losses amounting to $115 million per 
year if the CRTC approves Bell Canada's proposed rate increases 
for 1997.
<P>
	I regret to say that this government fails to realize that 
unhampered, unrestricted competition is not in the interest of 
consumers.
<P>
	We are anxiously waiting to see what the government will do 
once the CRTC renders its decision regarding Bell Canada's 
application to raise tariffs for business lines.
<P>
	As I pointed out earlier, the government claims that consumers 
and businesses will benefit from this competition. Unfortunately, 
the facts prove just the opposite.
<P>
	Instead of using their own money to invest in modernization, 
telecommunications companies pass most of the cost on to the 
consumers, this with the blessing of the industry minister, who 
seems to wash his hands of it. Worse yet, the poorest consumers 
and those living outside large urban centres are the hardest hit. The 
Minister of Industry can no longer afford not to be involved.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	While the re-balancing of tariffs is necessary in a competitive 
environment, the government should show leadership in order to 
alleviate the negative impact of thses actions by proposing stopgap 
measures for low income people and for small and medium size 
businesses in rural or semi-rural areas.
<P>
	There are elements of solutions. The Bloc Quebecois has already 
mentioned them to the government and it will do it again now. The 
Bloc Quebecois is very interested in solutions proposed by the 
federation of consumers' associations and by the National 
Anti-Poverty Organization.
<P>
	These groups propose to first set a monthly rate ceiling of $15 
for the basic service provided to households that have confirmed, 
through a self-certification process, as is done in California for 
example, that their income is below the poverty line. The whole 
process would be based on a universal telecommunications access 
fund. These moneys would come from a supplement charged to the 
ultimate user of telecommunications services. The providers of 
telecommunications services would be responsible for collecting 
these moneys and transferring them to the fund. In return, the fund 
would compensate companies providing the service to the poor.
<P>
	In the case of small and medium size businesses located in the 
regions, the purpose of the fund would be to ensure a sharing of 
access and maintenance costs, which are higher in the regions than 
in urban areas. The fund would be financed through a contribution 
paid by companies providing telecommunications services.
<P>
	Again, the government has yet to act upon the proposals made by 
these organizations. Convergence is here to stay, it is a 
technological fact we can no longer avoid. It is part of the 
government strategy concerning the information highway.
<P>
	As we indicated before, in the telecommunications area, the 
government's commitment to defend the interest of the consumers 
is too often swiftly dismissed in favour of the interest of 
telecommunication companies, and the government's record as 
regards the information highway is no exception to that rule.
<P>
	You have to understand that the federal strategy concerning the 
information highway seems to promote measures supporting 
telecommunications, such as personal communications services, 
local 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7596"> 7596 </A></B>
<P>
multipoint communications systems, multimedia services via  
satellites, direct broadcast satellites and broadcaster digitizing.
<P>
	On the other hand, the protection of personal information, 
copyright and privacy, and measures relating to offensive content, 
child pornography, production of francophone content, 
affordability, accessibility and universality of these services seem 
to be low on the priority list.
<P>
	The federal strategy with respect to the information highway is 
incomplete. It is being doled out bit by bit by the Minister of 
Industry, despite extensive, in-depth studies by various levels of 
government.
<P>
	Despite the CRTC report on competition and culture on Canada's 
information highway tabled a good year and a half ago, despite the 
final report by the information highway advisory council tabled 
over a year ago, despite the many departmental committees on 
which public servants toil away and without the benefit of a 
pre-study by a standing committee of the House of 
Commons-other than the Committee on Canadian Heritage that 
received evidence on more general issues-and despite the 
Minister of Industry's constant reminders of the need for urgent 
action, the minister has shown himself quite unable to define 
concrete and viable orientations for the more sensitive areas of the 
information highway.
<P>
	To get a hint of the minister's lack of insight, you only have to 
review the document he has just released. Everyone was expecting 
the federal government's action plan on the information highway. 
Instead, we got a report recapping the progress made on the 
information highway. The Minister of Industry told us this was a 
progress report on Canada's transition toward the information 
society and the government's response to the recommendations 
made by the Information Highway Advisory Council in September 
1995.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois reacted strongly to the tabling of this 
so-called strategy. Here are the main points that we condemned the 
report for at the time.
<P>
	While the report is a good analysis of the problem, it has nothing 
to do with the political intention of a thoughtful government that is 
saying it is urgent to move forward. The report denies the existence 
of the Quebec culture by making it an element of the multicultural 
diversity of Canada. The report covers all the technological aspects 
of the information highway, but leaves out the social aspects 
entirely.
<P>
	The report sanctions the hopes of the advisory committee on the 
information highway, which reflect a federal intrusion in provincial 
jurisdictions and which ultimately sanction new duplications of 
provincial programs. Finally, the report describes the majority of 
problems related to the information highway, but totally postpones 
dealing with the solutions to these problems.
<P>
	You will have understood that Bill C-57 in itself is a 
modernization of an act that had now to be modernized. But the 
government could not examine where this bill will lead the Quebec 
people and the Canadian people without checking at the same time 
the guidelines that are established to ensure that everything is in the 
best interests of the people. And the people are also the consumers. 
They work, for the most part, for small and medium size 
businesses.
<P>
	This is why I stressed the inconveniences currently experienced 
by individuals and by small corporations in the context of this 
convergence, this implementation of the information highway.
<P>
	We too support progress. Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois must 
support this bill. However, as I said, and I will say it again, the Bloc 
Quebecois does not support progress at any cost, progress at the 
expense of the most vulnerable ones, progress at the risk of killing 
our small and medium size businesses, particularly in rural areas.
<P>
	I would like to conclude by making three recommendations. We 
ask the Liberal government to exercise diligence to make sure that 
Québec-Téléphone and BC Tel get a satisfactory agreement so that 
they, like other telecommunications companies, have an 
opportunity to offer their services in the context of the convergence 
of telecommunications.
<P>
	Second, we ask the Liberal government to fulfil the commitment 
made in its red book, in the chapter on small and medium size 
businesses, to the effect that the federal government must 
contribute to the creation of a climate that promotes economic 
development. Once the CRTC renders its decision on rate increases 
for business lines, this government will show us whether it intends 
to fulfil its promise or to forget it like so many other ones.
<P>
	Third, we ask this government to stop the mad dash for the 
information highway, something that is less and less affordable to 
consumers, small and medium size businesses, and those who live 
in rural areas.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to enter the debate on Bill C-57. I want to register 
immediately that the Reform Party is in favour of this bill.
<P>
	At the time of rendering that support, however, I think it is 
essential for us to register that not only will we support the bill but 
at the same time we encourage the government to recognize that we 
are not deluded into thinking that somehow a suitable 
telecommunications policy has been developed for Canada. In fact, 
as I progress through the remarks that I wish to address to the 
House this afternoon it will become abundantly clear that the repeal 
of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7597"> 7597 </A></B>
<P>
section 7 of the Bell Canada Act is really nothing more than teeny 
weenie, itsy bitsy little bit  of a step moving forward but covering 
all the important parts that really should have been addressed but 
which are not being addressed by the telecommunications policy of 
the government.
<P>
	I hold in my hand a copy of the bill. It is probably the shortest 
bill I have ever seen. In fact the notes that explain what the bill does 
are many time longer than the actual words in the bill itself. I 
commend the government for its efficiency in writing this so 
succinctly. I wish all legislation was this succinct.
<P>
	However, we need to move on. The big argument that has been 
presented with regard to the repealing of section 7 in the Bell 
Canada Act is to give consumers a choice. While it is true that it 
will give them choice, it will for once bring about competition 
between the cable companies and the telephone companies in a 
common field so that they can now enter into each other's field. 
That is a good move.
<P>
	Let us now move into the broader field of communication 
technology of which this is but a part. I wish here to borrow rather 
extensively from Don Tapscott who wrote a book on the digital 
economy. That is probably closer to where we ought to be moving 
than anything we have heard in the paper supporting the converging 
technology or other aspects of telecommunications industry in 
Canada.
<P>
	The author writes that a decade ago cable and phone companies 
were seen as totally different businesses, but technology has now 
brought them into direct competition. This is because all 
information: audio, tech and video images can now be converted 
into digits or it can be digitized. It is the same commodity. That is 
little bytes of data that computers use. Depending on to whom you 
speak this is enabling the phone companies to encroach on the 
cable business and is enabling cable companies to poach on the 
phone business. In fact, in some locales the fight has already 
begun. The Videotron Cable Company in Britain is successfully 
offering local services. In Canada, BC Tel snared an exclusive 
contract with a developer in Vancouver's Concordia Pacific 
complex to provide all communication services, including cable, to 
a proposed housing development for 13,000 people.
<P>
	No matter who builds the highway, the backbone of the system 
will likely be fibre optic cable running underground from coast to 
coast. Some of that is already in place. These thin strands of glass 
use light pulses to convey 5,000 video channels or 500,000 phone 
conversations per fibre.
<P>
	That is just one small part. As we go on we will notice that while 
the fibre optic cables are important, there is something which is far 
more significant, probably far more dynamic and the change is 
revolutionary and that is the wireless communication system which 
exists with the direct broadcast satellites.
<P>
	To give a little precision to this highway analogy, the band width 
on which this information is transmitted, the road is shifting from a 
three foot garden patch which we have had until now to a highway 
16 miles wide. However, because that analogy is imperfect we need 
to move in a little different way. The issue is not just the width of 
the highway but also how highly and how tightly the traffic can be 
concentrated or screened on that road. The number of moving 
vehicles is the significant issue. Using compression technologies 
that squeeze more bytes through the pipeline, the capacity of the 
fibre is going up.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	Nicholas Negroponte points out that recent research results show 
we are close to being able to deliver gigabits per second. That 
means a fibre the size of a human hair can deliver every issue of the 
<I>Wall Street Journal</I>. I notice that the parliamentary secretary is 
grasping his hair because he notices that he cannot carry quite as 
much information as some of the rest of us. This means that a fibre 
the size of a human hair can deliver every issue of the Wall Street 
Journal in less than one second. It still means that the 
parliamentary secretary can carry quite a lot of information.
<P>
	Transmitting data at that speed, a fibre can deliver a million 
channels of television simultaneously; roughly 200,000 times 
faster than a twisted pair. I am talking of a single fibre so if you 
want more, you make more fibres. After all it is just sand.
<P>
	Telephone and cable are certainly not the only players in this 
game. There are also direct broadcast satellites as I mentioned 
earlier, cellular telephones as we witnessed just a moment ago, low 
orbit interactive satellites and even high altitude balloons to name 
but a few. Some electrical companies are assessing their possible 
role because they have extensive fibre optic systems in place to 
monitor their electrical grids. Technology is evolving so quickly 
that it would be rash today for any country to commit itself 
exclusively to just one or two of the systems. It is from that point of 
view that I call this an itsy bitsy little step. It is far from clear which 
technologies and strategies will ultimately be most effective in 
delivering content at the best possible price.
<P>
	In the end the total prize for suppliers will be in content, not 
carriage. At the moment all our long distance tolls are essentially 
measured in terms of the time you are on the line. As we move into 
a digital economy, and as the compression technologies advance, 
the issue will no longer become how much time you were on the 
line but how much information did you transmit. I suspect that 
could be another development.
<P>
	If that says anything about the way the CRTC operates one thing 
becomes abundantly clear: it is probably the greatest impediment 
of technological application that this country has witnessed. I think 
the sooner the CRTC gets out of the business of maintaining 
monopolies the better off we are all going to be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7598"> 7598 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to use a special illustration. Let us examine for a moment 
that the CEO of Alcoa wakes up one morning to find that Russia is 
now dumping aluminium on world markets at half the current 
price. The first major survey of Chinese people shows that the top 
priority for two-thirds of the country is to get rich through hard 
work, whereas only 4 per cent want to continue the revolution. 
Economist Lester Thurow asked his audience in a recent speech to 
U.S. business leaders: Who do you think has more high school 
graduates, the United States or China? If you guessed China-and 
in fact he has done this study-you are right by a couple of hundred 
million.
<P>
	Why should I hire a graduate from a U.S. high school at $30,000 
per year when I can get a person with equivalent education in China 
for $100 per month? Many U.S. businesses have already answered 
that question with a resounding: ``We don't''. Millions of so-called 
virtual aliens are clicking away on keyboards in Shanghai, New 
Delhi and Hong Kong fully networked and employed as members 
of the U.S. economy, except that they do not pay U.S. taxes or live 
in the United States. How are they doing it? Through the Internet.
<P>
	The bipolar world has become a multi-polar economy. In the 
1960s east Asia accounted for only 4 per cent of the world's 
economic output. Today that region accounts for 25 per cent. At the 
same time the GNP of the United States has been growing at a not 
bad 3 per cent annual rate, but the Pacific rim has seen rates that 
have been more than twice that high. Not so long ago Taiwan and 
South Korea were low cost countries. Now they find they have to 
ship to lower cost places like China. The economy for the age of 
network intelligence is a digital economy. In the old economy, 
information flow was physical: cash, cheques, invoices, bills of 
lading, reports, face to face meetings, analog telephone calls, radio 
and television transmissions, blueprints, maps, photographs, 
musical scores and direct mail advertisements. In the new economy 
information in all its forms becomes digital, reduced to bytes 
stored on computers and racing at the speed of light across 
networks. Using this binary code of computers, information and 
communications become digital ones and zeros. The new world of 
possibilities thereby created is as significant as the invention of 
language itself, the old paradigm on which all the physically based 
interactions occurred.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	To put this into the context of a child, ask this question: What is 
technology to a kid? One of the Apple people, Alan Kay, once said 
that technology is technology only for people who are born after it 
is invented. Twelve-year-old Niki Tapscott would agree. She is the 
daughter of Don Tapscott. When asked if she would participate in a 
consumer of the future panel at a technology conference she 
lectured her father: ``Okay, Dad. I will do it if you want me to, but I 
do not understand why you adults make such a big deal about  
technology. Kids use computers to do stuff. We do not think of 
them as technology. Like a fridge does stuff. It is not technology. 
When I go to the fridge I want food that is cold. I do not want to 
think about the technology that makes the food cold''.
<P>
	Lest we get the impression that this is only happening in Canada, 
a debate is raging and we are concerned about it. British television 
giants have joined forces in a digital revolution that was announced 
on February 1. The <I>Financial Post</I> reports the story on the BSkyB. 
If it is successful in winning the licences for the digitized 
communication, the shareholders have agreed to meet among them 
a peak funding requirement of up to 300 million and the company 
is expected to be profitable within five years.
<P>
	What will it do? It will offer an initial 15 channels, including 
subscription channels, from the British Broadcasting Corporation. 
This is the most exciting development in broadcasting, according 
to them, since the introduction of colour. We are on the brink of a 
revolution in entertainment, information and communications. We 
are not given the details, but we are told very clearly that the digital 
economy is upon us and we would do well to observe it.
<P>
	Shaw Cable, which is one of the companies involved in this 
convergence and is making some telephone offerings, received a 
licence last Friday. The licence is to provide direct to home satellite 
service for customers in Canada. This program would be allowed to 
launch using U.S. satellite space only on an emergency basis. 
Notice that none of the companies which has applied for direct to 
home television-and there are four of them now-has delivered 
any direct to home television programs because they have not been 
able to secure transponders on space satellites. They will have to 
migrate back to a Canadian satellite if space becomes available 
when another satellite is launched. However, they have been 
granted emergency access to a transponder on an American 
satellite.
<P>
	I want to speak on that area in a little more detail. There are 
examples of this happening in Britain. It is happening in Canada. It 
is happening all around the world. Let us go into the DTH business 
a bit.
<P>
	It is an alternative service to traditional cable. It is off air and 
large satellite dish television reception. It is an alternative. It 
differs in that the size of the dish is small. It is approximately 18 
inches in diameter. The signal is digital and the number of channels 
is much higher than on conventional cable. These small dishes and 
the accompanying satellites that transmit the signals were 
commonly referred to as death stars a couple of years ago. Today 
they are being recognized as a way to provide an alternative service 
that is less expensive than the other way around. The satellites are 
known as direct broadcast satellites or DBS.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7599"> 7599 </A></B>
<P>
	The Americans have a healthy DTH market, but in Canada there 
is as yet no operating service. We have licence providers, but none 
is currently delivering signals. This has created a service vacuum 
since Canadians want the service but have no legal means of 
obtaining it. The so-called grey market is the result. It contains 
approximately 250,000 Canadians and some estimate it at 300,000 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Canadians are obtaining the hardware, setting up a U.S. postal 
address either by themselves or through an intermediary and 
subscribing to service from a U.S. company. The equipment is 
generally legal. Receiving the U.S. signal is not. Equipment 
capable of receiving the U.S. signal today may not be able to 
receive a Canadian signal when one becomes available.
<P>
	We can see how important the whole telecommunications 
industry is. We need to recognize other areas that are not being 
dealt with. Canadian DTH providers would like to be broadcasting 
but there is currently no available satellite space.
<P>
	We have four licensed DTH providers in Canada. They are 
Expressvu of Mississauga, the Star Choice network of Lindsay and 
Power DirecTv of Toronto. Shaw Communications of Calgary is a 
fourth company and was just granted a licence, as I indicated a 
moment ago.
<P>
	The government continues to erect protectionist walls on culture 
and issues rather than letting Canadian programming compete on 
its own merits. I really want to underline this. The Americans 
refused to play ball vis-à-vis American joint ventures in our orbital 
slots unless they get concessions on culture, which in turn leaves 
our DTH providers out in the cold.
<P>
	The Canadian market is so small it brings into question the 
economic viability, if you will, of any company trying to launch a 
satellite service to serve this market alone without then being able 
to sell excess capacity to U.S. firms for use and service to the U.S. 
market.
<P>
	There are other examples. The local multi-point 
communications system which the hon. member from the Bloc 
referred to just a moment ago is an excellent service that is 
available. We can talk about the personal communications system. 
These are all virtual fibre systems. They are wireless. They use the 
digitization of information into these compact little bytes of 
information.
<P>
	We would do well to listen very carefully to what is happening 
and we need to be sure that we are ready to take advantage of these 
developments in technology.
<P>
	Canada is ahead of the Americans in the technology itself. The 
chief proponent and developer of the multi-communications 
system is WIC, Western International Communications. It is the 
main licencee for the technology in Canada and has pushed R and 
D to the  point where we are to see its introduction on a wide scale.
<P>
	Direct competition between LMCS licencees and resellers will 
take place in markets across the country and we will see that 
developing very soon.
<P>
	As these various ways of communicating come into existence 
and as they are appropriately licensed and may compete with one 
another, that will be a far more significant competition than the sort 
of competition that is being talked about by this amendment to Bill 
C-51, the Bell Canada bill.
<P>
	As far as the remaining spectrum goes, of the local multiple 
communications systems that have been allocated already, two of 
the remaining four frequency blocks are scheduled to go to auction 
in two years or so. The remainder will be disposed of by auction 
after that.
<P>
	I should note here that the first of the licences that were granted 
were granted on the basis of a licence fee and not auction. One 
would really question whether the best possible arrangement was 
made and whether the government realized the kind of revenue it 
could have realized had it gone to an auction system.
<P>
	We would have preferred something much more forward 
thinking where the competitive attitude being used in most aspects 
of this technology would be extended to all areas of the licensing 
process.
<P>
	I want to refer now to the Internet. The Internet is one of these 
very significant applications of the telecommunications system. 
The Internet enters into all of these discussions in one form or 
another. All of these take knowledge, from the direct broadcast 
satellite, the DTH, the LMCS, the local multiple communications 
or the personal communications all the way to Ma Bell, to which 
this bill refers, are capable of delivering Internet service. All of 
them are in varying capacities.
<P>
	Add the cable companies now and emerging services into the 
mix and it becomes clear that the Internet or more important, data 
transmission, is the one key driving factor in today's 
telecommunications marketplace. Currently the Internet is 
basically a glorified E-mail network. The worldwide web portion is 
in its infancy compared to what it has the potential to become. 
However, in order to reach that potential it must be free from 
government interference.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	The threat of regulation periodically raises its ugly head. Most 
recently the chair of the CRTC has threatened to regulate Internet 
in order to promote Canadian content. She has made comments 
with respect to requiring Internet service providers to obtain 
licences in order to operate their services. Licence fees would be 
applied toward a multimedia production fund according to her. 
Other threatened forms of regulation include  stringent anti-crime 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7600"> 7600 </A></B>
<P>
and intellectual property provisions, encryption technologies and 
others.
<P>
	Let me make it abundantly clear that it is absolutely essential we 
have privacy provisions so that individuals can have the assurance 
that information they put on the Internet if it is confidential and 
personal it indeed can remain that way. There have to be very 
stringent areas there. Something like that would be far more 
significant than bringing a bill forward that would release Ma Bell 
to be able to develop certain broadcast programs.
<P>
	The net has become accessible to the public and has become a 
medium for free speech. It has been entirely self-regulating in its 
policing. No one who has any reasonable knowledge of the net 
foresees any serious regulatory regime imposed by governments of 
any form as being either viable or successful. This is the danger of 
where we are running. The physical structure of the network as a 
method in which information is transmitted is essentially 
borderless. One would have to cut off a country's telephone system 
from the rest of the world in order to shut the Internet out and even 
that might not work.
<P>
	Therefore, we are on the brink of a very major concern, not only 
of individual Canadians and their privacy but rather that of 
government itself.
<P>
	In terms of policing the Internet, the most successful methods 
today have been a voluntary adoption of a code of conduct by 
providers themselves as well as blocking software for individuals 
and families. Ratings systems similar to those used in the movie 
industry are beginning to emerge. Microsoft and Netscape are 
among the biggest proponents of these initiatives. This gives 
parents in particular the power to block access to questionable 
material their children might be curious about.
<P>
	This becomes a very significant issue because this now puts the 
onus on the individual. It raises the question of what kind of 
orientation we would have toward life, what kind of orientation we 
would have to the values we hold and what are the kinds of things 
we would like to have influence our lives and particularly our 
children's lives so that they develop the kinds of attitudes and 
commitments to freedoms, to freedom of speech and to what is 
good and just in the way we think they should develop.
<P>
	The heritage department and its minister are major roadblocks to 
competition.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think we should underline this particular issue. It 
is not the individual or the government that are the intruders here 
but it is a commission of the government that is acting in an 
absolute position where it becomes the guardian and has been the 
guardian for years of a monopoly position in telecommunications.
<P>
	Industry Canada is wisely adopting an open standards approach 
to the introduction of new technology like  LMCS and PCS. 
Unfortunately the providers of these new services will require 
licences in order to start broadcasting and the CRTC will 
undoubtedly stick its nose in and disturb the competitive process.
<P>
	I would like to now refer to a recent conclusion that was drawn 
by one of our columnists in a national newspaper. It was Terence 
Corcoran who said on November 8, 1995: ``The Canadian 
Roadblock to Telecommunications Competition, CRTC, continues 
to stand athwart the Canadian information highway, causing much 
concern and mounting anxiety among its potential builders''. He 
goes on to explain exactly what has happened here. That is where 
the impediment lies. It is not in repealing sections like section 7 in 
the Bell Canada Act. Important as that is, it is only a very small 
beginning.
<P>
	In the final analysis, the Broadcasting Act and the 
Telecommunications Act as they are now constituted represent the 
biggest competitive barriers of all. The CRTC simply applies these 
acts in its deliberations on licences. That is not the only thing; it 
goes a little beyond that. Amalgamation of these two statutes is 
desperately needed in order to provide for a more expansive and 
competitive telecommunications market in Canada.
<P>
	To get to that point we must conclude that Canadian cultural 
protectionist arguments of the past no longer work. Witness the 
current battle pitting the international trade minister and the 
industry minister against the Deputy Prime Minister. We know that 
battle is an open one and the conflict is very vicious.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Our current market problems originate to a large degree with 
those people who consider themselves as cultural engineers at the 
heritage department and in the CRTC. Canadians can compete with 
anyone in the world. Our neighbour to the south may be large but it 
is no further ahead technically, so there is no reason for us to fear it 
on that score.
<P>
	The nationality of capital is irrelevant as long as we control how 
that capital is applied and what it does when it is applied. It is only 
the behaviour of capital that should be of concern to us and that is 
the concern we should address. The Canadian government retains 
the right to determine that behaviour and we must jealously guard 
that it is in the best interests of consumers where the application of 
that capital should go. We should be as businesslike, as efficient 
and as profitable as possible as we enter into each of these areas, 
not only into the convergence of telephone and cable companies, 
but into the wireless technologies which could get us all the way 
into direct to home television and so on.
<P>
	It has been a teeny-weeny, itsy-bitsy little movement here now. 
It is a good one but we need to go much farther. I encourage the 
government to move quickly and with dispatch into those areas that 
will bring us the  control we need so we can become true 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7601"> 7601 </A></B>
<P>
competitors not only in the communications field but in all of the 
manufacturing and other services Canadians can provide.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly 
could never be as eloquent and as knowledgeable as the previous 
speaker, my colleague from the Okanagan, who has gone on at 
great length about the technicalities and the intricacies of this new 
technological world we live in.
<P>
	I caught his point that technology is only applied to the new stuff 
that arrives. This is not new technology to young kids; this is how 
the world works. They have never seen a different world than the 
one we are in today. It is truly amazing to see how they have 
embraced the new technology as we call it, this electronic world, 
this wired world we are in.
<P>
	We of the older generation have a hard time catching up and 
keeping up with the young folks. At the same time this government 
has a hard time keeping up with the changing world we live in. The 
changing world is a competitive world which is the thing this 
government still has not come to terms with.
<P>
	Competition provides the best check and balance to any service. 
Competition in the private sector ensures that it does not matter 
what product or service you are selling, it ensures that you have the 
best quality and the best service at the best price. If you cannot do 
that, somebody else will come along, steal your market and you are 
gone.
<P>
	However, the government is hanging on to the CRTC, the 
regulatory body that looks back to the rules that were created back 
in the seventies and says that the market has to be apportioned to 
this player, that player and the next player. It is not just the CRTC; 
we have seen it in so many other industries.
<P>
	The opportunities of competition must be allowed. Bill C-57 is a 
small first step, and I emphasize small. What does Bill C-57 say in 
its entirety? It says that section 7 of the Bell Canada Act is 
repealed. That is it. That is the entire bill. One short simple 
sentence is the entire bill. Therefore, allow me to say that this a 
very very small step forward. However, we have to congratulate the 
government in that it is allowing a little bit of competition for Bell 
to enter into the competitive world. Surely it could have done a lot 
more thinking and had a lot more initiative to allow the electronic 
industry to get into the competitive world.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	An example is telephone company in the province of Alberta, 
AGT, Alberta Government Telephones. It was owned by the 
Government of Alberta, regulated by the Government of Alberta. It 
had a monopoly. It was told how much it was allowed to charge. Of 
course, because it was a monopoly it was strictly on a cost-plus 
basis: this is how much it cost to operate the service, this is how 
much  profit it made; divide that by the amount of subscribers 
which equalled the charges it would collect. That was the regulated 
system.
<P>
	A few years ago Alberta Government Telephones when it was a 
department of the government had over 12,000 employees. Today 
we have competition in Alberta and AGT is providing better 
service today with half the number of employees. I wonder what 
happened to the other 6,000 whose jobs are no longer relevant 
because AGT now has to live in a competitive world.
<P>
	Prices have come down dramatically. I mentioned service. 
Several years ago AGT sent a bill every month. If it was not paid, 
the service was cut off. That is simple. It was regulated and had a 
legal right to do that.
<P>
	Last week I got a telephone call from AGT's successor, Telus. 
They phoned me not to say that my bill was overdue but to say: 
``Let me tell you about our latest offering on how we can save you 
money on your telephone bill. If you subscribe to this particular 
package of services, we feel that we can reduce your bill by about 
35 per cent every month. The cost of overseas calls is going to drop 
dramatically. It does not matter what time of the day or night or 
what day of the week you call because the prices are coming 
down''. Whereas before when it was regulated if someone wanted 
to call during business hours, nine to five Monday to Friday, they 
charged an arm and a leg. No sales, no discounts, nothing for high 
volume, nothing for customer service, nothing to respect the 
consumer, nothing to respect the person who is paying their 
salaries. The government allowed them to squeeze it out of the 
consumer.
<P>
	Now when there is competition, they are phoning me to offer me 
a better deal because they know the competition may contact me 
and do something even better, so they have to be on their toes. I 
now have a choice. Choice is what ensures that we get value for our 
money.
<P>
	Think of the airline industry some years ago when the airline 
industry was deregulated in the United States. It was said that the 
planes were going to fall out of the sky, prices were going to go sky 
high, and the airlines were going to gouge the consumer because 
with deregulation they could charge what they wanted. But prices 
dropped like a stone. And I am glad to say that last night I was 
reading the <I>Economist</I> on the airplane. There was an article on 
airline safety which said that safety has not been jeopardized in any 
way, shape or form because airlines have been deregulated.
<P>
	We have the best of both worlds. Safety has not been 
compromised. Prices have come down dramatically. Service has 
been improved. The consumer gets a better deal because the 
government gets out of his hair.
<P>
	That again is repeated all through many industries. We just saw 
the softwood lumber deal the Minister for International Trade 
struck with the United States. Now  we are into the regulation of 
softwood lumber. Now every mill has its quota and can ship 
according to last year's shipments. They cannot go out there and 
say: ``Boy, I can reduce my prices. I can do this more efficiently. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7602"> 7602 </A></B>
<P>
can do a better job than my competitor. I can get some market 
share''. No. Government regulations say they can ship what they 
shipped last year but they cannot ship any more. There is no 
incentive for competitive efficiencies.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	As we enter into the technological world where competition 
worldwide is beating down our door, we must be able to respond 
with high tech research development and be the leader in the world. 
That is why I find that the responsibility of this government in the 
last few years we have been here is absolutely appalling.
<P>
	A few weeks ago we had the mini series on television about the 
Avro Arrow and how in 1957 Canada was at the forefront of 
aeronautical technology.
<P>
	We were at the forefront and the Prime Minister of the day said 
enough of that, we do not want to lead the world, and we scrapped 
the Avro Arrow.
<P>
	The previous government had signed a $5 billion program to buy 
helicopters. Yes, I know it was expensive, but it was going to put 
Canada at the front of research and development, at the front of the 
technology frontier on helicopters in the world. Through that $5 
billion investment we were going to be competitive in the high tech 
industries in the world. Then along came the Liberal government 
which said ``enough of that, we would not want to have that''. So 
we scrapped the $5 billion program at a cost of $700 million. We 
are going to get nothing for our $700 million other than some 
cancelled contracts; no research and development, no leading edge 
technology. Now we are buying some helicopters from abroad so 
that we lag behind rather than lead the rest of the world. This is a 
shameful record indeed.
<P>
	The point I am trying to make is that government has to be 
accountable. Government has to set the playing field. A 
government must allow competitive forces to play the game 
otherwise we will never, ever be able to compete in this world. I 
can assure members that if we are to maintain our prosperity in this 
country, if we are to maintain our standard of living in this country 
we have to be at the leading of technological innovation.
<P>
	When we look at the developing world it is learning very fast 
how to build build products on production lines and to send imports 
into this country that are cheaper and better in many cases than 
what we can produce. However, we have the advantage of 
education and if we use that advantage of education to develop our 
technology, to develop our research, to ensure we are at the 
forefront, we will have something to sell around the world. We will 
have something which will provide high paying jobs. We will have 
something which will give  people exciting and challenging careers 
for the rest of their lives.
<P>
	Those are the types of opportunities that we should be out there 
selling rather than an infrastructure program of jobs, jobs, jobs that 
failed miserably the last time around. These types of opportunities 
should be grasped, not just with a simple one line bill that states 
that Bell Canada can now compete in the television industry as well 
as the telephone industry.
<P>
	I urge the government to take note that time is rapidly passing it 
by. The door of opportunity is closing fast. If we are to stay ahead 
of the world, to lead the world and maintain our standard of living, 
the high tech industry is something that we must embrace and we 
can embrace it only through competitive advantage. If we think 
that some bureaucratic regulator has the key and the knowledge in 
order to keep Canada at the forefront, this government is wrong. 
That is why we need to open the doors to more and more 
competition.

DISCIPLINARY MEASURES) ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from November 5, 1996 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary 
measures in relation to members of certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain federal agencies and to 
make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Sarkis Assadourian (Don Valley North, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to welcome everyone back to the House 
in the new year. I would also like to mention the fact that this 
month is a holy month for Canadians of the Muslim faith. It is 
called Ramadan.
<P>
	This is also my first intervention as a Liberal candidate for the 
new riding of Brampton Centre. I wish people in  Brampton Centre, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7603"> 7603 </A></B>
<P>
my new riding, all the best. I hope I will be given the chance to 
represent them after the next election, which I hope will be held 
sometime this year or next. Whenever it comes, we will be ready.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to rise in the House to speak to Bill 
C-49, the administrative tribunals act. The bill will result in the 
elimination of some 271 governor in council positions and annual 
savings to the taxpayers of some $2.5 million.
<P>
	This is the second bill to introduce changes resulting from the 
agency review. The agency review, as a whole, will result in the 
elimination of over 800 governor in council appointments.
<P>
	The changes that Bill C-49 proposes continue the efforts of the 
government to reduce the deficit by eliminating duplication and by 
ensuring standardization of service and accountability to 
Canadians. These are the hallmarks of this government.
<P>
	By approaching the business of governing with a business like 
approach the government is ensuring that Canadian taxpayers are 
getting the best use of their tax dollars. The savings outlined in this 
bill reflect the commitment of the government to provide services 
in a manageable and affordable manner.
<P>
	Bill C-49 should receive the support of all parties in the House. 
The Bloc Quebecois should support the bill because it will reduce 
duplication. The Reform Party should support the bill not only 
because it will reduce duplication but because it will lead to a 
reduction in government expenditures which will result in a saving 
to the taxpayers in every region of the country. All other parties 
should support the bill because in the end it will mean savings to all 
taxpayers and a more efficient system for the delivery of 
government services.
<P>
	I urge my fellow members in the House to support the passage of 
Bill C-49. I hope Reform members will stop interpreting the 
speeches of members of Parliament, discuss the issues sincerely 
and support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak to this bill on the remedial measures in 
relation to administrative tribunals. It makes us realize that the 
government missed a great opportunity to transform the 
administrative tribunals and ensure their impartiality.
<P>
	For several years now, whenever decisions have been made, we 
have realized that maybe people were appointed members of 
administrative tribunals without having the required qualifications, 
that maybe they were appointed because of their political 
affiliation, because of their party background during the years 
preceding their appointment. With this bill, the government had the 
opportunity to rectify some important aspects of the  administrative 
tribunals, to clarify the situation and to ensure the independence of 
members of these tribunals.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	At first, one might think that administrative tribunals is a rather 
uninteresting subject, but when one considers which tribunals are 
involved and what they deal with, one realizes how important these 
tribunals are. For example, let us take the agricultural products 
review board, the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the 
Competition Tribunal, the Canadian Radio-Television and 
Telecommunications Commission.
<P>
	Speaking of the CRTC, let us not forget the controversial 
decisions taken last year, which raised questions about the 
connections between the government and the companies who were 
presenting projects, about how they were able to influence the 
government, to lobby. This example alone should suffice to show 
that with this bill the government has missed an opportunity to get 
rid of patronage appointments and restore the independence of 
these tribunals.
<P>
	The measures provided for by the President of the Treasury 
Board are of two kinds. First, they increase political influence on 
the removal for cause of members of these tribunals, the so called 
disciplinary measures. It will work this way: The chairperson of a 
tribunal will request an investigation and make a recommendation 
to the minister, who will study it at leisure. Nothing in the act 
compels the minister to go along with the recommendation if 
certain criteria are met.
<P>
	There is no such condition, even if there were a recommendation 
by the chairperson of a tribunal saying that an individual is in a 
difficult situation because he or she has become incapacitated or 
has acted dishonourably or irresponsibly, or because his or her 
responsibilities and other activities were incompatible. Even if 
such a recommendation were made by the chairperson of a tribunal 
to the minister, the minister is free to decide whether to act on it or 
not.
<P>
	In that sense, the government did not live up to its 
responsibilities because it did not specify what criteria the minister 
must use in approving recommendations made by the committees.
<P>
	So, there seems to be some illusion in this, a little smoke screen 
to hide the facts, which are that the government still has, and has 
even increased its political control over the appointment and career 
path of members of administrative tribunals. In that sense, the 
government goes directly against the recommendations made by 
senior officials in the administrative process.
<P>
	For example, on July 8, 1995, the president of the Quebec Bar 
Association was very clear in that regard when she stated that ``the 
lack of job security may have an unexpected psychological impact 
on the decisions of a person who may be more concerned about 
pleasing the government than about rendering a fair judgment''. 
This  quote is taken from <I>Le Soleil</I> of July 8, 1995. It is very easy to 
read between the lines how the government will continue to use 
disciplinary measures against members of administrative tribunals 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7604"> 7604 </A></B>
<P>
or how it will appoint the presidents of these administrative 
tribunals. The government has included in the legislation an 
important subtlety: from now on, tribunal presidents will be 
designated rather than appointed. Therefore, under political 
pressure, they could be removed at any time by the government. 
This clearly is an attack on the independence and impartiality of 
these tribunals.
<P>
	In our system, it is also important that decisions be fair and 
appear to be fair so that it can be demonstrated that they were made 
in a climate and in conditions that are both desirable and 
acceptable.
<P>
	When we look at the list, we see that there are all kinds of 
administrative tribunals. Some, such as the Veterans Review and 
Appeal Board, will make decisions affecting individuals who are in 
difficult situations and who do not always have the ability to defend 
themselves easily. If those having to make these kinds of decisions 
cannot act independently of the political power and of the people 
who appointed them, their decisions may be influenced by policies 
and political pressures.
<P>
	I think we have seen in the Canadian federation that the more our 
judicial system is independent of the political power, the better it 
can play its role and lead to satisfactory results and decisions.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	This decision will also have an impact on the future. When we 
speak of the Competition Tribunal or of the Canadian International 
Trade Tribunal, it will be crucial to appoint people with 
unquestionable qualifications, and to avoid all political 
interference through the appointment of people who get these 
positions as a reward for their involvement in party politics and not 
because of their qualifications.
<P>
	We have seen the consequences of this in the past. Decisions of 
bodies such as the Canadian International Trade Tribunal and the 
Competition Tribunal will have a great impact on the future.
<P>
	Let us take example of the Canadian International Trade 
Tribunal. Let us say that a person is appointed to the tribunal and 
that, after two or three decisions, it is realized that the person has 
the tendency to make decisions that are protectionist in favour of 
Canada, while the government is a proponent of free trade. A 
recommendation could be made to the president of the tribunal to 
the effect that the person has failed in his or her duty, that he or she 
did not seem to be completely independent.
<P>
	A recommendation could be made to the minister who would be 
able to decide according to his government's policy and not only to 
the relevance of having someone who is competent, who can make 
honest and impartial  decisions and who will prove to be competent 
in the future. A minister may well be tempted for short term 
considerations to choose someone who think just like him, who 
will interpret the laws just like he does.
<P>
	The role of members of administrative tribunals is not to please 
the government, but to make decisions according to the spirit of the 
law and giving satisfaction to the parties involved. Whether they 
win or loose, they must be told that the decision was based on the 
legislation and is not the result of some secret negotiations or 
political pressure, which would be unacceptable.
<P>
	The Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety 
Board is another example of affected organizations. Transportation 
is an area where people need clear, apparent and impartial justice. 
The proposed changes will not allow that. These changes will 
rather have the effect of increasing political interference in these 
appointments and in the disciplinary measures that can be taken 
against members of administrative tribunals.
<P>
	This is particularly true of the second aspect where the 
government is proposing to designate the chairpersons instead of 
appointing them. The chairperson of an administrative tribunal is 
somewhat like the director general of a tribunal. He or she is the 
person who can most influence the actions of these tribunals. If the 
chairperson is always worried that his or her decisions could 
irritate the government, he or she will be in a situation where he or 
she will tend to make decisions that will please the government, but 
which, in the long run, will tarnish the reputation of the 
administrative tribunal.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I move, seconded by the member for 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, the following amendment:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word ``That'' and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-49, An Act to authorize remedial and disciplinary measures in relation to 
members of certain administrative tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain 
federal agencies and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, be not now 
read a second time but that it be read a second time this day six months hence.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This will give the parliamentary committee a chance to do its 
homework so that the government can give us a bill that will be 
more in line with what is needed to ensure the effectiveness of our 
administrative tribunals.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
whole aspect of tribunals, administrative tribunals or quasi-judicial 
bodies, has been the subject of much debate in this House. If one 
looks to the very near past, one such debate centred around the 
Immigration and Refugee Board.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7605"> 7605 </A></B>
<P>
	A fundamental question has to be asked about the existence of 
these boards. What they really seem to do is take accountability 
away from the minister and the department that have these 
particular types of board.
<P>
	I know, Mr. Speaker, you were sitting on the other side of the 
House here and often this debate would rage around the 
Immigration and Refugee Board and the abuses that took place. 
Many of the people who were appointed were, to put it mildly, 
Liberal supporters of the party. They were dumped in there because 
somebody owed them a favour. That was and still is, I might point 
out, the whole essence of the Immigration and Refugee Board. It is 
an entity that should not even exist as far as I am concerned.
<P>
	However, a fundamental question must be asked regarding the 
establishment of these administrative tribunals. What is the real 
purpose of each board and why does it exist?
<P>
	I have spoken often in the House and asked several questions of 
ministers. In particular I will reflect on the former immigration 
minister since I was a critic at that time, and put questions on 
accountability to him. What would his reply be? His reply was 
consistently the same. ``I am sorry but that quasi-judicial body out 
there was put into place for a good reason,'' he said. That good 
reason, according to the minister, was that he did not have to make 
the decisions any more. It was just an entity in which he had no say 
or could make no statement on how an outcome or decision was to 
be made.
<P>
	We have seen the decisions that the board has made. Who are the 
board members? For the most part they are Liberal and 
Conservative friends. They are owed a favour and are stuffed into 
this highly paid job. The job pays $86,400 a year. That is $20,000 
more than parliamentarians make on their basic salary. There is 
something wrong with the system when that form of patronage 
exists.
<P>
	The decisions and results of the board impact not only on the 
taxpayer who has to pay the bill but on the whole immigration 
process. It brings the whole matter into disrepute. In fact, the 
decisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board bring the 
immigration policy and process into disrepute.
<P>
	I will digress from the Immigration and Refugee Board, and 
address something in this bill. This bill is supposed to be a 
wonderful, cost saving effort on the part of the government to deal 
with the patronage issue. However, I do not see it that way at all, 
not when we look at the availability of the number of appointments 
that can be made. There are 2,225 available positions to put friends 
into. Both past Liberal and Conservative governments and again 
today the present Liberal government have been packing that 
particular board again with a bunch of friends.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Reed:</B> What are friends for?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> What are friends for, one of my colleagues across 
the way asks. I guess that is the attitude over there. It shows itself to 
be that, given the fact that they are all Liberals. Most of them do 
not really seem to have any other qualifications.
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	Eighteen hundred appointments have been made into these 
quasi-judicial bodies by the present government. That is out of 
2,225. The bill states that 271 jobs will be eliminated. Wow. Out of 
2,225 appointments 271 jobs will be eliminated.
<P>
	Let us look at the facts. Those 271 jobs were not there anyway. 
They were vacant positions for the most part. In some cases some 
of these boards will no longer exist. The fact still remains that too 
many of these appointments take away accountability from the 
minister.
<P>
	Let us get back to the former minister of immigration. The new 
minister does not say anything really different. I have heard that 
minister say very similar things when asked about a decision the 
board has made. ``It is out of my hands'' the minister will say. 
Whose hands is it in? Is some non-elected entity making decisions 
that impact on the taxpayers and in some cases their safety, if we 
want to reflect to the National Parole Board? That is happening.
<P>
	Decisions are being made by quasi-judicial bodies because 
ministers no longer are accountable for those decisions, they say. 
Let us look behind the scenes now of both the Immigration and 
Refugee Board and the parole board.
<P>
	A whole industry feeds off these two boards. The parole board 
costs $25,163,000 to run. That is just the surface cost. The National 
Parole Board is not quite as expensive but certainly comes close. It 
is in the neighbourhood of $70 to $80 million to run each year.
<P>
	There is the decision process that is impacting on people. Look 
at the uproar. When Reform first came into the House in 1994 we 
attacked the parole board because of the decisions that were being 
made. People were dying as a result of that quasi-judicial body, an 
unelected group of people who had no concern really for what was 
happening in the community.
<P>
	It is only due to the pressure of the Reform Party that anything 
was changed. Even then the changes were superficial. The 
Immigration and Refugee Board has been ripped right out of the 
hands of the public. They have no say on how decisions are being 
made and no one to really go to and say to the minister: ``You made 
a bad decision there''. He says he is not accountable any more.
<P>
	As a result, there is a great rage that sort of turns around and 
around in the public's mind about both the parole board and the 
refugee board operate. They are not doing their job. The refugee 
board is taking good positions away from individuals who would 
rather  immigrate here and try to go through the process in a legal 
way as opposed to ones that the refugee board allows. For the most 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7606"> 7606 </A></B>
<P>
part, those positions are being filled in an illegal way: people 
coming here and claiming status knowing full well that they are not 
legitimate claimants.
<P>
	In conclusion, if we are to gain any respect or consideration back 
in Parliament regarding both the parole board and the Immigration 
and Refugee Board, we could well look at scrapping both of those 
boards. Their duties should be put closer to the people, the 
immigration department for the Immigration and Refugee Board 
and in merit release committees that will deal with parole issues 
because they would be a lot closer to the community.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to add my voice to that of my colleague, the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, in vigorously condemning the 
intentions of the Liberal Party now ruling Canada in the spirit of 
Bill C-49. The act to authorize remedial and disciplinary measures 
in relation to members of certain administrative tribunals, as 
written, is very worrisome.
<P>
	Now that Parliament has reconvened, the constructive criticism 
of the official opposition will again, I hope, bring home to the 
public the lack of originality that has characterized the Liberal 
government since its election in October 1993.
<P>
	Bill C-49, like most of the bills put forward by the government, 
shows once again the lack of rigour and transparency that are 
becoming the trademark of the Liberal Party of Canada. Not only is 
the government once again getting ready to back the most flagrant 
cases of patronage, but it will also be giving itself the means to 
override the application of justice in administrative tribunals.
<P>
	What we see in Bill C-49 is simply scandalous. The government, 
through the President of the Treasury Board and Minister 
responsible for Infrastructure, will be supporting the contravention 
of the most sacred of the principles underlying our political system 
by interfering with the notion of the independence of the judiciary 
with respect to other organs of government.
<P>
	We have already seen the Liberals' arrogance and their lack of 
regard for the precepts of our parliamentary system, but the tabling 
of Bill C-49 is beyond all understanding and shows the 
government's unbelievable contempt for the public it is supposed 
to be serving.
<P>
	During the holidays, we did a lot of visiting back and forth 
between friends and family. As my uncle said: ``We are going to 
take advantage of the fact that the member for Frontenac is here''. 
One of my nephews, a student at Laval University, told me how he 
had read in a  magazine last month about a survey of the public's 
level of confidence in 28 liberal and professional or 
semi-professional occupations.
<P>
	They were physicians, lawyers, engineers, teachers, new car 
salesmen, used car salesmen, architects, businessmen, retailers, 
farmers, and of course politicians. Do you know that in the poll on 
how much our fellow citizens trust us, we came second last? We 
got 4 per cent, just ahead of used car salesmen.
<P>
	When we look at what the government has been doing for the 
past three years, I believe that the Prime Minister himself and his 
cabinet have greatly contributed to the lack of trust in politicians.
<P>
	We only have to think about the Airbus fiasco. The government 
tried to sue the former Prime Minister and had to apologize 14 or 
15 months later. A first for a government. On top of it all, we are 
paying the court fees. If you add up Mr. Mulroney's legal fees and 
the government's expenses, the total bill will be well in excess of 
$5 million.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Was this a case of political vindictiveness? The question was 
asked today. Who in the cabinet is responsible for this nasty piece 
of work which is further discrediting this country's politicians?
<P>
	We only have to think about the appointment of Quebec's 
lieutenant governor who had to resign a few months later. Another 
ill conceived appointment by this government. Every time the 
government makes a new Senate appointment, my office receives 
hundreds of letters and telephone calls in protest.
<P>
	Since the Senate cannot be abolished without their unanimous 
consent, people would like no new senators to be appointed and, in 
time, as the population is aging, there would no be no senator left 
and the government would not be any worse off for it.
<P>
	And then, there is the Prime Minister's fumbling over the past 
few years on the issue of the GST and his infamous red book. He 
said: ``I never said that. You did not understand. You read it 
wrong''. They showed him the video tape, they played it back, but 
he said: ``This is not what I meant. You are thick, you never 
understand anything I say''.
<P>
	And yet, his deputy prime minister had the courage to resign last 
spring because she had promised she would if the GST was not 
scrapped within one year. It took some prodding, of course, but she 
eventually resigned, and getting her re-elected after her mock 
resignation has cost the Canadian treasury $500,000.
<P>
	With her quizzes, her famous CIO, the Canada Information 
Office, and her flag program, the Deputy Prime Minister has done 
much that explains MPs' drop in popularity in the polls.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7607"> 7607 </A></B>
<P>
	Luckily, Mr. Speaker, that is not your kind of politics and you 
have always acted in such a way as to maintain the public's respect 
for political figures. I wish this government would mend its ways.
<P>
	Bill C-49 before us this afternoon is a disgrace. It is outrageous 
for the government to be allowed to remove people designated to 
sit on a decision-making board or tribunal. They will appoint 
yes-men and women and tell them what to do and what to say, like 
puppets. ``Yes, that is right. Yes, 5 per cent. No, say 4.9 per cent 
instead''.
<P>
	This borders on indecency. When a democratic government has 
reached this point, there is cause for serious concern and one might 
wish it would disappear from the political scene.
<P>
	On two occasions, Canadian voters elected a party that brought 
disgrace upon this country. Only two members of this party were 
re-elected. There is no doubt that the Liberal Party should pay for 
misleading the public with false promises about the GST. And then 
there was the infamous Airbus affair, an unprecedented occurrence 
in the annals of politics.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	According to historians, never before in Canadian history had 
the federal government brought biased, unfounded action against a 
former Prime Minister and so soon after the fact. Proceedings were 
instituted at the beginning of 1996 while the alleged wrongdoing 
took place in 1992. That was a first.
<P>
	I think we must join with the hon. member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup in wishing that this bill be hoisted 
for at least six months. In the meantime, let us hope that the 
government will call an election or review Bill C-49.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
happy to have the opportunity today to speak to Bill C-49. It is the 
administrative tribunals act but it should be known as the bill which 
attempts to deal with patronage appointments to administrative 
tribunals.
<P>
	It is important that we set the stage for this debate by looking at 
the Liberal government's red book promise on how it intended to 
deal with this area. On page 92 of the red book it is stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will take a series of initiatives to restore confidence in the 
institutions of government-and make competence and diversity the criteria for 
federal appointments. Open government will be the watchword of the Liberal 
program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	If Bill C-49 is one step in a series of initiatives designed to 
address the patronage problem, I suggest it is very much a baby 
step. If this is the best the government can do to address the policy 
expressed in the red book, it should be withdrawn and the 
government should start over again. This legislation is simply 
another type of  window dressing which we see so often in this 
Parliament. It tends to mislead Canadians into thinking that 
something is being done when in fact very little is happening.
<P>
	Let us examine the bill for a moment. It still leaves over 2,000 
patronage appointments which can be dealt with by order in 
council. In fact the government has a special patronage 
appointment office in the PMO which deals with these 
appointments. It does not deal with the accountability factor. It 
reminds me very much of the old administration to which my 
colleague referred a moment ago, which was the Conservative 
government of the last Parliament. It was in office for nine years 
and patronage became very much a way of life, much as it has been 
for a century in this country.
<P>
	It reminds me of the story of an MP who represented a riding in 
western Canada. He was a Conservative member in opposition for 
four years and then in 1984 he became a government member. One 
of the local companies in his riding suggested that maybe they 
could get some of the government's legal work through farm credit 
and that type of organization. This fellow said: ``Oh, no, we would 
never do that. We are going to be squeaky clean''. About two weeks 
after the government took power he took one of the law firm 
partners out for lunch and said: ``Boy, was I naive. What do you 
want?'' That was it and the gates were open to patronage 
appointments. We heard what Brian Mulroney said about that in the 
last Parliament and we are hearing it all over again this time 
around.
<P>
	What happened to the process? What happened to the ideal in 
this country that jobs are awarded on the basis of competence and 
ability? What is wrong with that kind of process? Nothing at all. It 
happens in business all the time. It is a very admirable quality that 
we should try to achieve in the House of Commons.
<P>
	What happened to the openness of process that was promised on 
page 92 of the red book? ``Open government will be the watchword 
of the Liberal program''. We have not seen much of that happening. 
What about competition for these jobs? What about fairness of 
process? It simply is not happening.
<P>
	During the three years that I have been here I have certainly had 
my eyes opened as to how the system really works. Let us examine 
what has happened in the last three years.
<P>
	A very competent minister of the government, the former 
Minister for International Trade, Roy MacLaren, was talked out of 
running again. They asked him to step aside so a byelection could 
be held. It is my understanding Mr. MacLaren was not very happy 
about that, but then he learned there was a little reward at the end of 
the line for him. He could become the British high commissioner. 
Of course we already had a British high commissioner whose term 
was not up until July, and this was in January. Poor Roy needed 
some interim job to  tide him over and he was able to get a tidy 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7608"> 7608 </A></B>
<P>
little contract with the Department of Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade just to get him by.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	It seemed that it was the foreign affairs area which really got 
rewarded that time around. André Ouellet, the former Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, one of our colleagues in this House the last time 
around, was talked out of running again to allow one of those bright 
stars to come in from Quebec. We are not sure how brightly shining 
they are right now but that was the idea at least. Mr. Ouellet was 
talked into stepping aside. Of course there was a little reward for 
him at the end of the tunnel too: chairman of Canada Post 
Corporation, which happens to pay $308,000 a year. That seemed 
like a fairly good amount. There was more.
<P>
	Some of our other colleagues on that side of the House also got 
their rewards. They were asked to step aside and take appointments 
to the Senate, the great Senate, the heaven of patronage-haven, 
heaven. Jean-Robert Gauthier and former Acting Speaker Shirley 
Maheu got their rewards. I often tell my constituents that being 
appointed to the Senate is the only time someone can get to heaven 
without actually dying. That is what happens here. That is the kind 
of reward we see in this country.
<P>
	With that kind of example being set, it is common knowledge 
that candidates from the Liberals and Tories when they are in 
power, candidates who may not make it into the House of 
Commons are also rewarded. They get appointed to the Canadian 
Grain Commission and every other job we can possibly think of.
<P>
	It is no wonder Canadians are cynical about the process. We 
simply must get back to a process of accountability with people 
who actually have the competence to take these jobs based on past 
performance in other areas of life. They should not automatically 
go to people who were former members of Parliament, or people in 
power, or political candidates. There are a lot of competent people 
out there who would like a shot at being involved with these 
judicial boards.
<P>
	There should be a fair and open process that addresses this issue. 
We simply do not have it now. This bill should be defeated. It 
should be scrapped. If the government cannot come up with 
anything better than this, I suggest it should face the Canadian 
public at election time. Quit tinkering. Bring something 
substantive forward or do not bring forward anything at all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to draw the attention of the House to the parallel between Bill 
C-65, which was previously before the House, and Bill C-49.
<P>
	As the official opposition critic for the Treasury Board and 
Public Service Renewal, I would like to remind the  House that Bill 
C-65, which was an Act to reorganize and dissolve certain federal 
agencies, was first introduced on December 14, 1995, and that Bill 
C-49, debated in the House of Commons in October 1996, deals 
with administrative tribunals and aims at reorganizing and 
dissolving certain federal agencies.
<P>
	Members will remember that Bill C-65 was supposed to change 
and reorganize 15 federal agencies and dissolve 7 others. The 
expected changes were to lead to the abolition of 150 governor in 
council appointments and savings of $1 million, but the federal 
debt keeps increasing by more that $100 million every day. Bill 
C-65 was expected to reduce patronage and the waste of public 
funds; however, as reports published in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> on July 
8 and December 21, 1994 indicated, under the Liberal government, 
political appointments were as rampant as ever.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The savings resulting from the minister's bill, Bill C-65, 
represented only one-eighteenth of one per cent of the savings 
associated with the 45,000 public service positions that were 
abolished.
<P>
	Why would the minister be interested in reorganizing and 
dissolving certain federal agencies to realize savings of $1 million 
a year which have a minor impact on the federal budget compared 
to the savings associated with cutting 45,000 jobs?
<P>
	In some cases, eliminating any legal reference to advisory 
boards in order to reduce the number of political appointments and 
giving lower levels of authority the liberty to decide if such 
advisory boards are necessary leave some doubt as to the Liberal 
goverment's commitment to administrative transparency.
<P>
	In the case of Bill C-65, which was aimed at eliminating any 
reference, for example, to the National Library Advisory Board, it 
seemed that the director of the National Library had every intention 
of keeping a similar board with more or less the same members. 
This is just an example. In the case of Bill C-65, there were no 
savings and a little more power to the director of the Library. Will 
the House of Commons have the right to examine appointments to 
such advisory boards, which in fact will no longer be legally 
constituted? How about administrative transparency in a case like 
this?
<P>
	That was Bill C-65, an omnibus bill that created the illusion of 
transparency and deprived the government of the right to examine 
appointments to advosory boards which will no longer have legal 
status. Under the cover of administrative rationalization, this bill 
reduced the power of Parliament and opened the door to an even 
greater number of patronage appointments, something the Liberals 
are very good at.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7609"> 7609 </A></B>
<P>
	Coming back to the bill before us today, we can draw a parallel 
with Bill C-65 which dates back to 1994. Bill C-49, regarding 
which an amendment has been proposed  today, brings major 
changes to the way administrative tribunals operate.
<P>
	We are told its purpose is to standardize the disciplinary process 
in administrative tribunals as well as the procedure for appointing 
the heads of these tribunals, to dissolve seven federal agencies and 
restructure or decrease the size of thirteen others, and to 
standardize pay terminology and make a number of other 
amendments.
<P>
	Bill C-49 could have resolved the fundamental problem of 
partisan appointments to administrative tribunals. Instead, the 
federal government chose to return to a not-so-glorious past in this 
regard, rather than modernize the entire appointment process, as 
the Government of Quebec is getting ready to do.
<P>
	At a time when the public is so cynical about politicians, the 
President of the Treasury Board of Canada has introduced even 
more partisan procedures that will give political authorities 
increased control over administrative tribunals.
<P>
	The bill establishes a new mechanism to remove from office 
people appointed to administrative tribunals by the governor in 
council. This is in clause 3 of the bill. Also, after certain 
procedures, the governor in council will have the power to remove 
these people from office for cause, as specified in the bill.
<P>
	Only after receiving an inquiry report will the minister have the 
power to make a recommendation to ``suspend the member without 
pay, remove the member from office or impose any other 
disciplinary measure or any remedial measure''. This is in clause 
14 of the bill. The minister's recommendations are entirely at his 
discretion, regardless of the content of the inquiry report.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	All chairpersons of administrative tribunals will henceforth be 
designated instead of appointed. Such an amendment leaves the 
chairperson very vulnerable to political pressure from the 
government, which can simply designate a new chairperson as it 
sees fit. There is a danger that these new measures will further 
undermine the credibility of administrative tribunals and in 
particular leave them even more dependent on the political arm.
<P>
	It is unacceptable to introduce measures that are such a serious 
attack on the independence and impartiality of administrative 
tribunals. It truly runs counter to the transparency the public wants 
from a modern and progressive government.
<P>
	The two bills I have compared today, Bill C-65 and Bill C-49, 
dealt successively with the reorganization of certain federal 
agencies and of administrative tribunals, but the anticipated annual 
savings of one million dollars in the first case and a reduced right 
of review by  Parliament and an increase in partisan appointments 
in the second leave us with the impression of another promise not 
kept by this government.
<P>
	I would therefore like to take this opportunity to support the 
amendment put forward today by the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, and seconded by the member for 
Frontenac, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after ``That'' and 
substituting the following: ``Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary 
measures in relation to members of certain administrative tribunals, to reorganize 
and dissolve certain federal agencies and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, be not now read a second time, but that it be read a second time six 
months hence''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to Bill C-49, a bill which purports to do something 
about patronage appointments to various tribunals and boards.
<P>
	My colleague who spoke before me said this bill is typical of the 
sort of tinkering around the edges that we have seen in most of the 
Liberal legislation that has come before this House. It just tinkers 
around the edges of a problem without really getting to the grips of 
it, without really solving the problem that is there and that is 
inherent in the whole system. It is typical of the Liberals in 
government in that regard. Even behind the scenes they cannot 
make up their minds what to do next.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier in the day the book <I>Double Vision: The 
Inside Story of the Liberals in Power</I>. Mr. Speaker, I do not know 
whether you have had the chance to read the book but it is 
extremely interesting and revealing. It tells what has happened 
behind the scenes over the last three years. It points to the exact 
problem we see in Bill C-49 today, the tinkering around the edges 
and the inability to come to grips with the problems.
<P>
	An example in <I>Double Vision</I> was when the previous minister of 
immigration had to make some decisions about cutting costs in the 
immigration department. He could not bring himself to cut 
anything but the fact was he had to for fiscal restraint. Eventually 
he bought the idea of the landing fee for the immigrants even 
though he was under attack from some of his colleagues and 
advisers as being racist for introducing such a fee.
<P>
	The fee started off for good fiscal purposes to be around $1,500 
or $1,800. It ended up that the previous minister insisted it had to 
be under $1,000 in order for him to accept it. Here is this tinkering 
around the edges again and not truly coming to grips with the cost 
saving and accepting something less than ideal.
<P>
	I could go on all day about examples from <I>Double Vision: The 
Inside Story of the Liberals in Power</I> because it really does relate to 
this bill and how it is just tinkering around the edges. I personally 
think an excellent motion  sometime for this House to debate would 
be that this House recognize the valuable service to Canadian 
voters performed by the writers Edward Greenspon and Anthony 
Wilson-Smith in their writing of the book <I>Double Vision: The </I>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7610"> 7610 </A></B>
<P>
Inside Story of the Liberals in Power, and furthermore, that this 
House should encourage all Canadians to read the book prior to the 
next federal election.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	I wonder if I could ask the unanimous consent of the House to 
begin debating this motion immediately.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is there consent for the 
hon. member to move his motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> There is no such consent. 
The hon. member may continue his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was worth a try. 
We could have gone on to some very interesting stuff coming out of 
that motion but we will save it for another day.
<P>
	The hon. member who spoke before me from the Reform Party 
mentioned the Senate as being one of the great places of patronage. 
I was actually going to bring up the Senate as a good example of a 
place where we could begin addressing this problem of patronage. 
Bill C-49 actually claims to eliminate 271 positions from the 
patronage appointment list. However, none of those positions are 
filled. They are all vacant. Therefore, we are eliminating nothing.
<P>
	A lot of Canadians would feel a lot happier if we could eliminate 
271 seats in the Senate, if they existed. I know that perhaps, Mr. 
Speaker, in a previous time, prior to being a deputy speaker, you 
may have even hoped that there would be a total elimination of the 
parole boards. I know that personally you were quite against 
getting too tough on crime, but that is a story for another day.
<P>
	As for the Senate, even that is getting to the point where perhaps 
it cannot be trusted as a place of patronage because I know that 
Senator Anne Cools-Mr. Speaker, can we use a senator's name in 
the House?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member will 
want to be careful that he does not speak disrespectfully of the 
Senate. I believe that is a rule that he must follow.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. 
Senator Anne Cools is reported in a newspaper article in the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I> as departing frequently from the Liberal Party line. 
I am sure that some of those who were involved in perhaps a 
patronage appointment in that regard maybe are regretting their 
past decision.
<P>
	The article goes on to explain how she has great doubts about the 
Liberal Party's gun control legislation. According to the report she 
took part in a shooting  exhibition in Edmonton and has the target 
with suitable bullet holes in it pinned on the wall of her office. 
Right now she is apparently in opposition to the child support 
legislation presently before that House. ``Life is not so simple as 
women are angels and men are devils,'' says Cools, who, somewhat 
to her surprise, has become a darling of the right for her assaults on 
the feminist agenda.
<P>
	Virtue is hers and vice is his. Who could have believed we would 
have reached that stage in society where public policy making 
would be made on this basis. She took aim at the Divorce Act 
which is a bill we have already dealt with and is looking at perhaps 
derailing that. That is a patronage appointment perhaps that went 
wrong, depending on which side of the House one is on, so to 
speak. However, the Senate is a good example of a place of 
patronage.
<P>
	Another problem with Bill C-49 is that one does not even need to 
be a Canadian citizen in order to take advantage of this new bill. It 
is going to open things up for appointments or arrangements to be 
made for non-citizens. All one has to be is a landed immigrant. One 
wonders what sort of situation we are going to end up in with that 
sort of vague and open policy.
<P>
	Another area of patronage that is well recognized is the 
patronage that tends to follow from Liberal nomination tactics 
during the run up to elections. There is another article which 
coincidentally happens to be on the opposite side of the page of the 
Vancouver <I>Sun</I>. It is headed: ``Liberal nomination tactics under 
scrutiny''. It is almost a full page.
<P>
	It is about the natural patronage that tends to flow from 
nomination meetings run by the Liberals. For example, it deals 
with Mobina Jaffer, who ran run against me in the previous election 
in North Vancouver. I know that the Liberals felt they had a pretty 
good shot at it the last time, their best shot perhaps in 20 years, but 
they did not make it I am afraid. Now Mobina has been rewarded 
with an automatic appointment to the riding of Burnaby-Douglas 
which she agreed to take with no competition in return for allowing 
another party president, Celso Boscariol to go into the riding she 
had chosen. The rumour in the newspaper is that Mobina will get 
her reward even if she loses the seat.
<P>
<B>(1820)</B>
<P>
	The entire article concentrates on the aspect of patronage. I 
really do not see how Bill C-49 is going to fix that problem because 
all it does is eliminate positions that did not exist. It is a bunch of 
window dressing, typical of all of the legislation we are seeing 
here. We are just not seeing any serious legislation at the moment.
<P>
	Canadians would prefer us to deal with the Young Offenders Act. 
They would rather see their taxes lowered. When I go out on to the 
streets and ask them: ``Are your taxes any lower than they were in 
1993? Are your  streets any safer than they were in 1993? Is the 
country more unified than it was in 1993?'' We can go on and on 
with a list like that. ``Have members of Parliament fixed their gold 
plated pension plan? Is the GST gone? Is the jobless rate down?''. 
Canadians would much rather see us address those problems than 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7611"> 7611 </A></B>
<P>
some sort of half measure on patronage that really does not even 
address the problem.
<P>
	I plead with members to vote against this legislation. It is bad 
legislation. It is inadequate legislation. Let us go back, do the job 
properly and clean up the whole thing. That was promised in the 
red book. The Minister of Finance does not believe we should take 
any notice of the red book. He said he had a hand in writing it but 
we should not take any notice of it because he knows what c-r-a-p it 
is. I am sorry to use that word, but it was a quote from him.
<P>
	Just as a final reminder in closing, if members have not already 
read the book <I>Double Vision</I>, the truth about the Liberals in power, 
please read it.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
hon. member. I know that he knows it is improper to use props in 
the House. I know he would not want to break the rules in that 
regard.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this appears 
to be my day for speaking.
<P>
	We must be getting through reams of legislation. Let us talk 
about Bill C-49 which is the government's reorganization of the 
political patronage industry in this country.
<P>
	As members know I publish a waste report. I brought one out a 
few weeks ago which dealt to some degree with patronage 
appointments and the illegal tax evasion scams of some of them.
<P>
	Having been an accountant in a former life I know that the 
government has gone to great lengths to ensure that every dollar a 
person earns is a dollar taxable. These things are quite important 
because the government needs every dollar it can squeeze out of 
Canadians. However, it seems that when it comes to political 
patronage appointments it has forgotten to squeeze hard because 
there is an illegal tax evasion scam going on. It goes something like 
this.
<P>
	Dr. Victor Goldbloom, the Commissioner of Official Languages, 
was asked by the Clerk of the Privy Council to accept the 
appointment of official languages commissioner. The job of course 
is here in Ottawa.
<P>
	I have it on the record of the official languages committee when I 
asked the commissioner exactly what was going on. He said that he 
had no intention of moving from Montreal, where he lives, to 
Ottawa. The Clerk of the Privy Council then said: ``You will 
therefore be entitled to a second residence allowance''. Since that 
date we as taxpayers have been providing him with an  apartment 
here in town. I understand the rent is somewhere around $15,000 or 
$16,000 a year.
<P>
	In addition to that, he said: ``I prefer to live in Montreal''. Since 
his position carries a chauffeured limousine along with it, the 
chauffeur goes to Montreal every Monday morning and brings him 
to Ottawa and on Friday night takes him back home, all tax free of 
course. For every other Canadian commuting to and from work is 
not a tax deductible expense. They have to pay taxes on it if their 
employer provides that transportation. But not so for the 
Commissioner of Official Languages.
<P>
	Every time an employer provides extra accommodation, the 
value of that accommodation is taxable except under very limited 
circumstances. The Clerk of the Privy Council gave Dr. Victor 
Goldbloom a tax free apartment in Ottawa courtesy of the Canadian 
taxpayer and that is illegal.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	I have it on record at the official languages committee that that is 
exactly what has transpired. The government was asked through a 
question on the Order Paper a couple of years ago if this was an 
isolated experience or does it exist elsewhere. It took me two years 
to get the information. I had to rise on a point of privilege two or 
three times. I had to badger the government to get an answer to my 
question on the Order Paper. You know that yourself, Mr. Speaker. 
While the government has a responsibility to answer that question 
within 45 days it took two years before it was able to answer the 
question.
<P>
	The reason is that not only is the Commissioner of Official 
Languages participating in an illegal tax evasion scam but others 
are doing it too. They may have received a patronage appointment 
in Ottawa and live somewhere else. They want a housing allowance 
tax free. They may be within reasonable commuting distance of the 
position but they have to drive a certain distance. They are getting 
up to $2,000 a month for travel allowance because they decided 
that they were not going to move to where the job they accepted 
actually is. This is all on a tax free basis.
<P>
	Every other employer in the country cannot provide that type of 
service and that type of benefit on a tax free basis. Yet we have 
found numerous agencies that are paid by the taxpayer that are 
participating in this scam. These people with patronage 
appointments are in many cases making more than $100,000 a year 
and in some cases as much as $150,000 a year and are getting an 
additional $10,000 to $25,000 a year tax free.
<P>
	I reported these people to the Minister of National Revenue. I 
have had her verbal assurance today that she will follow through 
and ensure that she fulfils her duty to apply the Income Tax Act 
fairly and without bias right across the country and also to these 
patronage appointments.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7612"> 7612 </A></B>
<P>
	It is a disgrace that the people who are appointed by a 
government, not because of what they know but because  of who 
they know and what they may have been, such as a minister or an 
MP in a government of a previous day, should be able to latch on to 
the taxpayers' purse and then on top of that start some illegal tax 
evasion scheme to make it even more generous. It is despicable that 
we allow it to continue.
<P>
	I hope the message goes out loud and clear to every board and to 
every person with a political patronage appointment in this country 
that there are laws and they apply equally to them as they do to 
every other Canadian citizen. That is the type of attitude that brings 
disgrace on the political process. That is the type of thing that 
destroys Canadians' confidence in government.
<P>
	That is why this government, like the previous government, has 
a serious integrity problem. It has destroyed the trust that people 
have in government. People now believe that those who are in 
power are in power to help themselves. Unfortunately the facts 
seem to prove that to be so.
<P>
	Government and being a politician used to be an honourable 
profession where people wanted to serve their country, serve their 
constituents and serve the people of Canada. It is a noble calling 
that has been thrown in a trash can by the people who have used the 
opportunity to help themselves.
<P>
	I hope that in a small way this will show a new beginning, that 
trust can be won. However, it has to be won through earning the 
respect of Canadians by living responsibly, by working 
responsibly, by living within the rules, by ensuring that the laws 
that we write in this House apply not just to all Canadians out there 
but apply to us in here. Surely that is the fair test.
<P>
<B>(1830)</B>
<P>
	If we are prepared to apply a law to Canadians that says this is 
how much tax you have to pay, this is how much tax you have to 
forfeit to the Government of Canada, then surely that same law 
should be applied to us without fear, without favour and without 
bias and without writing a special, more lenient rule for ourselves 
and for patronage appointments.
<P>
	That is a small way that we could start to reintroduce integrity 
that has been lost and damaged and trashed by succeeding 
governments, especially this one right here. How can we have 
accountability when we have seen cabinet ministers whose 
positions of trust have been compromised by expense reports that 
cannot be fully justified by the travel on government business?
<P>
	It goes a long way to telling the poor people in this country, who 
are being taxed to death to subsidize people's grand style of living. 
We hear government members say bring out another tax and spend 
program, another child poverty program so that they can throw a 
few crumbs back to these people, while at the same time feathering 
their own nest.
<P>
	They are the tax and spend programs where people feel they only 
qualify for the tax side and seldom qualify for receiving the 
cheques side. When they open the paper and find out that here in 
Ottawa it is very easy to get on the receiving side that is when the 
trust is destroyed.
<P>
	I hope that Bill C-49, which we do not agree with, will be the 
final step and that from here on we start to build integrity into the 
system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill before 
us, Bill C-49, makes some administrative changes to boards, 
agencies and tribunals according to the summary.
<P>
	Our position is that this bill should be scrapped and done away 
with immediately. It does little, if anything, to reduce patronage. It 
makes surface changes to administration of boards and agencies 
but no real changes to improve accountability.
<P>
	We need competence and quality in appointments to government 
boards and tribunals as well as improved accountability. This bill, 
in itself, in our view is simply a blueprint for patronage.
<P>
	The bill does not affect the cabinet's power to make 
appointments. It can still appoint whomever it wants whenever it 
wants. In fact, the number of pleasure appointments have 
increased, which may open the door to increased political 
interference.
<P>
	The bill says it will eliminate 271 jobs. Currently all 271 jobs are 
vacant and we know full well, and acting on common sense, when 
someone does not have something they cannot very well take it 
away.
<P>
	There are still approximately 2,225 appointments available to 
cabinet. The person in charge of patronage appointments is Penny 
Collenette, a patronage appointment in and of herself.
<P>
	In the red book the Liberals made a promise with regard to 
patronage. They said that a Liberal government will take a series of 
initiatives to restore confidence in the institutions of government 
and make competence and diversity the criteria for federal 
appointments. Open government will be the watchword of the 
Liberal program. That was on page 92. This bill flies in the face of 
that commitment.
<P>
	Our commitment in our blue book was that the Reform Party 
supports restrictions and limitations on the number and types of 
orders in council permitted by a government during its term in 
office. That is the way these appointments should be made.
<P>
	Let us take a look at what the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> has to say and part 
of the list that it provided us on Friday, January 3 on government 
appointments. It notes that Deborah Coyne, a constitutional lawyer 
who worked as an advisor to former Newfoundland Premier Clyde 
Wells during the Meech Lake accord negotiations and who is a 
special friend of former Prime Minister Trudeau, will  kick off the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7613"> 7613 </A></B>
<P>
new year as a member of the department of citizenship's 
immigration and refugee board.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	It says that Stephen Goudge, a former chairman of the legal aid 
committee of the Law Society of Upper Canada and a friend of the 
current justice minister, was appointed a judge of the court of 
appeal for Ontario. When contacted at his Toronto home, Mr. 
Goudge stated that he did not have any comment on his 
appointment. He said: ``It would be inappropriate for me to 
comment on anything. I am honoured by the appointment. I will do 
the best I can''. I am sure he will and he will be well rewarded for 
it.
<P>
	Cabinet order in council documents show that the Liberal 
government made 53 such public service appointments on 
December 19. They were tremendous Christmas gifts. They 
included 27 appointments to quasi-judicial boards administered by 
the Department of Human Resources Development, 11 
appointments to the immigration and refugee board and the 
appointment of five senior judges. Some of the jobs are high 
paying. For example, the immigration and refugee board jobs come 
with salaries of $86,400 a year.
<P>
	These patronage appointments prompted an editorial in the 
Ottawa <I>Citizen</I>, a paper which customarily is friendly to the 
government. I would like to read into the record some of the 
editorial. The title is: ``Hypocrisy of Patronage''. The subtitle is: 
``Having failed to uphold red book promises to control patronage, 
the Liberals are guilty of the sin of hypocrisy''. The editorial states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What do hundreds of defeated Liberal candidates, campaign managers, 
fundraisers, and friends of Jean Chrétien have in common? They've been rewarded 
with patronage posts for their loyal service to the Liberal party.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Make no mistake, patronage is alive and well in the Chrétien government. It is 
most obvious with Gov. Gen. Roméo LeBlanc (former MP, senator, and election 
strategist). It is just as pervasive with the unknown Liberals who sit on countless 
agencies and boards.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Granted, the Liberals are not abusing the time-(dis)honored practice as much as 
Brian Mulroney did. He shamelessly spread the spoils of power and turned Canada 
into a nation of cynics.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chrétien's political sin isn't that he's acted as cavalierly as Mulroney, but that he 
hasn't met the high standards he promised. His is a sin of political hypocrisy. Among 
the Liberals' Red Book promises:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The budget for consulting contracts would be cut by 15 per cent. So-called 
communications consultants with political ties can reap lucrative contracts by 
providing ``strategic'' advice. The Liberals say general spending cuts have saved 
enough money, so they have not chopped consulting budgets as promised.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliamentarians would be given ``mechanisms'' to review some senior cabinet 
appointments. No such mechanisms are yet created, and no excuse given.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All appointments would be ``made on the basis of competence''. So far, more than 
1,800 have been appointed.  Some, such as LeBlanc, have been highly successful, but 
overall quality suffers if the candidates' prime qualification is that they are Liberals.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Chrétien promised this week ``he won't take Canadians for granted'' in the next 
election. If so, he should remember it's their loyalty-not that of party 
members-that should come first.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Patronage is a problem. That is pointed out in this editorial. They 
are not my words, they are the words of a newspaper which tends to 
be friendly with the current government. Patronage spoils the 
feelings which people have for politicians and their government, 
especially when they see candidates who were unsuccessful in 
general elections being appointed to government boards and other 
bodies which pay well. They look at that with great alarm. It is 
taxpayers' money and they wonder how well their money is being 
spent. Why should their hard earned tax dollars be used to support 
failed candidates in a manner to which the taxpayers would like to 
become accustomed?
<P>
	The bill makes very few changes, for example, to travel and per 
diem perks. In section 32(3), this bill will not affect such high 
flyers, as my colleague pointed out earlier, as Victor Gloodbloom, 
the Commissioner of Official Languages, who commutes between 
Montreal and Ottawa. But it will eliminate local commuting claims 
for people who used to claim the drive from home to work even if 
was just around the corner.
<P>
	The bill will deal with remedial and disciplinary measures which 
will be standardized for administrative tribunals. However, the 
power of the minister to interfere with disciplinary measures has 
increased. The minister can now decide whether any member of a 
committee should be subject to remedial or disciplinary measures, 
section 5, or whether they should continue on-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> I hesitate to interrupt the 
hon. member, but it being 6.40 p.m., it is time to adjourn. When the 
debate resumes, the hon. member will have about one minute 
remaining in his remarks, which is why I am so reluctant to cut him 
off, but we have filled the time.
<P>
	It being 6.40 p.m. the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m. pursuant to the standing orders.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.40 p.m.)
