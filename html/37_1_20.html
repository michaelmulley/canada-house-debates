<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA ELECTIONS ACT

<A NAME="LINK3">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from February 22 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-9, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, be now read a second time 
and referred to a committee 
<P><A NAME="LINK4"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is with pleasure that I rise to speak this 
morning.  I have but a few moments left to discuss Bill C-9 
before the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, allow me to congratulate you for the deportment 
which you brought to this Chamber yesterday while you were 
presiding over the official visit of the British Prime Minister. 
I must say that you brought great humility, humour and your usual 
candour to the Chamber.  You certainly carried yourself well in 
that role.

<A HREF="#LINKT1"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the bill, this is a piece of legislation that 
will go from this Chamber to the committee where there will be an 
opportunity to review some of the prevalent sections of the 
legislation itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been led to believe that the changes brought about by 
the bill, which, as I mentioned yesterday, resulted from a 
decision by the Ontario Court of Appeal, will in fact set this 
matter right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past election demonstrated the need to examine in greater 
detail this issue of a permanent voters list.  There were 
numerous occasions where many members of parliament encountered 
constituents who arrived at the polling booth and were sadly not 
able to vote.  This of course comes at a time when there is 
declining participation in elections.  Perhaps one of the most 
important exercises in the examination of the legislation is to 
ensure that this situation does not continue.  We must ensure 
that we are encouraging not discouraging people from taking part 
in this important democratic process of voting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this is a bill that is quite procedural in nature, 
there is a fundamental principle behind it that goes to the very 
heart of parliamentary democracy, that is, encouraging voters to 
participate in the electoral processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The definition with respect to the number of candidates that 
must run in an election to allow a party to have the official 
designation on the ballot is addressed.  The situation 
surrounding donations and the blackouts that occur during 
elections is also addressed, so that information as to results in 
some regions is not brought into play as a factor in another 
region because of the width and breadth of this country and the 
attached time zones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party, at this point, is certainly 
supportive of the legislation.  We look forward to full 
participation at the committee level to bring forward possible 
amendments that would improve and enhance the bill which is our 
role as members of parliament. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member referred to voters lists and some of the problems 
we had with them.  I think the hon. member will know that this 
was the first election under which we had permanent voters lists. 
I think all members would probably concur that there was 
substantive difficulty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder whether the hon. member has any comment with regard to 
the propriety and the feasibility of a good voters list using a 
permanent model, given what he knows from his own experience 
about what happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned in my 
remarks, I think that is perhaps the underlying most important 
aspect of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty, as the hon. member is clearly aware, is the 
nature of this country, the high level of mobility and the number 
of students, for example, who are attending university.  The 
permanency of the residency I suppose is the very issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I have found and I think the common experience of many 
members was the need for the checking and what was traditionally 
done prior to elections of having individuals go out and ensure 
the veracity of the current list, which, to my way of thinking, 
is tantamount to repeating the way the process was before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads to questions as to how permanent the list is and 
whether we should examine the list by going back to the old way 
of doing things, which was to simply, with ample time prior to an 
election, going out and enumerating and finding out where people 
are and ensuring that the lists are correct.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the enormity of that job, it is natural that there will be 
some mistakes.  There will never be perfection in this system, 
but to suggest somehow that a permanent list will capture 
everyone would be fooling ourselves, given the high levels of 
mobility.  The enumeration process will be relied upon heavily in 
most instances, and it is a return to a system that we have had 
for many years. 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this is not the first time I have spoken in the 
House since the resumption of parliament, but it is my first time 
participating in debate.  I congratulate you on your election as 
Speaker.  I very much respect and appreciate the job that you did 
as Deputy Speaker in the last parliament and I look forward to 
your favourable rulings in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are continuing the debate on Bill C-9 from yesterday when 
unfortunately the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle made reference to 
a private member's bill that I introduced in the House.  My 
private member's bill would seek to change the current number of 
members required to be designated as an official party in the 
House.  The proposal in my bill is that a party would require 10% 
of the seats in the House of Commons.  I made the proposal on the 
basis that I thought it was a reasonable amount.  If a party 
cannot achieve 10% representation then the benefits that accrue 
to official parties ought not to be available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words we use taxpayer money to assist us as official 
parties in carrying out our duties in the House of Commons and, 
as in the case of the official opposition, holding the government 
accountable for its actions.  I am not speaking about benefits 
available to each member of parliament to represent his or her 
constituents.  I am not proposing that should in any way be 
changed or altered whatsoever, but I am referring to the parties 
in general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current rule is 12.  If a party does not have 12 members it 
does not get those benefits.  My proposal is that 12 is too low a 
number.  It is less than 5%.  My proposal is 10%.  It was only a 
proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle would like to amend my 
bill and suggest 5%, I would be open to that.  I do not think it 
is unreasonable to say that the benefits of being an official 
party and the financial resources made available to it will be 
allowed if the party has 5% of the seats in the House of Commons. 
Surely that is not too onerous a level to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I take particular offence to is the manner in which the 
member, quite frankly, misled and misrepresented my bill and my 
position.  First, let me make it very clear that he went to great 
lengths to say that this was official Canadian Alliance policy 
when in fact it is a private member's bill.  He has been in the 
House long enough that he ought to know the difference.  He 
should not misrepresent my private member's bill or misrepresent 
the official policies of the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I am becoming somewhat concerned about the usage of the 
terminology misrepresented and misled in the context of the 
member referring to another member in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not think the hon. member has stepped 
over the line yet and I am sure that he will not.  He knows the 
rules and I think he will exercise judicious restraint. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B> Indeed I will, Mr. Speaker.  That is 
exactly the type of favourable ruling I was referring to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that it is a private member's bill which I 
introduced to engage members in debate on what number of MPs a 
party ought to have to receive the resources provided to 
officially recognized parties. 
I do not think 5% or 10% is an unrealistic number to have. 
However, I was pointing out that the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle tried to link that to the Canadian Alliance 
when in fact it was not fair for him to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took further offence when I reviewed <I>Hansard</I> today. 
Unfortunately I was not in the House to draw attention to the 
fact that the hon. member was misrepresenting my position. 
According to <I>Hansard</I> he made, quite frankly, vicious 
personal attacks on members of our caucus.  He referred to us as 
Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble people and then made 
disparaging comments about members of our caucus who wear cowboy 
hats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure there are many farmers and ranchers in the riding of 
the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle who wear cowboy hats.  Is he 
saying that they are somehow prehistoric people?  That is what he 
was insinuating about members who have been elected to the House 
of Commons to represent their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It raises this question:  Why was he engaging in that type of 
gutter politics and smear tactics?  He was doing so to distract 
attention from the issue.  He does not want to engage in the 
debate on whether or not 5% or 10% is a reasonable number to have 
in the House of Commons in order to receive official party 
status.  He therefore engages in the longstanding New Democratic 
Party technique of trying to distract attention from the issue by 
engaging in personal attacks.  It is highly inappropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was confusing my private member's bill with Bill C-9. 
Bill C-9 is about the elections.  It is about getting one's name 
on a ballot, what would constitute an official party and being 
able to put a party's name on the ballot.  I am in no way opposed 
to the number of members being 12.  I would support it being two. 
If two people want to run in a federal election and call 
themselves a party, they ought to be able to do that. Whatever 
rules and privileges we can extend to people who are running in 
elections, we ought to accommodate that and encourage people to 
participate and engage in the democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to highlight that my private member's bill in no way has 
anything to do with that.  My bill is after the fact.  Once the 
election is held, once we have accommodated people as much as 
possible to engage in the democratic process, to call themselves 
parties and to participate in elections, once the people have 
spoken, then we need to apply a certain standard.  Indeed, right 
now we do; it is 12 MPs.  I am simply suggesting it should be a 
percentage, and that 5% or 10% would not be unreasonable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose in that, further to what I have already said, is to 
eliminate official party representation in the House of fringe or 
marginal parties, such as the New Democratic Party, and to stop 
financial resources from accruing to them.  If there is any doubt 
about that, we had the privilege yesterday in the House of being 
addressed by the prime minister of Great Britain, Tony Blair, the 
leader of the labour party.  I would like to quote from his 
speech.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally on trade I just want to say this last point.  It is time 
I think that we started to argue vigorously and clearly as to why 
free trade is right.  It is the key to jobs for our people, to 
prosperity and actually to development in the poorest parts of 
the world.  The case against it is misguided and, worse, unfair. 
However sincere the protests, they cannot be allowed to stand in 
the way of rational argument.  We should start to make this case 
with force and determination. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the opinion of the leader of the labour party of Great 
Britain, the prime minister of Great Britain, is that the NDP's 
opposition to expanding our free trade zones is irrational and, 
in his words, misguided and unfair.  That just highlights and 
underscores the type of fringe, marginal party that the hon. 
member for Regina—Qu'Appelle represents.  My private member's 
bill was simply designed to prevent resources from accruing to 
fringe parties.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will also take the opportunity to criticize the Liberal 
government.  If we are interested in electoral reform, why would 
we not extend the discussion and the scope of the bill to include 
Senate reform? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For decades regional alienation has been occurring in the 
country, and part of the reason is because of the poor democratic 
processes that are in place.  We could undertake a lot of 
initiatives to improve democracy and improve the ability of 
members of parliament to represent their constituents.  I will 
not get into all the things we could do in the House of Commons 
but I do want to talk about the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not elect our senators?  It would obviously be more 
democratic and more representative of the will of the people. 
Senators supposedly represent people in the provinces they come 
from.  They debate and review legislation that comes from the 
House.  However, to have those people appointed is an affront to 
the very regions they are supposed to represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken the initiative of writing to the former premier of 
Saskatchewan, Mr. Roy Romanow, on a number of occasions over the 
past several years while he was still premier.  I urged him to 
enact a senatorial election act that could be done in conjunction 
with municipal or provincial elections in order to minimize cost 
and ensure efficiency.  It would allow the people of Saskatchewan 
to choose who they wanted to represent them in the Senate as 
opposed to the current practice in which the Prime Minister 
appoints friends and people who have benefited the Liberal Party 
in some way.  This is not a unique or even novel idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta has a senatorial election act and has elected senators 
in waiting.  Unfortunately the Prime Minister refuses to respect 
the democratic will of the people of Alberta and appoints people 
he has chosen to represent them in the Senate.  Ideally we need 
to reform the system so that senators who are elected 
automatically become senators.  However, as a first step, surely 
the Prime Minister could recognize and respect the democratic 
will of the people of Alberta and appoint their chosen and 
elected representatives, Bert Brown and Ted Morton, to the 
Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My purpose in writing the premier of Saskatchewan was to 
encourage him to enact a similar piece of legislation in his 
province so that we could elect senators in waiting and increase 
the pressure on the Prime Minister to abandon his undemocratic 
ways and start appointing democratically elected senators. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the premier of Saskatchewan at the time, a New 
Democrat, refused to accede to my request and implement such an 
act.  That was most regrettable, but it underscores some of the 
hypocrisy in the New Democratic Party.  The member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle talks in the House about fairness and trying 
to improve the democratic process and yet the former New 
Democratic premier of Saskatchewan would not enact a senatorial 
election act that would let people choose who they want to 
represent them in the Senate.  It is quite unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have taken the initiative to write to the new premier in 
Saskatchewan and I am waiting for his reply.  I hope he is more 
favourable toward my suggestion.  I hope he will be more 
democratic and try to assist the democratic process in Canada, 
something the former NDP premier was unwilling to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK7"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I could not help but notice the righteous 
indignation the hon. member cloaks himself in when he speaks of 
hypocrisy and of his efforts to bring about an elected Senate. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1025"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that would include the newest member of the Senate under 
the reform alliance banner.  In that other place, I would suggest 
it is only appropriate that, in keeping with official party 
stance, he would step down and run in British Columbia.  I would 
hope the hon. member would encourage him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also must refer briefly to the member's private member's bill, 
Bill C-273, in which the Progressive Conservative Party is 
referred to as a fringe or marginal party.  I take exception to 
that and think the hon. member, in all humility, might rethink 
the wording of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative Party, as we all know, goes back to 
the very origins of the country.  It has run candidates in every 
election since Confederation and has run candidates in every 
region of the country.  I ask the hon. member to reflect with 
some hubris upon the roots of his own party, the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When his party first arrived in the Chamber many people used the 
same unkind words, fringe party or marginal party.  From those 
humble roots his party has now achieved official party status and 
has become the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I caution the hon. member to perhaps choose his words carefully 
and reflect a little bit more broadly on the origins of his own 
party when he starts castigating and using that type of 
inflammatory language in the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be very interested to hear his comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raised a 
couple of questions.  First, of course, he drew attention to the 
fact that the former president of the Progressive Conservative 
Party, Gerry St. Germain, a very respected and noble Senator, is 
now a member of the Canadian Alliance caucus.  We are very proud 
and happy about that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question though was whether, in keeping with our official 
party policy, I would encourage Senator St. Germain to resign his 
position and seek to be elected as a Senator.  I very much 
encouraged him to do so, and he himself has offered to do that. 
Should the Prime Minister be willing to commit himself to 
appointing the democratically elected senator, Senator St. 
Germain would resign his seat and seek to be elected.  I hope 
that adequately addresses the question from the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second point the hon. member made is that my private 
member's bill describes not only the NDP but the Progressive 
Conservative Party as fringe parties.  I think he has a 
legitimate point.  Although the NDP is very marginal and has 
ideas that are, in the words of the prime minister of Great 
Britain, misguided, unfair and irrational, I think that meets the 
definition of fringe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, I agree with the hon. member with regard to 
the Progressive Conservative Party.  It has a proud tradition in 
this parliament.  Unfortunately it has lost favour with the 
general public to quite a degree, although its principles and 
policies are very much consistent with our own.  Very often 
members of both parties find themselves in agreement with each 
other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed, the PC Party does not meet the definition of fringe 
party.  My bill perhaps is unfair in the sense that there is a 
lot of common ground between our parties and our principles.  It 
does not make sense that such good progressive ideas are held in 
two parties divided.  Seeking to find more and better ways of 
co-operating and working together against the regressive policies 
of the Liberal Party should be encouraged, and I would certainly 
welcome that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I notice the member took offence to some of the things I 
was saying.  People who are watching and listening today should 
realize that the Alliance Party, through the hon. member, has 
introduced a bill stating that an official party should have at 
least 10% of the members of the House, which is 31 members, or 
should have members in three provinces.  The Bloc, of course, 
comes from only one province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member would classify as a fringe party 63 members of 
parliament: all the Bloc, all the Conservatives, all the New 
Democrats, the voices of one-third of the Canadian people.  Those 
three parties received about 33% of the vote. 
Is that democracy?  Is that inclusiveness?  Is that empowering 
people?  Is that what the Reform Party and the Alliance Party 
stand for?  Do they stand for excluding the voice of the people 
in the House of Commons?

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the party with a former leader who went across the 
country talking about the equality of people, saying “Let the 
people in.  Let the west in.  Let the people speak.  Let us treat 
everyone equally”.  Now those members have a bill in the House 
of Commons that would mute the voices of one-third of the people 
in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People should know where the reform alliance party stands. Never 
has anyone in the history of the House of Commons moved such a 
draconian bill.  No one has ever tried to do this before. It 
would mute the voices of one-third of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The left in the country will be around here for a long time 
after the Reform Party disappears.  I do not know whether the 
member has any sense of history in terms of the contribution of 
the CCF and the NDP in health care, social programs, the mixed 
economy and the charter of rights, all of these institutions. 
Maybe he was not a very good student of history. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask him this:  why would he propose an idea that is so 
contrary to what his former leader used to say about the equality 
of the people, which was that everyone is equal and should have a 
voice in the House of Commons in the Parliament of Canada?  He 
wants to exclude 63 MPs representing a third of the electorate. 
That is the most draconian idea I have heard since the ideas that 
came out of the era of Joe McCarthy in the United States. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member is doing it 
again.  He says “the Alliance Party through this member”.  In 
another part of his missive he asks “Is this what the Alliance 
Party stands for?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tried to be as clear as I could in my speech.  I will 
reiterate it.  This is not official Canadian Alliance policy. It 
is simply a private member's bill.  His question is, why would I 
propose such an idea?  I proposed such an idea because in the 
words of the prime minister of Great Britain, the NDP is 
misguided, unfair and irrational.  If such a fringe party is 
represented in the House, maybe we ought to examine the rules 
around that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough pointed out that 
his party is not really a fringe party, that it in fact has a 
proud tradition and often advocates very progressive ideas and 
policies which would improve the prosperity of all the citizens 
of our nation.  I agree with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Regina—Qu'Appelle takes offence to the number of 
10% and the fact that my bill would also exclude the Bloc because 
there would have to be MPs from three provinces.  My rationale, 
my purpose, in doing this is that a lot of Canadians are offended 
that the Bloc Quebecois gets financial resources even though it 
represents only one province and has as a specific purpose the 
splitting up of our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is just a private member's bill.  I am open to suggestions 
and amendments.  If the hon. member for Regina—Qu'Appelle wants 
to propose that we delete the three province requirement because 
it is unfair to members of the Bloc and that we lower the 10% to 
5%, I am open to that proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore seek the unanimous consent of the House to make my 
bill votable with the proviso that the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle would propose an amendment to lower the 10% 
requirement to 5% and drop the three province rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I guess it is a proposal.  I do not think 
the hon. member is asking for consent for all that, surely, at 
this point.  We are not debating his bill today.  We are on 
debate on a government bill at the moment.  Given the complicated 
nature of this matter, I think asking for unanimous consent might 
not advance his cause. 
<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
are on government business and I wish we would get back to that 
piece of legislation.  However, it was the member himself who 
brought up private member's Bill C-273 at great length during his 
conversation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a simple question.  As one of those parties that he has 
deemed to be fringe, is the 10% requirement a defence mechanism 
that the member is putting forward because he recognizes that the 
official opposition has fallen down miserably in trying to put 
forward that opposition to the government and must depend now 
upon those same fringe parties that he refers to, that is, the 
NDP, the Conservatives and the Bloc members?  Quite frankly, the 
credibility of the official opposition has been eroded to the 
point where no one will believe them or listen to them any 
longer. 
Is this only a defence mechanism to try to make sure we do not 
have the opportunity, with the limited resources and the limited 
questions we have, to in fact put forward questions in a much 
more effective manner than the member's party has been able to 
do?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first of all the hon. member 
says that he is representing a party that I have deemed to be 
fringe.  I thought I clarified that and highlighted the idea that 
really the only fringe party in the House of Commons, by 
definition of the prime minister of Great Britain himself, is the 
NDP, because it is, in his words, misguided, unfair and 
irrational. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other question the hon. member had was about why I am 
introducing the bill, whether is it a defence mechanism or 
something.  In fact, I reintroduced the bill in the House of 
Commons.  I introduced it in the last session of parliament.  I 
think it is a good cause and is something the House of Commons 
should examine:  what is a reasonable level of representation in 
parliament before an opposition party gets access to the 
resources that are provided to hold the government to account? 
That is the purpose of my bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK10"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to tell my colleagues from the other side 
that the Canadian public only two months ago gave their verdict 
on that party and that is why those members are sitting at the 
other end of the Chamber, almost on the way out.  Perhaps they 
will understand, since they are sitting here talking about 
democracy, that it was the Canadian public that made them lose 
their seats to the other party.  Let us keep that in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You guys did well in Ontario, did you? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  We went up.  You went down.  Perhaps 
they can understand that the Canadian public has made its choice. 
The public has said where those members are going to sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us go back to Bill C-9.  It is a pleasure for me to rise and 
speak on Bill C-9.  This is a bill the government brought in 
because of a court ruling.  It seems to me, and I can never 
understand what the government seems to be doing, that this bill 
is destined to go back to the courts.  It came from the courts 
and it is destined to go back to the courts because it is a 
flawed bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is saying, based on the ruling from the courts, that 
the government will recognize a party with 12 or more candidates. 
The government will recognize that party only on an election 
ballot.  The government will not recognize it as a registered 
party.  The difference between being on the ballot and having 
registered party favours the old parties, including my party—the 
Canadian public has chosen us to be the official opposition, 
contrary to whatever the members opposite want to say—and it 
favours the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that the government is trying to protect itself. 
If the trend carries on and the NDP and the other parties keep 
losing ground, then the bill will apply to them too.  If they 
lose one or two candidates, they will lose party status in the 
House as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about registered parties.  Let me tell the House 
what a registered party gets.  A registered party gets electoral 
voter lists.  A registered party gets the ability to issue tax 
receipts, which allows it to do fundraising.  It is also allowed 
to provide rebates on election expenses.  Most importantly, if 
for some reason the party is suspended, the bill would allow the 
party to have its assets liquidated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is happening here is that we are creating two classes of 
parties in the country, registered parties and eligible parties. 
I do not understand why we would want to do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Smaller parties ran in my riding in the November election:  the 
Marijuana Party, the Communist Party and the Natural Law Party. 
There were also five from the other registered parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Marijuana Party was running on the basis of getting out its 
message.  That is fine.  I thoroughly enjoyed having their 
members as my opponents and debating with them on the issues. 
They had one simple message they wanted to get out to the public, 
which was that marijuana be legalized for medicinal purposes. 
That was their only message, because a Mr. Krieger, who is in 
jail at this time, was and is using marijuana as a medicinal 
purpose to counteract pain.  He wanted this message to get out. 
That was fine.  There is nothing wrong with wanting to get out 
one's message.  After all, we do talk about freedom of speech. We 
cherish freedom of speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why can we not have these eligible parties become registered 
parties?  Perhaps the government can give me a good reason.  If 
it is good enough to recognize a party's official status in this 
esteemed House, why can we not recognize anyone who is putting up 
12 candidates as a registered party?  Why are we creating two 
systems here?  I will never understand this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of things we can do, but here is a bill that is 
destined to go back to the courts.  The bill addresses nothing, 
yet we have important issues to be addressed.  There are issues 
about reform.  There is the reform of the Senate, and my friend 
talked about reforming the House so that members of parliament 
can speak on behalf of their constituents.  As is evident and as 
has been stated time after time, the power of what is happening 
in the House is with the Prime Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on the committees, but we know they are irrelevant 
because at the end of the day everything comes from one person. 
Democracy in parliament has been eroded over the years, a legacy 
from past governments of the Conservative Party and the Liberal 
Party.  That is why the Conservative Party has been relegated to 
the back rows of the House.  This is the legacy that party left, 
a legacy of the eroding of democracy, of all aspects of power 
being concentrated in the hands of the PMO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues need to be addressed.  The Alliance has put forward 
a lot of good proposals for debate.  The other parties even agree 
with us on this, in regard to a private member's bill.  We are 
elected by the people of Canada.  We are their voice.  However, 
this is my second term and, based on experience, I can tell my 
colleagues that our voices here are not heard, nor are the voices 
of government backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us address the issues that are important.  Let us address 
the fundamental points of freedom of speech, transparency and the 
ability to allow those who want to speak on behalf of Canadians 
speak.  Let them be allowed.  The bill before us does not do 
that.  For these reasons we are opposed to the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I made my first address in the House yesterday.  You were not in 
the chair at the time, so I take this opportunity to congratulate 
you on your election.  I wish you well in your position and I 
wish you the best in terms of dealing with the stress that the 
job creates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the legislation before us I wish to make several 
points.  We are in support of the thrust of the bill to provide 
party status to those groups that can muster 12 members to run on 
their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is much more with the inadequacy of the bill on a 
number of other points.  Recognizing the time I have, I wish to 
address the lack of updating the permanent enumeration list from 
the perspective of the experiences I have had.  I have now ran on 
three occasions, and on each occasion I was confronted with 
similar problems that resulted in the inability of people in my 
riding to vote on election day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will use one example.  As a result of the unfortunate death of 
Shaughnessy Cohen, there was a byelection in my riding in 1999. 
There was construction going on at the time in the town of 
Tecumseh in one of the suburban areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I ran again in the November 2000 election, I happened to be 
canvassing door to door in that area.  I was knocking on doors of 
some people that I had met in the previous two election 
campaigns, but then I crossed the street and I began consistently 
running into residents that had clearly not been put on the 
voters list.  I was with a couple of supporters and we decided to 
cover the whole area to see who was not on the list.  It turned 
out that it was a new subdivision and well in excess of 100 
voters were not on the voters list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I suppose I should emphasize is that at this stage it 
was only about seven or eight days before the election and all 
these people had some significant difficulty voting on November 
27.  If a regular enumeration had been conducted prior to the 
vote and during the election period, these people would have been 
easily picked up and they would have had minimal or no difficulty 
on election day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should make a point that the returning officer in our area was 
not somebody who neglected her responsibilities.  In fact I 
thought she was quite positive in the way she did her job.  She 
did it as effectively as she could but was hampered both by the 
shortness of the election period and by the other tools that she 
did not have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were other areas where we had trouble.  The one of 
particular concern to me was with immigrants to Canada who had 
only recently achieved the ability to vote under the Canada 
Elections Act.  We have had a major in-migration in my riding, 
particularly from the Middle East.  There are some difficulties 
with language.  As a result a number of people in two areas of my 
riding where they tended to settle were not on the voters list. 
If an enumeration were conducted we would have been able to 
identify those people, get them on to the voters list and 
facilitate their ability to vote.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases, when these individuals did go to the polls, they 
had particular difficulty because of language.  Often they spoke English 
or French but they had difficulty with the language. They 
needed extra support in order to work their way through the 
system and had to bring the proper identification in order to 
vote on election day.  Again, a good number of them ended up 
being disenfranchised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain areas in my constituency with people who are 
of low income.  We have, as is the case in a number of other 
major municipalities, a housing problem.  These individuals often 
have difficulty affording housing and are moving on a regular 
basis.  The lack of enumeration of these individuals during the 
election period again tends to disenfranchise them.  They end up 
being disenfranchised almost on a class basis because they are 
forced to move often due to the cost of housing.  We are caught 
in a situation where we disenfranchise them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of these people often have difficulty with their 
identification and are not able, even if they are determined 
enough to go to the polls on election day, to produce the 
necessary identification. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In one area of my riding it is a financial issue.  If people 
show up at the poll and do not have their identification with 
them, they have to actually take a bus, because the poll is so 
large, go back home, get their identification and then come back. 
Those few dollars that it cost them is often enough to dissuade 
them from voting on election day.  So we disenfranchise them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The University of Windsor, although not located in my riding, 
has a number of students who come in from outside to vote in the 
riding where they may be residing while they go to school.  The 
lack of enumeration restricts a number of them and they often 
have difficulty on election day producing identification that 
would make it possible for them to vote.  They end up being 
disenfranchised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know the figure that has been publicized, the one million 
plus voters who were not on the voters list on election day on 
November 27, 2000.  That, by any standards, is unacceptable in a 
democratic country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would ask the government to reconsider the legislation and to 
provide additional amendments that would make it possible to have 
enumeration conducted during the course of the election.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
throughout the debate today and yesterday, I could not help but 
notice that the flow and the subject of the debate involved 
issues way beyond the scope of the bill that is before the House 
for discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a little disappointed in the debate because there are some 
important issues that lie behind the court decisions that the 
House is now acceding to in considering the bill.  I am not 
referring to the speaker who just spoke, but most of the previous 
speakers have wanted to address issues like the voters list or 
other issues related to democracy and the effectiveness of the 
electoral machinery that we use in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an attempt to bring our record closer to the issues that are 
in front of us, I would ask the member a couple of questions. 
Hopefully he has had a look at the bill and knows the issues that 
are in there.  There are of course the technical issues and a few 
amendments that are referred to as technical amendments. 
However, there is also the issue of allowing individuals, who are 
part of political parties that do not meet the 50 candidate 
threshold, to show themselves as members of parties.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I am trying to elicit an acknowledgement from the member that 
the proposals in the legislation to allow an individual and at 
least 11 other candidates to show themselves as a party on a 
ballot is fair, and that the 12 person threshold is fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has not come up very often, but sometimes the House and the 
government are called upon by the court to reconsider an issue 
based on the court's opinion.  In this case, the proposed 
amendments are as a direct result of court of appeal decisions 
and opinion.  The government has introduced a bill to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the member to comment on the appropriateness of the 
House responding directly to an exhortation or an opinion from a 
court to revise our laws so that they are more charter compliant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the outset of my 
comments today I made it clear that I was in support of the 
number 12.  I felt that the legislation as far as it went on that 
point was appropriate.  We need to have some number.  I think as 
a House we have accepted that, and the Ontario Court of Appeal 
has made it clear that the number 50 was unreasonable.  The use 
of 12 seems to be appropriate.  It is in keeping with the 
acknowledgement of party status in the House if that many members 
are elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should the number be 10, 14 or 15?  I suppose arguments could be 
made in that regard, but 12 seems to be accepted because of the 
historical significance of elected members within the House. I 
thought I had made that clear at the start of my comments but if I 
did not, I apologize to my friend across the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the point the member raised about the way the 
debate has gone and the fact that so many people have raised 
other issues.  I think that is the inadequacy of the legislation. 
It does not address a number of other very crucial issues, some 
of which I have spoken to.  Enumeration, in particular, should 
have been addressed.  I thought we had some sense of that from 
the House leader earlier in the session, that something more 
extensive would be forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reassert all the comments that I made in my original address, 
but to address his particular question, I made it obvious that we 
do support the number 12 in order to achieve party status for 
electoral purposes.

NATO in the very near future in order to secure a lasting peace

earlier this week I had the opportunity of commenting on 
scientific achievements of last week, including landing a

International Space Station. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two achievements in and of themselves are quite 
astounding, but they are also rooted in other achievements of 
note.  For instance, 92 years ago today, on February 23, 1909, 
the Silver Dart, designed by Canadian engineer John McCurdy, made 
the first powered heavier than air flight in Canada, in Baddeck, 
Nova Scotia, to be precise.  A few years before that, in December 
1903, the Wright brothers had achieved the first ever controlled 
powered flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to suggest that the 100th anniversary of the first 
ever powered flight, December 2003, would be an ideal time to 
officially open the long delayed new wing of the National 
Aviation Museum and dedicate it to the indomitable spirit of the 
men and women who gave us this marvellous adventure of human 
flight.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Irwin Cotler (Mount Royal, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Sri 
Lanka is not only one of the worst of contemporary killing 
fields, but one of the most tragic in terms of humanitarian 
consequence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The indicators are chilling.  Over one million internally 
displaced people with UNHCR have a limited mandate for 
protection.  There are over 12,000 unresolved cases of 
disappeared persons, second only to Iraq.  Both government and 
LTTE forces have been implicated in a variety of humanitarian 
abuses, with civilians as target and victim.  The UN special 
rapporteur on violence, who is herself Sri Lankan, has emphasized 
government complicity by security personnel in sexual violence. 
UNICEF has expressed concern for child victims of war and 
denounced the LTTE's use of child soldiers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the above, we should therefore be encouraged by two lesser 
known developments.  First, we are in the second month of an 
agreed upon and long awaited ceasefire in Sri Lanka and, second, 
a Quebec coalition for peace in Sri Lanka has been founded by one 
of my own constituents, which ought to augur well for an enhanced 
humanitarian sensibility within Quebec and Canada to developments 
in Sri Lanka.

financial bomb at Canadian wheat producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year our farmers exported 262,000 tonnes of wheat to Iraq, 
worth about $50 million, primarily from my home province of 
Saskatchewan.  One of the results of the endorsement by our 
government of the bombing of Iraq is that Iraq has now informed 
our Canadian wheat exporters that it will no longer accept wheat 
from Canada.  This has just driven another financial spike into 
the coffin of our prairie grain producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our farmers are already suffering enough.  They are in Ottawa 
today lobbying for better prices and for a better deal from our 
federal government and now they have lost yet another market 
because of the action of the government across the way.

my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister seems to be sowing a bit of confusion with 
respect to not just the Canadian position but also the American 
position on national missile defence.  On the one hand he 
appeared to suggest that they would not proceed without the 
approval of NATO, China and Russia, and then the next day he 
appeared to backtrack on that position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the Canadian understanding of the American position? Are 
they prepared to proceed even if China, Russia and NATO partners 
object, or not? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think the member would have to ask President Bush 
and the United States government that kind of question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans have said that they will consult with all those 
who are interested, the allies, as well as those who are 
concerned about global security issues, such as Russia and China, 
although Russia itself seems to admit that there is a problem 
with security.  Russia is proposing an alternate missile system. 
It understands, as the Americans do, that there is a 
proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the Prime Minister has stated quite clearly that we 
have not been asked to take a position.  The Americans have not 
put this in place yet and have not indicated the parameters of 
it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK72"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it does not seem to bother the Prime Minister to 
pronounce on the American position.  I thought maybe the Minister 
of National Defence might be willing to at least do what the 
Prime Minister does, but perhaps he could help us with respect to 
the Canadian position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talked about parameters, technology and it not 
having been put in place yet, but what is the position of the 
Canadian government in principle with respect to a national 
missile defence, something which in principle violates the ABM 
treaty.  Do we have any principles on this or do we just wait and 
see how the situation develops?  Is there any principle in the 
Canadian position? 
<P><A NAME="LINK73"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are consulting on the matter.  How can we make a 
decision when the Americans have not even made a decision?  It is 
the Americans who are proposing this as a security and protection 
for themselves, but they have not told us exactly what it is or 
when they will do it.  How can we possibly make a decision based 
on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister and I 
have been quite clear about this.  Let the Americans continue to 
consult with their allies, the Russians and the Chinese, and to 
concern themselves with the various treaties that exist, such as 
the ABM treaty, and then we will have something further to talk 
about in a decision making context.

together to create synergy so that we could provide more service 
and respond more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member should stand up and congratulate the government. 
Last year we made an announcement of $115 million to improve 
search and rescue across Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
minister should read the auditor general's report.  Due to the 
minister's refusal to let fishermen move to larger boats, more 
and more smaller boats are forced to go further and further to 
sea to catch their quota.  More marine activity is being 
generated around the oil and gas offshore activity.  The main 
shipping lanes in the western world are around the coast of 
Newfoundland. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this, how can the minister even consider cutting 
back on the safety, service and protection, not only of the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, in preparation for the upcoming United Nations world 
conference against racism, the multiculturalism minister is 
hosting a national consultation in Ottawa today.  Canadians will 
remember that during the recent federal election the immigration 
minister's name calling fanned the fires of racism in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did the multiculturalism minister insist that the immigration 
minister attend the consultation given her antisocial behaviour 
and misunderstanding of the fight against racism, or is the 
immigration minister refusing to attend? 
<P><A NAME="LINK99"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what I have heard from the 
consultations that I have done, regional as well as this national 
consultation, is that the slippery slope on the first step to 
hate and to any kind of racism is stereotyping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard day after day in the House stereotyping, which 
means taking one group and giving them all kinds of epithets.  It 
is called McCarthyism.  It is attributing to people in the 
country who belong to a racial minority that they are terrorists, 
et cetera.  That is stereotyping and it leads to hate.  That is 
what we have to deal with in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the immigration minister offended millions of 
Canadians who supported and voted for the Canadian Alliance. 
While the multiculturalism minister spent her time and taxpayer 
money running a campaign to fight racism, the immigration 
minister ran around labelling Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister demand that the immigration minister 
apologize for her catcalling and order her to attend the 
conference so that she may begin her schooling to learn some 
respect for Canada's cultural diversity? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the immigration minister is doing an outstanding job as 
minister, as a member of parliament and as a representative 
herself of the diversity of our great Canadian family.  When the 
hon. member asserts otherwise, it shows why he and his party are 
totally unworthy of the support of Canadians, especially those 
from groups other than the traditional majority groups.

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. 
The minister will recall that the House unanimously passed a 
motion in 1998 condemning the discriminatory treatment of British 
pensioners living in Canada and the failure of the British 
government to uprate their pensions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that yesterday Prime Minister Tony Blair, in a

with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain.  Prime Minister Blair

Minister Blair said, based on my recollection of the transcript 
of the press conference, that he would look into the matter 
further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was raised vigorously by the Prime Minister.  Mr. Blair in

in Canada by saying the matter is being dealt with in the U.K. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, perhaps he would explain why his government continues 
to ignore a problem clearly within the scope of his government: 
thousands of Canadian citizens facing crippling taxes on their

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans.  For 60 
years the Cobequid Federal Fish Hatchery of Cumberland county 
served industry and government, but in 1997 the department of 
fisheries announced a great new policy of divestiture with a 
great deal of fanfare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, only two and a half years later, the experiment has failed; 
the policy has failed; and the fish hatchery is closed for the 
first time in half a century.  Will the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans restore the fish hatchery to its former level and not 
punish the area just because the policy failed? 
<P><A NAME="LINK113"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

important part of DFO and we do that across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not familiar with the particular hatchery the hon. member 
has referred to, but if he provides the details for me I will 
certainly want to get back to him and make sure I provide a full 
answer to his question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK114"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Fisheries and Oceans should be familiar with the 
Cobequid hatchery.  He should be familiar with Coldbrook hatchery 
and the Mersey hatchery because lots of questions have been asked 
on them before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is simple.  His government and his department gave 
Salmon Care hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of supplies, 
juvenile fish and other things, and it was a colossal failure, a 
complete and utter failure.   What was the total cost to Canadian 
taxpayers and where is the new plan?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans,

take this question under advisement.

discriminate in favour of somebody on the basis of race without 
discriminating against somebody else because of their race.

were previously in the National Transportation Act, 1987. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was somewhat controversial as the hon. member will know if

this crisis management approach to mergers.  Other than the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

approach with respect to the airlines, but I might remind the 
hon. member, who is from western Canada, that in December 1999 
Canadian Airlines was two days away from bankruptcy.  It did not 
have the cash to meet payroll.  That would have meant 16,000 
people, many of them in western Canada, out of their jobs and 
absolute chaos in the air system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit it has not gone 100% the way we wanted it to go, but I

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA ELECTIONS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK155">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-9, an 
act to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act, be read the second time and referred 
to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central to 
speak to Bill C-9, the Liberal government's proposed changes to 
the Canada Elections Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Bill C-9 is to amend the Canada Elections Act 
which became law on September 1, 2000.  The Liberals passed the 
bill only a few months ago, but we are correcting their mistakes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are doing the work today that we asked them to do in the 36th 
parliament.  We do not mind helping them again to do their 
homework, but we are disappointed that Canadians did not choose 
to send us to Ottawa to do our work, because we would have done 
our work right the first time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 will overturn the current law that requires a party to 
have at least 50 candidates before it can be identified as a 
political party on the election ballot.  The Liberals will now 
require parties to possess 12 candidates in order to be 
recognized as political parties and be entitled to certain 
benefits and privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only registered parties are eligible to obtain the final list of 
electors, to obtain free broadcast time for political 
announcements and to issue tax receipts to donors on behalf of 
the party.  Only registered parties are entitled to such benefits 
and privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's chief electoral officer confirms the number of 
candidates.  The 12 candidate minimum conforms to the requirement 
that a party have at least 12 members of parliament to receive 
official status in the House of Commons, as the fifth party has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain how the Liberals arrived at the magic number of 
12.  The Liberals are trying to make it as hard as possible for 
any political group to challenge them at the ballot box.  In 
their twisted logic they have figured out that they would be too 
ashamed and embarrassed to make the required number of seats any 
higher than the number of seats required by the House for a party 
to qualify to be recognized as a political party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that members will remember that in the last parliament 
the Liberals originally set the bar high at 50.  It is a lot more 
difficult to field 50 candidates in an election than 12 or so. 
The Liberals like the number 50.  They were crushing a number of 
parties and preventing them from qualifying for certain 
privileges and benefits.  They have been forced to lower the bar 
and to allow smaller parties to have a greater level of 
participation in our democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the Liberals kept the bar high at 50 
candidates for what they knew would be the last time.  In the 
most recent election the Liberals could put in a fix by denying 
parties with less than 50 candidates from being major political 
parties in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before the Liberals passed the previous Canada Elections Act 
during the last parliament, the official opposition warned the 
Liberal government that the 50 candidate rule should be dropped. 
We told them upfront, but who listens on the other side?  I spoke 
to that bill in various debates in the last parliament. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT27"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT27"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had the approval of most of Canada's smaller political 
parties for the proposal, but the Liberals did not listen at that 
time.  It appears perhaps that they are listening now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even so, parties with 12 candidates will be allowed to have 
their party's name on ballots but will still not be able, as will 
parties with 50 candidates, to provide donors with tax receipts, 
to access the list of electors or to obtain free broadcasting 
time on TV. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those three things are crucial for a political party to be able 
campaign and to have its message communicated across the country. 
Those three things are very important, and parties with 12 
members will not be entitled to such privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With Bill C-9, the bill we are debating today, the government 
would create two tiers of political parties with different sets 
of privileges.  On one hand, registered political parties with 50 
or more candidates would possess all possible benefits.  On the 
other hand, political parties with less than 50 candidates would 
possess few benefits other than having their name on the ballot 
if they have at least 12 candidates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 continues to discriminate against smaller parties.  It 
is not only undemocratic, it is anti-democratic as well.  The 
Canada Elections Act should be neutral and should treat everyone 
equally and fairly.  Canadian voters, not the government, should 
decide whether a political party or candidate is worthy of their 
vote.  It should not be up to the government to decide, it should 
be up to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are trying to pass the legislation because a court 
case has necessitated changes to the Canada Elections Act.  As 
the House will recall, in my speech in the last parliament I 
warned the House of possible legal action.  I told the Liberals 
that they were exposing the Canada Elections Act to a legal 
tussle, and now here it is.  If they had listened at the time 
this probably would not have happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Ontario Court of Appeal decided the case in August 2000. The 
court decided that the Canada Elections Act provisions concerning 
the identification of political parties on election ballots was 
invalid.  The court said that the provisions were invalid and 
suspended its decision for six months, until February 16, 2001, 
so that parliament could address the court's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this had been done right the first time we would not be doing 
it again.  We could be spending the valuable time of the House, 
as well as of the court, on something more important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 also clarifies the calculations of the electoral 
expenses limit.  If the revised list of electors differs from the 
original list, the candidate's expenses will be adjusted 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reimbursement of election expenses is also covered in the 
bill.  Under section 435 of Bill C-2, which was a bill in the 
previous parliament, only registered parties, and not the small 
parties we must define today, will be reimbursed for election 
expenses providing they obtain either 2% of the national vote or 
5% of the votes in the ridings in which they endorse candidates. 
Those are two conditions parties must satisfy before they get any 
reimbursement for election expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 does not amend the reimbursement of election expenses 
provision that was in Bill C-2 in the last parliament.  Therefore 
this section will be discriminatory against smaller parties.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I am standing in the House and warning the government.  It 
should get its act together and correct these mistakes so that 
the Canada Elections Act is neutral, fair and treats everyone 
equally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Alliance, and my colleagues on this side, proposed 
election rebates.  We do not believe it is fair that only 
registered parties, and not the smaller political parties, are 
eligible for these benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important point in the bill is the fundraising 
activities.  If Bill C-9 is not amended, as we are asking, it 
will be difficult for the smaller parties to engage in 
fundraising activities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 does not make amendments to the income tax provisions 
of Bill C-2 which was debated in the House and passed in the last 
parliament.  The provisions are discriminatory.  Receipts can be 
issued on behalf of registered parties during and in between 
elections.  Whereas, candidates of non-registered political 
parties, the ones we talked about earlier, can only issue 
receipts during the writ period.  How can they prepare themselves 
to have their messages conveyed to Canadians when they do not 
have enough resources?  They are not permitted have fundraisers 
between elections. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During those 36 or 37 days they can receive funds and issue tax 
receipts to donors.  Other than the writ period, they are not 
entitled to raise any funds or issue tax receipts.  When tax 
receipts are not issued, it is very difficult to get money 
donated from someone to a political party or a political cause. 
That is very unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move on to another point about asset liquidation.  Under 
clause 394 of the former bill, Bill C-2, with respect to 
registered parties which failed to run 50 candidates, they become 
suspended and the assets of a suspended party need not be 
liquidated if the party applies for re-registration within six 
months.  However, if they do not apply within those six months 
then they are suspended.  Bill C-9 does not amend this very 
important provision.  The Canadian Alliance does not believe that 
a party should have to liquidate its assets under any 
circumstances, which is exactly what the Ontario Court of Appeal 
decided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government may be facing another court challenge 
over this if this clause is not amended.  We are telling the 
Liberal government what to do about this bill to avoid any 
potential lawsuits.  Whether or not it listens to us is another 
story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voting process is another issue.  Among other technical 
matters, Bill C-9 also stipulates that if the chief electoral 
officer wishes to examine alternative voting processes, such as 
electronic voting, the alternative cannot be used without the 
approval of the House of Commons and Senate committees.  Why does 
the chief electoral officer, who is supposed to monitor elections 
in Canada, have to get permission for electoral alternative 
electronic voting, for example, or other alternative methods to 
make the process efficient and effective? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other changes in the bill but most of them are 
housekeeping changes.  Under the current legislation, only the 
approval of the House of Commons committee is required.  This 
sounds to me like a way to prevent change, but I will reserve my 
comments and allow the committee that will hear this bill, and 
many witnesses over time, to decide what this section really 
means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward in seeing how the committee proceeds.  I look 
forward to seeing whether it will give a fair chance to witnesses 
to come forward and whether or not its recommendations will be 
taken into consideration.  The amendments to the former Bill C-2, 
which were discussed in the committee, were ignored.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me talk about the relationship of Bill C-9 to Canadian 
Alliance policy.  Canadian Alliance policy states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To improve the representative nature of our electoral system, we 
will consider electoral reforms, including proportional 
representation, the single transferable ballot, electronic 
voting, and fixed election dates, and we will submit such options 
to voters in a nationwide referendum. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader is in charge of the bill.  He 
was in charge of the last bill during the last session and did a 
very bad job.  I apologize for making this comment, but all the 
good amendments which we proposed and those which were discussed 
in committee were not taken into consideration.  Even when the 
red light was flashing signalling a warning that there might be 
some court actions, the House leader ignored it.  Now, the House 
leader is heckling me on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the bill does abandon the 50 candidate rule, it does not 
go far enough to democratize our electoral process.  We believe 
all parties should be treated equally and fairly, not merely 
those with 50 or more candidates.  All political parties should 
be treated fairly and equally.  That is called real democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada Elections Act is a mess.  Not only are the Liberals 
not learning fast enough, I do not know if they are learning at 
all.  They do not have the political will to make a fair and 
level playing field for all political parties to contest an 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The level playing field is very important.  Equal opportunity 
for all political parties is very important but it is not there. 
The Liberals not only have it in the back of their minds but they 
also have it in the front of their minds to have an elections act 
that will benefit the governing party, which in this case is the 
Liberal Party.  That is why they did not listen to the Alliance 
amendments in the last parliament and will try to ignore our 
amendments once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill maintains the most objectionable provisions of the 
Canada Elections Act.  Our elections should be democratic, free 
and fair, offering equal opportunity to all candidates and all 
political parties.  This would be a great way to start a new 
session of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak, arrogant and corrupt Liberal government that lacks 
vision is wasting an opportunity to modernize and democratize the 
patronage ridden Canada Elections Act.  It has this opportunity 
again.  Our election act is even worse than the election acts in 
developing countries and where this government's representatives 
go to monitor elections.  If our own elections act is a mess, is 
not democratic, how can we send our representatives to developing 
countries to monitor their elections?  I do not know if we are 
practising what we are preaching at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of the official opposition have proposed a number of 
worthwhile amendments to the bill.  We will continue to do that. 
It is our job, not only to criticize the government, but also to 
propose amendments, suggest new ways and worthwhile change to 
open Liberals' eyes.  As usual we are holding a flashlight for 
them but they are closing their eyes.  They refuse to look when 
we shine the light into their intellectual darkness.

parliamentary reform.  That is why they do not want to 
democratize our electoral system.  The more I think about it, I 
am quite convinced that the Liberals' actions are not just 
undemocratic, they are anti-democratic.  The government is the 
dictatorship of the 21st century.  It is nothing short of a 
dictatorship when it will not accept amendments that would 
improve the system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ovid Jackson (Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound, Lib.):</B>  Madam

</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill introduces for the first time Canadian legislation 
regarding shipowners' liability for the carriage of passengers 
and new rules for the apportionment of liability in maritime law. 
At the same time, it will consolidate existing marine liability 
regimes, which are currently scattered throughout various 
statutes, into a single statute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This important Canadian legislation will modernize the Canada 
Shipping Act to make sure it concur with the legislation.  Some 
40 million Canadians travel by sea.  There are various oil 
spillages.  Liabilities have resulted all around the world, in 
Europe, in Canada and in Greece.  The act will consolidate and 
make shipowners responsible.  It will take away the fact that in 
the fine print on tickets and so on they can exempt themselves 
from looking after their liabilities to Canadians.

Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I was taken aback a bit by my hon. 
colleague along the way in that he made quite a succinct speech 
on an important piece of legislation.  Obviously there is a need 
to adjourn the House for the weekend or something.  I am not sure 
exactly what is happening here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset of my remarks this afternoon on Bill S-2, the 
marine liability act. and because I only had 10 minutes to reply 
to the Speech from the Throne, I will begin by congratulating 
you, Madam Speaker, on your appointment to the chair; the Speaker 
on his election; and your colleagues who occupy the chair from 
time to time.  I know it is not an easy task riding herd on this 
place.  I not only congratulate you but will endeavour to support 
you in as non-partisan a way as possible from time to time when 
you are called upon to make a tough ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to thank my supporters as I did in quite a succinct 
manner during my brief remarks in reply to the throne speech a 
couple of weeks ago.  As all of us know, regardless of what party 
we represent in the House of Commons, we would not be here 
without the support, hard work and monetary donations of many 
individuals back in our respective ridings from coast to coast to 
coast.  In light of that, I assure the people who supported me 
back home that I indeed greatly appreciate their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very fortunate.  I have run in four election 
campaigns dating back to 1988 when I was unsuccessful.  People 
who supported the Reform Party of Canada's principles and 
policies at the time stepped forward to work hard on the party's 
behalf and ultimately on my behalf when I became the candidate, 
which saw me elected with about 56% of the vote.  I believe that 
increased to 66% in 1997 and almost 70% in the latest election in 
November 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am always quick to point out that I do not take it as a great 
affirmation that I am doing such a terrific job that 70% of the 
people who show up at the polls would mark their ballots for me. 
I take it as 70% of the people who were looking at the 
alternatives on election day decided to support in this case the 
Canadian Alliance's principles and policies first and foremost. 
They obviously decided to support the leadership of our present 
leader.  The reason I would get those types of numbers is 
primarily the support and the word of mouth translated throughout 
the riding of Prince George—Peace River by the people as much as 
by me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank each and every one.  I obviously would not have time to 
record the hundreds of people who are members of the Canadian 
Alliance in Prince George—Peace River and all the people who 
gave so willingly hours of their time to volunteer to make my 
re-election campaign ultimately successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  And now to the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  Madam Speaker, I will get to the bill.  The 
hon. House leader of the government probably has some urgent 
business back in his riding that he must attend to and would like 
to see the House adjourn early today, it being Friday afternoon.

represent and have represented now for seven years in the House

</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. government House leader might be interested to know 
that the riding of Prince George—Peace River is the only riding 
in Canada that actually straddles the Rocky Mountains.  It is 
some 200,000 square kilometres in size.  It is the eighth largest 
riding as far as geographic size is concerned.  While it is 
difficult to get around in a riding so large, and certainly my 
hon. colleague from Skeena is well aware of the problems that are 
inherent in that, the reality is that it is enjoyable as well to 
represent a large rural riding.  There are terrific grassroots, 
hard-working people from one end of the riding to the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased and honoured, as I have been for the last 
seven years, to represent the people of Prince George—Peace 
River not only in the House of Commons, but also try to be a 
worthy representative of those people when I am out in the real 
world speaking on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2, the marine liability act, is a multifaceted bill that 
will finally legislate protection for Canadians travelling by 
water in a manner similar to the protection that has existed for 
decades in the aviation industry.  Many Canadians have been 
waiting a very long time for the House to resolve that issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I say that Canadians have been waiting a long time 
for the MLA is that this is its third incarnation.  It has died 
on the order paper twice, the first time as Bill C-59, the 
carriage of passengers by water act, and the second time in 
October of last year.  Both times were the as a result of a 
premature, unnecessary election call by the present Prime 
Minister.  I am hopeful that the Minister of Transport and his 
government are serious about passing the legislation this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think about it, marine travel is one of the oldest modes 
of transportation in the world.  One only needs to think of 
Samuel de Champlain, Eric the Red and Christopher Columbus to 
realize just how long we have been travelling the high seas. 
However, it is now the year 2001 and we are without comprehensive 
laws defining liability for those travelling and working in the 
shipping industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If one has spent any time in Vancouver or elsewhere on the west 
coast, one will appreciate the incredible volume of cruise ships 
that travel the Strait of Georgia and the inland waterways toward 
Alaska.  The port of Vancouver alone handled over 800,000 cruise 
ship passengers just last year.  The cruise industry has also 
grown on the east coast of Canada, with the ports of Halifax, 
Saint John and Quebec City showing considerable growth in cruise 
ship traffic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On both coasts, greater numbers of people are taking to the 
water on ferries, whale watching ships, fishing boats and 
pleasure craft.  It is hard to believe that these vessels and 
their millions of passengers operate without a legislative 
framework defining liability for damage to property, injury, loss 
of life and the economic and legal consequences of maritime 
accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also hard to believe that the government opposite has 
allowed the bill, as I said earlier, to die twice on the order 
paper, leaving a void of liability in one of Canada's busiest 
modes of transportation.  We are fortunate that the void in 
shipping liability does not extend to the protection of our 
coastlines and marine environment.  We have had for some time 
legislation establishing civil liability for pollution from 
ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the merits of Bill S-2 is that it extracts these laws 
from the Canada Shipping Act and combines it with other relevant 
marine liability legislation into a single act.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do, however, have concerns about whether the wording of the 
provisions for civil liability accurately reflect the intent of 
the legislation.  The clause in the bill devoted to establishing 
civil liability for pollution from a ship deals with all types of 
pollution, yet the clause creating this liability itself speaks 
only of oil pollution.  We believe that this clause requires 
closer examination to ensure that the marine environment is 
adequately protected from all sources of pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The remaining pieces of legislation that found their way into 
the marine liability act included the Carriage of Goods by Water 
Act provisions for the limitation of liability and marine 
accidents and the Canada Shipping Act provisions for fatal 
accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to consolidating existing liability laws into a 
single reference, Bill S-2 also introduces two new liability 
regimes that are long overdue.  I am referring to the rules 
regarding apportionment of liability and to the rules defining 
the liability of shipowners for the passengers they carry on 
their ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of rules for apportioning liability will 
finally bring the federal court up to speed with developments in 
the provincial court systems.  The provincial courts have had 
rules regarding apportionment of a liability for years, but 
because marine claims are considered to be exclusively a federal 
jurisdiction, claimants and their families have been unable to 
rely on these rules when suing for compensation for injuries or 
in the case of the death of a family member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of this void in federal law, claimants have had to 
rely on antiquated common law principles.  These laws provide 
that if the defendant can prove that the claimant contributed in 
any way to his or her injuries, awards would be forfeited.  That 
is a very unjust and unacceptable situation.  With the passing of 
this federal bill, courts will now have the ability to hold each 
party accountable for their actions.  The percentage of liability 
will correspond with the percentage of fault. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to illustrate this with an example.  If a tour boat were 
to sink as the result of the captain's negligence and all the 
people on board wearing life jackets survived except the one 
individual who refused to wear a life jacket, the captain would 
be liable for the accident but not 100% liable for the loss of 
life.  By refusing to wear the life jacket some liability would 
be assumed by the passenger and under the existing law he or she 
would not be entitled to any compensation.  Clearly this is 
unacceptable and we are pleased to see that the government is 
finally taking steps to correct that situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another new provision of the bill is the introduction of a 
system for establishing a shipowner's liability for commercial 
passengers.  As I mentioned previously, it is unconscionable that 
a country which sees in excess of 40 million passengers carried 
by water each year does not have legislation protecting those 
passengers.  While we are pleased to see the reintroduction of 
the passenger liability provisions, we do not believe that this 
protection goes far enough.  Put simply, the limits are too low 
and there is no guarantee that the claimant will ever see the 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The passenger liability section of the bill caps the maximum 
amount a shipowner will ever have to pay a claimant at $350,000, 
regardless of the extent or severity of his or her injuries. This 
is a result of basing our domestic legislation on an 
international agreement that has not been updated since 1990.  I 
encourage the government to take the lead internationally on this 
issue and set limits that would provide real benefit to 
passengers injured in Canadian waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When comparing the amount of compensation available to 
passengers on ships, it is interesting to note that there is no 
limit for liability for passengers travelling by air. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our other concern, and the most significant one, is that there 
is no requirement for shipowners to provide proof that they can 
meet their financial commitment to passengers after an accident. 
I believe this omission seriously undermines the entire premise 
of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the government to act quickly to establish an enforceable 
regulatory framework for issuing operating certificates and 
requiring proof compulsory insurance or financial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The area of commercial shipping is not the only area of water 
activity where the government is not doing enough to protect 
Canadians. 
The government is very quick to assert its authority over all 
Canadian waters, including the lakes and rivers of the provinces, 
but it is very slow to develop policy relating to the use of 
those waters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here I would like to give a personal example.  When I was a 
young man I was fortunate enough to be able to save enough money 
to purchase a boat for waterskiing.  I learned to water ski at 
quite a young age.  It is interesting to note that while I had to 
insure and license the trailer for the boat there was no 
requirement, other than a sort of convenience requirement, to 
register the boat itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My understanding is that this continues to this day, that there 
are a lot of boats for which the province or the federal 
government requires no registration.  It is a matter of 
convenience.  The view is that if the boat owner registers and 
gets a bow number for the boat, in the event of an accident or 
misuse of the boat the number would be helpful to the authorities 
in ascertaining the actual legitimate owner of the boat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in many cases I have found that the new owner of a boat 
does not actually transfer that number with the registry of 
shipping for small watercraft.  It is never transferred to the 
new owner.  There are probably thousands, if not tens of 
thousands, of watercraft on our rivers and lakes that have never 
had their ownership transferred to the new owners.  There is no 
real strong deterrent to force them to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no requirement for insurance, none whatsoever, when one 
operates a small pleasure craft.  It astounds me that this 
situation is allowed to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By way of an example of that, one day we were waterskiing on the 
lake that is near my hometown of Fort Saint John.  As is often 
the case when slaloming, if people are not used to starting out 
on one ski they start on two skis and drop one.  At some point in 
time hopefully they can remember where the other ski is and go 
back and pick it up.  On that particular day, we came back after 
the skier had finished.  I was operating my boat.  We picked up 
the ski, threw it up on the bow of the boat and took off.  The 
wind caught the ski, flipped it and quite severely cut a friend 
of mine.  He had to be taken to the hospital and get some 
stitches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very fortunate that he was a good friend of mine.  I was 
quite young at the time and was not worth a lot of money anyway, 
so even if he had not been a good friend and had decided to sue 
me for damages, I do not think he would have got a lot.  That is 
the whole point of the story. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  But is he still your friend? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  He is still my friend and that is quite 
remarkable.  I thank the hon. government House leader for his 
interventions.  It certainly keeps the debate a bit more lively 
and keeps me on track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of the story is that today in Canada, with the 
situation of small pleasure craft not being required to be 
properly licensed and insured, if someone is injured or is 
fatally injured and dies, there is no way other than civil 
litigation in which to sue the owner of the boat for damages if 
it is proven that he or she was operating the craft in a 
negligent way.  One never knows if that person has any net worth 
to make it worthwhile suing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that there is something wrong with that.  In 
every other mode of transportation in Canada, there is a 
requirement that the operator be licensed and insured, either 
federally or provincially.  What is it that makes watercraft so 
special that they are exempt from these concepts?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage the government to bring in legislation that would 
grant the provinces the ability to regulate recreational boaters. 
It is time that we recognized that Sea-Doos should be treated 
equally to Ski-Doos and that yachts are no different from cars 
when it comes to responsible and safe operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I did not express that we take exception to 
the fact that the bill originated in the other place.  I note 
that this is the second time the bill originated in that other 
place and that during this session the Senate gave first, second 
and third reading to the bill in a single day.  I also note that 
the bill is not identical to Bill S-17, the previous incarnation 
that was introduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the previous version of the bill there were provisions in 
part 1 dealing with the relationship of dependency that could not 
be defined because the matter was under debate in this House. 
This is a prime example of why this place is the only place where 
it is acceptable for legislation to originate and to be debated, 
amended and voted on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Had the previous version been introduced in this House, it would 
have been debated after the debate on dependency had been 
concluded.  This would have ensured that the bill would have been 
passed correctly the first time and would not have required 
amendment after the fact, as it were. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the rationale behind utilizing the other place when 
this House is congested with business, but at the beginning of a 
session, indeed, at the beginning of a parliament, I do not feel 
that this is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that this House is the only one with elected 
representatives who are accountable to their constituents.  The 
other place lacks the legitimacy, credibility and accountability 
to serve as the originator of government legislation.  Until such 
time as the other place is true triple E—elected, equal and 
effective—my colleagues and I will be opposed to its 
intervention in legislative matters prior to their consideration 
in this Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The majority of marine industries affected by this legislation 
support it, as do the majority of the provinces.  The sole 
exception is Quebec, which believes the bill interferes in 
provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in my remarks I addressed the official opposition's 
concerns with the bill.  Although these concerns are serious, it 
is our intention to support this legislation at second reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to sum up by saying that we will be supporting this 
legislation.  I look forward to other interventions from my 
colleagues about this legislation as they point out whatever they 
feel are the flaws or the attributes of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also look forward to having the Standing Committee on 
Transport and Government Operations deal with the legislation.  I 
suspect it will be the first legislation referred to the standing 
committee once we pass it at second reading.  In that light I 
must relay a concern that I have in regard to the inaugural 
meeting of the standing committee on transport, which occurred 
just yesterday. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I need to explain something to the viewing audience, the people 
out in the real world, because they probably will not be able to 
make the connection as to why what I am about to relate to them 
should be of importance to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At an inaugural meeting of a standing committee a number of 
things take place.  The clerk takes the chair initially until 
such time as a chairman is chosen by the committee.  I have no 
dispute with the fine gentleman who spoke just before me and who 
has been acclaimed as the chairman of the standing committee on 
transport.  Likewise, there are two vice-chair positions and two 
individuals are elected to fill those roles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of other procedural things take place at the inaugural 
meeting, one of which is what I want to discuss right now for a 
few moments.  It is the matter of time allocated for questioning 
witness who appear before the committee.  A motion was put 
forward yesterday at the standing committee for transport which 
basically suggested that after a witness appears before the 
committee and makes a presentation, there will be questions—as 
at all committees—but the time allocated to the parties to 
question the witnesses will be equal.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, the original motion was that it would start with 
the Canadian Alliance, the official opposition, for 10 minutes of 
questioning, then go to the government, the Liberals, for 10 
minutes, and then to the other three parties, the Bloc Quebecois, 
the New Democratic Party and the Progressive Conservatives, each 
for 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that had been allowed to stand, it is very easy to see that 
on one front people watching on television might think it is 
fair, because there are five recognized political parties in the 
House of Commons and they would all receive 10 minutes to 
question a witness.  I respect the fact that committees are a 
power unto themselves and they decide, but I think it is 
important that we relate these types of stories to the Canadian 
electorate so that it understands what takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that on any committee on which I have served 
there was some balance for the representation in the House of 
Commons.  In other words, if the government is a majority and has 
over 50% of the seats in the House of Commons, legitimately it 
has a larger number of people serving on the committee, seven or 
eight members versus three for the Canadian Alliance, a couple 
for the Bloc Quebecois and one each for the two smaller parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a fairness aspect.  If there are seven or eight members 
of the Liberal Party sitting on that committee and participating, 
and they all have to share, as in this case, a 10 minute spot to 
ask questions, it stands to reason that many of them would not 
get to ask even one question of a witness on behalf of their 
constituents.  I think that is unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original motion was defeated.  I voiced that objection on 
the part of both the Liberal government and the Canadian 
Alliance:  that if that motion were allowed to go forward it 
would be unfair to the parties that have the largest number of 
people or the largest representation in the House of Commons.  It 
was defeated, whereupon an amendment was put forward and the 
motion was re-introduced.  It basically said that questioning of 
witnesses would go to the Canadian Alliance, as Her Majesty's 
loyal official opposition, for 10 minutes, then to the Liberals 
on the committee for 10 minutes, then to the next party, the Bloc 
Quebecois, for 10 minutes, and then to the Liberals for 10 
minutes, to the New Democrats for 10 minutes and the Liberals for 
10 minutes.  It would alternate back and forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While that solved one problem in the sense of being fair to the 
Liberal members who sit on the committee, because we would now 
have a situation where the Liberals, the government, would get 
half the questioning time of the witnesses who appeared, it was 
grossly unfair to the official opposition.  Anybody who does any 
math can understand that there are 66 members of the official 
opposition, whereas the two smaller parties have 12 members and 
13 members each.  If the Alliance has its full allotment of MPs 
sitting on that committee, we have three people present to share 
one 10 minute slot to question someone, whereas the NDP and PCs 
get a full 10 minutes for one member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised that as a concern, but it did not seem to resonate well 
with the other four parties, as one can imagine, because of 
partisanship.  The Liberals got what they wanted, and of course 
the other parties, in particular the two smaller parties, had 
representation totally out of balance with the representation 
they have in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised that matter, but we were constrained by time because 
the bells were ringing for a vote.  Even when a standing 
committee is sitting, a call to come to the Chamber for a vote 
takes precedence; the committee meeting has to adjourn so that 
members can attend to the House and their duties here.  I respect 
that fact.  It is unfortunate that the debate was cut short on 
such an important matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been made aware through the official opposition whip's 
office that negotiations have been taking place and I appreciate 
that.  Hopefully we can resolve this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that standing committees, as much as possible, 
operate in a non-partisan manner.  I made the comment that it was 
grossly unfair to the official opposition.  It might have been 
fun for the other four parties to all agree because they can 
simply raise their hands and vote.  Our party has only three 
members on the committee, and whether we vote for or against is 
irrelevant.  The government can set whatever procedures it wants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Canadian Alliance is to properly represent the millions 
of Canadians who voted for it and who believe in its principles 
and policies, then the time its members are allotted to question 
witnesses should be in equal proportion to the support they have 
enjoyed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz:</B>  Democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill:</B>  My colleague from Yorkton—Melville is 
right.  A fundamental issue of democracy is to have proper 
representation, and that is the way in which a standing committee 
should operate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of members of parliament from all parties question the 
work that can be accomplished and the amount of effort that is 
expended on standing committees.  I have not had the opportunity 
to be around this place nearly as long as the hon. government 
House leader but it has been my observation over the past seven 
years that there is a huge variance in how standing committees 
operate.  Part of it comes down to the way the chairperson chairs 
the meetings.  The chairperson can set the stage for the 
operation of the committee, which may then operate in a quite 
non-partisan way and accomplish a lot of good on behalf of 
Canadians and parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conversely, I and many of my colleagues have had the misfortune 
of sitting on standing committees that operate in a very partisan 
manner.  In many cases, for members from all parties who sit on 
such committees and endeavour to get something done, it is 
questionable whether they should even waste their time showing 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Standing Committee on Transport and Government 
Operations starting off by taking this step, it was a gross 
unfairness to the official opposition.  I made the comment that I 
shuddered to see where it would lead if the stamp that was put on 
the operation of the committee at its inaugural meeting was one 
of unfairness and partisanship.  How can members of that 
committee be expected to put in the effort, to work hard and 
endeavour to accomplish something on behalf of parliament and of 
the citizens of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often we are constrained by time.  When legislation 
comes forward we are given a 20 minute time slot in the House. 
When that is further divided in half it gives us 10 minutes to 
discuss issues of importance.  We all know it is sometimes 
extremely difficult to get a point across in 10 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize and have often had the opportunity to remark, when I 
speak in my riding of Prince George—Peace River, that in some 
ways I am becoming a politician.  It now takes me 20 minutes to 
say what I used to say in three or four.  Bearing that in mind, 
it is probably good that we are a bit constrained.  Otherwise we 
would go on and on, dare I say, ad nauseam. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to bring that issue to the attention of colleagues, as 
well as to the Standing Committee on Transport and Government 
Operations, which will soon be discussing, debating and calling 
witnesses on Bill S-2 and other legislation and projects that the 
committee wants to undertake on behalf of parliament.  I wanted 
to sort of red flag that issue in the hope that we could 
negotiate some other agreement between members of that committee, 
but also between members of all the other standing committees. 
We need to get a structure in place.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think my two colleagues and I are asking for anything 
outlandish.  We are simply asking for fairness in respect to the 
numbers.  I suggested that perhaps questioning at that committee, 
and indeed at all committees, should bear some resemblance to 
what was agreed upon for question period where there is a 
weighting according to the number of seats each party has in the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it should be similar to what happens in standing 
committees, with the exception I fully respect that they are 
supposed to operate in a non-partisan manner.  In fairness to 
Liberal members sitting on those committees, they should have at 
a minimum 50% of the questioning time because they have a larger 
number of members present listening to the presentations of 
witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw my remarks to a close.  Hopefully the government will see 
fit to communicate not only to members of the standing committee 
on transport but of all standing committees that they should 
endeavour to launch the committees and indeed operate in as 
non-partisan a manner as possible, in fairness to all committee 
members regardless of the party they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to see this thorny issue dealt with as quickly as 
possible.  Then the committee could get on with the important 
work I am sure it will have over the life of this parliament.

could just as well have originated in the House of Commons. 
Then it would probably have had a chance to get passed before 
the last election.  Once again, this is an example of how the 
parliamentary system complicates things, particularly for a bill 
of such benefit not only to the people of Canada but to people 
everywhere. 
Members understand because this bill deals among other things 
with oil spills, a major environmental concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the hon. member for Saskatoon—Humboldt kept 
saying this morning, members know that any reform of the 
Canadian parliamentary system would require a close look at the 
Senate and at the millions of dollars it costs the parliamentary 
system, as well as all the endless delays without which Bills 
S-17 and S-2 for instance would have been passed much more 
quickly in the best interest of the people in Quebec and in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of Quebecers and Canadians, I would like to 
briefly review the purpose of Bill S-2. The first part deals 
with personal injuries and accidents. 
It would allow the dependants of any person injured or killed in 
a marine accident to recover damages, which is not possible 
under the current legislation which will be replaced by this 
bill as soon as possible, hopefully in the days or the weeks to 
come.

<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will surely understand that, in the interest of all 
families, the Bloc Quebecois agrees with these new provisions 
that would allow, as I said, dependants of any person injured or 
killed in a marine accident to recover damages, as is often done 
under civil law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part sets the rules for the appointment of liability. 
Obviously, this is based on the principle that, if several 
persons or ships were responsible for an accident, their 
liability should be proportionate to the degree to which they 
are respectively at fault. If it is impossible to determine who 
was at fault, then the parties involved should be jointly liable 
for losses and damages, as is the case in Quebec civil society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois cannot be against such a principle, which 
respects the logic of Quebec law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 3 of the bill deals with the limitation of liability for 
maritime claims. The purpose of these provisions is to limit 
maximum liability in terms of cash amounts or units of account. 
Obviously, this can be somewhat complicated for the general 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Units of account are special drawing rights issued by the 
International Monetary Fund under the 1976 convention concluded 
in London and under the Canada Shipping Act. This liability in 
terms of cash amounts or units of accounts will now cover owners 
of docks, canals and ports who are responsible for an accident. 
Again, this would ensure that all parties responsible for an 
accident assume their share of liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois totally agrees with this position with regard 
to maritime claims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 4 of the bill deals with liability for carriage of 
passengers by water. 
The objective is to apply the liability of carriers that was 
included in the 1974 Athens Convention regarding the carriage by 
sea of passengers and their baggage to the carriage by water 
under a contract involving passengers or passengers and their 
baggage from a place in Canada to any other place in Canada, and 
which could even transit through a destination outside the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This includes compensation for passengers and their baggage. 
Therefore, from now on, all those who engage in the 
transportation of passengers by water will be responsible for 
damage caused to passengers and to their baggage under any 
contract or tour that would begin and end in Canada, even if the 
purpose of the tour is to go outside Canada, or to travel to 
foreign destinations. If they come back, these carriers will be 
held responsible for the passengers and their baggage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois supports this proposal, which is in the best 
interests of Quebecers and Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 5 of the bill deals with the liability for the carriage of 
goods. The idea is to implement the Hague-Visby rules and the 
Hamburg rules to the transportation of goods by water. This 
applies to a much more commercial type of transportation that 
involves ships and large shipments. In this bill, carriage by 
water is the same as carriage by sea. Shipowners will be 
responsible for marine transportation in Canada's territorial 
waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part 6 deals with liability and compensation for pollution. 
Pollution is among the most important issues in this bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1315"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT39"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The goal is to make shipowners responsible for damage caused by 
an oil spill but that liability is limited in the case of 
shipowners governed by the international convention on the 
limitation of liability, the 1969 Brussels convention which was 
amended in November 1976 and in November 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ships governed by that convention are required to provide a 
compliance certificate that compels them to have an insurance 
contract or a guarantor who shares with them responsibility for 
any damage. 
This would permit those suffering damage to take action against 
the shipowner, the insurer and the guarantor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The principle of Quebec civil law permitting proceedings 
against all those responsible, including the insurers and 
the guarantors is 
applied to the principle of shipping and marine damage.  The 
Bloc Quebecois fully supports the bill's recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second section of part 6 of the bill concerns compensation 
for pollution.  It involves the implementation of the 
international oil pollution compensation fund.  The public must 
understand that the transportation of oil will be covered by an 
international compensation fund. Clause 73 provides as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>73. If a claimant commences an action against the owner of a 
Convention ship or the owner's guarantor...the International 
Fund may appear— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The international fund is required to pay compensation through 
the fund administrator drawn on a compensation fund opened from 
a Government of Canada account and known as the ship-source oil 
pollution fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 88 of Bill S-2, under the heading “Claims for Loss of 
Income”, enables an individual deriving income from fishing, the 
production of fish or the culture of marine plants, the owner 
of a fishing vessel and the individual processing fish on shore, 
who suffer a loss of current or future income or a loss of 
supply as the result of a discharge of oil from a ship to be 
compensated by the said fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All citizens, all workers in the fishing sector, all those who 
benefit from the product of fishing, may now, in the event of an 
environmental disaster resulting from a shipping accident 
causing a discharge of oil, be compensated by a special fund, 
the ship-source oil pollution fund. 
This is a bank account opened by the Government of Canada.  I 
will explain later how shipowners will deposit money in this 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois agrees fully with this provision of the bill. 
It is time that not only all those who depend on products of the 
fishery for their livelihood are provided with some security, 
but also all those who benefit from commercial fishing, even 
those who farm aquatic plants, those who may benefit from the 
ocean's resources.  These people will be compensated if ever 
there is spill resulting from a shipping accident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though we are in agreement with the bill, there are always 
important questions to ask.  We will no doubt have an 
opportunity to discuss these in committee before the bill is 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 91 sets a maximum on the amount that the ship-source oil 
pollution fund may pay. 
This maximum is the same as the maximum in effect on March 31, 
1990.  This bill adds annual indexing based on the “Consumer 
Price Index, excluding the food and energy components”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is all very fine and well to decide to have a fund, to pay 
compensation and to set a ceiling, but the problem is that this is 
the same amount that applied on March 31, 1990, indexed but 
“excluding the food and energy components”. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1320"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inconceivable that the energy component would be excluded 
for a company or industry whose business involves energy, 
petroleum products and their transportation, given the millions 
and billions of dollars in profits they have made in recent 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government will have the courage to force them 
to pay compensation that is indexed to include the energy 
component in the consumer price index. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the heading “Payments into the Ship-source Oil Pollution 
Fund”, sections 93 and following require shipowners to pay a 
levy of 40 cents per metric ton in excess of 300 metric tons 
for shipments of oil imported by ship into Canada as bulk cargo 
or shipped by ship from any place in Canada in bulk as cargo. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously this amount of 40 cents can be considered important, 
but once again we are back with the same problem as with the 
maximum amount.  It is the same amount the industry was paying 
back on March 31, 1990.  The bill states that the amount will be 
indexed annually according to the consumer price index, but 
again excluding the food and energy components. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will be insisting in committee on an amendment 
to this part of the bill so as to include the energy component 
for shipowners who are precisely the ones drawing benefit from 
this industry, which has become highly profitable in recent 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would represent a simple gesture of good faith toward all 
those who might incur damages and would like to see added to the 
annually indexed 1990 figures the cost of the energy component, 
which in this country has been one of the major causes of the 
increased cost of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who are listening will surely agree with us that the 
energy component has been the one most responsible for the rise 
in the cost of living, in the higher costs for Quebec and 
Canadian families. 
Energy costs have in large part been responsible for the 
increase in household costs in the past year and one-half, if not 
longer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, the Government of Canada has even acknowledged this 
with the cheques it recently issued.  This got a poor reception 
from the people who actually have to pay energy costs, who have 
to buy fuel oil, but many of whom were not included in this 
Liberal government largesse.  Once again, because of the 
elections, they made another promise without calculating the 
impact on the good citizens of Quebec and of Canada.  We trust 
that the energy component will be included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the opportunity to pass the following message on to the 
Liberal government. Correct this error as quickly as possible. 
It is serious for anyone heating with oil, anyone facing 
increases in heating costs and should have received a cheque, 
regardless of their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people have had a significant increase, sometimes as much 
as 80%, in the cost they pay for heating in recent years.  Once 
again the industry benefited and not the public of Quebec and 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will agree with part 6, apart from the fact that, according 
to the consumer price index, the energy factor should be added 
to this indexing and not excluded from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The seventh part of the bill validates certain regulations, 
including those of the Canada Ports Corporation Act of 1983 and 
1985, in addition to the regulations made under the Pilotage 
Act, the Laurentian Pilotage Tariff Regulations, 1992.  We fully 
support the bill, which validates the tariffs for the 
Laurentian Pilotage Authority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois would like to point out the work of the 
Canadian Marine Pilots' Association and the International 
Maritime Pilots' Association, including the work of the lower 
St. Lawrence pilots and the pilots of central Quebec, who have 
had to fight for over 30 years for their profession.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shipowners and members of the industry are constantly harassing 
pilots in the St. Lawrence Seaway and in central Quebec, in an 
attempt to eliminate their work, on the grounds that it is an 
excessive cost for their industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a ship plies the St. Lawrence River and its affluents, it 
is taken care of by a pilot who is a member of the pilots' 
association to which I just referred. This pilot has the 
experience, skill, wisdom and knowledge required to avoid marine 
disasters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that in the bill we accept and recognize the 
Laurentian Pilotage Tariff Regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take this opportunity to ask the Liberal government to stop 
listening to shipowners who, again, are trying to make profits 
at the expense of pilots from the maritimes, the St. Lawrence 
River and central Quebec. These pilots are competent and they 
take charge of ships precisely to avoid natural disasters and 
oil spills in the St. Lawrence River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must stop criticizing and instead consolidate the work of 
these pilots, who are not the only ones in the world doing that 
job. There are pilots' associations on the Mississippi and 
elsewhere in the world, including in countries with large rivers 
and affluents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, we must try to send a clear message to these pilots, 
whose role it is to protect our environment and particularly to 
be responsible for a ship, regardless of its destination, 
whether it is Canadian or foreign owned, that they must take 
responsibility for it and ensure its safe arrival at ports along 
the St. Lawrence and all its tributaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this is the best security we can obtain as 
Quebecers and Canadians.  We must ensure our constituents, the 
people we know, Quebecers and Canadians, those around us, that 
there are people who are working to try to stave off future 
environmental disasters, the human errors made by captains 
unfamiliar with the difficulties of the St. Lawrence and its 
tributaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are therefore taking this opportunity to pass this message on 
to the government and also to congratulate and thank marine 
pilots of whatever allegiance—because there are several marine 
pilots' associations—but especially those working on the St. 
Lawrence and its tributaries, the St. Lawrence and central 
Quebec pilots' associations, and all those doing a good job of 
trying to protect the environment of Quebec and of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is in agreement with part 8 of the bill 
concerning transitional provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been my pleasure to present my position on a bill which, 
I repeat, should be passed as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said at the beginning, it is sad that the Canadian 
parliamentary system, such as it is, delayed the passage of this 
bill before the last election.  This is a bill originating in 
the Senate, with the result that there are very tight deadlines. 
The result was that a good bill, supported by all parties in 
the House, was significantly held up.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance)</B> moved that Bill C-237, an act to amend the Divorce 
Act (joint custody), be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, at the outset of my remarks I thank my 
hon. colleague for Skeena for seconding my bill today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to have the opportunity this afternoon to address 
my proposal for what I believe to be an important amendment to 
the Divorce Act.  This is contained in private member's Bill 
C-237. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to establish a new basis for sharing 
the custody of children following the divorce or separation of 
their parents.  The bill would ensure that courts grant custody 
of a child to both parents unless there exists evidence that to 
do so would not be in the best interests of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985, Bill C-41 amended the Divorce Act, making it easier for 
Canadian couples to file for and receive divorces.  The changes 
removed most of the blame from divorce proceedings.  Since then, 
in effect, we have had no fault divorce.  It is estimated that as 
many as 90% of divorces are now granted without a formal court 
hearing.  Putting this 90% figure into perspective, 69,872 of the 
77,636 divorces granted in 1995 did not proceed to the courts. 
The downside is that the remaining 10%, or 7,764, were the 
subject of protracted and at times difficult litigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same year, more than 47,000 children were the subjects of 
custody orders.  Using the same 10% figure, it means that 
approximately 4,700 children were exposed to ongoing tension, 
fighting and at times even violence between their parents.  It is 
the children who are the sole inspiration for the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the review of the Divorce Act in 1985, significant 
lobbying took place to encourage parliament to take action to 
protect the interests of children involved in divorce and custody 
battles.  Parliament agreed that the subject required extensive 
review and established a Special Joint Committee on Child Custody 
and Access that eventually released a report in December 1998 
entitled, “For the Sake of the Children”.  Unfortunately, this 
was two years following the passing of the amendments to the 
Divorce Act and many of its recommendations have yet to become 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was comprised of senators and members of the House 
of Commons from all parties.  They set aside their partisan 
differences to examine and analyze the impact of custody 
arrangements on children of divorced or separated parents.  I 
would be remiss if I did not take this opportunity to commend all 
members of the special committee for their work on this very 
difficult and sensitive subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee approached its work with great determination and 
travelled from St. John's to Vancouver and conducted 39 meetings 
where it heard from no fewer than 500 witnesses.  These witnesses 
included individual parents, children, fathers' organizations, 
women's groups and professionals, including lawyers, judges, 
social workers, psychologists, physicians and others.  The 
committee paid particular attention to what was being said by all 
of the witnesses and one resounding conclusion was reached. 
Dramatic changes were needed in the way parenting arrangements 
are decided following divorce.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee concluded that there was difficulty with the 
current provisions of the Divorce Act, as it focuses solely on 
granting custody of the children to one parent and access to the 
children by the other parent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Courts rarely impose joint custody orders in the absence of the 
consent of both parents.  It is thought that unless the parents 
could work together amicably and constructively enough to set up 
their own custody and access arrangement, joint custody would not 
be in the best interests of the children.  There is considerable 
evidence to suggest that this assumption is deeply flawed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marital breakdown is not an appropriate time for parents to be 
making decision regarding the division of parental 
responsibility.  Far too often the courts are granting custody 
arrangements that will result in the estrangement of children 
from not only the non-custodial parent but also the members of a 
non-custodial parent's family, such as stepbrothers or sisters, 
aunts, uncles and grandparents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-237 seeks to establish that the custody of the children 
will automatically be granted jointly to both parents.  This 
represents a fundamental change to the current system of custody. 
We will no longer look upon the process as determining custody 
and access but as establishing joint parenting responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Children define themselves by their parents.  It follows that it 
is in the child's best interests to have continuing contact with 
both parents, based on the child's existing relationship with 
each parent as it has developed during the course of that child's 
lifetime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for me to clarify that joint custody does 
not necessarily mean that parents start out with 50% access to 
their children.  It means that the parents will have equal 
decision making authority with respect to the child on issues 
such as schooling, religious upbringing and medical care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is estimated that under the current system, 86% of children 
reside with their mother, 7% with their father, and that only 6% 
live under some form of joint custody arrangement.  We recognize 
that these patterns generally reflect the division of child care 
responsibilities in intact households and that many divorcing 
parents agree to these arrangements because it continues with 
arrangements that existed pre-divorce or is otherwise in the best 
interests of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By amending the Divorce Act to automatically grant joint custody 
we will be establishing a new starting point for discussions 
regarding custody of children.  In these discussions both parents 
will be working from a position of equal footing and the children 
will no longer be pawns in divorce proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed amendments also contain a number of additional 
provisions relating to the authority of the courts in determining 
the best interests of the children.  The court retains the 
ability to amend the custody agreement where it can be 
demonstrated that the child has suffered mistreatment by one of 
the parents.  The court also has the ability to amend the custody 
agreement for a definite or indefinite period of time or until 
the happening of a specific event or it can attach conditions 
that it feels are fit and just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also additional protection for parents who enter into 
joint custody arrangements.  For example, the courts may include 
in any order a requirement that the custodial parent provide 
advance notice to the non-custodial parent of any intended change 
of address.  In addition to being of obvious benefit to the 
non-custodial parent, this also provides a benefit to the 
children, as it allows sufficient time for changes to be made to 
parenting agreements and to analyze the impact of the move on the 
child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In advancing these amendments to the Divorce Act, Canada joins 
countries such as Australia, the United Kingdom and many states 
in the United States in the establishment of joint custody laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is about putting the interests of the children ahead of 
the interests of two divorcing parents.  It is about preserving 
the role and contribution of both parents and their extended 
families in the upbringing of children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would hope that all members of the House would join me in 
supporting the legislation for the sake of the children.

to do so would not be in the best interests of the child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-237 would amend existing subsections 16(1) and 16(4) of 
the act that currently authorize courts to grant custody of or 
access to any or all children of the marriage to any one or more 
persons, by deleting the references to custody so that these 
subsections would pertain only to access orders.  In effect, the 
bill creates a rebuttable legal presumption of joint custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada announced a strategy for family law 
reform with respect to child custody and access in May 1999 when 
the Minister of Justice tabled the government's “Strategy for 
Reform”.  This strategy includes fundamental principles for 
reform and emphasizes the need for a comprehensive government 
response to address those important issues that have an impact on 
children's lives.  In light of this commitment to a comprehensive 
strategy, the Minister of Justice is not in a position to support 
Bill C-237. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The effect of Bill C-237 is to create a legal presumption of 
joint custody.  There are four fundamental problems with this 
legal presumption. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is inconsistent with the government's strategy for 
reform which rejects the idea that a one size fits all approach 
may be applied to all families experiencing separation and 
divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, it is inconsistent with the recommendations of the 
special joint committee's report “For the Sake of the 
Children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the bill is inconsistent with the government's commitment 
to work closely with the provinces and territories to develop 
co-ordinated reforms that respect the constitutional division of 
powers and responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the bill potentially creates confusion by imposing a 
legal presumption of joint custody without defining what is meant 
by that term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have noted that Bill C-237 is inconsistent with the 
government's strategy for reform of the family law system dealing 
with child custody and access.  Let me explain.  The reform 
strategy was announced by the Minister of Justice in May 1999 
when she tabled the government's response to the report of the 
Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access, “For the 
Sake of the Children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's plan for identifying reforms, and in 
particular, reforms respecting amendments to the Divorce Act, is 
based on the primary principle that the individual needs, best 
interests and well-being of the children are paramount.  The 
government's response notes that the Government of Canada has 
developed a strategy that is rooted in four principles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first principle is the desire to promote child centred 
reforms that focus on minimizing the negative impact of divorce 
on children.  This strategy identifies the need to reform the 
legal rules, principles and processes that will better structure 
the decision making process in a child centred way and shift the 
focus of the family law system from parental rights to parental 
responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second principle is the government's commitment to work 
closely with the provinces and territories to pursue 
co-ordinated, multijurisdictional efforts while respecting the 
division of powers and responsibilities in this area of shared 
constitutional jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third principle refers to the critical need to explore a 
broad range of measures to support families going through 
separation and divorce, because statutory amendments alone cannot 
address many of the problems that are, in reality, only partly 
legal in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fourth principle is of the utmost importance for the matters 
we are currently discussing.  It is the recognition that each 
family has unique characteristics and experiences divorce and 
separation much differently.  It is exactly the reason why we do 
not want to apply a one size fits all approach such as that 
suggested by Bill C-237 to all Canadian families experiencing 
divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conflict levels of separating parents vary widely, as do 
individual children's needs.  As well, children undergo 
developmental change over time and adjustments may be needed to 
allow for changing relationships and circumstances.  The 
Government of Canada's reform strategy recognizes that no one 
model of post-separation parenting will be ideal for all 
children.  For this reason, the minister cannot support the one 
size fits all approach that Bill C-237 attempts to introduce into 
the Divorce Act with the creation of a presumption of joint 
custody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As indicated, the proposed bill is inconsistent with the 
recommendations of the special joint committee's report “For the 
Sake of the Children”.  The special joint committee heard many 
arguments in favour of various different legal presumptions such 
as the one proposed by Bill C-237 when it held public hearings 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee held 55 meetings and heard from many 
witnesses across the country, including individual parents and 
children, women's groups, fathers' organizations, lawyers, 
judges, social workers, psychologists and physicians.  The 
hearings highlighted the difficult, emotional and contentious 
nature of custody and access issues and confirmed that the very 
different and often conflicting views continue to be held, both 
about the problems and about the reforms that are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special joint committee's report entitled “For the Sake of 
the Children” acknowledged that one of the most frequent 
requests at these hearings was that the Divorce Act be amended to 
add a legal presumption. 
However, the special joint committee decided not to recommend a 
legal presumption.  Instead, the report states on page 42: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presumptions in favour of joint custody or the primary caregiver 
have been adopted in a number of US jurisdictions, but in some 
cases legislatures have subsequently withdrawn them after finding 
that they were not having the intended desirable effects. 
Presumptions that any one form of parenting arrangement is going 
to be in the best interests of all children could obscure the 
significant differences between families...Presumptions can also 
have a negative effect of compelling families who might otherwise 
have been able to make constructive, amicable arrangements to 
apply to a court, if they want to avoid the application of a 
presumptive form of parenting arrangements.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The special committee carefully considered and rejected the use 
of legal presumption, such as the one that Bill C-237 attempts to 
introduce into the Divorce Act.  This is another reason why 
Bill-237 should not be supported. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is committed to working closely with the 
provinces and territories.  I am concerned that Bill-237 is 
inconsistent with the government's commitment to collaboration 
and partnerships in this area of law.  This is one of the four 
fundamental principles of the government strategy for reform, to 
work closely with the provinces and territories to pursue a 
co-ordinated, multi-jurisdictional effort while respecting the 
division of powers and responsibilities in the area of shared 
constitutional jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal and provincial governments have specific 
constitutional powers with respect to family law, and the 
territorial governments have specific responsibilities under 
their original acts.  The federal Divorce Act generally applies 
where parents are divorcing and need to settle issues such as 
child custody, access and support.  Provincial and territorial 
laws apply when unmarried parents separate or married parents 
separate and do not pursue a divorce, as well as to some issues 
involving divorce proceedings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Currently the federal Divorce Act and provincial and territorial 
legislation all have the same general legal principles to govern 
custody and access disputes.  Bill C-237 would impose a 
legislative presumption that is not found in any of the 
provincial or territorial statutes.  If the federal law is 
reformed without corresponding changes to the provincial or 
territorial laws, we risk creating confusion and uncertainty 
leading to more conflict between parents and increasing 
litigation.  This would only aggravate the difficulties 
experienced by children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill amending the Divorce Act could also have serious 
implications on provincial and territorial court procedures and 
court services.  The provinces and territories have 
constitutional power over the administration of justice.  This 
includes responsibilities for establishing the rules of civil 
procedure and administering court services within their 
jurisdiction, including procedures respecting Divorce Act 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Arguably, specialized court services and programs would be 
necessary to assist families who had a joint custody order 
imposed on them by the courts without their agreement.  This 
could be the result of the proposed Bill C-237 presumption of 
joint custody.  Members of parliament from every party should be 
concerned about supporting a bill that could have this kind of 
potential impact on the provinces and territories while seeking 
their prior co-operation and commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is critical to remind ourselves that developing and 
implementing family law reforms is a complex task.  The challenge 
in reforming the Divorce Act is to identify terminology that is 
consistent with a child centred approach and is carefully defined 
so that there is a clear and accepted understanding and use by 
both the courts and the public.  I believe that the proposed Bill 
C-237 does not meet this challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill creates a presumption of joint custody without 
clarifying what this means.  Does joint legal custody mean shared 
decision making?  If so, can we force parents to make joint 
decisions concerning their children when they are unwilling or 
unable to communicate with each other?  This would be 
particularly dangerous in a high conflict situation.  How can 
this be in the best interests of the child? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also possible that the bill is imposing a joint physical 
custody arrangement that would require each of the parents to be 
responsible for the daily care of the children for an equal 
amount of time.  This may not be appropriate for many families. 
I believe that children's living arrangements should be 
determined according to what is in their best interests as 
opposed to ensuring an equal division of time between the 
parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Separation and divorce are difficult for children.  The family 
law system must be responsive to their needs.  The bill could 
aggravate an already difficult situation for families.  It would 
impose a “one size fits all” approach.  That is inconsistent 
with the government's strategy for reform and that was rejected 
by the special joint committee.  It could create significant 
demands on provincial and territorial services without seeking 
their prior co-operation and commitment.  It also introduces a 
legal presumption without providing clarification of what it 
means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the government has spent a considerable amount of 
time working closely with the provinces and territories to 
develop well considered reform proposals.  To this end a number 
of background research papers have been prepared and several more 
are underway.  Work is also underway evaluating the impact of 
legislative reforms recently undertaken in other countries. 
Public consultations will be taking place this year on specific 
reform proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Developing and implementing family law reform is a complex task. 
Although we need to work quickly, we also need to take the time 
to insure that we get it right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as 
always, it is a pleasure to end the week in your company, at 
least the parliamentary week, because, as we all know, the work 
of a member of parliament is never done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to commend our hon. colleague for his initiative. 
Unfortunately, I have to advise him that we will not be able to 
support his bill for a number of reasons that I will try to 
explain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these issues come up we have to remember that they are 
dealt with in the civil code, the justice system in effect in 
Quebec, where equality in law for both parents is enshrined in 
section 587 and subsequent sections. 
It is called parental authority and parents are considered the 
tutors of their children. That comes with a number of duties and 
obligations. This legal reality is enshrined in our civil code 
and cannot be questioned unless one of the parents is found to 
be unreliable by a court of justice.  I am not sure how 
relevant this bill is, at least for Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, a federal-provincial-territorial task force will be making 
recommendations concerning family law and I will have the 
opportunity to come back to this issue later on. It will 
consider the need to reform the Divorce Act. Although 
well-intended, I think the bill introduced by the hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River is a bit premature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also leads me to say that it is a bit illogical to have the 
federal government responsible for the Divorce Act, while the 
provinces are responsible for decrees of judicial separation, 
and Quebec is responsible for the celebration of marriage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my pleasure to take a course in family law at the 
University of Ottawa a few years ago.  If Michelle Giroux, my 
law professor, is watching, I send her greetings and want her to 
know I intend to make use of what she taught me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some inconsistency in the distribution of 
jurisdictions, since one is hard pressed to find the logic 
behind Quebec's being able to legislate on marriage matters, 
particularly the formal requirements, on matters relating to the 
civil code and the right of judicial separation, while the 
federal government is responsible for divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that mean that custody, fair access, something parents and 
guardians must have, is not a problem?  No, let us make no 
mistake, it is an important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is such an important issue that, for a number of months, a 
joint parliamentary committee, comprising MPs and members of the 
other House, travelled across Canada.  The committee made 
recommendations.  It led to this report, which I want to show 
those in the gallery.  It is called “For the Sake of the 
Children”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To give an idea of the import of the phenomenon of divorce, I 
would like to read calmly, what I consider to be the essence of 
the report.  I will not read too quickly, out of respect for the 
interpreters.  I quote “Because of the high rate of divorce, 
over 47,000 children were affected, in 1994 and 1995—”  You can 
see that this is a fairly recent phenomenon. 
The quotation continues “—by custody orders under the Divorce 
Act”. This is the legislation for which our colleague is seeking 
amendments to sections 15 and 4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report goes on: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, more children—and younger children—are 
experiencing rearrangements in their households.  Their parents' 
remarriages or other new relationships following divorce 
compound the complexity of these children's lives.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Dissolution of the marriage has a heavy impact on the children 
of the marriage.  This is self-evident.  Some 75% of divorced men 
and women remarry.  Everyone has emotional needs, we all need to 
have someone in our lives.  So 75% of people whose first 
marriage ended in divorce remarry, and children from first 
marriages have to develop relationships with step-parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992, 13% of divorces were of second marriages.  Why should 
we as parliamentarians be concerned about this?  Because divorce 
is not just a marginal phenomenon. 
Members will remember that, at one time, a couple wanting a 
divorce had to go through the Senate and it was an exceptional 
procedure. This is no longer the case. Not only is divorce more 
accessible as an institution, but it is no longer left entirely 
up to the courts. Quebec has set up a mediation process between 
spouses, and it is working very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happens with the bill proposed by our colleague? It is 
based on the presumption that custody has to be shared, and this 
makes me wonder. I consulted with my colleagues, particularly 
the women in our caucus since they carry a lot of weight within 
the Bloc Quebecois. They reminded me that presumption of shared 
custody is not a good thing per se unless both parents have 
clearly indicated that this is what they want. 
Shared custody must come from a common desire if it is to be 
fully effective from a legal perspective as well as from the 
perspective of the quality of life of the children, who are our 
main concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a divorce decree is issued by the court, the judge has 
total discretion to assess the respective situations of both 
parents. In some cases, the income and the situation of each 
spouse make shared custody possible. However, in other cases, 
shared custody is not an option under the circumstances. That is 
the reason why presumption of shared custody is not desirable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, when we talk about divorce, it is important to understand 
the life experiences of those parents who want to leave each 
other and go their separate ways. 
But it seems to me that our primary concern should be the 
well-being and interest of the children.  In my view, this is not 
the focus of the bill as worded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the expertise of Quebec, where this assumption did not 
have the support of witnesses from Quebec who appeared before 
the joint parliamentary committee, we believe, once again, that 
the interest of the children must be our primary concern.  What 
do we mean by “the interest of the children must be our primary 
concern”.  There are apparently four considerations.  The first 
is recognized in law.  We could without any trouble find cases 
in which common law judges relied on this concern, making it 
part of the jurisprudence.  We are saying that, in so far as 
possible, the child must remain in an economic situation 
comparable to the one that existed prior to the divorce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why, when we speak of shared custody, we must be 
concerned about the ability of each parent to continue to ensure 
the material well-being of the children as it was before the 
divorce.  We must also place primary emphasis on the ability and 
the right to remain, in so far as possible, in the same 
neighbourhood, in the same natural environment.  Automatic 
shared custody does not seem to us to be desirable if it means 
that a child will be uprooted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a law student, I recall very clearly being asked to 
read a decision involving a parent who wished to move to 
Australia.  The parent with custody lived in Toronto.  There was 
a protracted legal dispute.  We see how upsetting it can be for 
a child who is required, in the case of shared custody, to be 
uprooted for one parent or the other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I have little time remaining, I will conclude by saying 
that we are unable to support this bill.  I give my colleague 
credit for taking an interest in the matter and I hope that our 
debates on the topic are productive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise to address this bill.  By way of background, I am 
bringing to this the perspective of having practised family law 
almost exclusively for some 15 years and then significantly for 
another 12 or 13 years in the province of Ontario.  I have also 
instructed in family law at the local law school as a sessional 
instructor and I have been a sessional leader at the bar 
admission course in Ontario as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a point I particularly want to address.  If I 
understood the comments of the author of the bill, he is 
interested in avoiding what at times is the inevitable conflict 
between parents in the course of a marriage breakdown.  I have to 
say to the member that my experience tells me the presumption he 
wishes to build into the legislation would inevitably have the 
effect of heightening both the amount of litigation that would go 
on and the level of hostilities between the parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I draw to the House's attention some of the 
statistics he gave on the breakdown that exists in the country in 
terms of how custody arrangements are finalized.  Members may 
recall that he made the point that in approximately 85% of all 
custodial arrangements custody resides with the mother of the 
children and some 6% or 7% with the father of the children, the 
remainder being joint custody arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a bit of an aside, that 6% is a substantial increase from the 
time I first started practising law.  I think it reflects some 
change in society and society's orientations and particularly in 
the orientation of women and mothers to be willing to look at a 
custody arrangement.  It also reflects, I think importantly, the 
amount of additional time that male members of society are taking 
with the children in wishing to have that type of arrangement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to come back to the reality of the process when 
marriage breaks down.  What will occur, I prophesy, is that of 
the 80% of mothers who attain custody we will have a much greater 
number of them going to court if this type of bill and 
presumption are passed into legislation.  We will have them going 
to court to rebut that presumption in order to establish sole 
custody in their names. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The end result is that instead of having 10% of all cases going 
to substantial litigation, which is the figure he quoted, we will 
have a greater number.  As an aside, I can point out that does 
not mean those cases go to trial and are determined by a judge. 
What that means is simply that they are lengthy and protracted 
litigation, which oftentimes ultimately end up in settlement in 
any event. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, what we will be having is a number greater than 10% in 
our courts.  If we are really sincerely interested in protecting 
our children from the abuse they suffer from the litigation 
process, we will want to avoid this.  I can speak to that 
personally from the fairly substantial number of contested 
custody cases I was involved in.  There is emotional abuse of 
children as they suffer their way through the protracted battles 
between their parents.  This proposed legislation would only 
heighten that.

it is now my turn to debate the bill that has been tabled by the 
member for Prince George—Peace River.  I do thank him for 
putting it forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, before we get into the bill itself and talk about the 
merits of this particular piece of legislation, I would first 
like to thank the member for Windsor—St. Clair for giving us his 
curriculum vitae and telling us of the experience he has through 
being a member of the bar, particularly in family law, because 
earlier today I commented about the Deputy Prime Minister, who 
made a comment yesterday about dealing with the law only if one 
is in fact a lawyer and which law school one should have come 
from.  As I said earlier, I am not a lawyer but that does not 
stop me from— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B>  Good for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Thank you.  Really, it is nice to be 
able to say that I have worked for a living, although I certainly 
would not suggest that the member for Windsor—St. Clair has not 
done so.  However, this was an issue this morning and it behooves 
us as members of parliament to be able to stand in the House and 
talk about pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know for a fact that the member for Prince George—Peace River 
is not a lawyer either, but he did bring forward something that 
is very important to all Canadians, certainly to those Canadians 
who are affected quite dramatically by the Divorce Act and 
custody of the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to rise to support Bill C-237, an act to amend the 
Divorce Act (joint custody), put forward by the hon. member for 
Prince George—Peace River. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to ensure that courts grant custody 
of a child of the marriage to both spouses, unless there exists 
evidence that to do so would not be in the best interests of the 
child.  As a supporter of change to the current structure of 
child custody and access, I was encouraged by the report of the 
Special Joint Committee on Child Custody and Access entitled 
“For the Sake of the Children”, which was mentioned many times 
in the House during today's debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report came to the House in December 1998.  The government's 
response to this report did not come back until May 1999.  Yet 
nothing has been done.  The inaction of the Minister of Justice 
has caused great frustration among Canadians who have been 
affected by marriage breakdown and the ensuing child custody 
battles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I share the frustration of many Canadians knowing that our 
children will continue to suffer because the recommendations for 
change will not be legislated into law.  Our party supports 
shared custody as long as it is in the best interests of the 
children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The PC Party played an effective role on the special joint 
committee and we were a strong voice for the issue of shared 
custody.  We feel that the courts should work in harmony with 
social services to ensure that no matter what the custody 
arrangement, the best interests of the children will be 
paramount.  The PC Party has stated that it will continue its 
efforts to have the recommendations of the committee legislated 
into law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Liberal government seems unwilling to take action on this 
issue, I once again commend the member for coming forward with a 
proposal that will move toward a more equitable treatment of 
both—and I stress both—parents involved in a child custody 
arrangement while ensuring, again, that the best interests are 
those of the children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judicial discretion permitted in the bill will allow a judge 
to make decisions in the best interests of the child, depending 
on the merits of the individual case.  The bill states:

</I></B></P><P align=left>The court may, on application by either or both spouses or any 
other person, make an order respecting any or all children of the 
marriage that is different from the order provided for in 
subsection (1) where, in the opinion of the court, the best 
interests of the child or children so require. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress that comment enough.  It is for the children, 
and certainly it is a piece of legislation that brings the 
parents together to make sure that in fact is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every other section of the bill states clearly that decisions 
regarding the joint custody of the child will always be subject 
to judicial discretion.  This protects the child while enhancing 
the rights of both parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other problems with the current system.  After a 
bitter divorce some parents deny visitation access to other 
parents and use their children to get even with their former 
spouses.  That is in fact happening, Madam Speaker, in your 
constituency and in my constituency.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Police have seen recent abductions of children by non-custodial 
parents who have become desperate after repeatedly being denied 
visitation rights.  I am not defending this course of action, but 
it provides further evidence of the negative effect this has on 
children.  Children are forced into a fugitive lifestyle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Shared custody should help avert the often extreme animosity 
that exists between divorced parents fighting for access to their 
children.  This would provide a much healthier environment, with 
less conflict, for children to grow up in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do wish that the Liberal government would take the necessary 
action to fix the problem.  Seeing that this is not the case, I 
would suggest that each member of the House support this piece of 
legislation as a small part of the proper thing to do to move the 
issue forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I once again thank the member for the bill.  I do support it on 
behalf of my party, the Progressive Conservative Party.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Spencer (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, this is my first opportunity to 
rise in the House to speak to any legislation.  I am not a 
graduate of too many schools.  I guess I graduated from the same 
law school that Joe Clark graduated from, or so I heard today.  I 
am not a lawyer, but I have taken courses.  One course was the 
course of life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member spoke of legal presumption.  There are several 
presumptions I want to mention today that are actually already 
being made in the courts when it comes to divorce and custody.  I 
also want to mention the fact that the reason many cases are not 
presented with a request for joint custody is that it is 
understood and well known that there is very little chance for 
that request to be granted because of these legal presumptions 
that are automatically being made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not aware that I would have an opportunity to speak to 
this legislation so I will not quote statistics, legal points or 
that sort of thing, but I will speak from my experience as a 
family counsellor for the last 30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I find the presumption is made that the female spouse in 
the situation is the better parent.  I agree that in many cases 
this may well be true, but I also know of many cases in which it 
is not true.  I know of a case in which a female parent was 
involved in drugs and in many kinds of activities that were 
wrong, yet she automatically got custody of the child and the 
father did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second presumption that seems to be made in the courts I am 
aware of in the city of Regina is that the mother is always the 
one who is telling the truth.  Insinuations can be made, the 
children given over and the case closed, just an automatic thing 
that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, I think there is the presumption that the mother is the 
one with the most inherent right to be the parent.  Again, I 
disagree with that.  Usually that is the case, especially with 
younger children where the mother may do a better job, but I 
think recent studies tell us of the tragedy that is caused by the 
lack of a father in the family.  We understand that over 70% of 
juvenile delinquents come from fatherless families, so it is 
extremely important that our children be able to maintain contact 
with their fathers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other presumption is that the mother is the one most likely 
to be subjected to continued abuse.  I am not so sure that is 
always the case either.  Perhaps mothers are the most likely, but 
in fact abuse does happen to the other parent.  Many times the 
father suffers from that element of control in the aspect of 
being barred from seeing the children or the aspect of being 
totally controlled in regard to when, how and where he will see 
the children.  It has reached the point where it is totally 
unfair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just this morning in my office I received from a constituent 
information about a website that I visited for about five minutes 
before coming to the House.  The website listed many cases of 
suicide when fathers have been shut away from their children 
because of this automatic situation.  They feel so hopeless and 
helpless, and many of them are committing suicide over this very 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of them are being asked to pay support beyond even their 
earnings.  I know one parent in Regina, for instance, who was 
compelled to give 75% of his income to support his young 
children.  That makes it a little difficult now in his new 
family.  The mother is not always the one who may be the most 
likely to suffer abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth assumption that is made is that children would prefer 
to be with their mother.  Again, this is false.  In a case I 
know, the father plays with the children.  The father takes the 
children on outings.  The father is involved with the children in 
sporting events and many other things.  The mother is not always 
the one who spends that kind of time with the children.  So, it 
is wrong to automatically presume that the father is going to be 
the lesser of the two parents and to automatically give the child 
to the mother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My final point is simply this.  We as Canadians are big on human 
rights.  We have gone through a period of time when everyone is 
most interested in receiving the rights they deserve.  We fight 
for our rights.  We are proud that we give rights to everyone. We 
extend rights so far that we end up with no rights ourselves 
sometimes, especially in our criminal system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, one thing we forget, one thing I have never heard 
mentioned by any lawyer or anyone else and something that I 
believe very seriously in my heart, is that every child in Canada 
deserves an equal right to two parents, not just one.  The system 
we have now, which automatically presumes that it is okay to 
legislate one parent out of the equation except for financial 
situations and very limited access, takes away the right for our 
children have to two parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would favour the legislation.  It may not be the be all end 
all, it may not be the perfect solution, but if we could start 
from the premise that our children deserve the right to two 
parents then move to an equitable situation and work that out, we 
would be doing what is in the best interests of our children.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues 
from all parties who participated in the debate this afternoon. 
It is unfortunate that, like so many pieces of legislation, this 
private member's bill will not be votable and that this hour will 
be the only opportunity that members have to participate in a 
debate about such an important issue as joint custody or shared 
parenting as is the new term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by thanking my colleague from 
Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre for his eloquent remarks.  I 
congratulate him on his first speech.  I know he did not intend 
to speak today, late on a Friday afternoon, but he jumped to his 
feet and participated in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would like to thank my colleague from the Progressive 
Conservatives from Brandon—Souris for his support and for his 
supportive comments in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Windsor—St. Clair also imparted his experience 
and wisdom that he accumulated when he worked in the real world, 
shall we say.  I would dispute perhaps the fundamental opposition 
he voiced to the legislation, Bill C-237.  If I understood his 
remarks correctly, he said it would probably result in more 
litigation, more than the present 10% that statistics show us.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would pose the question why would it necessarily do that? 
Parents would understand that the courts would uphold the joint 
custody unless there was clear evidence of abuse, mistreatment or 
whatever reason the court might rule.  However, it would have to 
be based upon fundamental, ironclad evidence that it would be not 
in the best interests of the child to have joint custody.  Once 
it became the norm, I believe parents would accept that.  They 
would quit using children as pawns in their otherwise very 
disruptive divorce settlements or separation settlements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would dispute whether it would necessarily result in an 
increase in that 10% number. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for Erie—Lincoln on participating in 
this debate.  I was appalled and saddened at his remarks but not 
surprised.  I suspect that the general thrust of his speech, if 
not in its entirety, was put together by lawyers in the justice 
department for the Minister of Justice and perhaps passed to him. 
They may not all be his thoughts on this important subject. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understood him, his main argument was that the government 
in its infinite wisdom wants to develop a comprehensive strategy 
to deal with this very important subject of shared parenting or 
custody and access.  I would argue that the government has had 
time.  How much longer can children wait?  Every day that goes by 
there are children caught between their love, respect and 
devotion for both parents.  Children are being hurt the most by 
the government's inaction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can go into all the legalities.  As the member for 
Brandon—Souris said we are not lawyers, so I will not get into 
the legality of it.  I believe very strongly that all of us as 
members of parliament, regardless of party, are being beseeched 
by citizens, parents and grandparents across the country on this 
issue.  There has to be a time for action and it has to be now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on but we are out of time.  I could talk about my own 
experience having just gone through a divorce some two years ago 
and the fact that I have three children.  Now is not the time to 
go into that.  Many of us have been touched by divorce.  We have 
seen children who have been hurt when parents start warring in 
the courts or outside the courts.  We must do something for them. 
I believe this was the first step we could have taken to go down 
that road to institute a system of more fairness and to help the 
children.

consideration of private members' business has now expired. 
Since the motion was not votable, the item is dropped from the 
order paper.

at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
