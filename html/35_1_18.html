	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, during World War II the Government of Canada issued 
victory bonds as a means to pay for our war effort. Patriotic 
Canadians bought the bonds and thereby saved their children 
and grandchildren a legacy of heavy debt.
<P>
	Today a new generation of patriotic Canadians is offering its 
financial support to pay down this country's debt.
<P>
	This government could issue a debt recovery bond and sell it 
domestically to Canadians. We could set an attractive rate of 
interest and use the entire subscription proceeds to pay down the 
debt. Our first priority would be the discharge of our foreign 
debt obligations.
<P>
	We owe it to our children to give them a debt free Canada. A 
debt recovery bond will appeal to both the patriotism and 
financial self-interest of Canadians. It will have the added 
benefit of providing taxes on the bond's interest for our federal 
treasury.

	<B>Mr. Benoît Sauvageau (Terrebonne):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Éco-Équipement Inc. is a company that was recently 
established in my riding. It is preparing to do research in 
wastewater treatment.
<P>
	This study, which is conducted in co-operation with Agropur, 
the École polytechnique of Montreal as well as two government 
agencies, the Department of Environment of Quebec and the 
Centre québécois de valorisation de la biomasse, is aimed at 
developing wastewater treatment in the agri-food industry.
<P>
	This biological dephosphorization project at the cost of 
$860,000 over two years will allow, among other things, to 
reduce discharges of phosphorus, thereby complying with the 
new environmental protection standards.
<P>
	I commend the instigators of this major initiative, who are 
showing a strong desire to develop a more performing 
technology while remaining aware of environmental laws and 
responsible towards them.

about those people who shaped our communities in their

<P>
	Each year the South Okanagan Historical Society awards the

farming, road building, education, development of parkland and 
other activities of leadership and involvement. Still today their

dedication to the community.
<P>

family for its invaluable contribution to the development of the 
south Okanagan and this great nation.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Five 
days after the massacre at Sarajevo's central market, the 16 
members of the NATO council are meeting today in Brussels to 
examine an American proposal that would force the siege of 
Sarajevo to be lifted within ten days. Just now there was a news 
release announcing: ``Today NATO member countries agreed to 
send an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, threatening them with 
airstrikes if they fail to withdraw their heavy artillery from the 
region around Sarajevo within the next 10 days''.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister whether this information is 
correct. And also, since these decisions must be made 
unanimously, whether Canada supported sending an ultimatum 
to the Serbs.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we agreed with the proposal to create a 20 kilometre zone around 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1101"> 1101 </A></B>
<P>
Sarajevo, within which any arms controlled by the Bosnian 
Serbs and the Bosnian Muslims  would be under the control of 
the United Nations. We agreed with this ultimatum.
<P>
	According to the last reports I saw, Mr. Rose, the military 
officer in charge of the forces in Sarajevo, said that an 
agreement had been reached a few minutes ago with the Serbs, 
who agreed to place their arms in the Sarajevo area under the 
control of the United Nations. I understand that the Muslims 
will do likewise, which means that if the ultimatum is accepted, 
there will be no need for airstrikes in the region.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I see that it is not quite clear what steps were taken by 
the Serbs following this ultimatum.
<P>
	May we ask the Prime Minister what the terms of the 
ultimatum are? Exactly what will happen to the Serbs should the 
ultimatum be rejected?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in resolutions that were passed in August and renewed on 
January 11, we said-and we supported this condition-that if 
the siege of Sarajevo were to continue, airstrikes could be used 
to help liberate the city.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	After the terrible carnage on the weekend, the 16 NATO allies 
decided to send an ultimatum and create a 20 kilometre 
demilitarized zone around Sarajevo. Apparently both the 
Muslims and the local Serbs are prepared to accept this 
condition, which means that airstrikes would be unnecessary, if 
what I saw in the report is true.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this means there has been a major change in Canada's 
position regarding airstrikes, because I understand that until 
now, Canada had accepted the principle of airstrikes at close 
range only for self-defence, to guarantee the safety of its 
peacekeepers. I understand that in this case, the government has 
decided to support the principle of an airstrike against a belli-gerent force in order to lift the siege of Sarajevo.
<P>
	In that case, I would like to ask the Prime Minister what 
guarantees he obtained to ensure that Canadian peacekeepers 
would not be adversely affected as a result of the ultimatum.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when we were in Brussels a month ago we were very concerned 
about the Canadian troops that were on the other side of the line 
in Srebrenica. The situation has evolved naturally there. The 
Bosnian Serbs have accepted the Canadians being replaced by 
the Dutch before the end of this month.
<P>
	The situation there is progressing normally. According to the 
news I heard a few minutes ago, the Serbs have agreed to accept 
the ultimatum in relation to Sarajevo so there will be no need for 
a strike. We have accepted to protect the civilians in Sarajevo 
and, in order to avoid a repetition of the massacre of last 
weekend, we gave that ultimatum to the military forces in the 
area.

<P>

<P>
	Is the government prepared to acknowledge today to the

smuggling will require not only a national effort, but a special 
and concentrated effort to re-establish the supremacy of 
Canadian law on those three Indian reserves?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
this is exactly what I have said for two weeks and I will repeat it. 
The law of Canada will apply in every part of the land.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a supplementary question.
<P>
	Most of us believe that only a small number of Mohawks are 
actively engaged in the smuggling operations on these reserves 
and that the majority of the residents resent and oppose the 
presence of these operations.
<P>
	Has the government attempted to communicate and consult 
with rank and file members on those reserves to enlist their 
support for reasserting the supremacy of Canadian laws against 
smuggling, against money laundering and the illegal 
importation and storage of arms?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
had a telephone conversation on Sunday with the chief of one of 
the reserves. Shortly after Question Period I am meeting with 
the chiefs of all three reserves. I will be seeking their 
co-operation to work with the RCMP to eliminate smuggling on 
the reserves, around the reserves and everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a further supplementary question. I appreciate meetings 
with chiefs, but there is a difference between meeting with 
chiefs and rank and file members.
<P>
	I am wondering whether the Prime Minister agrees that the 
re-establishment of democracy on these reserves is a 
prerequisite to re-establishing the supremacy of law. Has the 
government considered instituting a formal democratic process 
on these reserves whereby rank and file Indian people would 
have an opportunity to indicate by secret ballot which measures 
they believe would be successful in re-establishing the 
supremacy of Canadian law?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is my understanding that the chiefs in question are 
democratically elected by the residents of the reserves. The 
people on the reserves will likely think the Reform Party 
leader's suggestion is a strange form of democracy if he wants 
the government to march in and impose his version of 
democracy on them.

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I wish to point out to the House that the RCMP met last Friday 
with the three chiefs in question. They held rather lengthy and 
substantive talks, the outcome of which was reported that very 
same evening on television. The Minister of Indian Affairs is 
still in contact with them and today, they will have a meeting 
with the Solicitor General who is responsible for the RCMP. 
Therefore, I do not think that my presence would help matters 
any further.
<P>
	I believe that our ministers are capable of carrying out their 
duties and that the Prime Minister must intervene only when he 
has no other choice. Right now I think that the Minister of Indian 
and Northern Affairs and the Solicitor General are doing an 
excellent job.

	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Prime Minister and was inspired by Mr. Ian Craig from 
the riding of Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	As the lone opposition member from the province of Ontario, 
I am very concerned that the Prime Minister has negotiated a 
cigarette deal with the premier of Quebec at the expense of 
Ontario.
<P>
	Yesterday the premier of Ontario, Bob Rae, stated: ``All this 
does is put pressure on the rest of us to literally fall into line with 
a policy that... was declared unilaterally by the federal 
government and one province''.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of Ontario and the premier, how can 
the Prime Minister possibly justify creating a series of 
provincial dominoes of which Ontario is just the first and which 
has no choice but to match the tax cuts of Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
must be doing something right when I have the tobacco 
companies mad at me as well as the NDP in Ontario.
<P>
	I am very surprised at the statement of the hon. member 
because Premier Rae knows the truth. On December 13 we 
started to discuss matters with provincial officials in Ontario 
and Quebec. I have spoken with Mr. Rae many times. I talked 
with him again on the telephone on Friday night. On Sunday he 
sent his officials, led by his chief of staff, Mr. Agnew. They 
spent Sunday with Mr. Shortliffe, people from my office, people 
from the police and so on. They knew all the facts, the whole 
package. We discussed what should be and what should not be in 
the package.
<P>
	To go on TV last night and say that we had made a deal without 
talking to them I think was very cheap politics.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ed Harper (Simcoe Centre):</B> I have a supplementary 
question, Mr. Speaker. The premier of Nova Scotia also 
expressed his disagreement with the Prime Minister yesterday. 
In fact the majority of premiers are strongly opposed to this tax 
reduction.
<P>
	Why has the Prime Minister chosen to listen to the premier of 
Quebec while ignoring other affected premiers?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said in the House yesterday that the person who convinced me 
about the reduction of the tax was the head of the RCMP of 
Canada, who said that if we want really to cure the problem 
quickly we have no choice but to take the wind out of these sails.
<P>
<B>(1435 ) </B>
<P>
	I have done it. To try to make it a question of Quebec and the 
rest of Canada is not right. The problem is in Ontario which has a 
premier who wants to keep his head in the sand and not face 
reality.

for the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister stated quite clearly that Canada 
is one sovereign nation, has one set of laws and these laws will 
be enforced equally in every part of the country.
<P>
	These statements notwithstanding, there remains a 
widespread perception across Canada that there are differing 
provisions for the enforcement of law depending on whether an 
infraction occurs on or off a native Indian reserve.
<P>
	Could the Solicitor General advise the House whether the 
guidelines to be used by the RCMP in enforcing the 
government's action plan on smuggling differ depending on 
whether the infractions occur on or off a native Indian reserve?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to repeat and confirm what the Prime Minister said earlier 
in this question period, that the law will be enforced everywhere 
in Canada and that is the case. I am happy to say it again here.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like it 
to be a bit more specific. There is a general perception out there 
that there are two sets of laws, one on a native reserve and one 
off a reserve. I would like to have clarification on that.

propose-can you hear me, Mr. Speaker?

question is for the Minister for International Trade. While 
successive judgements confirm the Canadian position in the 
interminable conflict on softwood lumber, the United States 
announced yesterday that it intends to appeal the decision of the 
panel established under the free trade agreement. We thought 
that this decision of the panel would end the dispute which has 
already cost Canadian producers about $500 million.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to take this matter up with the 
American authorities to end the harassment of Canadian 
softwood lumber producers and does he intend to convince the 
American trade representative, Mr. Kantor, to end once and for 
all this conflict which has already gone on too long?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have met on several occasions with Mr. Kantor 
about the matter the hon. member raises. As he probably knows, 
two panels have recently reported in Canada's favour in the 
softwood lumber case. The possibility is now open to the United 
States to issue what is called an extraordinary challenge.

question is for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.
<P>
	Several of my constituents have told me of the difficulty 
experienced by many immigrants in trying to understand the 
functioning of the Canadian government and its many agencies. 
Obviously this problem is exacerbated when these newcomers 
do not speak English.
<P>
	In order to minimize the sense of isolation felt by many 
immigrants, will the minister in the upcoming public 
consultations address this issue and will he undertake to have 
better co-ordination among all levels of government regarding 
this important matter?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the member 
for his question. I took note of the statement by the member on 
January 31 with respect to the same issue.
<P>
	While members of the Reform may laugh, it is very important 
the member underline the role that settlement plays when we 
have set levels of immigration. We cannot divorce the two if we 
want to guide a coherent immigration policy.
<P>
	I can assure the member that over 300 organizations have 
entered into contractual agreements with my department to 
improve those settlement deliveries. In fact one entitled Host 
was piloted in the member's very own riding.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member and the House that the specific 
subject of settlement will be an integral part of the consultation 
process. The subject will also be the focus of an expert panel to 
ensure that we are maximizing our settlement programs and 
seeking modifications where they are needed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is also 
for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Should our 
immigration numbers be based on first, a percentage of 
Canada's population or, second, the country's current economic 
conditions and needs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, when we announced the levels we 
talked about a balanced approach. If one is to consider a number 
of different variables I am not sure we should put more emphasis 
on one or the other.
<P>
	We need to have a balanced approach that serves the interests 
of our country, that serves the interests of families and family 
reunification, that serves the interests of job creation and 
investment as we have done through the increase of independent 
skills and business workers.
<P>
	The other slant of immigration policy has to do with 
maintaining a tradition of keeping our obligations to those who 
seek assistance so there is a humanitarian aspect to immigration. 
Only when we have a balanced approach do we have a good 
healthy immigration policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, an interesting 
response, considering I put the same question to my constituents 
last weekend with very interesting results.

he undertake to put this question to all Canadians through an 
approved polling process and table the results in the House?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have just been through the most 
exhaustive consultation process. It is called a national election. 
The last time I checked the Prime Minister had won a decisive 
national mandate. Immigration was part of the red book.
<P>
	On top of that we have announced an unprecedented

status to the non-governmental organization called the 
International Lesbian and Gay Association, which is an

including the North American Man-Boy Love Association. This 
organization promotes sexual freedom between men and boys

deny men from having sex with boys.

his question. I want to tell him that when Canada, the United

consultative status to the ILGA, they were not aware the North 
American Man-Boy Love Association was affiliated with the 
International Lesbian and Gay Association.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr.

seeking consultative status at the UN was to raise the issue of 
human rights abuses against lesbians and gay men.
<P>

that would help Canadian farmers who are in distress. I wonder 
if the minister could guarantee that the programs we set forward

the House up to date on the status of that program.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

previous government and in conjunction with provincial 
governments a process is under way to review and revamp 
Canadian farm income safety net programs. That process 
resulted in a conference last week in Winnipeg involving the 
federal government, the provinces, farm organizations and 
others aimed toward developing a consensus on farm safety net 
programs.
<P>
	There was a great deal of support at the meeting for the 
concept of the whole farm program that we had described in our 
red book, a program that would be GATT consistent and market 
neutral and financially sound, affordable and effective. 
Unfortunately we had less agreement concerning the exact 
details of such a program or programs.

equalization payments-that is 47 per cent of the total-while 
B.C., Alberta and Ontario receive nothing.
<P>
	The formula used to calculate the size of the equalization 
payments is said to take into account the ability of individual 
provinces to tax their residents.
<P>
	Since the Prime Minister wants all taxation to be fair and to 
close all loopholes, how can he approve of such a large payment 
to Quebec when the tax rate for corporations in Quebec is only 
6.9 per cent, while it is between 15 per cent and 17 per cent for 
corporations in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the formula is a very complex one and every component is 
incorporated. If we extract one we can come to all sorts of

guaranteed in the Constitution.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	It would appear that because corporations in Quebec are 
paying income tax at a rate approximately one-half the rate 
being paid by corporations in the rest of Canada, that the people 
of B.C., Alberta and Ontario are subsidizing businesses in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Could the Prime Minister confirm that equalization payments 
to Quebec would be much lower if corporations in Quebec paid 
their fair share of corporation income taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions)):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to answer 
the hon. member's question.
<P>
	The details of the equalization payments are based on the 
ability of taxation standards among the provinces. They do not 
relate to tax rates. They relate to the ability to pay taxes 
including property taxes, corporate taxes and all sorts of other 
taxes. It is a very complicated formula. I will be happy to supply

	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to 
Standing Order 34, I am honoured to present, in both official 
languages, the report of the Nordic Council's Parliamentary 
Conference on the Arctic held in Reykjavik, Iceland, on August 
16 and August 17 last year.
<P>
	In this report the delegation to the council recommended and 
found acceptance to a number of recommendations which I will 
not read in their entirety. I will select from them the most 
important, namely the importance of co-operation among 
Arctic states and other parties engaged in the Rovaniemi process 
and the elaboration of an Arctic environmental protection 
strategy in accordance with agenda 21 of the United Nations 
Conference on the Environment and Development.

parliamentary delegation to Sao Paulo, Brazil, from July 16 to 
July 19, 1993.

Standing Order 34, I have the honour to present, in both official 
languages, the report of the Canadian delegation of the 
Canada-Japan Interparliamentary Association to the second 
annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific parliamentary forum held in 
the Philippines on January 14 and January 15.
<P>
	The recommendations that came out of this meeting are of 
great interest to Canada. The fact that the Canadian Parliament 
decided to participate even before this Parliament was formerly 
struck certainly indicates the importance that this government 
and this Parliament place on economic matters in the 
Asia-Pacific region.

	<B>Mr. Tom Wappel (Scarborough West)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-213, an act to amend the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service Act.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this is a very specific bill to amend a 
particular section, section 52, of the Canadian Security 
Intelligence Service Act. It would provide that the 
recommendations of the Security Intelligence Review 
Committee are to be implemented unless overruled by the 
minister concerned.
<P>
	In that event the minister would be required to report to 
Parliament the reasons for overruling the decision of the 
committee and if the reasons were secret the minister would be 
required to report to Parliament why they are deemed to be 
secret.

killer board game and similar games in Canada.
<P>
	This petition, gathered by the members of St. Matthew's

	The House resumed from February 8 consideration of the

believe the bill speaks to the very value system the nation 
represents.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1110"> 1110 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to begin by telling members of the House a short story 
about an experience that I was involved in about four years ago. 
It took place in Quebec City. I met a great Canadian artist from 
Quebec by the name of Richard Séguin. I went to a concert of 
Richard Séguin's; it was the first time I had heard him sing. 
I came away from that event moved by the talent, the energy 
and the real greatness of this Canadian artist.
<P>
	When I arrived home to Toronto I went down Yonge Street. I 
went into some of the popular record stores to try to buy a tape of 
Séguin because I wanted some of my friends to listen to him. 
After about six record stores on Yonge Street, in the back corner 
I finally found one cassette of Richard Séguin. ``Journée 
d'Amérique'' was the name of the cassette.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	I guess it was about a month later that I had lunch with him in 
Montreal. I told him the story about how it was so incredible that 
while this artist sold 100,000 tapes, records or albums in the 
province of Quebec and was so well known, in downtown 
Toronto in the largest record stores, it took six stores and in the 
back corner of one store I found one cassette.
<P>
	He said that sort of exemplifies some of the frustrations and 
some of the reasons why many of us in Quebec ask ourselves 
what is in Canada for us. He is a great artist and sells a large 
number of tapes in Quebec but outside Quebec he is known to 
very few people.
<P>
	Just as Canadian artists from Quebec are not well known 
beyond their borders, there are a lot of things done through the 
Government of Canada that are not well known in the province 
of Quebec.
<P>
	I am not standing here today trying to suggest that there are 
not frustrations or discrepancies coming from Quebec or, for 
that matter, from many other provinces. It is very important that 
on a bill such as this all of our constituents, no matter what 
region of the country they are from, should all understand what 
equalization is all about.
<P>
	It is especially important today because this is the first 
Parliament in our history in which Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition represents a point of view which wants to dismantle 
Canada, wants to separate from Canada.
<P>
	My community hears about a bill like Bill C-3, in which 
through equalization we transfer moneys from the have 
provinces to the have not provinces. We are talking about an 
agreement that was signed last week supported by all the 
provinces and the Minister of Finance. We are talking about a 
deal that goes the next five years. The basic essence of this bill 
entitles seven of the ten provinces to fiscal transfers from three 
provinces, B.C., Alberta and Ontario. They are funds with no 
strings attached so that they will have the same standard of 
living, a national standard, a national tax base, the same access 
to services right across the country.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	The Quebec portion of this transfer over the next five years, 
the period of this Parliament, is $70 billion. That means that we 
as Canadian taxpayers will be transferring from the have 
provinces to Quebec and the other seven provinces a large sum 
of money. I want to deal specifically today with the $70 billion 
that is being transferred to the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I want to say at the outset that by constitution this is an 
entitlement which I have no quarrel with. I support it happily but 
it is in the face of that transfer that I have great difficulty in 
understanding why members opposite would want to walk away 
from that type of environment where we try to create national 
standards and national programs so that the constituents of their 
ridings can have access to the same services as the constituents 
of my riding.
<P>
	We tend to think that this is the only thing that happens in this 
particular bill, that it is just a matter of transferring money. It is 
more than that. It allows the provinces to basically make their 
own decisions. Each of the provinces can make their own 
decisions as to how they want their communities, their people of 
that particular province served. It is not a condition where the 
Government of Canada is imposing a very specific directive on 
that money.
<P>
	The provincial members of Parliament are the sole directors 
of how those funds will be spent. It is no business of this 
Chamber. The only thing that is the business of this Chamber, 
the Government of Canada, the Parliament of Canada, is to make 
sure the formula is implemented and the cheque is transferred.
<P>
	I have talked to a few people, not only in my riding, but other 
friends that I have from the province of Quebec and many 
Canadians, not just in Quebec but all across Canada. They are 
not aware of this equalization bill. They are not aware of the 
extent or the numbers of dollars that are involved.
<P>
	That is what led me as we were preparing for Bill C-3 also to 
look into some of the other Government of Canada activities that 
take place in the province of Quebec. I am skewing or I am 
pushing my argument a bit toward the province of Quebec today 
because we do not have representatives from the other provinces 
saying that they want to separate, that they want to tear the place 
down.
<P>
	I for the life of me cannot understand why this is going on, this 
notion of wanting to run away from this partnership, from this 
value system, where we all share on a national standard. We 
cannot just think of this bill as I mentioned earlier. We have to 
think of the presence of the Government of Canada in many 
other areas.
<P>
	I would like to cite a few of them. One of the highest profile 
projects in the province of Quebec is the James Bay project. 
There is a perception out there that it is primarily a provincial 
project. As I was preparing today I did a short overview, a 
glance, a summary of some of the  Government of Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1111"> 1111 </A></B>
<P>
expenditures from 1986 to 1991 in the James Bay project. Did 
you realize, Madam Speaker, that in that one project the 
Government of Canada, through Indian and Northern Affairs, 
Canada Mortgage and Housing, Transport Canada, Industry, 
Science and Technology, Employment and Immigration, 
Secretary of State, Health and Welfare, Energy, Mines and 
Resources, Environment Canada, Fisheries and Oceans, Justice 
and the Solicitor General, contributed $607 million toward 
James Bay?
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I am not standing here saying that we should not be doing 
these things. These were decisions made by this Chamber and by 
members of Parliament who fought for their constituents, 
whether it be for job creation or to make sure that the economic 
viability of the province was there, but what I cannot understand 
is after all of this sort of federal presence, this Government of 
Canada work and presence, why Her Majesty's Loyal 
Opposition wants to separate.
<P>
	That is a question that many of my constituents have. I 
thought that today, because we were debating this bill, it would 
be a time to reflect and a time for all of us on this side to revisit 
the whole exercise of examining the Government of Canada 
presence in the province of Quebec. It is incumbent upon all of 
us to make sure that all of our constituents and all of their 
constituents know just what services are provided and where we 
fall short.
<P>
	I am not suggesting for a second that the situation is perfect. I 
think that Richard Séguin has a legitimate beef. When we talk 
about Canadian artists I believe Richard Séguin is a Canadian 
artist. When we listen to English radio stations all we hear is 
English radio programs. Those are Canadian airwaves. Why can 
we not have Séguin on every radio station in Canada the same 
way we have Anne Murray or Blue Rodeo on every radio station 
in Canada?
<P>
	I am not standing here saying that there are not some 
legitimate concerns, but what I am concerned about is the fact 
that we are not communicating to the people who live and work 
in the province of Quebec all of the Government of Canada 
presence that is there for them. The Government of Canada 
presence through programs and services, whether they be in 
industry, through the Department of National Defence, through 
the historic sites that are supported by the Government of 
Canada, through the Department of Tourism, all of these points 
of presence are something that we have to make known to the 
people of Quebec. If they should want to walk away from that 
they should at least know what the whole story is all about.
<P>
	I am convinced that once the total and accurate story has been 
told there will be some Quebecers who may now be thinking 
more in the separatist mode who might change their position. Is 
it possible? I hope so.
<P>
	I feel the more the members opposite become exposed to 
some of the Government of Canada work that is done in the 
province of Quebec that some of them might be a little less 
antagonistic toward the whole notion of Quebec within Canada.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	I stand here today recognizing and supporting totally Bill 
C-3. I hope that all members opposite will communicate to their 
constituents that we on this side of the House are supporting this 
bill with firmness. We are not in any way, shape or form 
questioning it, but we are asking ourselves if we are 
communicating. Usually when someone has a resentment 
toward a particular institution or a particular operation of 
government, there are legitimate reasons like waste or 
duplication. I accept the fact that we must work at correcting a 
lot of those flaws that are in the system.
<P>
	Those flaws that are in our system right now were created by 
many institutionalized bureaucracies around here. Those 
frustrations, believe you me, are the same for many people. We 
have the same feeling in downtown Toronto for those 
duplications and institutionalized bureaucracies and units that 
are no longer serving the end user in the way they were 
originally intended to serve the end user. But we do not say okay, 
let us throw up our hands and quit. The purpose of our presence 
here today is to make sure that we fix those things that are no 
longer serving the public.
<P>
	I hope that the message of the bill can be told to the people of 
Quebec. In the last five years close to $50.7 billion was 
transferred; in the next five years it will be close to $70 billion. 
That, along with all the other Government of Canada presence in 
the province of Quebec, I believe should mean something. Let us 
hope with a good communication plan over the next little while 
it will shift the attitude and cause a different approach from Her 
Majesty's Loyal Opposition.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood 
for his speech, because finally he got into the substantive issue.
<P>
	The people of Quebec all know what is in this bill; for 25 
years, we in Quebec have been debating this situation of money 
from the federal government that fluctuates from year to year. 
For us the time for plumbers is over; for us now is the time for 
architects.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1112"> 1112 </A></B>
<P>
	We do not care that you wanted to give us fish with a law like 
that. We want to be able to fish. What we want is to control 
things ourselves and have a free hand to run our own show. For 
that, what is most important to us is  to have a government that 
raises taxes giving services to the people for the taxes it raises.
<P>
	Now, because of the problem with Canadian federalism, to 
begin with, whereby the federal government has the right to 
raise taxes in areas it does not control, we have this fantastically 
hypocritical situation where the federal government says that it 
is giving us money back. It is not giving us money back; it is 
collecting our taxes and distributing them differently and for 
125 years we have fought it because it never suited us.
<P>
	That is why we in Quebec decided that there was no longer any 
point in coming here to fight with federalist members. Thus 
Quebecers elected sovereigntists because, as I was just saying, 
they no longer want to change the plumbing; they want to change 
house.
<P>
	What I also wanted to tell you is that there are still problems 
with this bill, because from the time a ceiling was set, the 
following perverse effect has been created: Quebec's payment is 
60 per cent of what it would be without the ceiling. When the 
federal government was run without the present level of deficits, 
we could afford this reduction, setting aside the basic problem 
with the federal system.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	Since the federal government has no more money because it 
mismanages ours, not only Quebecers' money but that of all 
Canadians, it set a ceiling. With the ceiling, Quebec's share is 
decreasing systematically.
<P>
	I quite agree with what the hon. member said about Richard 
Séguin-I know him well, and also his twin sister, who is a great 
singer; they are about my age and we have the same dream-we 
want to control our means of development so that our future can 
turn out as we want.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, I do 
not think the hon. member is reading the bill accurately. The fact 
is the money being transferred to the province of Quebec is not 
coming from the province of Quebec. It is coming from other 
taxpayers in regions of the country that happen to be blessed 
with natural resources or other economic advantages. As part of 
a constitutional agreement and through entitlement the money is 
taken from those advantaged provinces and regions and put into 
the province of Quebec so that there is a national standard for all 
citizens.
<P>
	For the hon. member to suggest that the taxes are coming from 
Quebec and going back into Quebec is not accurate. That is the 
point I was trying to make. The whole area of fiscal transfers and 
transfers of Government of Canada service needs a full 
examination.
<P>
	If the hon. member's remarks were to be picked up in his 
community right now they would not be accurate. The hon. 
member should be saying to his constituents that they will in 
fact be receiving from advantaged provinces over the next five 
years close to $70 billion in equalization payments. That would 
have a much different effect on his constituents and their 
attitude toward Confederation than if he said they are just 
reshuffling their own money.
<P>
	At least the hon. member did agree that this is the essence of 
the whole discussion which has to go on in the next little while. I 
for one am not going to shirk away from my responsibility to 
talk about the Government of Canada's presence in the province 
of Quebec, not just where it failed but also the good things it has 
done for the province.
<P>
	In this debate it is very important that the separatist members 
make sure they put the facts on the table and not twist them.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
deeply shocked, I must say, by the previous speaker's comments 
because I think they show a profound ignorance of the whole tax 
system, of the way government revenue is collected, as well as a 
mathematical oversimplification. I even wonder whether he 
understands the overall purpose of federal transfers and how 
they work. He should be looking at established programs, at 
what has happened in the education and health sectors to find out 
what is going on and recognize the strong tendency behind it.
<P>
	Equalization enables us to measure the capacity of a province 
to collect revenue. It is this factor that determines whether a 
province is defined as rich or poor. He should take into account 
the fact that many decisions made by the federal government, 
particularly Quebec's non-involvement in research and 
development, has led to Quebec being seen as a province that 
does not have the same capacity to collect tax revenue. Other 
actions by the federal government prevent Quebec from doing 
this.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	We should not act in isolation. If he wants to do it, I can do it 
with him. I have before me figures on defence spending. 
Quebec, with 25.5 per cent of the population, only receives 17.4 
per cent of spending, an annual shortfall of $565 million. The 
hon. member should not indulge in fiscal oversimplication.
<P>
	If we look at the whole picture, as we did during the election 
campaign when we had all the data, he would be surprised to see 
how unfavourable federalism is to Quebec from a fiscal point of 
view. We do not get our fair share given all that we pay and what 
we get in return.
<P>
	Saying that equalization is a gift is an outrageous attitude. 
Quebecers also pay taxes here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> I did not say that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> It is an outrage to suggest it is a gift. I refuse to 
accept it and I challenge him to come and debate the issue during 
the referendum campaign in Quebec in the same forums I will 
attend, so that Quebecers and Canadians can look at the real 
figures and get the whole picture.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Madam Speaker, my 
remarks will be very short.
<P>
	I have said on more than one occasion in the House that there 
is not a region that does not have some legitimate frustration 
with the Government of Canada, and Quebec is no exception. 
The House must thoroughly examine the last 20 years of the 
presence of the Government of Canada in the province of 
Quebec and its attempts to try to make life meaningful and 
productive just as it does in every region of the country.
<P>
	Members of Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition should realize 
that not only do we have members in our caucus from the 
province of Quebec who represent a voice for Canada in that 
province but for many years before that there were members 
from Quebec who would disagree with the approach these 
members are taking today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I would like to associate myself with my 
colleagues to vigorously protest against the fact that the 
government does not limit itself to technicalities regarding 
equalization in Bill C-3.
<P>
	What should have been done is a comprehensive review of 
federal transfer payments to the provinces, including 
established programs financing through which the federal 
government makes contributions to health and post-secondary 
education; the Canada Public Assistance Plan through which the 
federal government makes contributions to the provinces' social 
assistance programs and welfare services; and all the other 
programs governed by federal-provincial arrangements.
<P>
	This piecemeal approach the government is taking will leave 
the door open to unpleasant surprises when the time comes to 
renegotiate the other bilateral arrangements. This approach does 
not give us a complete picture of all the cuts to come.
<P>
	In fact, the trends are worrying. Federal contributions to 
transfer programs as a whole are in free fall. In Quebec alone, 
federal transfer payments have dropped from 28.9 per cent of 
the gross revenues of the province in 1983-84 to 20.1 per cent in 
1993-94, and they should account for a as little as 15.8 per cent 
of Quebec's revenues by 1997-98.
<P>
	Fiscal transfers no longer meet the objective they were 
intended to meet, although this objective was entrenched in the 
1982 Constitution to promote equity among the regions. It is 
common knowledge now that attaching limits to equalization 
and established programs financing  makes have-not provinces 
poorer and have provinces richer.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The federal government's withdrawal from various transfer 
programs is proving to be very expensive for Quebec. It is clear 
that the federal government wants to reduce its deficit at the 
expense of the provinces, and including Quebec.
<P>
	Since the Bloc's position on equalization was already 
explained at some length by the two previous speakers for the 
Official Opposition, I would like to address two areas where 
Quebec did not receive its fair share: research and development 
and established programs financing.
<P>
	Why is spending on research and development so important 
for the economy? Why talk about research and development in a 
debate on equalization? Simply because research and 
development constitutes a so-called structural investment, an 
investment that helps create a modern and competitive industry 
that generates high quality, well paying and permanent jobs. 
Through its productivity and growth, industry has a positive 
impact on the entire economy of a country.
<P>
	The federal government is a very important player in research 
and development. In fact, it provides two types of funding for R 
and D activities: internal funding and external funding. Internal 
spending covers all R and D activities funded and conducted by 
the federal government. These expenditures are recurrent in 
nature. As for external spending, this covers all R and D 
activities which the government finances but does not conduct 
itself. This type of spending is random in nature since it can 
easily be shifted elsewhere in subsequent years.
<P>
	In 1989, the federal government funded nearly 30 per cent of 
all R and D activities in Canada. Between 1979 and 1989, 
Quebec received only 18 per cent of federal spending in this 
area, while Ontario received 50.1 per cent, which works out to 
$4.6 billion for Quebec and $12.5 billion for Ontario.
<P>
	In a study dealing with the equity of R and D financing, 
Pierre-Étienne Grégoire applied four criteria to determine 
under-funding or over-funding of R and D in the provinces.
<P>
	These criteria are as follows: demographic weighting; 
economic weighting, which reflects support for regional 
economic activities; significance of regional R and D activities, 
which reflects support for new technology in the region; and 
significance of R and D involvement by provincial 
governments.
<P>
	Accorded to these criteria, Quebec and Alberta are 
under-funded across the board. The study concludes that the 
provinces benefitting most in terms of regional development 
and economic growth are Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Ontario and Manitoba; 
Saskatchewan and British  Columbia benefit in terms of regional 
development; 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1114"> 1114 </A></B>
<P>
and Quebec and Alberta do not benefit, either in terms of 
regional development or economic growth.
<P>
	Finally, Quebec and Alberta are the only provinces with a 
negative balance for internal spending on research and 
development.
<P>
	If we consider the amounts paid under established programs 
financing, Quebec and the poorer provinces are paying a very 
high price for the policy adopted by the federal government.
<P>
	Established programs financing was introduced in 1977. 
Initially, the government indexed the per capita contribution and 
prorated this indexed contribution according to the population 
of each province. However, starting in 1982, the federal 
government gradually withdrew from financing this program by 
reducing the per capita increment.
<P>
	We must realize that across-the-board cuts per capita are felt 
more severely by the poorer provinces, and this situation 
becomes even worse with the ceiling on equalization payments, 
since the provinces no longer receive additional equalization to 
make up for the lost revenue caused by federal cutbacks.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Since 1982, cuts in established programs financing have 
meant a loss of revenue for Quebec, which amounted to $1.8 
billion in 1993-94.
<P>
	Let us consider the impact of federal disinvestment on 
post-secondary education, especially at the university level. It 
is generally agreed that basic requirements in terms of training 
and skills will increase because of economic globalization and 
the ensuing need to specialise.
<P>
	In its third report, the Conseil de la science et de la 
technologie predicts that by the year 2000, 64 per cent of all jobs 
will require post-secondary education. The government's 
withdrawal from funding our universities leads to 
under-funding of institutions that will be increasingly hard 
pressed to play the active role one expects them to play in this 
frenetic race to be competitive. Peter J. Nicholson, 
vice-president of the Bank of Nova Scotia, defines 
competitiveness as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The ability to produce goods and services that meet the test 
of international markets while citizens earn a standard of living 
that is both rising and sustainable over the long run''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	An economic study conducted at the request of the 
Organisation nationale universitaire, which deals with the 
consequences of disinvestment in higher education and was 
published in 1993, provides some significant figures in this 
respect. For instance, a 40-year old worker who graduated from 
high school earns about $23,000 while a university graduate 
earns $43,000. If we extrapolate what these would earn in the 
course of their working lives, the  university graduate receives 
additional income that mainly benefits governments, thanks to 
the current tax system. In Quebec, progressive tax rates allow 
the state to take an average of 53 per cent of the income of 
university graduates and 33 per cent in the case of high school 
graduates.
<P>
	The study concludes that this sizable difference reflects a 
potential loss to the State of over half a million dollars every 
time a high school graduate decides to enter the labour market 
instead of going on to earn a bachelor's degree.
<P>
	In the short term, the government saves money by 
disinvesting in higher education but, in the long term, these 
so-called savings result in a loss, and as the organization says, 
when the government wants to save money in the short term and 
decides to withhold one dollar from its funding of higher 
education, every dollar not invested will, in the long run, cause 
the government to lose $10 in tax revenue. The substantial 
reduction in tax revenue will, sooner or later, have to be 
compensated by a corresponding increase in the tax burden for 
all taxpayers. Unfortunately we will never be able to 
compensate for the net loss in human capital to our economic, 
social and cultural development. Basically disinvestment means 
that human potential and creativity remain untapped, and the 
loss to society is immense.
<P>
	Of course disinvestment also has a negative impact through 
the resulting drain on unemployment insurance and welfare.
<P>
	According to the Bureau de la statistique du Québec, in 1992, 
the unemployment rate was 14.3 per cent among high school 
graduates, while during the same period, university graduates 
experienced an unemployment rate of 5.8 per cent, despite the 
recession.
<P>
	There is also a very significant cost in terms of social 
assistance, and the government's disinvestment in funding for 
university education will increase the number of people who 
will need social assistance later on.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	According to Statistics Canada, in 1986-87, 52.2 per cent of 
welfare recipients were people who had only partially 
completed their high school studies, whereas 2.4 per cent were 
university graduates.
<P>
	We could talk for a long time about the negative impact on the 
economy of the federal government withdrawal in the field of 
post-secondary education, but all these figures do not say 
anything about the loss of human potential resulting from this 
disengagement of the federal government.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1115"> 1115 </A></B>
<P>
	After participating in this exercise, my party and myself 
come to the following conclusions. First, Quebec is far from 
getting its share in the research and development sector. This 
loss results in a very heavy price for our province, since R and 
D is an extremely dynamic sector of a country's economy. I 
want to point out that, overall, between 1979 and 1989, Quebec 
received $8 billion less than Ontario for that sector alone. In 
fact, Quebec's economy will feel the adverse effects of this loss 
for a long time to come.
<P>
	Our second conclusion is that tax transfers are no longer a 
reliable source of financing for Quebec and for all the have-not 
provinces. Cuts imposed by Ottawa deprive Quebec of 
important revenues. If at least those cuts helped reduce the 
deficit, they would provide some benefit, but we are well aware 
that such is not the case. In fact, the federal government forces 
the poor provinces, including Quebec, to pay for its 
mismanagement.
<P>
	The third conclusion which can be drawn is that all the cuts 
made to the tax transfer system have the effect of increasing the 
fiscal burden of the poor provinces, that select club to which 
Quebec belongs. In 1992-93 Quebec lost $2 billion under the 
established programs financing alone, yet the law forces the 
province to maintain national standards regarding the quality of 
services to which the federal government contributes less and 
less.
<P>
	Sovereignty has become more necessary than ever for 
Quebec. All the measures taken by the federal government to cut 
these tax transfers to provinces destabilize Quebec's finances. 
To make things worse, the federal government is not even able to 
control its deficit.
<P>
	I want to quote Mr. Jean Campeau who, when he came to my 
riding during the election campaign, said: ``There was a time 
when Quebec wondered if it could afford to leave Canada. Now 
Quebec knows that it can no longer afford to remain part of 
Canada''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for her speech. I 
have several questions for her. First, I would like her to explain 
to the House and to those listening to this debate the difference 
between sovereignty and separation, because I do not really see 
any difference between these two concepts. I have to say that 
when I talk to Canadians, not only those outside Quebec but 
those in Quebec as well, they have some difficulty 
understanding the concepts. I think that when the hon. member 
uses the word ``sovereignty'' or ``sovereigntist'', it is simply to 
hide the true objective. That is my first question.
<P>
	As for my second question, I greatly appreciate that the hon. 
member has taken the time to explain her position, but is she 
prepared to concede that this is only one viewpoint? I find it 
amazing that in all the years that have gone by, nothing good has 
been done for Quebec as far as transfer payments are concerned. 
What you are doing, Madam, through you, Madam Speaker, is 
the same  thing that the Reform party did today. It was dishonest 
when it tried to make Canadians believe that out of a total of 
nearly $8 billion in transfer payments, Quebec received $3 
billion, or 47 per cent of the total. What they neglected to 
say-and they know this-was that Quebecers account for 60 
per cent of those who receive equalization payments.
<P>
<B>(1600 ) </B>
<P>
	Is the hon. member not trying to do the same thing, namely 
choosing situations that promote her aims, namely separation? 
She is trying to make Canadians, and in particular those who live 
in Quebec, believe that it is unhealthy to be a part of this 
beautiful country, that it is impossible to sit down and negotiate 
new agreements that would satisfy their requirements. I find that 
astonishing.
<P>
	I was surprised to see the hon. member do the same thing as 
Reformers who must be getting a little nervous. They are trying 
to make the voters believe that Quebec receives more than its 
fair share. They are claiming that Quebec receives 47 per cent of 
transfer payments whereas in actual fact, it accounts for 60 per 
cent and more of the population receiving such payments.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would care to respond to my 
comments?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Madam Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for his questions.
<P>
	It is very interesting to see that, in spite of the official position 
of your party-it is true that the red book has become a thing of 
the past but still-you seem to be in favour of a referendum 
debate. Good, welcome to the club!
<P>
	I do not want to spend too much time explaining the difference 
between sovereignty and separation, but the hon. member seems 
to have understood that sovereignty is a legal right. Sovereignty 
means that as a nation, we can negotiate our own treaties, make 
our own laws, levy our own taxes. Separation flows from 
sovereignty; once we have achieved sovereignty, we will be able 
to say, to put it simply, that we are separate. One is a legal 
reality, the other a consequence. Sovereignty is a legal status, 
and separation its consequence.
<P>
	There is one important point I should make though. This 
House may not be aware of this, for we are continually portrayed 
as playing the poor, but the truth of the matter is that this has 
never been the attitude in Quebec. We Quebecers are proud 
people. We prefer to stand, even on a broken leg.
<P>
	What I am getting at is that the federal government is taking 
nearly 23 per cent of its revenues from the pockets of Quebec 
taxpayers. On the other hand, between 1963 and 1993, federal 
departments have made less than 18 per cent-17.9 per cent to 
be exact-of their investments in Quebec. For 30 years-not 
one mind you-we never got more than 17.9 per cent of federal 
investments. This type of investment have a structuring effect. It 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1116"> 1116 </A></B>
<P>
creates  steady employment, steady jobs that make insecurity 
disappear.
<P>
	Instead, what you are giving us is unemployment and welfare, 
and we have had enough. This House and Canadians from coast 
to coast must understand once and for all that we are sick and 
tired of being told that we are lying to the people. We will not 
stand for that any more.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am very glad we can have some lighter moments in the House, 
even after listening to some nonsense from separatists.
<P>
	The previous speaker's comments relating to equalization 
payments were replete with data, numbers, all kinds of figures 
suggesting how the province of Quebec was getting the shaft in 
Confederation. I would invite the previous speaker from the 
Bloc to go beyond equalization payments. I can assure her there 
is a lot more to Canada and a lot more to equalization payments 
than sharing in the national wealth. It has to do with Canadians 
sharing in the entire cultural life of the country, sharing in its 
full experiences. That is what Canada is all about. It is not just 
raw numbers and raw figures as the Bloc suggests. I would invite 
these people to look beyond these narrow figures, which I 
suggest are placed in a context that really makes for a bogus 
argument, a bogus presentation.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	I would also say this. Yes, all of us are ignorant. One would 
think after listening to the Bloc that the only thing Quebecers are 
concerned about is how they are being shafted in Confederation 
and their preoccupations with the Constitution. I do not pretend 
to be an expert on Quebec but I know there is much more to that 
province and certainly much more to Quebecers than any 
concern about the Constitution and certain financial 
arrangements.
<P>
	I would also say the same thing about people who come from 
the other nine provinces. We do not know enough about Quebec. 
We ought to learn a lot more.
<P>
	I really appreciated the comments of the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. We can do a much better job of telling 
the Canadian story. I have always been a critic of the CBC, even 
though I worked there for 18 years. In a way the CBC enforces or 
perpetuates the two solitudes. We have an English language 
network and a French language network and neither comes 
together which is very unfortunate.
<P>
	I would like to see many more exchanges, French language 
programs appearing on the English television network and vice 
versa-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but time has 
run out.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Would 
the House allow the hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata 
to reply to the hon. member?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Unanimous consent 
from the House would be required to allow the hon. member to 
answer.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We need unanimous consent to permit a response from the 
hon. member for Rimouski-Témiscouata. We are a minute over 
our time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I 
believe you will find that the next speaker may be the member 
for Winnipeg-St. James.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Thank you, but I still do 
not have unanimous consent for the member to continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I was not expecting to speak at this time, but I certainly welcome 
the opportunity to talk about the equalization program.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, the equalization program as we know it 
embodies some of the great ideals and great values of 
Canadians. I cannot think of a much greater ideal under our 
democracy than sharing one's wealth, sharing one's resources. It 
is an ideal and a value that all of us cherish. It recognizes that 
there are those provinces and those people who perhaps have it a 
little better than others. It may not always be that way.
<P>
	It had been my experience that the province of Ontario was the 
fat cat province. We always looked on Ontario as rich, with 
plenty of people, the home of manufacturing, the leading 
province, certainly the leading English speaking province. We 
expected Ontarians to share some of that wealth with the rest of 
Canadians. It was always very laudatory on the part of Ontarians 
that they wanted to do that. They wanted to share their resources 
and their wealth.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	In the last three or four years things have not been going so 
well for Ontario. In relative terms it is still a rich province but it 
has not been doing as well as in the 1940s, the 1950s, the 1960s 
and the 1970s. At certain periods of our national life some 
provinces contribute to other provinces that are not doing so 
well. That is why I am a very strong supporter of equalization 
and of this equalization program.
<P>
	It was pointed out by one of the Reform speakers yesterday, 
and I appreciated his comments, that the proposal put forward in 
the bill by the finance minister gives the program an element of 
certainty. We are going to know for the next five years what this 
program is all about. We may not be totally happy with the floor 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1117"> 1117 </A></B>
<P>
or the ceiling that is set but as least we know for the next five  
years where we are going with respect to equalization payments. 
Right now it is in the $8 billion range and the projections under 
the five-year figures put it at about $10 billion.
<P>
	Let me say one other thing as I talk about equalization and this 
element of caring and sharing under it. There are others in our 
society that could learn a lot from the government about 
equalization.
<P>
	What comes to mind is the National Hockey League. We know 
there are a number of NHL cities in the country that are scared to 
death they will lose their NHL franchises. The city of Winnipeg 
where I come from is one. Even though Edmonton has won five 
Stanley Cups and in the last 15 years has been one of the most 
prosperous and talented teams in the NHL there is even concern 
about the Edmonton Oilers moving. In fact Mr. Pocklington who 
owns the team has been trying for more than a year to move it. I 
do not think Quebec City is in a much different situation.
<P>
	What I am getting to is that the NHL does not have 
equalization. I suspect the NHL is run by a bunch of right 
wingers who believe in dog eat dog, everybody for himself and 
take whatever you can. That is what they have been doing. But it 
certainly works against the best interests of smaller cities. There 
is no doubt that if the NHL does not deal with this problem, if it 
does not put a cap on players' salaries or if the NHL does not 
deal with some of the financial problems, smaller cities like 
Winnipeg, Edmonton, Calgary and Quebec City will not be able 
to keep that financial pace. They will ultimately lose out and 
those franchises will move to larger markets in the United 
States.
<P>
	I bring this up only because there are others in Canada who 
can learn a lesson from equalization. I cannot imagine this 
Canada without equalization. I cannot imagine not helping the 
province of Newfoundland, or the province of New Brunswick, 
or my home province of Manitoba.
<P>
	My province geographically speaking is smack dab in the 
middle of the country but we are in terms of wealth a have less 
province. I do not say have not. I do not like that term. I say have 
less. However, thanks to equalization and other transfer 
payments of one kind or another, Manitobans can expect a 
certain standard of living, a certain standard of services thanks 
to a vision that our forefathers had a long time ago. I am very 
proud of that.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to say that I am very glad the 
government has re-enunciated its commitment to equalization. 
We know where we are going for the next five years. It is very 
important. We have heard this from a number of government 
agencies, not only from provinces. They want to know where we 
are taking them. They want to know where they stand. I think 
that is very reasonable.
<P>
	I support Bill C-3 and I hope we can move forward with it 
very quickly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
thank the hon. member for Winnipeg St. James for his 
comments.
<P>
	The hon. member made a terrible mistake. He discussed 
hockey in the middle of a political speech. Whenever we do that 
we run the risk that the conversation will quickly turn away from 
politics and stay strictly with hockey.
<P>
	The NHL has a form of equalization. It has the annual draft 
which has the effect of redirecting players to teams that perform 
poorly and I should add, redirecting players away from the areas 
of the NHL to some of the smaller urban centres in Canada that 
produce a lot of the hockey talent. Arguably there is a form of 
equalization that is overequalization and quite detrimental in 
that case to our interests. It is somewhat like what the member 
for Lethbridge alluded to yesterday when he talked about 
overequalization in some of our programs here.
<P>
	I would just like to ask the member for his comments on one 
question. I am curious about his perspective. Under equalization 
levels for this year, 1994-95, the per capita top up for the 
province of Manitoba is $849 and for the province of 
Saskatchewan $552, his province and the neighbouring 
province. This is a tremendous difference. I have looked at 
statistics from Statistics Canada and I see that Saskatchewan 
residents have a lower personal income per capita than 
Manitoba. This seems to me to be a bizarre result and one that is 
in favour of his province.
<P>
	Does he think there are problems in the formula? Maybe some 
time down the road we should study the formula and come up 
with a more fair one that is easier for people to understand and a 
little more clear in the kinds of results it produces. I would be 
interested in his views on some of the particulars of the 
equalization program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of 
my hon. friend from Calgary West. I am glad he supports the 
principle of equalization. I did overlook the matter of drafting in 
the NHL. However when it comes to straight financial 
arrangements there is no equalization.
<P>
	With respect to Manitoba's share under the equalization 
program, my good friend from Calgary is suggesting that 
perhaps Manitoba is not treated as well as Saskatchewan. I am 
not prepared to give an evaluation right here and now about that. 
Earlier today in question period the Prime Minister pointed out 
that this is a very complicated formula.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1118"> 1118 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to say this to my friend from Calgary. I do not 
think that equalization can be all things to all people. It cannot 
be the panacea or the answer for every fiscal problem faced by 
the federal government or by the provinces.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I would just point out one thing to my hon. friend. When it 
comes to western stabilization or the famous Crow rate, western 
farmers share in that program to the tune of $700 million, 
somewhere in that neighbourhood.
<P>
	That is a program for western farmers. We are all in favour of 
it. As far as I know, people in Newfoundland do not share in it. 
People in Nova Scotia do not share in it and so it goes. People in 
Quebec do not share in it.
<P>
	What I am getting at is that while perhaps equalization does 
not take care of every difficulty that we have in this 
Confederation, we do have other programs. If the speaker is 
asking whether we should not revisit the formula that is used 
under equalization, no, I would not bury my head in the sand. If 
that is what he is asking it is fine and dandy with me.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank and congratulate the hon. 
member for Winnipeg for his speech on hockey-it is my 
favourite topic-but we will now move on to something more 
important. I found out that he worked for the CBC, which is my 
other topic. This honourable organization did such a good job 
that the two solitudes have grown further apart with each 
passing year.
<P>
	This afternoon, the Prime Minister reminded us that 
somebody else had his head in the sand; the hon. member just 
told us that he does not have his head in the sand. I must 
conclude that this government is going from coast to coast in a 
submarine to hide from reality in this country. This country is 
two countries. That is what we have been trying to say since we 
came here, and we must stop suppressing this reality. There are 
two countries: Canada and Quebec. We came here to speak for 
Quebec and to defend its interests. In addition we were 
presented with Official Opposition status on a silver platter. We 
will also look after Canada because we want the country to be in 
good shape when we leave. We do not want a heavier debt 
burden and we want our share of a country that can stand up. We 
do not want to leave in a wheelchair.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, all I want to say is that the 
Bloc suffers from double vision and I suggest it should see a 
doctor.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I listened closely to the previous speaker. He criticizes 
Bloc members, and the province of Quebec, for focusing on 
money and on how poor we are and how we do not get our fair 
share of the equalization  pie. But if this gentleman paid us a 
visit, he would see the effects of not getting our fair share of 
equalization payments for research and development and 
regional development. What is the outcome? Unemployment.
<P>
	Let him go and tell Quebecers on unemployment or welfare 
what a great and beautiful country Canada is. When one is 
hungry, unemployed or dependent on welfare, one does not care 
much about this great and beautiful Canada. That is why 
equalization transfers are important. We must get our piece of 
the pie.
<P>
	Quebec hands over to Canada over $28 billion a year in taxes, 
but we are left with the crumbs. This has drastic consequences in 
the daily lives of the people of our country, which is Quebec. 
That is why we are not afraid to claim what Quebec is entitled to.
<P>
	We are not indifferent to the Canadian deficit and $500 billion 
debt, as it has daily consequences for all people living in this 
country. Speeches such as the one delivered earlier should not be 
allowed.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Madam Speaker, of course we have serious 
problems in the country, including the good province of Quebec. 
I would not suggest for a moment that we overlook some of the 
serious human problems that arise from unemployment and 
other difficulties we have in the economy.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	All I was trying to suggest in my earlier remarks was that one 
cannot measure this great country, this Confederation, in 
financial terms alone. There is a lot more to this country than 
raw data, raw figures and raw numbers. The Bloc is rather 
myopic in this and perhaps cannot see through the barrier that it 
has placed in front of it, but if it would try to evaluate this 
country in a more wholesome way and take into account all the 
elements that make up the country it would come to a much more 
positive assessment of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the Reform Party supports the principle of Bill C-3 as 
was noted by the two Reformers who spoke on the subject before 
me. Reformers, as well my constituents, believe that it is 
important to preserve and cultivate the humanitarian instincts of 
Canadians that drive us to want to help those who find 
themselves in financial or other difficulties.
<P>
	My two colleagues have noted two criticisms of Bill C-3. One 
is its planned increases in the level of transfers while the 
government is beset by very serious financial problems. All 
spending needs to be curtailed. Interprovincial equalization 
payments ought not to be exempted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1119"> 1119 </A></B>
<P>
	The second criticism was that the government has been 
carrying the principle of equalization too far. If Bill C-3 does 
what it is designed to do there is no need to use other spending 
programs to favour provinces with low income and taxation 
capacity.
<P>
	These two objections to Bill C-3 are valid. I would like to add 
an additional one which involves the very nature of the 
equalization program as it functions now. My criticism is based 
on my academic research and understanding of the problems 
which are caused by subsidy programs of all sorts. It is also 
based on messages which I have received from my constituents.
<P>
	Finally I should note that the criticism is based on the same 
kind of reasoning which underlies the recently announced 
government review of all social programs in Canada. These 
programs have failed to deliver on the promise which underlies 
their design. They have blunted incentives, increased 
unemployment, trapped people in poverty and made them 
dependent upon government support. These are almost identical 
words to those used by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development in the House.
<P>
	In addition, the programs, not the innocent victims who have 
reacted to the incentives created by the government, have 
contributed much to the present fiscal crisis of the country. I 
believe the compassionate people of Canada are fully in favour 
of helping others who have fallen on hard times. However, many 
Canadians have told me they also insist their aid be conditional 
upon efforts being made by the unfortunate to change their own 
lot. Some, like those with permanent handicaps, cannot and are 
not expected to do so. For those the support is happily given on a 
permanent basis. For others, however, the aid must be limited 
and conditional.
<P>
	It is well known that the interprovincial system of 
equalization payments was designed to create greater equality. 
However, when the program was designed it was hoped that such 
transfers would be temporary because the federal government 
simultaneously started a substantial program for regional 
economic development.
<P>
	Since the beginning, regional economic development 
programs have been beset by difficulties. There have been 
experiments with a variety of models and with locating 
responsibility for their administration in different ministries.
<P>
	During the 1980s I was the academic director of a research 
project on the Canadian service industries undertaken by the 
Fraser Institute and financed by what was then the department of 
regional industrial expansion. One of the prime motives for the 
study had been the realization that the spending of billions of 
dollars on infrastructure and megaprojects, as well as direct 
subsidies to industry, had not narrowed the income gaps 
between the have and the have not provinces.
<P>
<B>(1630 ) </B>
<P>
	The fact that over 70 per cent of all Canadians are working in 
the service sector had awakened interest in the possibility that 
perhaps more development per dollar could be obtained by 
support of service industry projects than the traditional 
investment in structures and machinery.
<P>
	I mention this study of the service industries to illustrate the 
problems which regional development programs have 
encountered, problems which in the view of many have been so 
severe they made the programs an almost complete failure. The 
reasons for this failure are quite clear now.
<P>
	Historically regional disparities in income in Canada and all 
industrial countries of the world were due to different 
endowments with natural resources. The maritimes enjoyed one 
of the highest levels of income in Canada at a time when rich 
fisheries and coal were the primary base of the income of people 
and regions. Later the fertile plains of the prairies gave that 
region one of the highest incomes in the country.
<P>
	For at least the last 70 years, however, the wealth of nations 
has been increasingly based on the accumulation of human and 
knowledge capital rather than natural resources.
<P>
	Just look at the per capita income of Singapore and Hong 
Kong, tiny geographic regions with zero natural resources. 
Singapore does not even have enough water for its people. Some 
estimates suggest that as much as 60 per cent to 70 per cent of 
the wealth of modern industrial states consists of such 
intangible human and knowledge capital.
<P>
	Unfortunately for regional development prospects, human 
and knowledge capital are most productive only in large 
population centres, where the so-called agglomeration 
economies generate the high productivity that underlies high 
personal incomes. In these centres, the proximity of people 
lowers transportation and communication costs, allows 
increased specialization and creates other productivity 
increasing benefits like competition in markets for labour and 
goods and services.
<P>
	For this reason, in Canada and all industrial countries, 
megacities with high population densities have the highest 
incomes and outlying areas are further behind the more remote 
they are from the urban centres.
<P>
	According to this view of the role of human and knowledge 
capital and the economics of agglomeration, the solution to 
regional income inequalities lies in the movement of people 
from outlying areas to the centre. Such movement, which in 
Canada until the 1960s had been gradual and low cost, permitted 
higher incomes to be earned by the migrants and, more 
important, it raised the income of those remaining behind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1120"> 1120 </A></B>
<P>
	Just imagine incomes in the fishing industries in the 
maritimes or the farm sector in the prairies if the population 
of these regions were perhaps half its present level. The 
adoption of the best production technology, regardless of the 
effect on employment, would permit the smaller number of 
workers in these industries to enjoy higher levels of 
productivity and income. No one knows at what population 
levels emigration would have ceased. It is clear that eventually 
it would have equalized incomes in the centres and outlying 
regions, where income is broadly defined to include such 
intangibles as the quality of rural life and the cost of congestion 
in cities.
<P>
	The tragedy of many post-war government policies for 
Canada was that they disregarded the decreasing role of natural 
resource wealth in the increasing role of human capital and 
cities in economic development.
<P>
	The income equalization program being extended by Bill 
C-3, the regional development programs and the payment of 
unemployment insurance benefits to workers in seasonal 
industries like fishing have severely retarded outward migration 
from remote regions with low incomes. The natural adjustment 
which market forces were generating gradually were 
short-circuited by these policies.
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	The policies undoubtedly were well intentioned but basically 
flawed, unfortunately. They have had several unfortunate 
effects. To finance the transfers and fruitless development 
efforts in the outlying regions the productive areas had to be 
taxed more heavily. Extra payroll taxes going to the 
unemployment insurance funds have raised labour costs and 
discouraged employment.
<P>
	The disincentive effects of such taxation on investment, work 
and risk taking retarded the growth in the entire country's 
income and wealth. The lower rates of economic growth which 
started more or less with the initiation of these regional 
assistance programs in turn retarded the increase in government 
tax revenue. They therefore contributed significantly to the 
financial crisis and the need for the redesign of social programs 
that will be discussed in the House in upcoming months.
<P>
	Equally unfortunate has been the impact of the policies on the 
people in the outlying regions. I find it most distressing to see 
videos of workers in the maritime fishing industries and of 
farmers in the prairies who have lost their jobs and are afraid of 
losing their homes and possessions. Perhaps more important, as 
the Prime Minister kept noting during the election campaign, 
these people have lost their dignity. They have become 
dependent upon government handouts, the generosity of the 
House.
<P>
	The predicament which these people find themselves in is not 
of their own making. They are the victims who simply have 
acted rationally in their response to the incentives created by 
government policies.
<P>
	These people deserve better. They deserve that the 
government and this House initiate a review of the existing 
programs for regional assistance and development. The 
government has already announced plans for a major review and 
redesign of social programs affecting individuals. Regional 
assistance and development programs should be included 
explicitly in such a review.
<P>
	I have my own views on the insights which such a review 
might produce. Abstracting from all political considerations, 
Canada needs to restore market incentives for migration, the 
only fundamental and lasting solution to the problem of regional 
inequalities that does not also create dependence and a loss of 
dignity. To create these incentives all present forms of regional 
transfers must be phased out. Such phasing out should be 
gradual but certain.
<P>
	In place of current programs we need to have programs that 
are both economically efficient as well as consistent with the 
compassionate nature of Canadian society. Financial transfers 
to regions and provincial governments must be limited to 
situations where incomes are reduced to events beyond the 
control of those affected.
<P>
	Outstanding examples are the disappearance of fish stocks, 
bad harvests or low world prices for certain products. The 
payments must be limited to the duration of temporary adverse 
influences on incomes. In the case where incomes are lowered 
by permanent changes in conditions, financial support must be 
conditional upon the adoption of policies that bring about real 
adjustment to the new environment.
<P>
	People who are asked to make payments to help others should 
have a right in deciding on how this money is being spent. Many 
people believe the proposed characteristics of regional 
assistance programs must also be incorporated into social 
programs serving individual Canadians if the country ever 
wishes to restore the government's fiscal health and at the same 
time maintain a sound social security net for those in genuine 
need. They also agree that the sooner such a review is 
accomplished and acted upon, the better.
<P>
	For these reasons I recommend that the government append 
Bill C-3 to mandate such a review. In addition I recommend that 
the government send a message to the recipients of the 
equalization payments suggesting that future transfers will be 
made conditional upon real adjustment needed to equalize 
regional productivity and income.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I enjoyed my colleague's presentation in the 
sense that he had obviously thought very carefully about what he 
was going to say. Clearly what he has said reflects the fact that 
he studied it for some time. Although we may have some differ-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1121"> 1121 </A></B>
<P>
ences on how this  major problem he has underlined might be 
approached, I respect what was said.
<P>
	What bothers me certainly is not the approach he has taken or 
the content of the address. But today there were two remarks 
made by members of the Reform Party which bothered me a 
great deal.
<P>
	Looking at the transfer payments it is correct that Quebec gets 
47 per cent of the transfer payments, but there is the additional 
bit of information that Quebec represents roughly 60 per cent of 
the people who get transfer payments.
<P>
	I am wondering why his party would want to give the 
impression, which I got and I am not from Quebec, that Quebec 
was being favoured. We heard from Quebecers today, our 
friends the separatists-some of them are friends-who feel 
they are not getting enough.
<P>
	Another thing that bothers me is there seemed to be a 
suggestion that Manitoba was being favoured by this formula. I 
am from Manitoba. If that was the suggestion I am offended, 
unless I can be clearly shown that it is true.
<P>
	Now correct me if I am wrong. I am one of those members of 
Parliament who accepts the fact that he could be wrong. It seems 
to me that yesterday one of the hon. member's colleagues said 
the Reform Party would reduce the amount of transfer 
payments. If so, by how much and what would be the impact on 
Saskatchewan and my home province of Manitoba?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I welcome the opportunity to 
respond to some of the points the hon. member has made. I do 
not obviously know all the reasoning behind the statements 
made by my colleagues, but I can attempt to give an answer.
<P>
	The people of my riding are reacting to the fact that a province 
like Manitoba which according to Statistics Canada has a higher 
per capita income than Saskatchewan receives more per capita 
in transfers than Saskatchewan. This simply does not make any 
sense to people who are no experts in this complicated formula 
the Prime Minister referred to.
<P>
	Using the same idea with respect to Quebec, 47 per cent of the 
benefits are going to Quebec. It has 60 per cent of the 
population. I am sure the hon. member would like to look at the 
statistics in light of the per capita income. The per capita 
incomes of that 40 per cent of the population receiving transfers 
is way below those of Quebec.
<P>
	This has to be seen in the light of the complicated formula but 
also using some intuition. The income of Quebec is only 
fractionally below that of the average. That is why it is receiving 
this money. The statement about 47 per cent of the total transfer 
going to Quebec was not made in any disparaging way. It was 
made, as far as I remember, in response to a challenge that 
Quebec is not benefiting from this program.
<P>
	My constituents certainly are asking why a province with such 
a high income is receiving 47 per cent, even though it has 60 per 
cent. This is the formula but I am returning to the point that the 
hon. member had made on how difficult all this is to understand.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	I apologize about the third point that somebody said transfer 
payments should be reduced. I do not know who said that and in 
what context. I do not really wish to presume that I could answer 
that question for the hon. member.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
appreciated the hon. member's presentation, but I am 
particularly puzzled by some points in it. First, he says that if 
transfer payments had not been so high, people would have 
emigrated because of the lower payments. Perhaps they would 
have tried something else and found new resources where they 
were to ensure their economic vitality.
<P>
	Also, I would point out that if Quebec receives transfer and 
equalization payments, the total it receives from Ottawa is the 
same as what it sends to Ottawa, about $28 billion. 
Unfortunately the money comes back in the form of transfer and 
equalization payments, when it could come back as normal 
federal spending, such as Ontario receives.
<P>
	Thus Quebec wants to break free from this system. Many 
times we proposed the way to do it. Perhaps that could satisfy 
our member of the Reform Party. Does he have an opinion on 
that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased to hear probably 
for the 15th time now that hon. members from the Bloc are 
insisting that we hear repeatedly the story that Quebec is getting 
a raw deal in the extent to which it is sending money to Ottawa 
and the extent to which it is receiving money. I really have no 
more comment to make on this. It is a very complicated issue 
and that is why there is a dispute over the merit of this case.
<P>
	However on the substance of what I tried to say, I would point 
out that if in the 1960s we had not retarded the incentive for 
outward migration from some of the outward lying regions of 
Canada, the process which had gone on for the preceding 50 or 
60 years would have continued.
<P>
	The hon. member is an economist and realizes there would 
have been increased capital per worker and increased natural 
resources per worker remaining behind. Therefore the incomes 
would have gone up. Maybe more resources would have been 
discovered. Then outward migration would have slowed down. 
In the end we would have had a solution making everyone happy, 
those who were moving as well as those remaining behind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1122"> 1122 </A></B>
<P>
	We have destroyed this welfare maximizing process through 
our programs and I urge that they be re-examined.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Serré (Timiskaming-French River):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would first of all like to thank the member for 
Capilano-Howe Sound for his comments. However, I must tell 
you that I do not share his opinions. To avoid any confusion, I 
would say to the hon. member that, although I am seated on this 
side of the House and speak French, I am not a Bloc Quebecois 
member. I am one of the millions of francophones outside 
Quebec who consider Canada, including Quebec, as their 
country.
<P>
	Nevertheless, Madam Speaker, I have one thing in common 
with my colleague here from the Bloc; like him, I am puzzled 
too. From the beginning, since this House opened, I have heard 
the Reform Party with its far-right agenda telling us that we 
should not spend money to help the regions, we should not 
subsidize small business. Implicit in that is that people are poor 
through their own fault, because they want to be poor.
<P>
	I also deplore the debate on equalization turning into a battle 
between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Very little is said about 
the other provinces like New Brunswick and Newfoundland. I 
think that the equalization program is unique; it helps define us 
as Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	It is a program whereby the richer regions help the less 
well-off regions. I am from northern Ontario and I can tell you 
that our unemployment rate is probably higher than anywhere in 
Quebec. In some regions like Kirkland Lake, for example, it is 
40 per cent.
<P>
	That being said, I do not care whether my money is used to 
help people in Quebec, New Brunswick or Newfoundland. That 
is what Canada is all about.
<P>
	In the morning, the people in the Reform Party tell us that we 
absolutely must keep small rural post offices open, and I agree 
with that because it is a kind of regional development. We can 
keep our small post offices open because people elsewhere in the 
country subsidize them and I fully agree with that.
<P>
	What I do not understand is that in the morning, they ask us to 
do it, but in the afternoon, they tell us to cancel these programs. I 
would like to know what the Reform Party really wants on this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Unfortunately the 
period allocated to questions and comments has terminated. We 
will have to continue debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
debate that is going on today is important. It actually strikes at 
the very heart of what type of country we live in.
<P>
	Many times we engage in debate that has a very narrow 
interest across the country. This one certainly has not. I have 
indicated at other times when I have spoken in the House, 
specifically in opposition, that we have grown differently. We 
are a different state than our neighbours to the south and we are a 
different state than our two founding nations, both Britain and 
France.
<P>
	We have decided to do something a little different. We are 
unique. We have believed as a nation-it is a founding principle 
of our nation-that there is some sort of collective ownership of 
the resource that is Canada.
<P>
	We have structured programs through successive 
governments and have said that we believe in this great nation, 
Canada, which maybe one day has a disparity in the east, in 
Quebec or the west, that somehow governments have a 
responsibility to commit themselves to free market enterprise 
but at the same point in time to ensure that there is a 
redistribution of wealth in this great country.
<P>
	Indeed I can go back to the time of Confederation. Atlantic 
Canada at that point in time was a have region in this country. It 
was one of the wealthiest. Some would say that we have never 
looked up since we joined Confederation. Some others would 
say that perhaps in the short history of this country-we are not 
an old country-these cycles perhaps are very small.
<P>
	During the course of our short history we have believed that 
central governments have a responsibility to redistribute wealth 
in this country. We believe fundamentally with regard to those 
who because of the exploitation of a natural resource or certain 
trading patterns or routes exhibit great growth and personal 
wealth, employment and tax revenue that somehow there is a 
responsibility of government to redistribute that wealth.
<P>
	We have formalized that in our Constitution. We have federal 
legislation that is called equalization. The equalization 
payments are the most visible sign of that fundamental principle 
of sharing and collective ownership of resource in this country 
that the federal government does.
<P>
	Under equalization, the federal government has transferred 
some of the taxes that it takes to the less fortunate provinces to 
try to ensure that those provinces have the resources necessary 
to offer programs that their citizens deserve, indeed demand, 
programs of national standards so that within this great country 
we do not have very different applications of our economies.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1123"> 1123 </A></B>
<P>
	It has worked very well. Indeed I hear sometimes from the 
province of Quebec, from some of the members who are here 
from the Bloc, that Quebec has been shortchanged.
<P>
	That is up to debate. Sometimes in Atlantic Canada we 
believe that we have been shortchanged and that it is not just 
simply a matter of always wanting equalization. Perhaps it is a 
matter of fundamental government policies that allows each 
region of this country to develop its resources and its labour 
market so that some day we can all be contributors to the 
national economy instead of takers from the equalization pot.
<P>
	Sometimes we are fighting over scraps. I would much rather 
see policies enacted by provincial governments that allow for 
the freer movement of goods and services and people, that 
allows for various regions of this country to develop their 
economies so that the people can develop to the fullness of their 
potential. That day is not yet upon us. Equalization is indeed 
important. I remember just a few years ago in this place when 
the government of the day was different. It was the Conservative 
Party, which is now down to two members in this place. That 
government saw the the role of the federal government in 
redistributing wealth a little differently. Every penny it could 
save, every dollar of its own debt it could transfer to the 
provinces it saw as a victory. Then hopefully it could go the 
public and say: ``Look how well the economy has been 
managed''. Through the restraints it put on equalization, 
through its interpretation of some of the clauses we saw the 
numbers of dollars that the provinces expected to get from the 
federal government jump wildly.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	I think it was three years ago that I rose in my place and 
questioned the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister 
because that small, beautiful province of Prince Edward Island, 
whose minister of finance was preparing a budget, was given 
information by the federal government of the day that it could 
expect so many dollars in equalization under the formula for the 
previous year. At the last moment, two days before he tabled his 
budget in the P.E.I. legislature, the federal finance officials 
called and said: ``Sorry, we have reinterpreted some of the 
provisions and now you are going to get millions of dollars less 
in equalization''.
<P>
	What did that do to little Prince Edward Island? The treasurer 
was going to be reporting a surplus in his budget. Can you 
imagine a surplus in this day and age? That surplus was turned 
into a deficit.
<P>
	In my province of Nova Scotia the minister of finance, a Tory 
at the time, and I guess they did not even talk among themselves 
because he was caught quite unaware, found out he was going to 
get $72 million less. The province had already spent the money. 
Therefore, there was a pressing need from the provincial finance 
ministers and treasuries to put some order into what they could  
reasonably expect to receive from the federal government.
<P>
	This bill puts some order in it. It is a five year plan wherein we 
tell the provinces: ``We cannot give you everything you might 
want, but we are going to give you some certainty. We will tell 
you what our plan is and we will guarantee that we will not 
deviate from that plan in a way that negatively impacts on your 
fiscal ability to conduct your affairs in your own province''. 
That is a plus. I do not think there is a premier of any of the seven 
provinces that receive equalization who would not get up an 
applaud this very positive measure.
<P>
	There is another area that the bill does not address but it is 
equally important, called the EPF, established programs 
financing. These are programs that the federal government gets 
into to again try to equalize opportunity around the country. 
These are programs that fund our health care system in Canada 
and fund post-secondary education.
<P>
	I told one of my colleagues from the Reform Party who called 
me a socialist Liberal, the other day-I thank you for the 
compliment by the way-that if it was not for EPF to the 
provinces across Canada that as the son of a coal miner from 
Cape Breton who not through any fault of his own but because of 
the working conditions of the day saw more pay days than he 
saw pay cheques, I would not have been able to afford to go to 
university. In some of the poorest provinces if it was not for the 
established programs financing, the EPF, we would have 
different systems of health care right across this country.
<P>
	Those Liberal policies of days gone by just like equalization 
were corrupted by the previous administration. The result was 
that provinces that had programs of national standard dictated 
primarily by the federal government, as in health care, found in 
every single year, in every federal Tory budget that came into 
this place that they could expect less and less.
<P>
	In a place like Newfoundland if you receive $12 million less 
for post-secondary education where in the name of goodness are 
you going to pick that up on your limited tax base in that 
province? In a place like Nova Scotia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba 
or Quebec, when a federal government unilaterally cuts because 
it has mismanaged the economy like the Tories did and says that 
it is not going to be participating at the same level as it did last 
year, tell me where those provinces pick it up. They do not.
<P>
	One thing we said during our campaign and the Prime 
Minister has also said we will work on is once again to put some 
certainty into the levels of EPF, establish programs financing. 
We cannot give them everything. We have a huge deficit and a 
huge debt but we will put some certainty so that ministers of 
health and ministers responsible for post-secondary education 
in each of our provinces will be able to sit down and with some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1124"> 1124 </A></B>

certainty know that they are not going to get the royal  shaft in 
the next federal budget that comes down from the federal 
government. That is exactly what we need.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	I want to give some statistics. I am not going to criticize 
members of the Bloc Quebecois for their political beliefs. That 
is what freedom of expression is all about in the democratic 
process. We will have great and hopefully historic debates in 
this place about the issues they wish to put forward. However the 
reality is that many of the fractures we currently see in our 
country are recent ones. They can be traced back to a sense of not 
being listened to, a sense of betrayal by many regions of the 
country in their dealings with the federal government.
<P>
	The province I come from does not want handouts. I would 
desperately love to stand in this House some day and complain 
that we are getting too much money and that it should go 
somewhere else.
<P>
	My role as a member of Parliament is not just to represent and 
try to build a strong Nova Scotia. It is to try to better Canada. It 
is to try to ensure that we pass policies and programs which 
allow each and every one of our citizens, no matter who they are, 
no matter what their language, no matter where they come from, 
whether they are native born or immigrant, to participate to the 
fullness of their potential in this great country. That is what we 
are all here for.
<P>
	Over the last number of years we have seen the erosion of the 
regime where we did transfer and did believe in collective 
ownership of the resources and riches of Canada. I want to give 
some sense as to why we are seeing fractures in the east and 
maybe in Quebec, but certainly in the west. They say that federal 
governments have not listened to them.
<P>
	The federal Conservative government, in a number of 
successive budgets, possibly three or four, changed the 
established programs financing formula which is another form 
of equalization. It said it would participate on increases using 
the consumer price index, CPI minus one, CPI minus two, CPI 
minus three. What did that mean?
<P>
	To a province like Nova Scotia it meant that if health care 
costs went up by 5 per cent the federal government no longer 
was giving out 50 cents on the dollar on that increase. The 
benchmark if it was the previous year was 50:50, but any 
increase over that would only be cost shared on a formula that 
said cost is consumer price index minus 3 per cent.
<P>
	If the consumer price index was 5 per cent and the health care 
costs went up by 5 per cent there was not full sharing on that 5 
per cent. Full sharing was received on 2 per cent which meant 
that the poorest provinces had to find within their limited tax 
bases a way to fully recover the 3 per cent increase. It was 100 
per cent on those dollars, no 50-cent dollars.
<P>
	What has it meant? It means under the old formula the 
province of Quebec will be the first province to no longer see a 
transfer in cash for hospital expenditures. It will be the first. It 
means that over the course of its 10-year program in health care 
alone the federal government had withdrawn on full funding 
50:50, to the tune of $29.998 billion. In 1989-90 as a result of 
the government's formula where it rejigged what participation 
meant, it meant that the health care system in the provinces lost 
$1.107 billion.
<P>
	What does one do in British Columbia? It is hard enough to 
deal with that if it is a so-called have province such as Ontario, 
which is not really a have any more because of the New 
Democratic government and its policies. But Alberta and British 
Columbia are finding it tough enough. What about the 
economies where there is deep recession and even depression?
<P>
	What about education? As a result of this rejigging of EPF, 
this fundamental tenet of Canadian federal-provincial relations, 
in post-secondary education, during a 10-year period the 
Conservative policies will have cost $12.109 billion out of 
federal government participation on post-secondary education.
<P>
	What does that mean? It means in the poorest provinces, the 
smallest provinces we have already started to create a society 
where it does matter where one lives and it does matter what 
one's tax base is, because the province of Nova Scotia has now 
seen transferred over nine years of Tory government a huge 
amount of the federal mismanaged debt. It is down sitting on its 
desk now. The same can be said for Newfoundland, Quebec, 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan. That is what it has done. Therefore 
the pressures on us now have been caused by intentional fiscal 
policies.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	I do not think we can right all the wrongs of the past and I am 
not suggesting for one second that we could. I wish we could, but 
I do not think we can. What we can do is work with the 
provinces. We can tell them we are not going to give them the 
shaft every time they turn around at budget time. We are 
prepared to sit down and work with them. We understand that a 
dollar saved at the federal level by reducing transfers for these 
necessary programs is not really a dollar saved when looking at 
the impact on these smaller provinces.
<P>
	I do not know what the Minister of Finance will come down 
with but I know our government will uphold the commitment it 
made to Canadians and to the premiers during the election 
campaign. We will not do what the previous government did and 
come in and lay waste to the equalization programs and 
established programs financing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1125"> 1125 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not think there is an issue that grips Canadians more 
today than whether or not our health care system can survive. 
There is a funding crisis and a utilization crisis in our health 
care system. Surely the way we deal with that is not to continue 
with the policies of the past government. We must deal with 
it co-operatively and recognize that the federal government got 
us into these programs and the federal government cannot be 
allowed to abandon them.
<P>
	We also believe in fiscal responsibility. We have to look at the 
finances of Canada not just at the finances of the federal 
government. The finances of our provinces, the territories and 
our municipalities all impact on whether or not we are able to 
grow and prosper or whether or not we will be weighed down by 
debt. Our federal government has indicated it is prepared to deal 
with that.
<P>
	In every one of the economic policies we pursue as a 
government, no matter how scary the deficit might be, no matter 
how many special interest groups may scream, whine and 
threaten, we will always, always, always make those economic 
decisions based on the impact on every average Canadian. That 
is different. That should give some hope to the unemployed. It 
should give some hope to the people in the poorest regions. It 
should give hope to some of the have not people in the have 
provinces who need training, who need to be put back to work, 
who want to be taxpayers instead of tax takers.
<P>
	We may debate whether or not it is enough, but this is an 
initiative that stops the slide of federal dollars into the 
provinces. This initiative sends out a signal and a sign to the 
provinces that there is a new gang in town. This is a new 
Parliament. We are prepared to work with each and every one of 
the provinces to ensure that the priorities of Canadians are 
expressed and fulfilled not just by the federal government but by 
our provincial legislatures as well.
<P>
	I applaud the government but I also let it know there are some 
on this side of the House, now that we are government, who still 
believe we have a fundamental responsibility to stand and speak 
for the people who elected us. To date the ministers seem to have 
listened. I know the Prime Minister has.
<P>
	I know that many on this side of the House and on the other 
side as well will be vigilant in ensuring the government fulfils 
the commitments we have all collectively made to our 
constituents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I greatly 
appreciated the presentation by the hon. member of the 
government party. I think he painted an interesting picture of the 
crisis in which the previous government had plunged the country 
for nine years, I would, however, like to have his reaction to or 
views on some of my concerns which he touched on.
<P>
	Earlier on, we had the opportunity to discuss transfer 
payments. At that time, I expressed a number of reservations 
and received some answers.
<P>
	Now we are looking at the issue of established programs 
financing. Regarding this matter, we know that if the trend 
continues, as the hon. member mentioned, then in a few years 
time, Quebec will no longer be receiving any funding at all. 
Eventually, a number of provinces would see their share also 
reduced to zero.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	In 1977 the federal government made a commitment to the 
provinces in the area of established programs financing. At the 
time the commitment was based on the formula that the hon. 
member mentioned a while ago. On the strength of this 
commitment, each province set up its own health care and 
post-secondary education programs.
<P>
	Over the past ten years or so, the government has gradually 
reneged on its commitments. At the same time the taxpayers in 
each province must continue to pay their full share of taxes. The 
money that the taxpayer was giving to Ottawa was not being 
reinvested in his or her province, as the federal government and 
the provinces had agreed it would be in the late 1970s.
<P>
	Could we not call this a misappropriation of funds? I will ask 
the hon. member to comment on this point in a few minutes. The 
fact remains that under the present circumstances, this approach 
would seem to be the safer bet. I would like to repeat what the 
hon. member said.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We want to put a certainty into the EPFs. We do not have that 
at this stage and have not had it for the past 10 years.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The best guarantee we could have that the provinces are 
receiving their fair share is if the taxpayers in each provinces 
remit directly to the province, and Quebecers to Quebec, the 
money which is now sent directly to Ottawa and which is not 
fully reinvested, and less and less in each provincial health care 
system.
<P>
	I will conclude with a question for the hon. member. Does he 
not think that each province should have exclusive jurisdiction 
over health care?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Madam Speaker, the proposal the member 
puts forward certainly is debatable. I do not have the figures 
here for transfers to the province of Quebec. Looking at tax 
revenues going out and transfers going in, I would suspect that at 
least recently Quebec has not been hard done by, nor has Nova 
Scotia. At some point we will be net givers. I hope that at some 
point the province of Quebec will be a true have province 
according to the fiscal definitions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1126"> 1126 </A></B>
<P>
	If the question is would it not be better if Nova Scotia just 
collected its own taxes and kept everything it collected, I would 
like someone to tell me how it is going to decide what 32 per 
cent of hospital beds should be shut down in that province. I 
would like somebody to explain which universities will have 
to close and how people with my type of background will be 
able to get a university education.
<P>
	The reality is that not each province at any given point in time 
is able to pay its way on all these programs. Equalization is not 
there as a handout; it is supposed to be a hand up. It is supposed 
to allow the provinces, dealing strictly with equalization, to 
have enough resources to try to build the infrastructures within 
their economies so that they can be competitive. It is not meant 
to keep them in poverty; it is meant to try to take them out of 
poverty.
<P>
	When dealing with established programs financing I would 
caution my colleague to be very careful. My understanding is 
that those provinces which get EPFs, at least the seven that get 
equalization, are getting more than what they would get if they 
just kept their own tax base.
<P>
	The question is not whether it is better to be sovereign. The 
question is whether we can work together as a nation with all our 
component parts to ensure that if the principles are no longer 
valid then there will be a debate on it. If the principles of a 
universally funded health care system are not valid and 
assistance to post-secondary institutions is not valid then let us 
have a public debate on it, and not necessarily here.
<P>
	Let the Canadian people speak. We would find that the people 
in the Gaspé, the people on the greater northern peninsula and 
the people from the plains of Saskatchewan might jump up and 
say: ``What are you trying to do to our country?''
<P>
	The question is not whether or not we should have these 
programs. The question is whether or not we are able to afford 
them and whether or not the federal government as the senior 
partner in Confederation is prepared to work with each 
individual province to ensure that these programs continue.
<P>
	I want to speak about EPFs and health care in the province of 
Quebec. The government in Quebec has done some very neat 
things in dealing with trying to keep the escalating costs of 
health care from going through the roof. Other provinces should 
look to Quebec to see what it has done.
<P>
<B>(1715) </B>
<P>
	I remember reading an article. One of the major costs of the 
escalation of health care is that every community has an out 
patient service and in order to properly staff an out patient 
service, look at the number of people on average coming 
through and determine how many doctors have to be there, what 
equipment has to be there, an anesthesiologist, a surgeon on 
duty, all of those things, and it is based on volume.
<P>
	Some people say as many as 80 per cent of the visits to an 
emergency unit can be handled by a GP. They can be handled by 
a nurse or a nurse practitioner. Because we have become used to 
it being free perhaps it is over used. Perhaps it is abused.
<P>
	The province of Quebec decided not to deny anybody health 
care but make alternate health care facilities available. If I were 
in Montreal and walked in needing stitching of a cut on my hand 
it would agree to do it but it would cost me a few dollars because 
it is not an emergency service. If I went across the road to the 
clinic I would be covered under the health care program.
<P>
	That has saved the Quebec health care system tens of millions 
of dollars. There are efficiencies that we can look at. The federal 
government must lead in sharing these good examples as the 
province of Quebec has done.
<P>
	I was in London, Ontario, at St. Joseph's Hospital, and 
London decided it had to better manage the health care budget it 
had in that hospital. It came in with a new management called 
total quality management, TQM. Within a year not only did it 
have better and happier staff in the hospitals, not only did it 
handle more people in a more efficient manner but it saved about 
13 per cent of its budget. It was a large budget. It had not even 
intended when it set out to try to save money.
<P>
	In health care, in post-secondary education, we have to lead 
the way. There are fewer dollars here. We have to lead the way in 
rationalization of services, both in the health care and in the 
post-secondary educational system.
<P>
	I would leave my hon. colleague with this comment. I would 
ask him, and maybe he has figures to the contrary, to check with 
his party's research bureau to find out whether the province of 
Quebec, at this point at least, has a net output of taxes or a net 
input of taxes. If he could find that out I would be pleased again 
to debate the issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot):</B> Madam Speaker, we have 
heard much about the transfer of wealth of Canada to the 
provinces.
<P>
	If we look at our debt and our deficit and the borrowing we 
have to do we are not transferring the wealth of Canada, one 
might say, we are transferring the wealth of other countries we 
borrow from and the people of Canada from whom we have 
borrowed.
<P>
	We have seen the Liberal government of past years plunge our 
country into a debt situation of approximately $200 billion. We 
have seen the Conservative government more than double that in 
the last nine years until we are now sitting in a situation looking 
at a $500 billion debt. We are plunging into debt by another $40 
billion approximately and we have paid interest on that debt of 
$40 billion in the last year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1127"> 1127 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member, if he has time to respond to 
the question, if he feels we can continue in this way in view 
of the plunge into debt we have experienced over the last 20 
years.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Is there unanimous consent to continue?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, time has 
expired.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is not an easy task to explain the equalization process 
so that our voters, the people of Canada can assess this thing, but 
I think that it is important that we do so. It is one of the 
responsibilities that fall upon us as politicians.
<P>
	As a preamble, I would like to quote the statement the 
Minister of Finance made on January 21, 1994, when he 
unveiled the details about the renewal of the equalization 
program for five years.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	He said this: ``This is a key program to reduce disparities 
between provinces in terms of their revenue raising capacity''.
<P>
	He also said: ``I have indicated to my colleagues that I will 
proceed with this renewal in a financially responsible way, 
taking into account both the needs of the citizens in each 
province and the need for the seven provinces that receive 
equalization payments to enjoy the necessary stability for 
planning''.
<P>
	This is a little arid, but it is important to understand what this 
statement implied.
<P>
	Equalization payments are calculated using a method 
prescribed by federal legislation which takes into consideration 
the overall capacity of each province as well as local 
governments to raise revenues through taxes and various dues. 
This includes personal income tax, corporate income tax, sale 
taxes in general, taxes on fuel, tobacco products and alcohol, 
fiscal levies on natural resources, property tax and many more 
not so far-reaching taxes.
<P>
	Each year, the fiscal capacity of the provinces is compared on 
the basis of their individual estimated revenues if the same tax 
base and tax rate were applied in each case. This requires a 
standardized tax system known as representative tax system in 
which provincial governments' revenues are divided up based 
on 33 different revenue sources, each having a base 
representative of those actually used by the provinces. The size 
of the tax base is then calculated for each province and, using the 
average provincial tax rate from each source, the revenues of 
each province is calculated for each source separately and 
globally.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Very simple.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Very, very simple indeed.
<P>
	The standard of equalization is the per capita revenues 
resulting from the application of the representative tax system 
in five provinces, namely Ontario, British Columbia, 
Saskatchewan, Quebec and Manitoba. In 1993-94, the standard 
was $4,731. Together with equalization come floor or minimum 
payment level provisions protecting each recipient against a 
sudden annual drop in equalization payments.
<P>
	Bill C-3 would renew the equalization program for another 
five years, from April 1, 1994 to March 31, 1999. The maximum 
payment level would be maintained at the 1992-93 level. Note 
that the Department of Finance plans to maintain this ceiling for 
the five years covered by the bill. This will limit the growth of 
the payments made to the provinces.
<P>
	The Department of Finance also planning statutory changes to 
the tax bases used in the equalization formula. The complexity 
of the process hints at its inefficiency.
<P>
	Bill C-3, An Act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements and Federal Post-Secondary Education and 
Health Contributions Act, can be considered from various 
angles.
<P>
	First, one could wonder about the actual impact of the goals of 
this piece of legislation. Let us not forget that equalization was 
established to compensate a major shortcoming in the Canadian 
federal system, in which the federal government has the power 
to spend tax revenues without authority over provincial areas of 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	Equalization was instituted in the federal system based on the 
proceedings of the Rowell-Sirois commission. Since then, 
equalization has prevented Canada from breaking up, but it has 
created negative effects of its own which, among other things, 
have contributed to the loss of faith of the people in the tax 
system governing them.
<P>
	Not being able to establish a direct link between the 
government levying taxes and the one providing services makes 
it difficult for the Quebec and Canadian taxpayers to assess fully 
how each level of government is carrying out its 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The main negative effect however has certainly been the 
introduction of a ceiling on the amount that can be paid to a 
so-called have not province. This ceiling thwarts the initial goal 
of equalization by widening the gap. Quebec will have to assume 
60 per cent of the cut imposed on recipient provinces, solely 
because of this ceiling.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Let us recall the basic objectives set by Quebec's finance 
minister as the basis for provincial transfer reform, in order to 
adjust to the financial and budget realities of the 1990s.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1128"> 1128 </A></B>
<P>
	These basic objectives are: to better balance government 
responsibilities against tax revenue; to improve the 
redistribution of wealth in Canada; and to enhance Canadian 
public sector efficiency.
<P>
	Mr. Bourbeau, Quebec's finance minister, is known as a 
passionate federalist. But he went on to say: ``I nevertheless find 
it difficult to accept that the federal government has decided to 
maintain the ceiling provision of the equalization program''. 
The finance minister of Quebec and his critic in the National 
Assembly agree on this. Poorer provinces will, paradoxically, 
help to trim the federal deficit.
<P>
	I think this provides compelling evidence that the federal 
system does not work. Only an extensive reform of the overall 
transfer program structure can correct the present situation.
<P>
	This reform should be based on the following elements: no 
cuts in real terms and per capita to provincial transfer payments; 
no national standards incompatible with Quebec's specific 
situation; non-interference by the federal government in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction, which is a well-known cause of 
inefficiency. This reform must be aimed at a better 
redistribution of revenue among the provinces, particularly in 
terms of equalization payments. The equalization ceiling must 
be removed.
<P>
	This bill clearly shows that Canada's Liberal government paid 
no attention whatsoever to the message delivered by the people 
of Quebec, who elected 54 members of the Bloc Quebecois. 
Quebecers no longer want to be dependent on a system that 
encourages them to stay poor. The current system is an incentive 
to inefficiency.
<P>
	In spite of all this, the federal government has decided to deal 
with equalization as if it were business as usual. If I were a 
member of the majority defending Canadian federalism, I would 
oppose maintaining the ceiling provision of the equalization 
program for the sake of equity within the Canadian federation. 
Unfortunately I did not hear many members opposite say the 
same thing.
<P>
	But, as a member of Quebec's national community that has 
pursued self-sufficiency for 50 years, I know that maturity 
entails specific responsibilities and powers that will allow 
people to determine their government's effectiveness. 
Nevertheless, the removal of the ceiling is a cure the current 
system cannot do without.
<P>
	To determine if the equalization system meets its objectives, 
we should check if it has corrected economic, social and cultural 
inequalities among the various parts of Canada since its 
implementation. Unfortunately, that is not the case. If you 
compare unemployment rates, the exodus of young people from 
various regions of Quebec in the last 20 to 30 years, the system 
is a failure as all indicators clearly show.
<P>
	Furthermore, the imposition of a ceiling does not meet the 
objectives of the equalization program. This program makes it 
difficult for taxpayers to assess its effectiveness. That is one of 
the main reasons why voters distrust politicians like us as well 
as the process itself because Canadians cannot tell if the money 
they invest in taxes comes back to them in the form of adequate 
services. The people we pay our taxes to are not necessarily 
those who deliver services and I think this is an important 
shortcoming that should be addressed.
<P>
	Taxes are collected by the federal government. The federal 
government then transfers the money to the provinces who, in 
turn, distribute it among their various programs, while the poor 
taxpayer must determine the effectiveness of this and that and 
find out what is going on.
<P>
	All this to say that, by tabling Bill C-3, the government has 
demonstrated that it has set aside the real changes expected by 
Canadians. While waiting for a comprehensive reform package 
we are asking it to at least remove the ceiling.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I listened carefully to what was said by the hon. 
member, and I have a pretty straightforward question.
<P>
	I also listened to what was said by the hon. member's 
colleagues, who had nothing constructive to say about the 
equalization program. They said it made Quebec poorer, that it 
was no help at all, and that it was clumsy and cumbersome and 
harmful. But could they not find anything positive to say about 
it? Nothing at all? Nothing.
<P>
	Thank you, I don't think I need an answer after all.
<P>
	The answer is clear. Now it will be up to Canadians and 
Quebecers to decide whether my question and the answer I got is 
right: the whole thing is no good.
<P>
	Now that really sounds responsible. That sounds like a team 
that is going to make something of this province. Well, I am not 
impressed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to say to the hon. 
member-if he has children he will understand-that we have a 
situation where a group of people or a region is a like a child that 
grows up. When Quebec entered Confederation, it was looking 
for some form of security, and it helped to found the Canadian 
Confederation.
<P>
	As the years went by, it realized it had no control over the way 
the house in which it lived was run and that, once past 
adolescence, it was not treated as an adult. But at some point, 
you have to go from adolescence to adulthood.
<P>
	Equalization gave Quebec a chance to survive at least for a 
couple years? We never said it did not. What we are saying is 
that the system undermines Quebec's desire to  be autonomous. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1129"> 1129 </A></B>
<P>
The equalization system treats us like children who have to be 
told what to do.
<P>
	Quebec will no longer stand for being treated like this by 
societies other than its own.
<P>
	We have taken charge of our economic development, 
especially since the sixties when we created instruments like the 
Caisse de dépôt et de placement, which we had to wrench from 
the federal government. Otherwise we would have no control 
over this area today. We nationalized electricity at the expense 
of outside authorities as well. Little by little, we reached the 
conclusion that we had to get out of this system.
<P>
	I think that Quebecers, especially since 1968, have tried a lot 
of things: we tried a federal Liberal government, with 74 Liberal 
members, and we did not get what we wanted. We tried ``le beau 
risque'' with the Tories, and we did not get what we wanted. 
Now the people of Quebec have decided to clarify the situation 
with Canada, and that is our role here, as representatives of the 
Bloc Quebecois, elected by 50 per cent of the population of 
Quebec.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to participate in the debate on Bill C-3 at the second reading 
stage where we are called upon to discuss the principle of 
legislation. There will be ample opportunity in committee to 
examine some of the critical questions that members have 
raised, but here we are talking about the principle of Bill C-3, 
which refers to equalization as a concept.
<P>
	I listened with interest while some people suggested they did 
not like the idea of equalization. To me this is somehow 
speaking against motherhood. It is fundamental. It is enshrined 
in our Constitution. It has been a Canadian way of life since 
1867, formalized in 1957, where we formed the Canadian 
family.
<P>
	We acknowledge that from time to time there are parts of 
Canada where economically things are thriving more than in 
other areas, but there has always been this generosity of spirit, 
this willingness to assist and co-operate. If province <I>x</I> seems to 
be doing better for the moment it will share some of its wealth 
and prosperity with some other parts of Canada that perhaps are 
not experiencing that same prosperity or wealth. This seems to 
me to be what Canada is all about.
<P>
<B>(1735 ) </B>
<P>
	Essentially Bill C-3 extends the principle of equalization for 
another five years. We will be seeing the $8.5 billion we will be 
spending in equalization payments this year go from the have to 
the have not provinces. It will expand over the years at about 5 
per cent annually to reflect the realities of Canada. We feel that 
in principle this is something we endorse. When I say we I am 
referring to my colleagues as New Democrats. That is what we 
are talking about today, the principle of this legislation.
<P>
	That does not mean we do not have some questions and some 
concerns that we want to raise, but I want to put it on the record 
because I know my constituents would like to know who is 
getting what. When the three have provinces of British 
Columbia, Alberta and Ontario decide to share their wealth with 
the rest of Canada it breaks down as follows: the Northwest 
Territories will receive about $910 million; Prince Edward 
Island will receive $164 million; Nova Scotia will receive $880 
million; New Brunswick will receive $995 million; Manitoba 
will receive $854 million; Saskatchewan will receive $522 
million, which I am sure my hon. colleague here will be pleased 
to hear; and Quebec will receive $3.8 billion. It seems to me this 
is an equitable effort in distribution.
<P>
	I listened with interest to some of my friends from the Bloc 
who feel, for a variety of reasons, that this is not appropriate. I 
look forward, particularly in committee, to hear the ways and 
means they will select to make this, in their mind, even more 
equitable.
<P>
	As a British Columbian, we are pleased to participate in this 
sharing program. We are pleased to extend a hand, to share the 
wealth that is generated in British Columbia with other parts of 
the country. I know that my colleagues will be pleased if I say a 
few things about what is going on in British Columbia.
<P>
	Recently the province of Alberta went through some very 
painful exercises provincially to deal with some of the economic 
realities that confront that part of Canada. We have seen other 
provincial governments take very serious steps at addressing 
their fiscal realities, one might say in some part of the country 
brutal steps when it comes to dealing with various social 
programs.
<P>
	We have not had to do that in British Columbia. Not only are 
all of our social programs intact but expanding. Education and 
health care will see a 3 per cent increase this year. Since 
November 1991 we have seen an increase of 91,000 new jobs. 
We have seen economic growth this past year of over 3 per cent. 
Exports were up by more than 16 per cent last year. Housing 
starts are up more than 10 per cent. Retail sales were up by 
almost 9 per cent in 1993. This, however, is an important one, 
the level of business confidence. This is a good barometer, a 
good litmus test to see how the world is feeling about a 
particular area of the country. Capital investment intentions 
were up 6 per cent for 1992-93, four times the national average. 
In other words, the business community has confidence in the 
economy of British Columbia and are prepared to invest their 
money.
<P>
	I have a booklet here that just goes on and on, pages and pages 
of all the positive initiatives being taken by the provincial 
government. I want to simply refer to one interesting graph. 
There is a lot of talk about the global economy and how we must 
be part of it and how the future is our ability to participate 
globally. It points out that for Canada as a whole about 80 per 
cent of exports go to a single country, the United States of 
America. This  has been a reality from the very beginning and 
something that we simply acknowledge as a fact of life. Good-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1130"> 1130 </A></B>
<P>
ness, why would not the majority of our trade be with such a 
large neighbour to the south with such easy access?
<P>
	This is why some of us have had difficulty understanding why 
the past government and now this government is so anxious to 
increase that unless the ideal would be to have 90 per cent of the 
trade with the United States. When entering into the FTA and 
NAFTA the explanation was that this would provide even more 
trade, increased exports and so on to the United States.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	We have to ask ourselves where in the world would we find a 
country that says that if we put 80 or 90 per cent of our eggs in 
one export basket it is a wise policy. Perhaps there are some. I 
am not aware of any. Perhaps some of my colleagues would be 
able to share their views on that with me. From British 
Columbia's perspective, 49 per cent of exports from that 
province go to the United States. One of the major areas is 
softwood lumber.
<P>
	What is the major area of harassment in terms of the FTA and 
NAFTA? It is softwood lumber. Even in the one major export 
B.C. has to the U.S., with it being 49 per cent of our trade, we 
have had nothing but trouble since day one. The FTA and 
NAFTA have done nothing to relieve that continual harassment 
and hassling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> What a burden for you, Nelson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My hon. friend wishes to get into the debate a little 
later as well I hear.
<P>
	What I am saying is that we are happy in British Columbia. 
There are all sorts of reasons for the prosperity and that people 
from all across Canada are moving to British Columbia to take 
up residence.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Good government there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Part of it is because of the good government.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Part of the reason is the good government. We 
constantly hear that international investors and so on are very 
concerned about the government of the day, particularly about 
its fiscal responsibility and so on. We can ask the question 
rhetorically. Which provincial government has been best able to 
control the deficits of their province?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Ontario.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Saskatchewan and B.C.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Alberta.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> The answer is British Columbia. There is no 
question. My friend says ``Alberta''. I have watched Mr. Klein 
at work and how he is approaching this along with how 
wonderful he is doing.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Slash and burn. Tell us about Bobby Rae.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My cheek is bulging. I said that with my tongue in 
my cheek. What Mr. Klein is doing is a typical Conservative or 
perhaps Reform approach to the world. We will see how that 
works out in the next few months.
<P>
	We tried a different approach in British Columbia. We tried 
what I would call the real New Democrat approach of can we 
bring that deficit under control without emasculating the social 
programs. Yes, we have. As a matter of fact I do not think there 
is an economist in Canada who can say that is not taking place. 
Anybody who understands the financial markets would say it is 
not taking place.
<P>
	To be fair, it is not only because of Mike Harcourt and the New 
Democrats. There are other reasons but I just wanted to make the 
point because hardly anybody ever makes it these days so I felt 
some obligation to raise it in the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Get on the subject, Nelson.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> We have to see Bill C-3 in a number of contexts. 
What other programs has the federal government involved itself 
in of a similar nature?
<P>
	My colleague earlier referred to the EPF, the established 
programs financing, where for health care and post-secondary 
education the federal government contributes about $11 billion. 
The Canadian assistance plan or CAP as it is referred to has $7 
billion where the federal government shares in the development 
of a variety of social programs.
<P>
	The whole area of tax points has to be included as well as a 
whole host of shared cost programs. Almost $12 billion last year 
was involved with a sharing program between the federal and 
provincial governments. In our province, the program that 
comes to mind is the forestry agreement, FRDA. It is a very 
helpful investment program where both provincial and federal 
governments work in co-operation with the private sector in 
British Columbia and invest in the future of the forest resource 
and ensure sustained development in the years ahead.
<P>
	The federal government in its wisdom decided it would not do 
that any more. It would pull out of this program. Recognizing 
that forestry is our number one export in Canada, the federal 
government abandoned the ministry of forests and is moving out 
of its contributions to the FRDA program. It is a very regressive 
step.
<P>
	One has to raise this issue. Recently when the government 
introduced the infrastructure program, it said that every 
province would have a certain allocation. The allocation in 
British 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1131"> 1131 </A></B>
<P>
Columbia was $220 million. This was done on a population 
basis essentially plus or minus 5 per cent depending on the state 
of unemployment in a province. In other words here was an  
effort at some equalization. Often this takes place in federal 
programs.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	The question I would raise is that if we have a whole program 
for equalization in which we try to create a relatively level 
playing field in terms of the ability of provincial governments to 
provide services and having relatively similar revenue systems 
in place as well, is it necessary when we take that step on such a 
massive scale as we are doing with this legislation to also have a 
whole set of other equalization programs in place? Is not one 
good one enough?
<P>
	We have to look at this within that context and say we are 
dealing with equalization with Bill C-3, but what about all the 
other areas in which equalization is also attempted? To see the 
value of this legislation, whether it should continue, whether it 
should be expanded, whether it should be reduced or maintained 
as is, I think we have to see it in that context and we do not have 
enough information here. Perhaps in committee we could ask for 
that and then have a more serious discussion there.
<P>
	I guess this is my complaint section during my presentation. I 
hear other provinces complaining that they do not get enough, 
that they have this size of population and so on. Over the years I 
have never been able to identify a single federal program in 
which the province of British Columbia gets its fair share. There 
might be one some place. I have yet to find a single one that is 
based on our population within Canada.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Good weather.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> My friend says ``good weather''. Yes, perhaps we 
get good weather and we are happy for that. However, I am 
thinking of things more to do with the federal government at this 
point. I know it lays claim to all sorts of things but the weather of 
Canada would not be one.
<P>
	Is there a single federal program in which the government 
participates with the Government of British Columbia in which 
the people of British Columbia get their fair share? I could 
present a long list with the figures of where we do not. I do not 
believe that is necessary. I simply want to make the point.
<P>
	Even within that climate, even recognizing that I do not think 
there is a single federal program in which British Columbia 
receives its fair share, at least based on population, we still do 
not begrudge the fact that we are going to be participating in this 
equalization program.
<P>
	In all my years as a member of Parliament and in all the 
discussions I have had with my constituents and others, I have 
never heard anybody complain about the willingness to share. I 
hear a lot about getting the short end of the stick, or getting 
skewered or all sorts of other fancy names we could put to that in 
terms of our fair share regarding the federal government. 
However I will  let that stand for the moment. There will be 
other opportunities to raise this.
<P>
	I simply want to say in closing that I appreciate having the 
chance to participate in this debate. However I do not want to get 
into the Reform Party schtick of saying: ``Mary Bloggs from this 
town asked me to raise this question''. I have been asked to at 
least raise the question on behalf of the city of Vancouver in 
terms of what it perceives to be an unfairness. It certainly is not 
unique to the city of Vancouver or unique to any particular city. 
It is regarding immigration policy.
<P>
	The federal government establishes its immigration policy. 
The minister of immigration indicated the other day a new set of 
quotas or limits on the numbers, acknowledging that a major 
share of those immigrants end up in the greater Vancouver area. 
Then it is left to the school boards and the taxpayers of 
Vancouver to the pick up the necessary language training and 
and so on, at least to a certain extent.
<P>
	The government is asking for some consideration. With the 
reality of immigration in certain selected parts of Canada, 
should there not be more attention given by the federal 
government to acknowledge that and to assist and co-operate in 
terms of providing the appropriate services for new Canadians?
<P>
	To be fair, I acknowledge that there are programs that work 
toward that end but when it comes to English language training 
or teaching English as a second language, particularly in our 
school system, the costs are becoming over burdening.
<P>
	I simply want to conclude by saying that I have been pleased 
to participate in this debate. I look forward, particularly at 
committee, to see a more thorough examination of the some the 
points raised by my hon. friends and I look forward to third 
reading debate some time the future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
certainly enjoyed the presentation by the hon. member for 
Kamloops. I noticed that he touched upon a few Reform themes 
like the issue of double equalization that occurs in some federal 
programs. He touched upon issues like western alienation, the 
effect of these programs upon his province and the effect on the 
inter-relationship of this with the equalization program. I 
acknowledge these. I do not want to say that he is a good 
Reformer but I certainly acknowledge these as rays of wisdom 
breaking through like the sun on the British Columbia flats.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	Having said that, I would like to ask him about one particular 
comment that he made on the relationship between fiscal policy 
and the present economic growth situation. He was anxious to 
credit the current government in British Columbia with this, but 
it is fair to say that we have had a period in Canada over the past 
generation in which governments, federally and provincially, 
have grossly mismanaged their finances. One of the areas in 
which relatively good fiscal  performance occurred was in the 
province of British Columbia. Corresponding to that we have 
seen rather healthy economic growth in British Columbia at a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1132"> 1132 </A></B>
<P>
time when other provinces are struggling with their deficits and 
debts at much more significant levels.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member would acknowledge that there is 
this long-term relationship between deficit, debt and low 
economic performance and whether he would give credit to 
British Columbia governments over the years for having 
avoided to a fair degree that kind of trap.
<P>
	Specifically in the case of this bill, would he recommend that 
perhaps in re-examining equalization in the future we look at 
whether the fiscal performance of these governments should be 
a factor in the kinds of equalization transfers that go to them?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Madam Speaker, I appreciate the question from my 
hon. friend.
<P>
	I want to clarify one point that he made, or perhaps add 
clarification. I do not think he was saying that the Social Credit 
government actually managed the state of the province well. 
That is not my view.
<P>
	We will all recall that when the New Democrat government 
took over office in British Columbia it brought in one of the 
more internationally recognized accounting firms to evaluate 
the books and it found the whole place a complete financial 
disaster. We will start from that and then go on, much the same 
as this government is finding the Conservative situation 
regarding the whole country.
<P>
	I will acknowledge the point that we have seen a general 
understanding that it is important to get the debt and the deficit 
under control in British Columbia for some time.
<P>
	There is probably no province in which that has been 
demonstrated more clearly than the province of Saskatchewan, 
if my memory serves me. There seems to have been a pattern. 
This is an interesting pattern, although I do not want to take up a 
lot of the time of the House by talking about it. It just seems 
natural that people change governments. They elect another 
government, either a Liberal or a Tory government and it turns 
the whole place into a financial disaster. Then it gets tossed out 
and in comes the CCF or the NDP again. It gets everything in 
order over a period of time. This just plays itself out.
<P>
	That is a reality and just the way things go in that province.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> You would not make a very good historian.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is the history of Saskatchewan and 
B.C.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> What about Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Part of getting the fiscal house in management in 
the province of Saskatchewan and in the province of British 
Columbia has been the recognition that we have to get the debt 
and deficit under control as well. No question about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Ask Bob Rae.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Let us ask Clyde Wells. I am just using this as a 
good case study. We want to look around the world and ask 
where governments seem to work. They seemed to work under 
CCF and NDP governments in Saskatchewan and under the NDP 
government in British Columbia.
<P>
	<B>An. hon. member:</B> What about Yukon?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> ``What about Yukon'', somebody asks. Yukon is the 
same.
<P>
	I am not saying that New Democratic governments always 
work super well everywhere, just like I do not think anybody 
here would say the Tories or Liberals-Reform has a short 
record so far-essentially work everywhere. I am saying that we 
have to look around for models of excellence in which people 
actually have done the job well. I am saying that British 
Columbia is doing it well, just like the New Democratic and 
CCF governments in Saskatchewan have done well over the 
years.
<P>
	I want to acknowledge the point made by my hon. friend. To 
do this properly one must manage debt and deficit.
<P>
	How do you do that? Ralph Klein is trying one approach. It 
does not seem to be working. The Tories before him I guess tried 
that. He is trying some more cut, cut, hack, hack, seeing if that 
works. So far it has not worked.
<P>
	I was here for the nine years that the Progressive 
Conservatives were in office and they said they tried that 
approach. The situation has never been worse in this country. We 
have over a half trillion dollar debt. Obviously the people of 
Canada want to try something totally different.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	The province of British Columbia is doing it a bit differently. 
It has cut back on all sorts of unnecessary government spending. 
It also acknowledges that there is something called government 
investment. It is investing in a variety of areas such as the 
development of high tech firms, training highly skilled 
technicians, putting money into scientific research and 
development through to production. In other words, it is 
recognizing that there is government money to put into 
investment and government money to put into simply spending 
and that has to be cut. It has done that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1133"> 1133 </A></B>
<P>
	As a result I am pleased to say that probably within another 
two years there will be a balanced budget in that province, the 
only province in Canada. I say that the proof of the pudding 
is in the eating. I am not saying that everything that it has ever 
done has been perfect. We would not say that about any 
government. However, when it comes to managing the economy 
it seems to be working better than any place else in Canada.
<P>
	I say to my hon. friend that I think his question was good. It 
was not really a question, I guess. It was simply would I agree. 
Largely I would agree.
<P>
	To tie equalization in in terms of the fiscal management of 
provincial governments, I think that was the question, is worth 
some merit. Perhaps it is the kind of thing I would like to see 
discussed more in committee to see what the implications of that 
would be, particularly for some of the very poor parts of Canada. 
I do not want to name those provinces, but I think there would be 
some provinces that would have a very difficult time without 
substantial equalization in a whole variety of programs. It 
probably is sufficient for my hon. friend to say that they are 
doing a good job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Madam Speaker, 
since the beginning of this debate on Bill C-3, several experts 
have tried to prove with figures that equalization was not 
necessarily fair, and I am sure it is not.
<P>
	Coming from a remote area, from one of the poorest ridings, I 
see farmers forced to sell their land, I see our trees sold without 
any processing, in short I see serious problems. I am not 
prepared to say that equity from sea to sea applies to my riding.
<P>
	However I wish to focus on education. Therefore I will deal 
more specifically with transfers to education. In a country like 
Canada and in a future nation like Quebec, it is essential that we 
devote every effort to manpower training. I spent my life in 
education and I know that without proper training it is 
unrealistic today to expect a decent standard of living.
<P>
	Education and training are the keys to economic, social and 
cultural development. They are also the keys to our success, 
nationally and internationally. Our labour force must be 
upgraded on a continuing basis if we want to meet the challenges 
of today and especially those of the future.
<P>
	The federal government started to grant money directly to 
universities in 1951, although education was officially a 
provincial matter. At that time, and justifiably, Quebec strongly 
opposed that move.
<P>
	In 1961 the federal government transferred to Quebec 1 per 
cent of corporate income tax in order to allow the province to 
give its educational institutions equivalent grants.
<P>
	The cost sharing arrangements for post-secondary education 
were revised in 1967. The federal government agreed then to 
transfer to the provinces 50 per cent of the operating costs of 
post-secondary education institutions. These agreements then 
took the form of tax point transfers and cash payments to all the 
provinces. In 1977, these agreements were merged into one 
program called Established Programs Financing.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	Previously advanced education was accessible only to a 
privileged few. Education was reserved for a minority. At that 
time, the only university for all of the Gaspé Peninsula, the 
North Shore and the Lower St. Lawrence was Laval in Quebec 
city. The ordinary people of our regions, whom we called the 
poor, did not have access to that institution. It meant that only 
some people, part of the elite, could go to college and the others 
had to stay home because they could not afford it. What did they 
do? They became welfare or unemployment insurance 
recipients.
<P>
	Be that as it may, after World War II, there was a mass 
communication explosion; our planet was about to become a 
global village. It was no longer possible to deny the people their 
right to a better education and better training. All young people 
wanted to study and our system quickly overflowed, to such an 
extent that in 1967 we had to create the CEGEPs, general and 
vocational colleges.
<P>
	At that time, Quebec's Department of Education said it could 
not meet the demand. That year, only ten CEGEPs were created, 
but others followed. Progress was not to stop there. We had to 
build or expand universities to meet the demand and 
governments invested considerable amounts in that area. 
Another major factor at that time was the fact that people wanted 
to get good training in vocational sectors.
<P>
	What triggered the whole process was the coming home of 
soldiers after World War II. We had to find jobs for them. We had 
to put them back in the labour market. But before anything else, 
if they were to have a real opportunity to succeed, they had to be 
trained. We created a country-wide network of technical 
schools which were merged with the CEGEPs during the 1960s 
and 1970s. Only a few schools still remain independent.
<P>
	Furthermore, the adults who were already working wanted 
advancement so they also wanted access to higher learning. The 
demand for education increased unbelievably. All this led to the 
development of a sound education system across the country, 
thus raising the general level of education. In some specific 
areas, it increased very rapidly.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1134"> 1134 </A></B>
<P>
	Another very important aspect of this revolution that swept 
North America, is the fact that women were admitted in 
colleges. Before that, only men had access to higher education. 
Thanks to the efforts made by Quebec in the area of education, 
there are now more women than men enroled in higher 
education establishments. And so it should be.
<P>
	In spite of its many successes, our education system still 
needs to be improved, and for that, the help of the federal 
government is essential, especially as regards post-secondary 
education. In my riding, we only have one CEGEP and no 
university. The slightest tuition fee increase closes the door to 
post-secondary education for some of our young people, 
depriving them of the necessary training to face the challenges 
of the next century.
<P>
	Each dollar we do not invest brings our young people, and our 
adults too, closer to having to depend on unemployment 
insurance and welfare. Every year, in my riding, the rates go up. 
Is it what this government wants? Is it what we want, 
unemployment and people on welfare? It is not possible to go 
back in 1994. By investing less in post-secondary education, do 
we think that we can continue to develop this country and get out 
of the economic problems it is going through?
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	Certainly our education system is not perfect, but it is highly 
defensible, especially in Quebec. Like any system, it must 
continue to be improved. We cannot improve it by cutting its 
funding.
<P>
	We have let parents and teachers have their say in our 
education system. Now it is up to us in the government to follow 
through on the right to speak which we have given them. Parents 
are speaking up and so are students aged 16 to 20. They are 
afraid of unemployment. Today, I speak on their behalf.
<P>
	Can we again go back on this point?
<P>
	We must bring the debate back to the real issue. Do we want a 
better future for our fellow citizens? Do we want to give our 
desperate young people a real chance? Do we want Canada and 
Quebec to continue to enjoy a good standing among developed 
nations? If that is what the government wants, it cannot cut 
transfers to the provinces, especially for post-secondary 
education. Our future depends on it. Furthermore, 
post-secondary education is in provincial jurisdiction. In 
Quebec, we need all the available resources.
<P>
	I want to speak out here against the principle of a ceiling on 
equalization. For Quebec, it means a loss of hundreds of 
millions of dollars over the next five years.
<P>
	I am speaking against Bill C-3 because it extends the ceiling 
on equalization payments. On the contrary, we need a complete 
reform of all transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	The cuts made by the federal government in established 
programs financing reduced the federal share of funding of 
health and post-secondary education programs in Quebec from 
45 per cent in 1984 to 32 per cent in 1993. Government spending 
on research and development is much lower in Quebec, 
whatever the criterion used.
<P>
	It is unacceptable to let this government darken our future by 
depriving us of money that we send in taxes which should be 
used to educate our youth and adults. It is too important for the 
survival of Quebec and the riding of Matapédia. As long as we 
pay taxes, we must get this return. It is too important for the 
young people and adults in my riding. Madam Speaker, you can 
be assured that I will demand it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
listened closely to the speech by the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane. If I understood correctly, he was speaking 
not only about the treatment of Quebec in Canada, but also about 
the way his region is treated by the province of Quebec. We find 
that to be a very interesting point.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	Does he believe that in the case of federal programs such as 
the equalization provisions in this bill, if the federal government 
were to change the formula, the Quebec provincial government 
would be encouraged to spend some of the equalization funds it 
receives in the poorer regions of the provinces. I think that is the 
aim of programs such as this. Does the hon. member believe it is 
important that the provincial government spend equalization 
funds in his region, and not only in the large urban centres such 
as Montreal or Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel:</B> Madam Speaker, I want to thank my hon. 
colleague who appears to be highly sensitive to the plight of the 
regions. It is true that very often when we think of Canada, we 
think of large cities. Large urban centres are often represented 
by several members, and sometimes by several ministers. That 
is why I say that federalism has proven to be a failure for regions 
such as mine, and most likely for regions such as his.
<P>
	Basically, federalism has proven to be an even greater failure 
in the regions. It has failed throughout Quebec, but especially in 
the regions. True, equalization and transfer payments are 
supposed to help the poorer regions. However, I have only one 
voice and compared to that of Toronto, Vancouver or Montreal, 
the voice of regional members is not heard because they 
represent a much smaller number of people.
<P>
	When I decided to run in my riding, it was for a very special 
reason, namely to heighten the awareness of city dwellers of the 
poverty in our regions. We have a great deal of talent. We have 
tremendous human capital, but as we all know, when people 
leave to attend large universities, they do not return. On this 
point, I agree completely with my hon. colleague. We need to 
focus more on the regions and give them as much as possible.  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1135"> 1135 </A></B>
<P>
Because, when towns cease to exists, cities decline and 
eventually disappear.
<P>
	I want to thank my hon. colleague and let him know that I am 
very sensitive to his concerns. I agree that more has to be done 
for our regions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague from 
Matapédia-Matane for an excellent speech, and especially for 
talking about Quebec and Canada's rural communities.
<P>
	I had the privilege and the opportunity to be associated with a 
great event held in February, 1990, in Quebec, which was called 
the États généraux du monde rural. What came out of this 
general assembly for rural communities, which lasted for over 
three days, but took more than a year to prepare, is that we do not 
do enough for rural areas in Quebec and in Canada. We always 
tend to consider government programs, taxation and even the 
Constitution in terms of the needs of the cities rather than the 
needs of rural areas.
<P>
	I would like to congratulate him for that, and to build on his 
arguments about federalism versus rural communities. 
Nowadays, we hear about a concept called subsidiarity, which 
goes a bit like this: if you expect good results from government 
policies, you would not be needing extremely centralized 
measures undertaken by a cumbersome bureaucracy, or a 
paralysed government, but rather massive decentralization. 
During the debate on Quebec sovereignty, and where Quebec 
attains its sovereignty, we might also have to talk about 
subsidiarity, to draw the people, especially the rural population, 
closer to power.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General):</B> Madam Speaker, I would also like to make a few 
comments on the speech made by the hon. member representing 
Matapédia-Matane, which is the riding next to mine.
<P>
	The hon. member more or less wanted to make a case when he 
squarely put the blame on federalism for the hardships and 
problems encountered in remote regions.
<P>
	However, I would ask him to take a look at policies 
implemented by recent provincial governments in Quebec, not 
only the Liberal one in office since 1985, but especially the Parti 
Québécois before that. I do not think that the federal government 
is necessarily the one to blame; the province is also responsible 
for the situation in rural areas.
<P>
	In any case, more and more young people and business people 
return to the regions to get the local economy going again. I 
believe that to get regional and local economies going again, we 
must invest more in individuals, and not necessarily in states. 
Whether it is the state of Quebec or Canada, I think we should do 
more for small business people.
<P>
	Over the years, especially under the Conservative 
government but also under the Parti Québécois before, not 
enough was done to help small businesses, for example with 
loans. It is mainly because of government agencies, or because 
of the lack of co-operation of financial institutions, that we 
were not able to improve the situation of small businesses and, 
consequently, the quality of life in rural Quebec. But it is wrong 
to say that the federal government is the only one to blame.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Yes, indeed it is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagnon (Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine):</B> It is 
absolutely wrong, because some positive attempts were made by 
the federal government to get regional economies going again, 
for example with the Federal Office of Regional Development. 
Quebec has been talking about the one-stop concept for years, 
but I would like to hear the Bloc Quebecois tell us exactly why 
federalism was so bad for rural economic development.
<P>
	I think that by talking about sovereignty and by making it an 
obsession in the eastern part of Quebec, we jeopardize the future 
of our young people and our remote regions. I do care for my 
region; I am first a Gaspésien, but I object to this claim that 
federalism is to be blamed for our high unemployment rate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Canuel: </B>Madam Speaker, how can federalism not be at 
fault since, over the last few years, our ridings have been 
represented by federalists at the provincial level? Indeed, 
whether at the provincial or federal level, there are only 
federalists. Also, the unemployment rate in our region is at 21 
per cent and is constantly increasing. If that is not a failure, what 
is it?
<P>
	Our young people are all leaving. If provincial or national 
federalists are not to blame, after all the Parti Québécois is not in 
office, then whose fault is it? It is not the Parti Québécois, nor 
the Bloc because we just got here. We will improve things, but 
we need time to do that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina-Lumsden):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is my pleasure to participate in the debate on Bill C-3. My sense 
of the bill is that it has assisted the provinces of Canada in 
stabilizing their budgetary plans over the next five years. I have 
an attraction toward supporting the bill, in particular as it 
applies not to just to all of our country but as it applies to 
Saskatchewan where I come from.
<P>
<B>(1820) </B>
<P>
	What has happened in Saskatchewan over the past 10 or 12 
years is nothing short of a disaster. I will go back a bit to 
describe what Saskatchewan was like between 1971 and 1982. 
At that time Saskatchewan was governed by a New Democratic 
Party government led by Premier Allan Blakeney. The NDP was 
the only government of the day in Canada that had 11 
consecutive balanced budgets. These balanced budgets were not 
done for the sake of balancing the budget, but they were the 
result of good  planning on behalf of the premier, the cabinet and 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1136"> 1136 </A></B>
<P>
government and ensuring that the priorities of the people came 
first.
<P>
	In spite of the balanced budget the province of Saskatchewan 
had the lowest overall tax rate in the country. Saskatchewan had 
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues from the resource 
industries. We had the only children's dental program for 
children 18 years of age and under in the entire world. We had a 
prescription drug plan for all of our citizens.
<P>
	We had a very significant initiative not only in health care but 
in the economic sector as well. People were working. The farm 
economy was well attracted to the government in terms of the 
type of agricultural programs we undertook. We pioneered 
agricultural programs such as land bank and farm start which 
encouraged young people to stay on the farm and get into the 
farming sector.
<P>
	After 11 years we basically came out of the 1970s to 1982 not 
only with 11 balanced budgets, our people working and good 
social programs for the population, but also with a heritage fund 
of about a billion dollars. Our final budget in 1981-82 provided 
a surplus of $139 million on the operations side.
<P>
	In 1982 an event took place in Saskatchewan which to this day 
and for probably a generation or two will be remembered. That 
is the date of the election, April 26, 1982, when Grant Devine 
and the Conservative government came to power. They had won 
the election on the basis that they were a Conservative 
government, that they were fiscally responsible and that they 
were going to do all these great things for the province of 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	They had 10 consecutive deficit budgets in their nine years of 
power. They went from a $139 million surplus on the operations 
side to $8 billion in debt. We went from a $3 billion crown 
corporation capital debt in 1982, which was a self-liquidating 
debt like a mortgage on a house, to after nine years of Grant 
Devine and the Conservative government ruling the province, to 
a crown corporation capital debt of not $3 billion but over $8 
billion coupled with the significant problem of having all of our 
profitable crown corporations privatized. There were no 
revenues to pay off this $8 billion capital debt.
<P>
	In 1991 the people of Saskatchewan had enough. They 
defeated the Conservative government and elected another NDP 
government. We are not just faced with this massive $16 billion 
debt for less than a million population. We are also faced with a 
savage attack by the national government in terms of reduction 
in equalization payments. As a result of Mr. Mulroney and the 
former Conservative government we have lost on average about 
$252 million a year in equalization payments. That was the 
punishment Saskatchewan received even though we had a 
like-minded Conservative government at the provincial level. 
That was the reward. It was more of a punishment than a reward.
<P>
	This shows very clearly that Saskatchewan had the ability to 
run its own finances, to introduce progressive social programs, 
to produce jobs for its people. When it had a plan in place under 
the NDP we progressed from that to where we became basically 
almost a bankrupt province in 1991. Part of that was because of 
the established programs financing and other equalization 
programs that were cut back. The majority of it obviously was 
because of the Grant Devine government.
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	The point I want to make with respect to Bill C-3 this evening 
is that this bill addresses some of the hardship under the former 
government in the sense that it re-establishes some of that lost 
revenue on an annual basis. It does not make up all of it, but 
establishes an upward trend to providing us with more of our fair 
share in more ways than one.
<P>
	The other reason we had big deficits in terms of losing our 
equalization payments in the 1980s was because the 
equalization formula that was negotiated with the former 
governments, two Tory governments provincial-federal 
negotiating in the 1980s, took away the ability of the province to 
raise revenue through resource taxation. The way it punished 
Saskatchewan was that for every dollar we raised in terms of 
additional resource revenue we would have the equalization 
payments reduced dollar for dollar.
<P>
	In the event where prices for potash and oil increased as a 
result of world prices, our price sensitive royalties would gather 
more revenues to the province, but we would lose for every 
dollar we gained on the equalization payments from the federal 
government. It was really a catch 22. We were handcuffed as a 
province in terms of managing our own finances.
<P>
	I am pleased to see in the bill some progress toward taking the 
handcuffs off. It has not resolved all of the things we would like 
to see in Saskatchewan, but what has been resolved is this very 
distressing problem with respect to resource taxation. It has 
provided a change in the equalization formula which will 
address the problem known as a tax back in determining 
equalization entitlements for Saskatchewan and I understand for 
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia as well. Saskatchewan will 
receive some long-term benefits.
<P>
	There will still be a very light handcuff on the Government of 
Saskatchewan to increase its revenues with respect to resources 
and not be affected with respect to equalization, but the good 
news is there is an about face in terms of the total disregard for 
provincial autonomy when it comes to resources and this bill is a 
positive move in that step. That is one of the reasons I support it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1137"> 1137 </A></B>
<P>
	As important I believe is that governments must have a plan. 
It is not good enough to come to this Parliament on a daily basis 
and have an agenda for today. What is important is that we as 
the Government of Canada and the provincial governments 
have a long-term plan-a medium term plan, a daily plan, a 
weekly plan-some idea as to where they are going in the next 
five years.
<P>
	Under the Romanow government since 1991 they have put 
together a five-year plan which will provide a balanced budget 
for the first time since 1982 in the 1995-96 fiscal year. We are 
very proud of that in Saskatchewan. It has been very difficult. It 
has not come without a great deal of sacrifice, an increase in 
taxes and reducing some of the benefits. Our options were very 
limited.
<P>
	Bill C-3 in my view is a good move. I do not think it is going 
far enough for the province of Saskatchewan, but I am satisfied 
that it is a step in the right direction. As a result in principle I do 
support the bill.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAXACT">INCOME TAX ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved 
that Bill C-9, an act to amend the Income Tax Act, be read the 
second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity 
to lead off the debate on the second reading of Bill C-9. This bill 
proposes to implement a number of amendments to the Income 
Tax Act that were announced by the previous government in 
December 1992 and April 1993.
<P>
	The previous government introduced legislation, Bill C-136, 
last June to provide statutory authorization for these measures, 
but the bill died when Parliament was dissolved and election 
writs issued. For these measures to have legal effect new 
legislation must now be passed by this Parliament. The 
measures in Bill C-9 address a number of areas.
<P>
	Allow me to list them: first, the unemployment insurance 
premium relief for additional jobs created by small business in 
1993; second, the extension of the home buyers plan through 
March 1, 1994 which allows individuals to withdraw funds from 
their RRSPs to purchase homes; third, changes in the rules for 
instalment tax payments that will require more high income 
filers to make quarterly payments while allowing other low 
income filers to pay only once a year; fourth, certain tax 
measures to support small business, scientific research and 
development, oil and gas exploration and labour sponsored 
venture capital investments.
<P>
	Let me be clear at the start in explaining why we are going 
ahead with this legislation. We have no obligation to the 
previous government, a government that was resoundingly 
defeated by the Canadian electorate last October. Our mandate 
from the electorate is based on a different vision. It is a vision 
that offers hope to Canadians that we can work together and deal 
with the difficult legacy that we inherit. Our mandate rests on a 
clear commitment to create a different and a better future, a 
prosperous Canada in which everyone has a chance to 
participate in building the country and a chance to share in the 
rewards.
<P>
	That being said, it is essential that the government always 
reflect the sense of fairness and common sense of Canadians. 
This is the test we have applied to the unfinished legislative 
business before us today. Simply put, these tax measures were 
introduced some time ago. Many were announced more than a 
year ago and some have fully run their course and are now 
expired. Many were said to be effective immediately when 
announced by the previous government and many thousands of 
Canadians took it at its word.
<P>
	These individuals have relied on these announcements when 
making important decisions. Many have, for example, used their 
RRSPs to buy and build homes and I am sure everyone in the 
House agrees that buying a home certainly represents a major 
commitment to those involved. Other Canadians have relied on 
these announcements when making significant investments or 
hiring new employees.
<P>
	The commitment these taxpayers have made is for the most 
part irreversible. The actions that have been taken are concrete 
and represent real investments of hard earned savings. We are 
not dealing simply with plans that some people have for future 
actions. Consequently, if we were to walk away from this 
situation many people would be put in a very difficult situation, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1138"> 1138 </A></B>
<P>
an unfair situation. The trust that Canadians have in their  
government, a trust that we must always strive to keep and 
enhance, would be dealt a powerful blow.
<P>
	However, we do not approach this question as prisoners of the 
previous government's actions or inactions, to put it more 
precisely.
<P>
<B>(1835) </B>
<P>
	We have carefully reviewed the measures in this legislation 
and believe we can support them in their own right.
<P>
	One of the measures in the old legislation has been dropped. 
The previous government had proposed paying the GST credit 
only twice a year to low income Canadians. For our part we 
choose to continue paying this credit every quarter to those who 
qualify during the period the GST remains in force, which will 
hopefully not be too long. The government is committed to 
replacing the GST with a fairer and more efficient tax. The 
House of Commons finance committee will be examining 
options over the next few months on the matter.
<P>
	As for the other measures, our primary criticism generally is 
that they represent only a small piecemeal effort by the previous 
government to deal with a large and pressing need in this 
country to strengthen the economy and to create jobs. The 
approach to economic management by the previous government, 
a combination that might be called slash and burn on the one 
hand and ineffective tinkering on the other, needlessly 
prolonged a painful economic downturn and spread intolerable 
levels of distress and suffering over this whole country.
<P>
	For our part we believe we need a long-term process of 
reform to government policies and programs that is, to quote my 
colleague the Minister of Finance, creative, compassionate and 
constructive.
<P>
	I am confident the upcoming budget will set in motion a 
process of re-evaluation and reform that will result in 
meaningful, significant steps to bring this country back onto a 
path of job creation and economic growth shared by all.
<P>
	I ask my colleagues and my hon. friends opposite to consider 
this legislation not as an indication of the approach this 
government takes to economic management. Rather, this is 
simply a question of parliamentary housekeeping and the 
discharge of a trust we in this House owe to all Canadians.
<P>
	With this in mind, let me outline briefly the measures of the 
bill. First of all there are measures that affect individual 
taxpayers. One is an extension of the home buyers plan by one 
year through March 1, 1994. As I mentioned before, to renege on 
this program would cause undue and unfair difficulties to many 
thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	As well the legislation provides that starting next September 
certain higher income Canadians will have to make quarterly 
instalment payments on their taxes. This measure will affect 
those people whose tax payable is $2,000 or more than the total 
tax withheld at source. In Quebec where we collect only the 
federal tax, the figure is $1,200. At the same time some 300,000 
low income filers will be excused from quarterly payments and 
required to pay only once a year.
<P>
	Some member may argue that these measures are yet to take 
effect and thus could be allowed to die without undue hardship 
to taxpayers. I would counter by pointing out that these changes 
represent a small but real improvement in the income tax 
regime.
<P>
	Most Canadians pay their taxes either every time they receive 
a pay cheque or quarterly. Therefore it is only fair to set the same 
requirement for those Canadians who have substantial income 
which is not taxed at source and effectively receive a special 
benefit. At the same time we support the premise that low 
income filers, many of them elderly, should have their tax 
payments simplified.
<P>
	Another area addressed by this legislation is one of the few 
attempts by the previous government to foster job creation. The 
December 1992 economic statement announced a one-year 
program of relief for unemployment insurance premiums for 
increased employment by small business. This program has 
come and gone unnoticed by the 1.5 million unemployed in this 
country. Nevertheless a number of small businesses have taken 
the government of the day at its word and we shall honour that 
bargain as a matter of public trust.
<P>
	The same considerations also apply to the other measures 
targeted at small business. These include first of all the 
temporary small business investment tax credit for the purchase 
of eligible machinery and equipment from December 2, 1992 to 
December 31, 1993.
<P>
<B>(1840 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, the extension of the small business financing 
program to the end of this year, allowing small businesses in 
financial difficulty to refinance up to $500,000 of debt at low 
interest rates.
<P>
	Third, the removal of any limits on holdings of small business 
shares in RRSPs and RRIFs.
<P>
	Fourth, the extension of the 35 per cent investment tax credit 
available to small Canadian controlled, private corporations for 
eligible research and development expenses.
<P>
	In addition, this legislation will give effect to some general 
improvements in the tax credit incentives offered to encourage 
Canadian research and development. As well, it removes the 
annual limits on the investment tax credits. This limit, 
introduced by the previous government in 1987, reduced the 
effectiveness of the ITC incentives for rapidly growing firms, 
one of the engines of job growth in this country.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1139"> 1139 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill also assists resource companies by allowing 100 per 
cent of the first $2 million of oil and gas development 
expenditures to flow through directly to shareholders and be 
deducted by them. As well, it gives these companies more 
flexibility in managing their affairs by removing the mandatory 
reduction of the Canadian exploration expenses.
<P>
	Finally, this bill will put in place new, more flexible rules for 
investments in labour sponsored venture capital corporations.
<P>
	In conclusion, let me reiterate the position I put forward 
earlier. The government has no quarrel with the underlying goal 
of our predecessors in announcing these measures. No party in 
this House or in the previous Parliament is against job creation 
in principle. The issue however is which parties are for job 
creation in practice. That issue was put to the voters and the 
voters provided a clear answer. We do not hold out the measures 
in this bill as any solution to the challenge of job creation, but 
we do recognize the attempt. Of equal importance, we recognize 
the commitments made by small business people, by new home 
buyers and by others who have relied on these proposed 
measures.
<P>
	It is with these thoughts in mind I urge members of the House 
to support the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to have this opportunity to speak to Bill C-9.
<P>
	As our colleague just mentioned, Bill C-9 gives concrete 
expression to measures announced by the previous government 
in the Economic and Fiscal Statement of December 1992 as well 
as in the last budget it tabled before being litterally swept out of 
office in the last federal election.
<P>
	This bill will be considered in the Standing Committee on 
Finance, at which time the Bloc Quebecois plans to examine 
each provision, even though the government considers certain 
provisions as mere formalities. With regard to those measures 
that we see as very positive, such as the extension of the plan 
allowing individuals to withdraw funds from their RRSPs to buy 
a first home and those relating to labour sponsored venture 
capital corporations, an item by item examination of Bill C-9 
will give us an opportunity to make recommendations to the 
government, if applicable, to extend further this kind of 
programs. I think that this is one of the functions of the Standing 
Committee on Finance.
<P>
	Having said that, no great revelation emerged from my review 
of this bill because I was familiar with the actions of the 
previous government. Like my hon. colleague though, I have 
realized that the last budget tabled by the Conservative 
government was full of short-term measures, measures to 
mitigate a catastrophic economic situation they were largely 
responsible for. Think for instance of the recession which took 
unprecedented proportions after the first quarter of 1990, 
making the rate of unemployment in Canada climb from a little 
over 9 per cent to 12 per cent. Think of youth unemployment 
also. Released just recently, the latest statistics on the last 
quarter of 1993 indicate that unemployment is affecting 17.5 per 
cent of young Canadians under the age of 25.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	Take the inactivity rate in Quebec, for example, because we 
know that situation better. This is the unemployment rate plus 
the people who are no longer looking for work because they are 
so discouraged by the economic measures of the previous 
government that they have given up. In five years the inactivity 
rate has gone from about 19 per cent to nearly 25 per cent in 
Quebec.
<P>
	These are the devastating effects of Conservative policy. In 
Bill C-9, in the last budget, we find some piecemeal, partial, 
weak measures to lessen the blow and bandage the wound which 
they themselves created.
<P>
	That said, I would like to give an overview in the next few 
minutes-I will not take too much of your time-but in the next 
few minutes, I would like to give the reasons for this mess, the 
causes of the catastrophic state the economy is in, so that the 
present government will not repeat the same mistakes.
<P>
	The economic situation which we have been in since the first 
quarter of 1990 is the combined result of three main factors. The 
first of these is very bad management of the government's 
finances. The second is the Conservatives' monetary policy and 
the third, the international economic climate which has 
worsened the disastrous economic situation and the sorry state 
of Canada's finances due to the Conservative government.
<P>
	I do not think that we have to review the first of these factors, 
the government's finances. Canada's public finances have 
become a cause for great concern since about 1986, even 
extreme concern.
<P>
	I would remind the government that it was when the Liberals 
were in power before that we started to have problems with the 
government's financial management. I will just give you a few 
figures in the hope that the new Liberal government will not 
repeat the same mistakes that it made when it was in power from 
1970 to 1984. I would remind you that the present Prime 
Minister of Canada was Minister of Finance during that time. I 
would remind you that from 1970 to 1984, the annual federal 
deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product rose from 0.3 
per cent to 8.7 per cent, a record since unmatched. The Liberals 
set the record when they were in office before.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1140"> 1140 </A></B>
<P>
	We are hoping and taking the opportunity of this debate on 
Bill C-9 to warn you against reverting to this mismanagement 
of public funds.
<P>
	The second cause of our disastrous economic situation, the 
second legacy left us by the Conservatives, is the anti-inflation 
policy.
<P>
	When you say that in less than a year and a half the gap 
between Canadian and American short-term interest rates went 
from about 1.5 to over five points at times, it is obvious that, 
sooner or later, it would impact on investments and, in turn, on 
economic growth and job creation.
<P>
	The dogmatic anti-inflation policy followed by the former 
Governor of the Bank of Canada was a major factor in the ailing 
economy that led, in Bill C-9, to a few fragmented stopgap 
measures.
<P>
	We therefore warn this government against making the same 
mistake by adopting a dogmatic anti-inflation policy that goes 
too far to bring inflation under control without trying to 
maintain a balance between long-term price control and 
short-term job creation.
<P>
	We also hope, after thoroughly reviewing Bill C-9 to learn 
from it as you can see, that this government will subject all 
programs, expenditures and tax measures such as those in Bill 
C-9 to extensive scrutiny. Because, after studying this bill and 
consulting senior officials from the finance department, we 
found out, that no cost-benefit analysis has been done, that no 
serious, objective review is done every time new tax measures 
are planned like those the Conservatives left us in June 1993.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	The Auditor General is very clear on that. He said that out of 
16 federal programs accounting for $124.5 billion, only two 
have been seriously evaluated. Therefore, I urge the government 
not to make the same mistake in the next budget. It is important 
that every measure proposed in a budget be fully analyzed, that 
they be subjected to a thorough cost-benefit analysis.
<P>
	Fourth, I hope the government will propose something other 
than palliative measures-similar to those inherited from the 
previous government-like the ones in Bill C-9. I am hoping for 
real programs of job creation, not Mickey Mouse programs. I 
would like to see real measures to create long-term jobs, 
measures which would raise the quality of manpower and 
improve its capacity to face the globalization challenges. I hope 
the government will fulfil the expectations concerning training, 
the expectations of the Quebec Government, and that it will put 
an end to overlappings and inefficiencies in this area.
<P>
	This is another piece of friendly advice to the government 
from the Bloc Quebecois. I hope the government will not repeat 
the mistake of the Conservatives and try to attack social 
programs. That too seemed clear in the red book that is being 
waved at us virtually every day on the other side of the House. 
By the way, I believe it is improper to produce exhibits in the 
House. I would have to check, but I think I read that somewhere.
<P>
	It was clear in that red book-I remind you that Mao also had 
one -that social programs would be protected and that future 
budgets would also allow for the creation of social housing. It 
seems that the Minister of Finance has forgotten those 
commitments.
<P>
	Let us hope that the government will not repeat the mistakes 
of the Conservatives who tried several times-and they were 
taught a costly lesson-to reduce social programs, to reduce 
senior citizens' pensions, and to practically eliminate-as they 
did in their second last budget-social housing.
<P>
	It is hoped-and that was shown to me by Bill C-9-that the 
government, when tabling its next budget, will try to really 
reduce its extravagant spending. There are also real measures 
that can be taken to fill the taxation gaps, and I will give you 
some, because I have the feeling that people here tend to forget 
these things, even from one day to the next.
<P>
	There are major gaps in the Canadian tax system. It has been 
said repeatedly since the morning of October 26 and even 
before, during the election campaign. I will give you two or 
three more examples in order to refresh your memory and that of 
the minister of Finance, who is preparing his next budget which, 
according to rumour, is to be tabled on February 22.
<P>
	Here are some examples of these scandalous situations. 
Taxpayers in Canada who get their income mainly from 
capital-so, they are not workers, but people who are able to 
invest in stocks, bonds and elsewhere-are taxed at an average 
rate of 9.9 per cent. The basic rate for workers, for those who toil 
to earn a living and who cannot afford to speculate, is at 29 per 
cent. Why are there such inequities?
<P>
	Here is a second example. In 1987-because since then the 
Department of Finance has stopped conducting these analyses 
and, all above, publishing them; people in the federal system are 
hiding them because they are ashamed-in the middle of an 
economic growth, there were 90,000 Canadian companies that 
made $27 billion worth of profits without paying any income 
tax.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has often mentionned the scandal of 
family trusts during question period. The Minister of Finance, 
as the Prime Minister and all the members of the Liberal Party, 
decided to laugh at the whole issue of these tax loopholes and to 
discard, with language well known to this House, the family 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1141"> 1141 </A></B>
<P>
trust problem even  though it costs the federal government 
between $350 million and one billion dollars a year in tax 
revenues.
<P>
	Last weekend, I read an article by Yves Séguin, who is 
certainly not uninformed about taxation whether in Quebec or in 
Canada, and he estimated that in Canada, tax loopholes alone-I 
am talking here about grand-scale tax evasion by Canadian 
corporations-represent a loss of revenue of approximately 2.5 
billion dollars.
<P>
	When the government presents its budget, when it evaluates 
all tax measures and when it modifies or reviews the whole 
Canadian taxation system, we hope that the Minister of Finance 
will keep in mind that there are blatant tax inequities in our 
system and, most of all, that he will not touch middle-class 
income, social programs or those people who have been carrying 
an ever-increasing tax burden since 1984, that he will not copy 
the previous government which, need I remind you, was erased 
from the federal map.
<P>
	Contrary to what the Tory government did in its last budget, I 
hope this government will present true tax incentives in order to 
promote economic recovery in Quebec and in Canada and to 
reinforce corporate and individual competitiveness because 
globalization is something everyone speaks about in this House, 
something everyone has been talking about since 1984 under 
Tory management, but it is more than a mere concept.
<P>
	Globalization means we have to face the best in the world, the 
best industries, the best workers, in a world that is getting 
smaller by the minute. My former boss at the Union des 
producteurs agricoles used to say that globalization would 
transform our planet into a global village. Therefore, the United 
States are not our competitors any longer; our competitors are 
now the most efficient workers in the world. They are the Pacific 
Rim countries and the developing countries because in the area 
of mass production, their competitive effectiveness is superior 
to ours.
<P>
	So we hope this government will not repeat the errors by 
applying stop-gap measures instead of real ones which would 
reinforce corporate competitiveness and worker productivity in 
Canada.
<P>
	We hope that this government will change its mind and restore 
the full meaning of the Canadian equalization program, which 
we had the opportunity to debate yesterday and today, with 
respect to Bill C-3, by eliminating the ceiling it imposed on 
payments to the provinces. My message is the same one we 
delivered yesterday and are still sending today: this ceiling 
completely changes the nature of the equalization objectives.
<P>
	For the benefit of my friends in the Reform Party, I will 
digress for a moment. I have the feeling that they cannot read, 
although I hope they can write; but I do know for a fact that they 
cannot read; how else could they refuse to understand the basic 
principles of equalization? Since yesterday, they have been 
saying  things about Quebec and the Canadian equalization 
system that are totally biased, harmful, and even vicious.
<P>
	May I just remind all the members, before I make my point, 
that this system is here for a good reason and that it originates in 
the Rowell-Sirois report, which I urge all the members of the 
Reform Party to read and study; there are close to two dozen 
copies of the report in the Library of Parliament. It provided the 
basis for the Canadian equalization system, together with a nice 
Canadian dream neither my colleagues nor I believe in any 
longer. It said that the redistribution of wealth among all 
Canadian provinces was the cornerstone of federalism.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	The aim of equalization is to make sure that even the poorest 
provinces, the have-not provinces-these are the principles of 
fiscal federalism, I did not invent them, they stem from the 
Rowell-Sirois report and subsequent ones-are in a position to 
have sufficient revenues, including equalization payments from 
the federal government, to deliver approximately the same level 
of quality public services as the other provinces.
<P>
	Equalization payments are calculated according to two 
factors. The first one is the ability of provinces to raise tax 
revenues on the municipal and provincial levels. This taxation 
capacity is then compared to a national average calculated using 
five Canadian provinces. If the taxation capacity of a province is 
inferior to $4,800 per person, if I remember the latest 
calculations, equalization will provide the rest.
<P>
	Since the total amount of equalization payments is calculated 
on a per capita basis, it is obvious that Quebec, with seven 
million people, receives more. Quebec is a have-not province 
with regard to its capacity to raise tax revenues. When you 
multiply the per capita rate by the population of the province, it 
is obvious that Quebec receives more money than Manitoba, 
Saskatchewan and most of the provinces which ``benefit'' from 
equalization. This is not a hand-out. This is the principle of 
federalism in action. And if the members of the Reform Party 
are federalists-unless they have had a change of heart and have 
become sovereigntists in their respective provinces, but I will 
assume they are federalists until further notice-then they are 
out of line when they point a finger at Quebec for receiving more 
than its fair, equitable share, or so they say, a share based on the 
federal system.
<P>
	A second point before getting back to the main subject. I 
would suggest that my colleagues from the Reform Party as well 
as some of my Liberal colleagues ask the Library of 
Parliament-they have economists, tax experts and other 
specialists working there; I can even send a memo on their 
behalf if they do not know how to go about making such a 
request-to dig out for them all the expenditures and types of 
expenditures the federal government has made in each province 
as well as the per capita share. They will realize one thing: 
Quebec may, on  the one 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1142"> 1142 </A></B>
<P>
hand, be receiving 3.6 or 3.7 billion in equalization payments 
but, on the other hand, it has been losing support for the past ten 
years in areas such as research and development, transportation, 
agriculture, federal department investments in Quebec- I 
would appreciate that they wipe that smile off their faces and 
just check the figures. At any rate, we will keep bringing them 
up in this House throughout our mandate, over the course of the 
four years we will be spending here together.
<P>
	A third point on equalization. My colleagues from the Reform 
Party come mainly from the Prairies, from Western Canada. Let 
me remind them -and I know this for a fact-that each and 
every year since 1984-85, the three Prairie Provinces have been 
receiving between $2.5 and $5 billion from the federal 
government mainly in support of the grain sector.
<P>
	Back in the days when I sat on foreign trade and stabilization 
committees of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture as a 
representative of the Union des producteurs agricoles, the UPA 
was saying that Prairie grain growers were hard hit by the global 
economic situation. They have also been hit by several droughts 
since 1984. We understood their situation and never criticized 
the federal government for making ad hoc payments to help 
them out.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	We have never blamed them for the fiscal federalism that 
Quebec is being blamed for through equalization. So I would ask 
them to show a little more respect for Quebec when we are 
talking about it and not to make harmful analyses on 
equalization and what Quebec gets from it. This is all I wanted to 
say on equalization.
<P>
	To go back to my advice to the government, I would suggest to 
the Liberal government, in the light of the disastrous economic 
situation the Conservatives have imposed on us since 1990, not 
to revert to the dogmatic anti-inflation fight advocated by the 
previous government, as it seems determined to do.
<P>
	I was very surprised and shocked to hear, before the holidays, 
that the finance minister was holding a press conference with 
Mr. Thiessen, John Crow's right-hand man and principal 
advisor at the Bank of Canada. I was very disappointed because 
it indicated to me, barring evidence to the contrary, that the 
current finance minister and even the current Prime Minister of 
Canada have long advocated a monetary, inflation-fighting 
policy maintaining a better balance between long-term price 
stability needs and short-term consistent job creation needs. I 
believed in them at one time.
<P>
	I was very disappointed to see that the finance minister, in a 
pre-holiday press conference with the new Governor of the 
Bank of Canada, announced that, like his predecessor, he would 
wage a relentless fight against inflation. We do not have 
anything against fighting inflation per se but we are totally 
opposed to a relentless fight because, since 1990, we have lived 
through the outcome of such a relentless, dogmatic fight against 
inflation.
<P>
	If the Liberal government is telling the truth about long-term 
job creation and economic recovery, and if the Liberals were 
telling the truth when they were in opposition and challenging 
John Crow's policy, this government should not renew this 
obsessive anti-inflation policy. Things are going rather well at 
the moment, in the sense that there has not been a surge in 
interest rates such as that caused by the Conservatives' 
anti-inflation policy in the early 1990s. But-this piece of 
advice is also directed at the hon. members opposite-as soon as 
the economy picks up, and I hope there will be strong economic 
growth in the next few months, there will certainly be upward 
pressure on prices. There is no doubt that if the Bank of Canada 
pursues its policy of controlling inflation at all costs and tries to 
keep it at two per cent, the chances of having a truly sustained 
recovery are reduced.
<P>
	A mere review of Bill C-9 showed Bloc Quebecois members 
the carelessness and the incompetence displayed by the previous 
government. We do hope that you will not make the same 
mistakes. We also hope that this review of Bill C-9 will help you 
find a better solution.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, we would like to see the Finance Committee 
do a clause-by-clause review of Bill C-9. As I said earlier, we 
would like to do an in-depth analysis, as the government did 
according to the hon. member, but in this case it would be a 
non-partisan exercise done by the Finance Committee. If we 
have the opportunity to do so, there are already two measures 
contained in Bill C-9 which we would like to see in the budget to 
be tabled soon. First, the clause on venture capital corporations 
for workers. Second, the extension of the Home Buyers' Plan, 
which enables taxpayers to use their RRSPs to buy a property for 
the first time.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, this concludes my comments. I thank you for 
your kind attention.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am quite happy to be able to speak to Bill C-9 because it has 
some significant issues in it that should be addressed.
<P>
	The bill has some nine amendments in it but they affect 21 
additional sections within the act. This tells us that the 
complexity of the Income Tax Act today makes all of those 
things necessary.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1143"> 1143 </A></B>
<P>
	I would make one note. It is unfortunate that changes to one's 
income tax may be implemented by many things today. Even 
a press release can effect changes to one's income. 
Unfortunately without the proper legislative steps prior to 
implementing changes, the tax system becomes quite volatile 
and can be manipulated very easily.
<P>
	I must start out by confessing to the House that I have mixed 
feelings about rising to address this bill. It enacts measures 
introduced by the previous Conservative government in its 
December 2, 1992 economic statement and its April 26, 1993 
budget. These are obviously not new to Canadians.
<P>
	On the one hand it would seem to be only prudent that we 
support what is generally referred to as a housekeeping bill. 
Much of what this bill enacts has already been policy for the past 
year or more and we are now just getting around to proclaiming 
it law. I would not pretend for a minute that it would be anything 
but irresponsible of us to oppose these measures merely on 
principle. On the other hand, I wish to make it clear that there are 
some principles here to which I am strongly opposed, as is my 
party.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act has become an unwieldy monster 
symbolizing I suggest what many Canadians see is the problem 
with government in general: there is just too much of it.
<P>
	As an accountant, Madam Speaker, I can assure you I am 
familiar with the act. I have studied it, worked with it and, yes, 
like everybody else, have had my problems with it in my day. I 
have burnt a lot of midnight oil in April trying to figure it out.
<P>
	I want to assure my fellow accountants across this country 
that I am not advocating putting them out of work, but the act 
must be changed. It is time the average Canadian had a chance to 
understand not just the principle behind taxation but the 
mechanics of it as well.
<P>
	The last attempt by the Conservative government to introduce 
tax reform led to an income surtax, an alternate minimum tax, 
tax deductions, tax credits and the complicated GST, all of 
which have further confused matters. It does not have to be this 
complicated.
<P>
	Let me illustrate my point with a personal experience I had 
that I believe shows how this entire process has become 
symptomatic of a larger disease that is big government today. 
When I first began to look at Bill C-9 I was in my constituency 
office in Matsqui, British Columbia. My assistant had a copy of 
the bill here in Ottawa and I asked him how large it was. The 
answer was 68 pages. I thought 68 pages of amendments, how do 
I go through this in a week and try to figure all of it out. I asked 
him if he could find some kind of explanatory summary. He told 
me he had asked the Department of Finance for the summary and 
had received one very quickly. There was only one problem, the 
so-called summary of a 68-page document was 78 pages long.
<P>
<B>(1915 ) </B>
<P>
	These are the kinds of little stories to which even those of us 
who are new to Ottawa have become immune. The people who 
have sent us here, the people who have to struggle through the 
tax forms every single year, the people who pay our salaries, are 
not immune to these little stories. They are sick and tired of 
them quite frankly. I believe that was one of the strongest 
messages sent to this House last October.
<P>
	We could help our deficit problems by addressing the vast 
amounts of money this country wastes on sustaining an army of 
tax accountants and tax lawyers which is what one needs to 
interpret the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	We could dramatically reduce costs for individuals' 
businesses and governments by simplifying the system. We 
should make it a priority. I would encourage the Liberal 
government to make it a priority. The Reform Party has it as a 
very high priority.
<P>
	I would like to make it clear that there are some good aspects 
to this bill that we would like to see the government continue or 
improve on in its up and coming budget. For instance, section 
146.01, the home buyers' plan, is a good example of that. I think 
members heard that from the previous speaker as well.
<P>
	Young people today cannot afford to buy homes because they 
are paying too much tax. While total incomes per capita have 
increased 170 per cent in the last decade, total direct personal 
taxes have risen by 235 per cent.
<P>
	How are we doing with respect to other countries? Canadian 
government revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product 
increased from 24 per cent in 1950 to almost 43 per cent in 1990.
<P>
	Six years ago, the tax burden in Canada was approximately 20 
per cent higher than that of the United States. In 1992 it had risen 
to 25 per cent and it is projected to increase to 30 per cent by 
1997. It is not just young people who are feeling the tax burden. 
It is all Canadians today.
<P>
	The home buyers' plan which allows those savings for a home 
withdrawn from an RRSP to make a good down payment is a 
good idea. It not only puts the dream of home ownership within 
the grasp of more people but it provides economic spinoffs all 
the way down the line.
<P>
	Sue Bennett, one of my constituents from Langley, British 
Columbia, has sent me some information on the plan. I would 
like to go through it briefly. A poll released in September 1993 
by the Canadian Real Estate Association confirms that the 
homeowner buyers' plan has been a big success.
<P>
	The poll done by Angus Reid was conducted in five major 
Canadian cities. It found that four of five buyers who used the 
plan said it was an important factor in their decision. It was 
especially important for 86 per cent of the first time buyers. 
Accountants usually take it. If it is very close, we have to say it 
does not average. However,  nearly half the people said it would 
have been unlikely they would have been able to buy their home 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1144"> 1144 </A></B>
<P>
without the plan. The plan helped a significant number of home 
buyers surveyed, 22 per cent of all first time buyers and 17 per 
cent of buyers generally.
<P>
	Repaying their RRSPs is a high priority in this country. 
Eighty-one per cent of the respondents said that it is important 
to repay. Fully 88 per cent said that they would repay at least at 
the rate required by the plan and only 4 per cent said that they 
would not repay and would declare their withdrawals as income.
<P>
	Therefore the impact of the plan is there. It is a positive plan. 
Home ownership was seen by 84 per cent of those surveyed as 
being at least somewhat important to retirement planning. 
Fifty-four per cent said that it was very important. Owning a 
home was rated by far as the most important source of income 
for retirement.
<P>
	The Department of Finance has already reported that the 
numbers have been impressive. There were nearly 200,000 
participants to the end of July 1993. It is significant.
<P>
	Housing starts, as any economist will tell you, are a reliable 
indicator of the overall health of our economy. The housing 
industry directly employs as we know general contractors, 
carpenters, electricians, plumbers, dry wallers and real estate 
people among many others. Indirectly it benefits many other 
segments of society including, yes, even accountants. We are 
encouraged by such measures as the home buyers plan and, as I 
said, we are hopeful the new budget will include an extension of 
this popular program. Let us put more Canadian carpenters and 
plumbers back to work.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	We in the Reform Party support a taxation policy that has as 
its principle objective the raising of funds to pay for government 
programs. If we look at the history of the act that is what it was 
originally intended to do, collect taxes ideally, and that would be 
done in an orderly, simple fashion.
<P>
	Somewhere along the line we have lost the original intent of 
the tax system and we have allowed it to become a tool to 
influence people's behaviour. I am speaking now of social 
reform creeping into a piece of the financial legislation. That is 
not only inappropriate, it does not work. We propose working 
toward a simple, visible and proportional system of taxation.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance announced in a December 20 press 
release that a proposal by the Conservatives to pay the GST 
rebates twice a year instead of quarterly has been dropped from 
Bill C-9.
<P>
	At a briefing earlier this week the minister's department 
informed me the reason the proposal was dropped is because it 
was found to be more economic sleight of hand on the part of the 
previous government and that it would have made the deficit 
look a little better to the Canadian public. To reject that type of 
sleight of hand is a sound decision and I am encouraged by it.
<P>
	I have mixed emotions. I am extremely concerned by the new 
government's lack of commitment to change the way it handles 
its economic affairs; no concentration on the debt or the deficit.
<P>
	We sit here today perhaps to give assent to an amendment 
proposed by the last government. I therefore cannot help but be 
cautious in my optimism. All of us in this House should not need 
reminding of the resounding message sent to the last 
government on October 25. We cannot allow ourselves to slip 
into those ways even in the slightest way.
<P>
	I call on the government today to assure us it will give reform 
of the Income Tax Act the priority it deserves. This will show the 
opposition parties that the government is making good on its 
promise of the new way of doing business. It will send a strong 
message to the provinces that they should follow the federal 
government's lead. Most important of all, it will show the 
Canadian people there really is hope for a new way of running 
government. We cannot let fear of media or any other kind of 
pressure inhibit our effort to reform. We have to try.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to take a moment to remind my 
colleagues in the House that there is a big, fast moving, exciting 
world out there beyond these walls. Even with my brief 
experience in this House, I am often amazed at how this simple 
fact gets lost in the daily shuffle of papers that this institution 
sometimes seems to be.
<P>
	I would like to leave you, Madam Speaker, and my colleagues 
with a final thought. Failure is not fatal but in these times failure 
to change may be. Let us simplify. Let us be fiscally prudent and 
responsible.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>M. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
with great interest the remarks of our colleague of the Reform 
Party. It is obvious that Quebecers and Canadians as a whole 
have to deal with a level of taxation which is definitely very hard 
to support for the population, those who have a job and even 
those who do not have a job, given all the consumption taxes.
<P>
	I remember preparing my first income tax returns years and 
years ago. It was a plain sheet printed on both sides and very 
easy to fill out. You would arrive in no time at a result that was 
not too frightening. But ever since, with all those schedules you 
have to deal with in order to be allowed various deductions, the 
whole process has become very complicated. There are so many 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1145"> 1145 </A></B>
<P>
calculations to be done and, in the end, the amount you  have to 
pay is often horrifying. Which goes to show that more is not 
always better.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	There is a saying in English: No taxation without 
representation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	With that level of taxation, people have been represented to 
death. I think they gave their verdict about that in the last 
election.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The fact is that the government is still facing a deficit and has 
been for many years. It tried several solutions, but also 
systematically raised taxes. We could very easily draw the curve 
of tax raises and realize that as taxes were increased, the deficit 
went up. So, if there was a new tax hike coming, we could almost 
predict by how much the deficit would go up even further.
<P>
	Perhaps we should find another way of using tax solutions to 
avoid increasing the deficit. You see, Madam Speaker, every 
time someone is paying taxes, they have less money left in their 
wallet. And if there is less money in their wallet, they are less 
able to buy things. However, some say that in order to have a 
recovery, the consumer must buy things. I hope the government 
will not take any more money from consumers, because they 
will be even less able to buy things.
<P>
	Of course, we can also talk about expanding the tax base. And 
if we tax new fields, we will be in a situation where goods and 
services will become more expensive because, ultimately, 
businesses or individuals who will be taxed will try to 
compensate by raising prices. And we will perpetuate the 
situation that we have experienced for many years, here in 
Canada and in Quebec, that is an inflation one of the main 
components of which was our short-sighted vision on taxation. 
If the government tried to make money now by raising taxes, it 
would very quickly bring Quebec and Canada back into a 
situation where they would have an even greater deficit.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to respond and would be curious 
to hear his comments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, much of 
what the hon. member said is so close to my philosophy I am 
wondering if maybe he would like to move over and talk about 
it.
<P>
	It is very true about the complexity of this system. The system 
has become so complex that I do not think this government, nor 
did the Conservative government, knows the effect of a 
transaction when it changes the Income Tax Act. When we stand 
in the House and ask the questions: ``Just how much does that 
cost'' or ``How much revenue will you receive'', they are 
estimates. They are estimates that can be out anywhere from 
$100 million to a billion dollars. The system is so complex today 
that there is no logic, rhyme or reason as  to exactly how much 
money one gets from changes in this act.
<P>
	Just one other comment on the long-term effects. I think that 
is one of the real symptoms of the problem in the Income Tax 
Act. Today it is typically used as a quick knee-jerk reaction to 
try to try to resolve a problem. You are going to see that in the 
excise tax with the cigarette smuggling situation.
<P>
	What we have to do is to get governments to start looking 
longer term. We do have to simplify the system. That is how to 
make it effective.
<P>
<B>(1930 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to ask my colleague a couple of 
questions very quickly.
<P>
	I am not sure whether or not members of the Reform Party 
oppose the broadening of the tax base. I stand to be corrected, 
but I understand they would prefer not to have any more taxes 
added to those which exist.
<P>
	Do Reform members oppose the broadening of the tax base? 
Do they oppose blocking the loopholes certain groups enjoy by 
transferring money to other countries where there are certain 
advantages? Apparently some wealthy families are able to 
shield income. There are corporations making money and not 
paying taxes and wealthy Canadians who have paid no taxes. 
There is the black market economy where people avoid paying 
taxes. Are they suggesting to the Minister of Finance and this 
government that they should not move in that direction, that 
they should ignore those particular measures? I am very much 
interested in the response.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, the major 
concern of Reformers is that broadening of the tax base to the 
government means more taxes. If the member is asking whether 
Reform thinks there should be more taxes on the individual, the 
answer is no, no, no. That will be heard more than once in this 
House.
<P>
	I do not think the member's definition of broadening the tax 
base necessarily means equity in the tax system. My opinion is 
that once again it is going to come out of the pockets of the hard 
working, middle income earners and we will be watching for it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the hon. member in his speech talked about tax and the 
most recent question was with respect to the broadening of the 
tax base. I would still like to know from the hon. member 
whether the privileged people in this country who have avoided 
tax for many years and accumulated not just some moneys but 
fortunes should continue to be exempt under the guise of no 
increased taxation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1146"> 1146 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
having difficulty understanding who the privileged few are in 
this country.
<P>
	This party is for a fair tax system, a simple tax system. The 
definition of privilege to the government is something similar to 
that of broadening the tax base. When I see its definition of 
privilege and broadening the tax base the member will get the 
answer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have been following this debate and I do not quite 
understand what the reply was. Perhaps I can define the question 
again or take a third try at it.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member to tell me whether the Reform 
Party is for or against closing tax loopholes. Does he feel that 
the closing of tax loopholes is a broadening or an addition to the 
taxes?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry but the period 
for questions and comments has expired.
<P>
<B>(1935) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Madam Speaker, before 
I start my speech, I would like to comment on what was said by 
the hon. member for the Reform Party about simplification. Of 
course there is a case for simplifying the entire tax system, and I 
am referring to income tax returns as well as tax shelters, but I 
do not think we can agree on everything, and there are other 
options that should be considered very carefully.
<P>
	Bill C-9, An Act to amend the Income Tax Act, has an aspect 
that may be somewhat odd, I suppose, for members on the other 
side of the House. In fact, we are legislating measures that arise 
from the last budget. I am not sure, and I did not go through 
<I>Hansard</I> to see what the reaction was to these measures when 
they were announced, although it might be interesting to do that, 
but now, they have no choice, and neither do we. These measures 
must be enacted. This legislation will implement measures 
which in fact businesses were able to take advantage of all last 
year. Legally, these measures had not been adopted, but they 
will be in the weeks to come, which will more or less finalize 
what was announced in the last budget. These are very technical 
aspects.
<P>
	However, there are also some principles involved, and we 
could do a repeat of last year's budget debate, but we cannot 
really affect the outcome. The fiscal year will end in a few 
months, and by that time we will have a new budget, in a matter 
of weeks even, and there are rumours it might be in less than two 
weeks. At that time we may have something more interesting to 
discuss.
<P>
	Nevertheless, there are a number of comments we would like 
to make about the last budget and the measures arising from that 
budget, in a final attempt to influence what will be in the next 
budget, and especially in next year's budget, because the 
Minister of Finance is already saying they will not have time to 
put everything  they want in this year's budget and that it will 
have to wait until next year.
<P>
	Whether that is the real reason, who knows? I think they are 
hoping for a strong economic recovery and that they are 
overestimating the positive impact of economic growth on the 
deficit, despite all the nice speeches by the Minister of Finance 
and despite his good intentions. He said that he would not repeat 
the mistake of the past, the mistake of the Conservative 
government in overestimating evenues. We can see from last 
year's budget that spending was grossly underestimated, and the 
Liberals say they will not do that. As far as revenues are 
concerned, I can tell you that we will be watching closely.
<P>
	The dozen or so measures contained in this Bill were 
announced in the December economic statement and in the 
budget last May. The rest is made up of changes to the wording 
of the law. All that is very complex, given the number of areas 
covered by the Income Tax Act, and with time we even get 
conflicting clauses, but I will come back to that.
<P>
	These measures were meant, to a great extent, to stimulate 
small and medium sized businesses. That was really the target 
sector. There was also something for research and development, 
and finally measures concerning exploration for natural 
resources.
<P>
	That budget had extended for another year the use of 
registered retirement saving plans for home buying. This is a 
good measure which we hope to find again in this year's budget 
for application next year.
<P>
	I heard some members say that representations were made by 
some of their constituents showing that this particular measure 
had a positive impact. Obviously this is a kind of measure which 
is easy to evaluate, and that is interesting.
<P>
	I will conclude, not on the basis on my speech but on that of 
the proposed measures, that the government will have to do 
better in the future.
<P>
<B>(1940) </B>
<P>
	Last year's budget was very disappointing. It seemed as 
though the government wanted to preserve maximum flexibility 
so that the next Conservative Party Leader would have the 
leeway to adapt it at will. Maybe that was not a good idea. I do 
not believe that, in these difficult times, we can postpone for a 
year, not even for a few months or weeks, our fight against the 
deficit nor efforts towards better management of public funds. It 
seems we have wasted a year and that is very disappointing.
<P>
	What do we expect from the next budget? A decrease in 
expenditures, naturally; but we also hope it will propose a 
complete tax reform. We have heard nothing along that line yet. 
We feel as though we were preaching in the wilderness. We 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1147"> 1147 </A></B>
<P>
cannot wait for the government to announce even a slight 
intention of addressing that issue, of reviewing our very 
complex personal and corporate tax system. Such a measure 
would increase the confidence of Quebecers and Canadians 
alike in their  taxation system and thereby, their confidence in 
their representatives and institutions.
<P>
	We expect a simplification of the process. As my colleague, 
the member for Portneuf said: very few people can prepare their 
own income tax return. It is not an easy task to read the Tax 
Guide; even the one you receive with the short form is quite 
exacting. Just think of the elderly; it is not easy for them. Even if 
we prepare specific short forms for senior citizens, it remains 
too complex.
<P>
	There are many measures that could benefit people who, 
unfortunately, do not understand them. They do not know that 
they apply to them. They are ill-equipped to use the tools they 
are told could be of benefit to them. They hear about them from a 
friend or a colleague, but more often than not, they ask an 
expert, such as an accountant, to prepare their income return for 
them. These people do not tell them what they should do to 
improve their financial situation and personal planning. It is 
very complicated and that is the reason why very often new tax 
measures bear more heavily on the middle-class since it is 
having a difficult time adapting rapidly to changes or even 
understanding quickly the tax system.
<P>
	Those who can benefit fully from it are the most wealthy, 
which causes people to say that the system is unfair. You do not 
have to go very far. We all have heard, at one time or another, 
someone in our riding say that the system is unfair, that the rich 
pay less taxes. Even if there is a trend, statistics show that, on 
the whole, it is not true; of course there are exceptions, and even 
a few are already too many. They create a lot of discontent.
<P>
	Let us look more closely at the dozen of provisions contained 
in the bill. The first one is interesting to look at and study from 
the following point of view. On this side, we often talk about 
overlapping jurisdictions. But we forget to mention 
interdepartmental co-operation, a very complicated issue. The 
Auditor General mentioned it and pointed at a lot of things that 
could be improved. The government is doing something with 
one hand and doing something else with the other that reduces 
the effect. In last year's budget, this first measure said that 
unemployment insurance premiums would be reduced as a way 
to create more jobs and to encourage businesses to hire more 
people. This year, it was already announced that unemployment 
insurance premiums would go up at the beginning of January. In 
the same year, they give with one hand and take with the other. 
People have trouble getting a clear message from that. There is 
something very contradictory. In the same fiscal year, there was 
a change of government, but the policy orientation is hard to 
grasp. I am the first one to say so. Why did they do that? We 
suppose that they took the money to finance the infrastructure 
program. That may be a reason or it may be to finance something 
else as well. But I have trouble understanding why with all those 
resources and so many competent people around, we find 
ourselves in situations where contradictory measures are taken, 
not by the same government but by the same level of 
government. To be sure, we can understand that in some cases 
the federal and provincial governments act differently, since 
they do not always share the same policy orientation, but it is 
very hard to accept the same level of government acting in a way 
that contradicts itself.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	There are also temporary investment tax credits for small 
business. The temporary nature of this measure-
<P>
	Madam Speaker, would you please ask hon. members to-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please. If the 
hon. members wish to pursue a conversation, I would ask that 
they do it outside the Chamber. The hon. member for 
Témiscamingue may continue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Thank you, Madam Speaker. Our friends would do 
well to listen. When the subject is taxation, we have the 
impression that they are no longer listening, that they are 
afraid-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> I am listening.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Indeed, there are some-and they deserve full 
marks-who listen closely.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel: </B>We listen quite religiously.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien: </B>Indeed, and I am even expecting some questions.
<P>
	Let us continue. Another measure, one of a series of very 
technical measures, is the extension of the small business 
financing program under which a small business in financial 
difficulty may refinance its debt. This measure, which provides 
for a different tax treatment, is very interesting for businesses as 
well as for financial institutions.
<P>
	Another measure provides for the abolition of the penalty tax. 
How ineffective can this be. The penalty tax on excess small 
business properties held by RRSPs and registered retirement 
income funds is repealed from October 31, 1985. It is not 
important to understand the technical aspects of this measure-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order. Could members 
please, if they must speak, do it outside the Chamber. I have 
trouble hearing what the hon. member is saying.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1148"> 1148 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Thank you, Madam 
Speaker. I am happy that you have trouble hearing me as it 
shows there is at least one person listening besides my 
colleagues, or two persons I should say.
<P>
	The technical reason for this measure abolishing something 
retroactively to 1985-not the technical reason but the actual 
principle-is that it could not be implemented in real life. It was 
too complex to manage. It took eight, almost nine years to put in 
place this measure and the revenue department could not make it 
work. It is very hard to understand. Why did we wait so long and 
what happened to the money given to debtor businesses that 
could not be recovered? All this remains to be seen and we will 
ask questions when this bill is reviewed by the finance 
committee.
<P>
	Another measure that we wish to see extended further in the 
future is the home buyers plan. This is a valuable measure with a 
stimulating effect on the construction industry. It allows 
individuals to buy a home, which is desirable. The bill provides 
for tax incentives and ways of doing things in terms of taxation 
which are very positive. When we talk about reform, we are not 
suggesting that everything about the present tax system is 
wrong. Some aspects of it are more positive than others, and this 
is one of them.
<P>
	Two measures regarding flow-through shares and exploration 
expenses were included in an attempt to repair the mistakes 
made by the Conservatives when they axed the flow-through 
shares program. The Quebec government had jumped on the 
band-wagon and I can tell you that it had disastrous 
consequences in my region.
<P>
	In 1987, the unemployment level was about 7 per cent in 
Abitibi-Témiscamingue. Today, we would call that full 
employment. In the beginning of the 1980s, full employment 
was fixed at about 4 per cent, but we must adjust this figure. 
After two recessions, one in the beginning of the 1980s and the 
second one ten years later, the unemployment level is now 
higher. Our economy was thriving. There was indeed abuse. As 
with everything else, there are some who take advantage of good 
policies. That is what happened and that is why we had to make 
drastic cuts.
<P>
	A popular expression applies here: we threw out the baby with 
the bathwater. It could have been possible to correct the 
situation with a few technical amendments. We tried to make up 
a little for this. These measures are interesting, but a lot less, and 
it is not the main concern of the Association des producteurs et 
des exportateurs. I can tell you that the former incentives and 
flow-through shares plan were much more interesting than these 
measures.
<P>
	There is another measure that must not be considered only in 
this light because one has to dig a little to put it in perspective. It 
is important since it is closely related to a suggestion made by 
the Bloc Quebecois, and which, hopefully, the government will 
study one day.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	It provides for a maximum annual investment tax credit. This 
credit will be eliminated. Before, businesses could use this 
credit up to a maximum of 75 per cent. They could reduce their 
benefits by 75 per cent, so why not totally eliminate them and 
not to have to pay any tax?
<P>
	It will now be possible. This has to be considered along with 
another measure from the previous year, namely a capital tax to 
ensure that most businesses pay a minimum of taxes. Where 
there may a problem, although we have to be careful and 
examine this issue in a much more technical and thorough 
fashion, it is with this capital tax of .02 per cent which applies 
only to a capital amount of $10 million or more. Do businesses 
with a capital of $5 to $10 million deserve this break? This is a 
good question which we must ask ourselves. It must at least be 
raised, but it should be examined and I hope it will be when the 
Finance Committee will look at this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The other two measures were aimed at promoting research 
and development, and at ensuring the payment of tax 
instalments. The amount has been raised to help more people.
<P>
	This bill is exactly identical to the one tabled by the 
Conservatives following their budget, except for the change to 
the GST refund. I do not object to the fact that it is so similar to 
the previous piece of legislation. What I am saying is that there 
is only one change. There will still be four quarterly payments, 
which is a good thing, and which also enabled the previous 
government to change somewhat the record keeping and 
underestimate the deficit. Now, it has the opposite effect with 
the new government, which uses it to slightly overestimate the 
deficit.
<P>
	This is certainly not a major change. Some like the idea of 
four payments, others would prefer two, but in terms of public 
finances as a whole, this is of no consequence. It is essentially a 
cosmetic change.
<P>
	Finally, there are two things about taxation and fiscal policy 
that bother me. These measures often target small businesses. 
Earlier, I heard an hon. member talk about the importance of the 
people and of the rural communities. I urge him to carefully 
consider the situation of the small and medium sized businesses, 
because there must be some in his riding too.
<P>
	These businesses have a lot of trouble dealing with a very 
complex tax system. If the system is complicated for the 
individuals, it is even more so for small and medium sized 
businesses, who completely rely on an accountant or an analyst 
of their acquaintance for advice, even though it is not always in 
their best interests. They are  told about temporary one-year 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1149"> 1149 </A></B>
<P>
measures, but they are unable to assess quickly enough the 
benefits they can derive from these measures.
<P>
	They do not take full advantage of the measures. The 
government should put in place a simpler mechanism, easier to 
understand, particularly in the area of research and 
development. There is not enough R and D done in the private 
sector in Quebec and in Canada. With all the economic changes 
that are occurring, the level of R and D in the private sector will 
have to increase. The government will have to encourage these 
people to get into R and D. However, they need about eighteen 
months before there are any significant results. I can tell you, 
Madam Speaker, that we have excellent tax incentives, the best 
in the world in some areas, but they are not well understood by 
businesses and they are very difficult to use.
<P>
	Obviously, pharmaceutical companies understand them well 
and use them well. They are doing very well in Quebec. But in 
other areas, companies are not even aware of the tax incentives 
that exist. The Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce 
has a program, the Department of Finance has another program, 
there are just too many programs. Businesses have trouble 
finding their way through the maze of programs. They have to 
look at all the possibilities and it takes time. It is not only the 
GST that costs businesses a lot of money. There is also the cost 
of trying to understand all the government support programs. It 
can be very difficult, particularly for small and medium sized 
businesses.
<P>
	I am about to conclude. Fiscal measures should always be 
evaluated as to their fallouts and costs before being announced. 
In economic jargon, it is simply called a cost-benefit projection. 
Then, results can be made public. This is rarely done and it is 
easy to understand why. When facts are published, the people 
can evaluate how good their government is. Thus, I hope that for 
the sake of openness this government will do more than its 
predecessor on this. The Minister of Finance has often promised 
to do it and his colleagues should press him to deliver.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	To conclude, we will carefully monitor these measures and 
the upcoming budget. That is when it will truly start. And if this 
government does not want to end like the previous one, it should 
take a completely different approach.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I wish to thank my colleague for his speech. 
First, I want to assure him that our approach is totally different.
<P>
	I have four quick questions for him. First, since some 
Canadians took certain decisions in response to budgetary 
measures announced by the previous government-I insist on 
that point-I would like to know if, yes or no, the Bloc 
Quebecois agrees with the Bill.
<P>
	Second, you heard the members of the Reform Party say in 
this House that they oppose all taxes. They said: ``No taxes, no 
taxes, no taxes,'' even for wealthy corporations or individuals 
who benefit from tax shelters. I would like to know the position 
of your party on that subject.
<P>
	Third question, I would also like to know whether the Quebec 
income tax guide and forms to be filled out are really different 
and more complex than the federal ones. I take that question at 
heart and no doubt you know the answer.
<P>
	Finally, the member spoke about small and medium-sized 
businesses and indicated that one of the things that bothered 
them-and I want to make sure my colleague understands this 
last question since it is probably the most important-was the 
complexity and large number of regulations and so on. But he 
did not mention access to capital. At home, in St. Boniface, that 
great place at the geographical centre of Canada, we are mostly 
interested in access to capital for small and medium-sized 
businesses.
<P>
	Maybe he can make very short comments on my four 
questions, answering by yes, no, or maybe.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Brien:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. 
member for St. Boniface for his questions and especially his last 
point, which I will comment, but only after I have answered his 
questions in sequence.
<P>
	First of all, the hon. member asked whether we agree with this 
bill. As a matter of fact, it will pass at second reading whether 
we agree or not. We will support the principle of this legislation, 
but we will examine the bill clause by clause in committee and 
ask very specific questions. Third reading will come afterwards. 
That is the way it goes. This bill will be referred to the Finance 
Committee, a committee which always has a busy schedule, but 
it will only be one more piece of legislation on a heavy agenda.
<P>
	Now he wants to know what our position is compared to the 
Reform Party's. I think I see what he is getting at. Do we 
consider that reducing tax shelters is different from raising 
taxes? I think that was the thrust of his question.
<P>
	There could be a difference, except that, on the whole, we are 
collecting more revenues. One day, we will have to agree on a 
definition of tax increase. Traditionally it means increasing the 
consumption and income taxes. Can we say, however, that 
reducing tax shelters and fiscal incentives is in effect a tax 
increase? This is debatable, but the results are the same: more 
revenues for the government.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1150"> 1150 </A></B>
<P>
	In some instances, we will agree with a given tax shelter; in 
others, we will not. We will study them one by one.
<P>
	If we compare the tax returns for Quebec and for Ottawa, we 
see that they are both complex, because there are two 
governments involved. That is very important.
<P>
	In Quebec, Mr. Yves Séguin tried very hard to simplify the tax 
returns, but there is still a lot to be done. We often talk about 
administrative overlap, but there is one thing that drives people 
crazy. Let me assure you that Quebec's sovereignty will have a 
great benefit in people's daily life, if only for the fact that they 
will only have one tax return to fill.
<P>
	Overall, the figures may not change much, but it would be a 
lot simpler. The individuals will feel better, as will the 
businesses, and that will be a great step forward, one we have 
never been able to take so far.
<P>
	We will not have to hear a lot of rhetoric about harmonization 
all year long, without ever achieving it.
<P>
	In closing, I want to speak about access to capital. I tell the 
hon. member that we will have to see what the government will 
do. The federal and the provincial governments tend to offer 
more and more assistance programs to businesses, including the 
business development centres. There are even regional 
investment funds. We hear people talking about putting more 
pressure on financial institutions, but what will happen?
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> It being eight o'clock 
p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at ten o'clock 
a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	The House adjourned at 8 p.m.
