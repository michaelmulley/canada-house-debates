access to information requests with regard to documents relating 
to the Charlottetown accord.  There was some delay and 
scuttlebutt with regard to the delay of those documents, some 
secrecy, and we all know how pernicious secrecy is.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My prediction is that the government will vote down this motion 
and not produce the documents with regard to the Calgary 
Declaration.  I think that is somewhat hypocritical.  On the one 
hand the government was talking about how open it wanted the 
process concerning the declaration to be.  It said it did not 
want to do things the way Mulroney did with the Charlottetown 
accord.  It wanted this to be a very open process, but we have 
secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worse than that.  It is not just the case of secrecy, that 
the government is hiding something, but it is using taxpayers' 
money to do it.  That is what I find objectionable.  Polls are 
done to find out how taxpayers feel on certain issues, for 
example, the credibility of political leaders in negotiating 
these types of deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even though it is taxpayer money that is used to find out what 
the taxpayers feel about particular situations, they are not 
being told.  They are not being given the information.  We have 
some serious problems with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very reminiscent of what happened with Brian Mulroney in 
1992 when the Tories refused to release the taxpayer-funded polls 
on Charlottetown.  It begs the question of why this taxpayer 
money is being spent.  Why are these polls being held back?  Why 
are we not being apprised of the situation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It boils down to a few reasons.  One of the things the 
government likes to say is that somehow this will taint 
federal-provincial relations.  That was decided in court by Judge 
Rothstein.  I will get into the quotes in a minute.  In that case 
there was a determination that the government did not have a 
legitimate case to deprive the public of these documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go into some of these things that I think need to be 
touched on because previous information commissioners and others 
have made determinations with regard to this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members, when in opposition and even while running in 
the last election in 1997, made promises which were contained in 
the red book.  Indeed there was a violation of one of the sacred 
red book promises.  We do not like to see that happen.  There are 
probably others, but I will point out one which is glaring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Information Commissioner Grace wrote that it is “passing 
bizarre that the public should be denied knowing what the public 
thinks when the public pays for collecting information about 
itself”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is passing bizarre.  But it is something that is not so 
bizarre that I would put the Liberal government past it because 
that is exactly the case today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to revisit some of the comments made by government 
members when they were in opposition, the criticisms they 
levelled against the Tory administration of Brian Mulroney on 
secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader has in his riding the lovely town of 
Prescott which I have been to several times.  At that time he 
said that the government must justify why taxpayer dollars were 
spent gathering information that could have benefited the party 
in power, the government of the day.  That is exactly the same 
question we raise today.  Why is this Liberal government refusing 
to allow access to documents that could benefit it in terms of 
its strategy and what it is doing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it does not benefit in terms of the strategy and what it is 
doing and if it is not being used for partisan purposes, then let 
us see the documents.  The taxpayers have paid for them. It is 
only fair to give taxpayers access to the documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Calgary Declaration was supposed to be an open process, 
then let us open up these documents.  Basically that is what this 
motion asks today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The justice who had some serious problems with the rationale 
used by governments previously to withhold documents just like 
these was Justice Marshall Rothstein. 
He said that he did not see a harm to relations with the 
provinces, that basically those types of arguments were 
unfounded.  He thought that disclosing public opinion surveys was 
indeed important.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not as though this is a cheap endeavour. It is not as 
though these are piddly sums of money.  The principle is of 
course that the government, because it is using taxpayer dollars, 
should make these types of studies, these types of surveys, these 
types of polls available to the public which is paying for them. 
The government is violating that principle in terms of what it is 
doing with these secret deals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More than that, it is also a case of money.  We have seen this 
administration continually increase the amount of money it is 
spending on these polls.  Indeed government advertising alone, 
used in conjunction with these polls, is over $100 million a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The strategic polling that we are talking about here that was 
done with regard to the declaration, which the government is 
withholding, amounted to millions of dollars.  It is 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These types of polls are also used for political or partisan 
purposes when they probe views on people like the Prime Minister, 
the Leader of the Opposition and various premiers who were 
involved in some of the negotiations.  If the government is going 
to be using public dollars, then everybody should be made aware 
of them, including those people across the way who are the 
subject of some of those polls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we include some precedents in this debate. 
Polling results on the Charlottetown accord amounted to 700 
pages.  That is a lot of polling.  When we look at what it 
contained, the idea that the government withheld it from the 
Canadian public who paid for it is heinous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again we have the government marching down the path to a 
deal with regard to the Constitution, or at least putting forward 
a declaration with regard to it.  We know it has had some 
determinations on it.  Certainly it has done polling.  It has 
told me that it has done polling.  I have been contacted by 
people who are involved with intergovernmental affairs.  I have 
been contacted by people who are involved in the Privy Council 
Office.  They have told me that they have these documents, but 
they said they do not want to release them.  They said that 
instead I should go through an access to information request or 
something like that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government has the documents, if it has located the 
documents, surely, for the taxpayers who paid for the documents, 
there should not be a problem producing the documents in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government released the 700 pages of documents relating 
to the Charlottetown accord, it did so in an attempt to pre-empt 
a court ruling and avoid setting a legal precedent.  If that 
legal precedent had been set of course we would be looking at 
using it today.  It only released those documents to avoid 
setting a precedent with regard to the release of these types of 
documents.  That is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in principle it should be releasing these documents, as it 
should because taxpayer dollars have paid for them, then we 
should not have to wait.  The government should not be hiding 
behind the skirts of a legal decision, trying to avoid it.  It 
should be forthright and release these documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bills that Decima and Créatec had with respect to the 
Charlottetown accord amounted to $306,000.  I am sure these types 
of things are going on today, but because the government is being 
secretive in terms of what it is doing with these documents we 
are not going to know the actual figures and what polls were done 
until it actually comes forth and releases them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that it is not just the official opposition which is 
concerned about things like this, it is also people whose job it 
is to inform the Canadian public, namely the Canadian press. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again with regard to precedents, because I am laying the 
groundwork which is very important in this argument, the last 
time the journalists from the Canadian Press, Southam News, the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> and other researchers asked the Privy 
Council Office to disclose public opinion research on 
constitutional proposals the government refused to do so.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not just a case of the official opposition or opposition 
parties in the House requesting the information.  It is a case of 
journalists in the country who under the freedom of the press 
have their responsibilities to report to the public on the 
goings-on of the government.   With secrecy like this it is very 
difficult for them to do their job.  It is difficult for us to do 
our job as the official opposition, and the taxpayers are being 
denied the information.  That is very unfair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This points to the ideas in government circles on something like 
this.  At the time when this was being debated sources in the 
government indicated that they did not want to release the 
polling data because they would fall into the hands of the 
enemies of the state.  Those are the types of comments that have 
been used by governments with regard to secrecy.  It did not want 
the polling results made available to the public because it 
worried they would get into the hands of enemies of the state. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are those enemies?  Is it the official opposition?  I do not 
think so.  We have the best interest of Canada at heart, as does 
the government.  As a matter of fact in this case I think it is 
more so because we are not the ones promoting secrecy and hidden 
agendas.  We are not an enemy of the state.  Surely it is not the 
people who are viewed as an enemy of the state by the government. 
It should not be the people.  They are the ones the government is 
supposed serve.  They are the ones the opposition serves. 
Certainly the people should not be viewed as enemies of the state 
in this type of matter.  The documents should be made available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also touch on the fact that there are good people on the other 
side and I appeal to them today, those in government.  Some may 
be backbenchers.  Some may even be in cabinet but usually they 
are not the veterans who have a vested interest in some of these 
things to make sure contracts go out to long time friends of 
theirs.  Certainly some are rookies, those who are a little more 
fresh to the process or a little more accountable and a little 
more responsible, a little more in touch with the people who 
elected them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those people have argued in the past that they want polling and 
advertising done by the bureaucrats and not decided by some 
people in cabinet and not decided by some people who have vested 
interests on the other side to keep the whole process secret.  As 
a result they should be following through on that. They should be 
ringing true some of those words and making good on that pledge. 
Instead we have veteran cabinet ministers who in the past have 
told bureaucrats who should be included on bidders' lists.  They 
do not want everybody to fairly bid on the process and they want 
to keep it secretive.  There are examples of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a cabinet minister from the city of Winnipeg where I was 
born who awards very lucrative contracts in the hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to a long time friend of his, Angus Reid, 
who also resides in the same city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I implore members of the government that these things 
do not stay secret forever.  When they finally come out the egg 
is on their face and it makes them look secretive, like they are 
hiding and manipulative, and all these things are seen for the 
fair value of what they are.  They might as well come clean early 
and allow Canadians access to the documents because it will come 
out eventually; it always does.  We have to end the whole 
practice of some would say payola, patronage, kickbacks or 
backroom dealing. Anyway we want to phrase it, it is wrong and we 
should end these types of things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where are the credible standards of political behaviour?  I will 
get to the red book because it addresses some things about 
political behaviour and the government should be coming clean on 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately when the secrecy ends the government goes into 
damage control mode, and we have seen that.  It touches on the 
whole controversy of the use of pepper spray at APEC.  We have 
seen the government go into damage control mode because 
eventually the secrecy will not hold.  Eventually it breaks. 
Eventually somebody talks.  Whether it is a bureaucrat, a 
disgruntled cabinet minister or a backbencher who is 
underappreciated, somebody breaks.  Maybe it is a new government 
that takes the positions of control and is able to go ahead and 
expose some things to shed some light on some of the evil 
dealings, the secretive dealings that have gone on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it is very unfortunate because that party is in damage 
control mode and it is too late.  They could rectify these 
positions early but they rarely save themselves that way.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going to the red book—I am holding the best till last—I 
will talk about some of the research firms that I expect will be 
profiting from some of these polls, these secretive deals, the 
ones that are not being disclosed today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last couple of years they have benefited to a hefty sum 
from the government.  Maybe somebody in those organizations will 
be willing to talk about the polls that have been done and the 
results that are not being released by the government.  Ekos 
Research, Coopers & Lybrand, Angus Reid, Pollara, Environics, 
Compas, Sage, Price Waterhouse, Phase 5, Créatic and DJC Research 
have had very lucrative contracts from the government.  Maybe 
somebody in those firms knows about these secret polls, these 
polls the government is trying to conceal and will not release 
with a declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will get to the red book, another red book broken promise.  I 
think back to the red book of 1997.  If we flip open that red 
book and look at page 6, “Securing our Future Together”, we see 
that the Liberals are making a promise:  “We will ensure that 
any future debate which calls into question the continuing 
existence or unity of Canada will be characterized by clarity and 
frankness”.  That is the promise the Liberal Party made when it 
went to the polls in 1997 after having governed the country since 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we want some clarity.  Today we want some frankness.  We 
have put forward the motion for the production of papers with 
regard to the Calgary declaration.  I am imploring the government 
for some clarity, for some frankness, and to make available those 
documents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had phone calls from the Privy Council Office and from 
the Department of Intergovernmental Affairs.  They have all told 
me that they have the documents.  If they have them, why will 
they not release them?  In its handwriting it is saying that it 
wants to see clarity and frankness with regard to the continuing 
existence or unity of the country.  Certainly the Calgary 
declaration falls within the mould. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They, by their own words, should produce those documents.  It is 
the taxpayers money.  The taxpayers have paid for these polls. 
They have paid for these surveys.  It was their money.  They are 
owed.  They deserve to have access to these things.  In order to 
do its job the official opposition deserves access to them. 
Because of the right to free speech the press has a right to 
access to them.  It should be able to do its job. It is not fair 
when the government does not live up to its words, conceals 
documents and lives by secrecy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will wrap up with the general pattern we have seen in this 
regard which I hope we do not see continued today.  It is the 
pattern of depriving the public of the documents and the 
wherewithal as to what went on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the protesters at APEC summit in Vancouver, we 
have seen secrecy, concealment and a disdain for democracy.  A 
number of times we saw closure in the House of Commons.  We are 
seeing a concealing of taxpayer funded documents.  It is wrong. 
We have nothing new under the sun.  They should come forward with 
these things.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul DeVillers (Simcoe North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I had a 
number of reasons for wanting to take part in this debate on the 
motion by the hon. member for Calgary West  This motion calls 
upon the government to lay before the House copies of all 
documents, reports, minutes of meetings and memos relating to 
the Calgary Declaration. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1125"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1125

<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although this steals somewhat from the thunder of the hon. 
member's speech, the government agrees to follow up on this 
Reform initiative and I am delighted with his interest in the 
Calgary Declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, I recall that on November 25, 1997 the members of the 
official opposition were the ones calling for a debate on the 
Calgary Declaration, and the motion making such debate necessary 
at that time had come from another Alberta MP, the one from 
Edmonton—Strathcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government has nothing to hide.  The Calgary Declaration 
grew out of the desire of nine provincial premiers and two 
territorial leaders to define a framework of discussion with 
Canadians to strengthen federation. 
Our government has always supported that initiative and today's 
motion gives it the opportunity to reiterate that support and to 
emphasize its merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The consultation process surrounding the Calgary Declaration was 
a transparent one.  Canadians were invited to take part.  The 
legislatures of those provinces where consultations were held 
adopted the declaration, and the reason behind the support it 
obtained throughout the country is that our fellow citizens 
identified with the values on which it is based. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration is based on seven principles that are 
completely in line with our government's national unity policy. 
It highlights our country's diversity.  It calls on Canadians' 
tolerance and generosity and reflects what we are, not only in 
our own eyes but in the eyes of the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary declaration is not a proposal for constitutional 
reform but a statement of principles that are shared by 
Canadians.  It highlights not only the things that differentiate 
us from one another but also the things that unite us and make us 
collectively stronger. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our government supports this message of unity, not because it is 
intended as a miracle solution to all the challenges facing our 
country, but because it clearly defines the values of the 
Canadian community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We did not wait to be urged by anyone to make unity the top 
priority of our government.  I would invite anyone who has 
forgotten this to reread the throne speech of September 23, 
1997, with its clear illustration of the path the Canadian 
government intends to take to lead its citizens toward the new 
millennium.  In a word, our government has showed leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Leadership can take many forms.  Let us not lose sight of the 
fact that unity is not merely a constitutional matter.  It must 
be reflected in all spheres of our life as a nation. 
Our approach is one based on efficiency emphasizing co-operation 
from the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our leadership and actions have created a climate favourable to 
Canadian unity. This does not mean, of course, that there is no 
room for improvement, but I think I can safely say that the 
conditions in this country are better today than they were when 
we came to office in the fall of 1993. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Indeed I would invite those who are skeptical to look at the 
figures that testify to our success in the financial and economic 
fields.  In only a few years we have managed to balance a budget 
that was running a huge deficit of $42 billion only five years 
ago.  That was a challenge that many people thought could not be 
overcome.  However, we took on the task with determination and 
the efforts made by all Canadians have been crowned with success. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My reason for bringing up our economic and financial success in 
this debate is simple. The Calgary Declaration carries a message 
of unity, but our government does not believe the unity of this 
country to be separate from other spheres of human activity. 
Instead, it pervades each of these spheres. It reminds Canadians 
of the levels of excellence they can aspire to achieve when 
there is a collective will behind their actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians may not fully realize this. However, there are many 
examples of our success at the international level, which show 
what can be achieved by working together toward a common goal. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to illustrate this with figures. 
Let us look at the economy.  Between 1994 and 1997 Canada's GDP 
grew by 2.9% a year on average, the strongest performance of the 
G-7, putting us in 14th place of the OECD countries.  Average 
annual employment growth was 1.8%, the best performance, on a par 
with the United States, of the G-7 countries and in ninth place 
among the OECD countries.

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD forecast that we will have the strongest economic 
growth of the G-7 countries for 1998 and 1999.  Canada's 
inflation rate has averaged 1.5% over the past five years, one of 
the lowest in the world. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not bad for a country which some claim does not work. 
As I said, the unity of a country as diversified as Canada does 
not rest solely in the hands of governments and institutions; it 
calls on the efforts and energy of everyone who believe in the 
future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's worth is not tied solely to its economic successes or 
its social safety net. It is more than a mere accounting 
operation. 
If that were the case, a downturn in monthly statistics would be 
enough to propel those advocating secession into action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is much more than that.  It is a country where men and 
women from all corners of the community of nations come together 
to achieve a shared ideal.  This ideal springs from values 
shared by Canadians in the various regions across the country 
and by Quebeckers.  The merit of the Calgary Declaration is that 
it draws these values out and reminds us that what joins us 
together is far greater than what separates us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I remind the sceptics of the results of a poll 
released in May 1998.  According to it, a substantial majority 
of the people in Quebec—67%—including a majority of those on 
the yes side—60%—supported the Calgary Declaration. 
In addition, 82% supported equality among Canadians, 57% 
favoured equality among the provinces and 61% stated that Canada 
offers diversity, tolerance, compassion and equal opportunity, 
among other things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Calgary Declaration is not the solution to all of Canada's 
challenges, but it does point out that it would be easier for us 
to meet our challenges as a united front.  It also underscores 
the heritage of values and principles we share in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was on this heritage that we built the successes we have 
enjoyed throughout our history, and, as the Calgary Declaration 
points out, we must continue to build on it in the future. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion I simply say that the government intends to 
comply. Inasmuch as we appreciated the opportunity to discuss the 
Calgary declaration once again in the House, we find it is a bit 
of a waste of the House's time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK6"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is now my 
turn to speak to Motion P-22 from the Reform Party, which asks 
that all documentation—including correspondence, documents, 
reports and minutes—relating to the Calgary Declaration be made 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the speeches, I also heard reference to polls and public 
opinion analysis.  At the time of the Charlottetown accord, the 
federal government spent millions and millions of dollars 
analyzing public opinion, and it is no doubt doing the same 
thing in this case.  We can assume that, behind all of this, a 
lot of money has been spent on assessing the impact on public 
opinion of this Calgary Declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, has anyone in this House recently heard about the 
Calgary Declaration? That document may be one of Canada's best 
kept secrets. They keep it in a drawer somewhere. They figure 
that, at times, they can use it to make Quebeckers believe that 
some other minor change will eventually take place. That 
document is so limited in scope that they are uncomfortable 
talking about it, because there is so little in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Simcoe North alluded to public opinion 
polls. If this is what they are going to lay before the House, 
then it is nothing new. That information is already available on 
the Internet site for the Calgary Declaration.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We wanted to look at the issue more thoroughly. We did not have 
much faith in the kind of Mickey Mouse polls sponsored by the 
government. Therefore, we had our own poll conducted by Léger & 
Léger in Quebec, and by Comquest outside the province. Of 
course, we were quick to release the findings of that poll in 
the spring, to show how Quebeckers and Canadians were 
appreciative of the Calgary Declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I could not remember all the figures, I brought the 
results of that poll here with me. The first finding was that no 
one knew about the Calgary Declaration. 
I will give the exact figures later, but that was when people 
were asked if they knew the Calgary Declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without getting into numbers, I remember a television report 
here in Ottawa—which is, after all, the national capital and a 
city where people follow politics rather closely. People on 
Sparks Street, not far from here, were polled and the results 
were broadcast on CBC or CTV. People were asked what they knew 
about the Calgary Declaration. It was lunch time, and there were 
probably many public servants around, since Sparks Street is so 
close to Parliament. Out of the seven or eight people 
interviewed at random, none knew what the Calgary Declaration 
was, or whether it was related to politics, sports or business. 
No one knew about it. Yet this was in Ottawa, the national 
capital, where the Liberals get all excited whenever this issue 
comes up. However, it generates very little interest on the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now come to the first question in our poll.  People were asked 
whether they thought Canada had made a new proposal to Quebec 
since the 1995 referendum. They were asked “Have there been any 
proposals?”, because the Calgary Declaration was supposed to 
have been a form of response to the last referendum in Quebec. 
When all regions of Canada are taken together, 25% of those 
polled said yes; 56% said no; and 19% said they did not know. 
One person in four, therefore, thought there had been some sort 
of offer.  No details were provided; one person in four thought 
that maybe something had been put on the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It gets even sadder when the Calgary Declaration is mentioned. 
People were asked if they had heard of the declaration, but they 
were not asked if they knew what it was.  One person out of 
three, or 33%, had heard of the Calgary Declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were then asked if they had a general idea of the content, 
even if they did not know the details.  This will be a big 
disappointment to those who think the public has any great 
interest in the declaration:  17% of those polled had heard it 
was something about the unique nature of Quebec; 6% had heard it 
was something about provincial equality; and 12% gave other 
answers.  But 70% of people had no idea what it was about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And now they tell us that a large number of people support the 
declaration.  I heard the parliamentary secretary tell us that 
people throughout Canada, including Quebec, support the Calgary 
declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> They would have to know what it was about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Pierre Brien:</B> Nobody knows what it is about. 
When they find out, I can guarantee you that they will not think 
much of it.  This is a initiative that never got off the ground; 
nobody talks about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People were then asked whether they thought that the Calgary 
Declaration would solve the problem of national unity.  We will 
now see whether they are as optimistic as our Liberal friends. 
Only 2% of people thought there was a very strong likelihood 
that it would solve the problem of national unity; 15% said they 
thought it was rather likely that it would solve the problem of 
national unity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A total of 17% of those polled said that it would perhaps solve 
the problem and 83% said it would solve nothing.  This is very 
revealing.  I could go on.  Several questions were asked and the 
poll results were made public at the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another question.  The members opposite misled us. 
They kept telling us that Canadians had been consulted, that 
they would be given an opportunity to express their views, that 
there were elaborate plans for a cross-country consultation. 
People were asked whether they had been consulted in any way. 
“Do you feel like you have been consulted on the Calgary 
Declaration?” It was a yes or no answer: 4% said yes, 94% said 
no and 2% did not know. The last two categories add up to a 
total of 96%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must remind members how this consultation process took place. 
In some instances, it was done at little publicized public 
meetings. Some of it was done through the Internet. Some of it 
was done though toll-free lines. It was done in a variety of 
ways, but every effort was made to keep the consultations 
secret. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the Calgary Declaration is a constitutional 
initiative that is going absolutely nowhere. If the government 
were really serious, it would talk about the fact that, during 
the summer, the provinces agreed on the social union concept and 
discussed priorities for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among other things, they agreed that the federal government 
should reinvest in our health system as a priority, with a well 
established mechanism that would require the agreement of a 
majority of the provinces for an initiative to be put in place. 
Moreover, if a province has its own program, it should be 
allowed to opt out. That kind of proposal is much more promising 
for a government that promotes co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the attitude of this government, starting with the Prime 
Minister? “If the premiers want to run Canada, they just have to 
run against me in the next election”. The last one who tried 
that ended up at the helm of the Liberal Party of Quebec where 
he is having a lot of problems. That is the tactic they used. It 
is a message. We have not forgotten and others will not forget 
either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us tackle serious issues. The government should focus 
its attention on responding to the provinces' unanimous 
consensus that it should put more money in our health system, 
allow them to administer that money, and invest in transfer 
payments instead of wasting its time on something that will lead 
nowhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People have not heard about it and I presume they do not want to 
hear about it anyway. This information can be made public, but 
it will be a total waste of time. However, it will help us find 
out how much money has been wasted so far on this constitutional 
circus that is turning out to be a very lucrative industry in 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am happy to pick up the debate in response to the motion of the 
hon. member for Calgary West.  He is one of the more interesting 
and promising of the new members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope he will allow me to say I had a feeling of disappointment 
that he offered a rather turgid complaint about a non-existent 
issue, access to documents.  He should have been uttering a 
celebration, Beethoven's Ode to Joy that a distinguished western 
provincial premier had opened the doors to the west to 
understanding of Quebec's distinct role in the Canadian federal 
system and the merits of seeking constitutional recognition or 
accommodation to that fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course one of the great virtues of the Calgary declaration is 
that it offered the opportunity for Canadians to understand that 
we are one country, that we are tolerant people and that people 
in the west, so far from having fear of Quebec and what it 
represents, wish accommodation and wish for a plural Canada and a 
federal system that reflects that. We are all doing our best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sat as a member of the commission of the premier of British 
Columbia to implement the Calgary declaration. We went around the 
province.  I can report that 80% of British Columbia voters saw 
nothing unusual, in fact everything to commend, in a 
comprehension that Quebec was indeed a distinct society within 
Canada and that the constitutional rules could and should 
recognize that fact.  Why not?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a coming of age in Canada and the debate, sometimes 
angry but for the most part I think educational, has helped us 
on.  Constitutional law is a dialectical process.  New principles 
evolve. They are developed to meet new societal facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wrote in 1979 that relatively minor constitutional adjustments 
on the part of English speaking Canada when the quiet revolution 
was still in its early phase would have enabled a containment and 
a utilization of Quebec's best constitutional drives in a new and 
renewed federal system.  I think this is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems of comprehension is related to the 
constitutional principle of equality before the law.  It rests, 
as the Greek philosophers themselves recognized centuries ago, on 
a notion that we treat equal things equally when there is a 
congruence of these societal facts underlying the positive law. 
Then the positive law must be applied in the same way. Where the 
societal facts are different they demand a differentiation of 
treatment and that is in itself a full recognition in the best 
spirit of the Greek philosophers of the principle of equality 
before the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been enunciated by the privy council in some of its 
better judgments on the Canadian Constitution.  It has been 
reaffirmed by the United States Supreme Court, Justice Douglas in 
particular, in examining the meaning of the constitutional 
principle of equality before the law which we have replicated in 
our own 1982 charter of rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Pepin Robarts commission to which I had the privilege of 
being chief adviser, along with Leon Dion, Dion Père, John 
Meisel, developed this rather complex phrase which I think was 
probably one of the reasons Prime Minister Trudeau buried it, 
asymmetrical federalism. If we get into phrases that are too 
technical people run away in fear, but all it was designed to 
show was where there are distinct societal facts, a good and 
subtle federal system will take account of those facts and make 
the changes accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope my friends in the Bloc will understand if I express a 
regret that the quiet revolution has not given birth to more 
bright, interesting ideas that transcend the issues of Quebec 
particularism.  It is a privilege to have undergone a quiet 
revolution. But there is an absence of refreshing new ideas from 
Quebec, and this has been true for 40 years since the quiet 
revolution began, on the relations, for example, of executive and 
legislative power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the principles of the judiciary, the nature of the 
constitutional legitimacy in relation to bodies such as the 
Senate, bodies such as the supreme court and the constitution of 
judges, Quebec could have helped us here. It is our hope that it 
was not a quid pro quo in British Columbia in saying yes, we are 
not afraid of distinct society, we recognize and accept that. But 
we would have hoped, for example, that there might have been some 
movement on Quebec's side to say in return we like the five 
regions too, we will give you that concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are things we could have done together and should have 
done together and can still do together.  It is for this reason 
that I welcome the motion of the member for Calgary West and in 
its full spirit, the celebration of the fact that the west 
understands Quebec.  The west wants to work with Quebec.  It is a 
sign of the times that premiers such as the premier of Alberta, 
so far from being politically weakened by such a move, can gain a 
new and augmented national stature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is the good thing that has come out of the 
constitutional debate and it is in that spirit that we will all 
work to renewing the federal system.  We can change a 
constitution by formal amendments.  We can change it by practice. 
There are so many areas, particularly in this area of executive 
legislative relations, on which many members on this side of the 
House have strong views.  Many of us would like to see the 
committees take on a new and dynamic role.  Why have these 
expensive royal commissions when parliament can do the job and 
where historically it has done it?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey (Chicoutimi, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, you may find 
that I am seated a bit too far, but we are not responsible for 
the situation. As you know, there was a byelection in the riding 
of Sherbrooke in which we lost a seat and we have come to terms 
with that. In fact, I want to congratulate the new hon. member 
of the Bloc Quebecois who will soon be joining us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not worry, our priorities are elsewhere. We do not intend to 
quarrel over this and you can be assured that our priorities 
will not be over the seating pattern of the House of Commons. We 
thought we had reached an interesting compromise, but we were 
told at the last minute that it would not fly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too many serious issues have our constituents concerned for us 
to start to quarrel over this. However, it is unfortunate that a 
whole party had to be displaced to reallocate one seat. It seems 
an extraordinary measure to take to make room for one newly 
elected member of Parliament from the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anyway, you may rest assured that we are still proud to be here, 
in the House of Commons, to stand for our constituents and also 
to represent the Progressive Conservative Party, which is the 
only national alternative to the government in office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this spirit, these days, we may be last, but you can be sure 
that one day we will be first. I think it is the right way to 
react to this massive displacement following the election of 
only one new member of Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now want to deal with the motion put forward by our hon. 
colleague from the Reform Party on the documentation related to 
the Calgary declaration. It is quite surprising to see that the 
motion today is put by a Reform member, at a time when the 
people have a whole different set of priorities. No one can be 
against a statement of principle, the Calgary declaration, that 
includes praiseworthy objectives. However, we should stop 
constantly coming back to this issue and wanting to make this 
debate a priority— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regularly go back to my riding. 
I have frequent opportunities to speak with my fellow citizens. 
The focus is on the priorities of concern to them, whether it be 
the development of business or of tourism, or the fact that the 
bulk of Quebeckers, and most other Canadians as well, have 
trouble obtaining quality health care.  No one ever refers to the 
Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that taking a frivolous approach to a debate like 
today's is tantamount to a lack of respect for our fellow 
citizens.  Such is my perception.  I must tell the House quite 
honestly that it is far removed from what our fellow citizens 
are concerned about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no objections to a party wanting to have complete 
documentation on a declaration that has been made.  Of course 
our party is in favour of that. 
But making this the object of a House of Commons debate proves 
just how far the Reform Party is prepared to go in stirring up 
things around the fact that by far the majority of our fellow 
citizens want to see constitutional peace.  We hear regularly 
from two-thirds of Quebeckers that constitutional debate is one 
of their lowest priorities.  I believe that we here in the House 
of Commons must show some responsibility and not keep coming 
back to this same debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a better way of casting some light on the debate and of 
affording people of good will in this country, and all of its 
governments, with the opportunity to reach agreements that will 
work in favour of the development of our communities.

<A HREF="#LINKT11"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That way is to not keep harking back to the constitutional 
issue, since our fellow citizens have asked us to take a 
breather on this.  I am not fully convinced about the real 
intentions of the Reform MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has often been said that what goes around comes around. 
Judging by the focus of their campaign advertising during the 
last election campaign, how can anyone take this motion before 
the House in good faith?  They say “We want the documentation 
relating to the Calgary declaration”.  Let them get it, read it 
over and over, go into it in detail.  They are out of touch with 
reality with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is serious though is that after running an advertising 
campaign that excluded seven million Canadians—that is all of 
Quebec—during the election campaign, they now come up with a 
motion such as the one before us. This shows a blatant disregard 
for the issues that our fellow citizens want us to tackle on 
their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party's intentions seem questionable to me. Members 
will remember Bill C-237, asking that the federal government be 
authorized to negotiate the terms of separation. We may regulate 
everything we want, but we will never manage to keep in the same 
room people who do not want to be together. Regulating the 
constitutional issue is the best way to destroy the country, to 
split it up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that Reformers want to pursue that avenue because it is a 
matter of survival for them. Reformers survive because of the 
splits between the various regions of the country. 
They survive in a very specific region because they make their 
fellow citizens believe that all other Canadians are against 
western Canada. I am convinced that all Canadians, including 
westerners, want constitutional peace, and the only way to 
achieve that peace is to stop making matters worse by tabling 
motions such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is adding fuel to the fire, as it did during 
the last election campaign and continues to do here in this 
House. It promotes division to ensure its own survival in the 
regions that it represents. Reformers have absolutely no 
national agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, regulating the constitutional issue is the best way to 
destroy the country. If such is the objective, then let them 
continue down that road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Among the issues that our fellow citizens want us to tackle is 
deciding what do to with an accumulated surplus of $20 billion, 
thanks to the excessive premiums imposed by the government. 
The government is about to make important decisions: should it 
lower taxes, reduce premiums or invest in specific areas? It is 
urgent that we begin a consultation process to find out what 
exactly our fellow citizens would like us to do with that 
surplus. These are the issues that people want us to tackle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is wrong for the Reform Party to keep going against people's 
will. I doubt there is a single Canadian, including in western 
Canada, who asked the Reform Party member to table a motion 
asking that we have access to all documents relating to the 
Calgary declaration. Westerners, like Quebeckers, like people in 
my riding of Chicoutimi, want us to tackle the issues that are 
of concern to them. These issues are employment, economic 
development, the creation of new businesses— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> This is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Harvey:</B> —and growing poverty. At a time when people are 
demonstrating and calling for a federal strategy against 
poverty, we are being asked to table documents relating to the 
Calgary Declaration. It is an outrage. As far as I am concerned, 
the Reformers should get all the papers they want to amuse 
themselves, but in the meantime, the Parliament of Canada should 
be dealing with more concrete issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me repeat that we are pleased to sit in this House, even on 
the back benches, and it is from these seats that we will do our 
work in a constructive manner.

remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I like to think that the Reform Party does not have a hidden 
agenda by this motion which would lead to a more divisive debate 
in this country than there has been already on the national unity 
issue. I would prefer to think that the member for Calgary West 
really does want to lead the way in getting better access to the 
type of government documents, federal and provincial, that 
members of parliament, the press and the public should have 
access to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would assume that he would not want to open up documents that 
might adversely affect federal-provincial relations.  He does not 
want to cause dissent.  He wants knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest to him that the problem he really ought to be 
addressing is the Access to Information Act. Currently under 
section 14 it rather broadly prevents the government from 
disclosing any type of documents relating to federal-provincial 
affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Access to Information Act were amended so that it was not 
so broad, so that so much was not restricted from public 
disclosure, so that in this particular section it was narrowed 
down that governments should only withhold information that would 
cause problems with federal-provincial relations, then his motion 
would have merit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest as it is currently framed the motion does strike 
with too broad a brush and has the potential of causing great 
damage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must give the federal government and the provincial 
governments an opportunity to debate divisive issues in privacy 
and perhaps give them a 30-year rule whereby these things should 
be reported.  Right now I really do think that what the member 
should be doing is looking to amendments to the Access to 
Information Act.  Then I think he would get exactly what he 
wishes.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, eleven months ago I came before the House 
to seek its approval to extend for one year the lending 
authority under the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said at the time that this extension would allow us to 
complete a comprehensive program and policy review that was 
under way at that time. It would allow for thorough consultation 
with both private and public sector stakeholders.  And that it 
would allow us to consider the auditor general's 
recommendations.

First, our analysis found that the program is fundamentally 
sound.  It has proven itself for 37 years.  Our consultations 
with public and private sector stakeholders showed that small 
business believes this program works.  Our research supports the 
soundness of the program's current structure.  Our analysis 
indicates we are on course toward the cost recovery goal.

The recent and quite unexpected volatility in currency and 
trading markets that we have all witnessed, confirms, again, the 
importance of sound, consistent public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small business, which is especially vulnerable to the vagaries 
of economic gyrations, needs stability.  It needs this even more 
so at a time when the country is about to enter into a vigorous 
debate on the role and structure of its financial services 
industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House can go a long way to help establish a climate of 
stability for small business by giving its approval to Bill C-53, 
the Canada Small Business Financing Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Decisions related to the recommendations of the Mackay Task 
Force and the proposed bank mergers will have a direct bearing 
on the well-being of small business, which is the source of 
economic and job growth in every region of the country.

to adapt itself to the impact of electronic banking, E-commerce, 
the Internet and other new technologies that are reshaping the 
way business is conducted. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses continue to identify the lack of access to 
appropriate credit as an impediment to their growth.  I think 
hon. members will agree that it is essential for us to ensure a 
measure of stability by continuing the one program which is 
available to all legitimate for-profit small businesses wherever 
they are located in Canada.  Small and medium size businesses are 
an anchor for our national economy.  In fact they make a crucial 
contribution to our collective economic well-being.  This is one 
reason support for the bill before us is important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are more than 2.5 million small businesses, including 
self-employed individuals across Canada.  These account for 99% 
of all Canadian businesses.  Together they have generated 70% to 
80% of all new jobs in Canada over the last three years. 
Businesses with 100 employees or less account for 50% of all 
private sector employment and 43% of gross domestic product.  It 
is a sector of the economy that continues to grow. Growth in the 
small business debt financing market outpaced that of the total 
business market, increasing by 20% between 1994 and 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the increase in available capital and the increase in 
lending, access to credit continues to be identified by 
entrepreneurs as a significant barrier to the growth of small 
businesses.  This is precisely why we are asking the House to 
approve the Canada small business financing act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the small business financing program is to 
facilitate the availability of loans for the establishment, 
expansion, modernization and improvement of small business 
enterprises.

up to 10 years.  Business will be able to borrow up to $250,000.

are excluded from the current program.  Parliament has 
established a sister program entitled the Farm Improvement and 
Marketing Co-operatives Loans Act to facilitate farmers' access 
to credit. I note also that the bill proposes the design and 
implementation of a pilot program for lending to the voluntary 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today provides a step forward in streamlining 
the Small Business Loans Act.  We expect that this will make it 
easier for the loans officers in the 13,000 points of service to 
understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While all the key provisions of the act are contained in the 
bill, most of the detailed administrative provisions will be in 
the regulations.  This means that all major control levers remain 
in the act while the regulatory regime provides a more complete 
guide to program implementation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now outline for the House the key provisions contained in 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would provide authority for the Department of Industry 
to conduct audits to ensure compliance with the act and 
regulations.  It would provide authority to create a limited 
pilot program on a cost recovery basis for capital leasing.  It 
would also provide authority to create a limited pilot program on 
a cost recovery basis extending lending to the voluntary sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also proposing to replace the current sunset clause.  Every 
five years Industry Canada will conduct a comprehensive review of 
the program using an evaluation framework and performance 
measurements.  The resulting report on the program's performance, 
effectiveness, financial viability and progress toward cost 
recovery would be tabled in parliament and referred to committee 
for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a means of maintaining and ensuring cost recovery, the 
governor in council through regulation would have the power to 
restrict eligibility criteria for access to program loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crown's contingent liability under the program would be 
capped at $1.5 billion over five years.  This means that 
regardless of the dollar value of the loans made under the act, 
taxpayers would never have to cover more than $1.5 billion on 
loans made in that period.  That $1.5 billion payout would only 
happen if all loans were to default, all of them, which is a 
rather unlikely prospect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the rate of loan losses has been 5.8% meaning that 
over 94% of all loans have been repaid without incident.  This 
contingent liability would automatically be renewed every five 
years.  This will permit lending to continue while parliament 
considers the comprehensive review.  I will explain briefly the 
rationale and thinking behind these provisions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill proposes the creation of two pilot projects designed 
to be financially self-sufficient.  Hon. members should know that 
I intend to call upon their advice, through the Standing 
Committee on Industry, when the regulations and the parameters 
of the pilot projects are being drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only kind of financing which currently enjoys the 
government's risk sharing is asset-based lending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Capital leasing is a rapidly growing form of small and medium 
sized business financing. 
Some hon. members and the leasing industry have pressed for its 
inclusion under the program.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leasing industry says it 
generally does not provide financing to firms less than two 
years old or those seeking amounts less $100,000.  A major 
portion of current SBLA clients fall into these categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why authority to design a capital leasing pilot program 
is included in the bill.  It would test the need to fill an 
apparent but, as yet, unproven gap.  As I have indicated before, 
it would have to be independently self-sufficient in terms of 
meeting its cost of claims. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The voluntary sector plays an increasingly important role in 
Canada.  Consistent with our previous commitments, Industry 
Canada consulted members of the voluntary sector to determine 
whether the CSBFA program should be extended to this sector. Some 
indicated that extending the program would make a real difference 
to a voluntary group's ability to serve its community. A proposed 
pilot would test this view and it would also be designed to be 
self-sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An item that we had to reject was the suggestion that the 
program be used to provide access to working capital.  The 
program already indirectly facilitates access to working capital 
through a 90% financing rate on fixed assets.  This is higher 
than conventional lending.  This provision leaves a greater 
portion of small business equity available to finance working 
capital.  During our consultations stakeholders said that they 
did not see the program as an appropriate way to meet their 
working capital needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sunset clause that called for the program to come to an end 
after specific periods of time created undue and really quite 
unnecessary anxiety for both lenders and borrowers.  It has also 
led to situations where the House has been asked to provide 
legislative authority while facing a tight deadline.  This has 
constrained parliamentary consideration.  Further, it is not a 
businesslike way to manage a program which is badly needed by 
small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the new provisions parliament will have the opportunity to 
review the program's effectiveness every five years.  Currently 
all major control elements of the program are found in the act. 
The proposals contained in the bill, if approved by parliament, 
would change this authority so that the governor in council would 
have authority to make regulations to restrict access to the 
program to ensure that it remains on a cost recovery track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This power is restrictive only.  Should a future administration 
wish to make changes similar to those made in 1993, for example, 
it would need to seek parliamentary approval for them.  This 
protects the control of the House over appropriations while 
ensuring that action can be taken in a timely fashion to mitigate 
taxpayers' risks under the small business financing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also proposes a number of measures which may reduce the 
level of program losses, thereby lowering default and claims on 
the program. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this year, Parliament set the program's total lending 
ceiling at $15 billion for the period April 1, 1998 to March 31, 
1999.  Traditionally, the lending ceiling has been used to 
control the size of the program.  This has led to confusion.  It 
has led to the mistaken belief that taxpayers are lending the 
entire $15 billion.  This is simply not the case.  Lenders are 
lending money they raise themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taxpayer liability has always been much less than the aggregate 
lending ceiling.  This is because of the formula which is used 
to cap the limit on claims that the government must pay in the 
event of default. 
The new bill maintains this formula, but eliminates the 
artificial and confusing aggregate lending ceiling. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make the government's and the taxpayers' liability absolutely 
clear, we are capping the contingent liability at $1.5 billion 
for each five year period.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. members should understand that program costs have never 
come close to this contingent liability and that these costs are 
now offset by revenues on loans that have been made under the 
program since 1995.  I would also like to point out that this 
contingent liability allows the program to continue guaranteeing 
lending of approximately $2 billion a year, which is the current 
yearly average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the government set the program on a cost recovery track. 
A private sector analysis of the program indicates that on loans 
made since 1995 the program is in fact on track.  However this 
analysis has also shown that the program is extraordinarily 
sensitive to changing program parameters and may be affected by 
other economic conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many factors that affect the performance of the 
program.  Industry Canada will therefore continue to monitor the 
program very closely. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To conclude, Mr. Speaker, allow me to remind the House, once 
again, how critically important the proposed CSBFA is. Created 
in 1961, its overall record is one of great success.  Its 
results demonstrate the need to make it a stable, long-term 
instrument of our economic policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year, it provided access to nearly $2 billion in financing. 
This means that close to 30,000 firms across the country, in 
all regions, got necessary financing that they might not have 
had access to otherwise.  Some 9,000 of these firms were in 
rural communities. 
The majority of loans, averaging nearly $68,000, went to firms 
less than three years old. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success rate of the program is quite high.  Defaults have 
fluctuated periodically and we anticipate a rise for a period. 
The fact is that the loss rate on loans have been on average 5.6% 
over the 37 year life of the SBLA program.  Private sector 
forecasts suggest the current fee structure is expected to offset 
the claims costs of the program on loans made since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program which parliament is being asked to approve does not 
represent a subsidy to small business therefore, or to the banks 
or other lenders.  As currently structured the program shares the 
risk of lending among lenders, borrowers and taxpayers.  Loan 
losses now guaranteed under the program are expected to be fully 
cost recovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CSBFA will continue to offer a way for the government, 
financial institutions and small business borrowers to share the 
risks of fixed asset based lending to smaller, younger firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In providing this risk pooling the Canada Small Business 
Financing Act will support one of the most dynamic growth sectors 
in the Canadian economy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned earlier, an important contribution that we can 
make at this time for this sector is to provide it with 
stability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This stability is provided through the bill, which will continue 
to provide the small business community access to financing, 
even as the finance services industry continues to restructure. 
Maintaining the major program elements provides a stable base of 
financing for small business, while institutions and their 
product lines are under review. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Measures are contained in the bill which will maintain the 
program on a cost recovery track.  This contributes to its 
stability, ensuring taxpayers long term support for this 
important risk sharing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eliminating the aggregate lending ceiling will also enhance the 
stability of the program.  It will reduce the periodic 
uncertainty which has plagued the program in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time we have approached this artificial ceiling we have 
been required to return to parliament for an increase.  The 
proposed cap on the contingent liability provides a real cap on 
our liability but does so in such a way that will not 
unnecessarily take up the time of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By eliminating this periodic uncertainty we will enhance 
borrowers' confidence that the program will be there in the 
future to facilitate financing for at least a period of five 
years.  Stability will be enhanced by eliminating the sunset 
clause and replacing it with a regular review during which 
lending will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past this provision has created uncertainty about the 
future of the program.  It has also constrained parliamentary 
consideration of the program in the past. 
This proposal will eliminate these features while still allowing 
for appropriate parliamentary reviews.

Small Business Loans act expires on March 31, 1999.  The 
authority under the current bill would commence April 1, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the many strengths of this program is that it is 
delivered by lending professionals, not bureaucrats.  This, 
however, means that the more than 1,500 financial institutions 
must have the time they need to train their staff on the new 
legislation and regulations. With over 13,000 points of service, 
this is no small task. 
This is why lenders have asked for 90 days to prepare themselves 
to implement the legislation.  While this may reduce the time 
for parliamentary consideration, I believe that effective 
implementation to serve Canada's small business community is 
important. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>]

of bill as soon as possible. 
<P><A NAME="LINK14"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
according to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business and 
the auditor general, access to reasonable financing is the single 
biggest impediment to growth in the small business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can be done?  What is the role of government?  The first 
thing that should be done is to determine whether there is a 
legitimate market failure.  In that regard the performance of the 
government is abysmal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done to quantify the degree to which 
access to financing for small business is a problem?  How 
extensively has the government reviewed the performance of 
Canadian banks in this regard? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of answering these questions, instead of being proactive 
and demonstrating leadership, what do we see from the Liberal 
government?  We see it tinkering with yet another fundamentally 
flawed government program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact the government has not quantified the problem 
of access to financing for small business, we can safely assume 
that a problem exists.  Improved access to financing for small 
business would clearly have a beneficial effect on the economy: 
lower unemployment, more disposable income and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we achieve this?  What are the impediments that need to 
be removed in order to alleviate the underlying problems which 
truly inhibit the growth of small business?  They are excessive 
employment insurance premiums, high levels of taxation and a 
banking system which lacks competition.  They are not a lack of 
government programs or a bureaucracy that is too small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the Liberal government do?  Instead of lowering 
employment insurance premiums, instead of cutting taxes, instead 
of deregulating the banking industry to increase competition 
which would benefit all consumers and instead of taking those 
measures that would clearly have a direct and immediate benefit 
on every small business owner in Canada, the government is 
preoccupied with changing the name of the Small Business Loans 
Act to the the Canada Small Business Financing Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What insight, what vision, what incredible leadership it has 
demonstrated by changing the name of the program.  In terms of 
positive change for small business, the legislation is no more 
significant than a dot over the letter <I>i</I> in the word 
stupid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental flaw with the Liberal government is that it does 
not understand one of the most basic concepts of governing: a 
dollar left in the hands of a consumer, an investor, an 
entrepreneur or taxpayer is more productive than that same dollar 
in the hands of a lobbyist, a bureaucrat or a politician.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the answer is not a government program that taxes 
Canadians, then runs our money through an inefficient bureaucracy 
and then selectively redistributes it.  That creates an uneven 
playing field.  It chooses winners over losers.  Inevitably 
mistakes are made.  Businesses acquire financing which is not 
viable and they would not have acquired the financing had the 
government and taxpayers not subsidized them.  The net effect to 
small business in Canada is a negative one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how it can justify its concept of these programs. 
It can tax people, run it through the bureaucracy and then 
somehow have a more beneficial effect with that money than if it 
had just left it in the pockets of Canadian business owners and 
taxpayers.  How it can claim that degree of interference in our 
economy can possibly have a positive effect is beyond me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry started in his speech to introduce the 
new Canada small business financing act by talking about long 
term life and viability of the program.  Notice that he is more 
concerned with jobs of the bureaucrats who work and who 
administer the program than he is with the small business owners 
of Canada.  He also said that the program is fundamentally sound 
and that it has proven itself for 37 years.  Did the minister not 
read the report of the auditor general?  It was a report that 
prompted him to change the name of the program.  I suggest he 
probably did read it but he is clearly prepared to ignore some of 
the conclusions we must draw from the deficiencies and the 
problems which were cited by the auditor general and the degree 
to which banks are abusing this program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am a perfect example of that.  Prior to entering politics I 
had several businesses.  On opening one of them I went to a bank 
for financing.  The bank said yes but I had to acquire my 
financing under the Small Business Loans Act.  At the time I was 
not apprised of the criticisms that the auditor general had for 
the program.  I was not that conscious of how disastrous and what 
the negative effects of programs like this had on small business 
owners like me.  I was more concerned with meeting the day to day 
demands of my business.  So I agreed to it.  I was forced to pay 
a premium on my interest rate charges.  I was forced to pay 
registration fees.  I was forced to endure even more burden 
because the government made available to the banks a tool by 
which they could guarantee themselves the loan at a cost to the 
small business owner and at a potential cost the Canadian 
taxpayer.  The banks are abusing their privilege or their ability 
to use this program, guaranteeing loans that they would have in 
most cases given out anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said the volatility we have seen recently in the 
marketplace shows we need stability.  Therefore now would not be 
the time to implement any drastic policy change of the 
government. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would suggest just the opposite.  Would the 
volatility in the marketplace not suggest to the minister that 
the program is not fundamentally sound, as he said, but that it 
is fundamentally flawed?  How can the government sleep walk 
through the currency crisis that we have endured in this country 
over the past couple of months and that it not occur to it that 
maintaining the status quo is exactly the problem that got us 
into this mess in the first place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister also went on in some detail to quote some 
statistics about how many small business owners there are in 
Canada and how much small business contributes to our economy. It 
is good that he understands and recognizes the importance of 
small business.  However, what I do not understand is why he 
would not be trying to support business.  Why is he tinkering 
with a fundamentally flawed program when the government should be 
reducing employment insurance premiums? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would have a greater effect on every small business owner 
in Canada, not just the ones who apply for a guarantee of their 
loan under this program?  Every small business in Canada would 
benefit by a reduction in the employment insurance premiums to a 
much greater degree than any bureaucratic program administered 
from Ottawa could possibly hope to achieve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the GST?  Why is the minister preoccupied with 
changing the name of the Small Business Loans Act instead of 
eliminating the GST which this government once promised?  It once 
said that it would scrap, eliminate and abolish the GST.  The GST 
is probably the single largest burden on small business owners. 
The amount of paperwork that a small business owner must deal 
with, effectively acting as a tax collector for the government, 
is preposterous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the minister were really concerned about small business he 
would be targeting those kinds of things, not trying to 
rejuvenate a fundamentally flawed program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about deregulating the banks?  If access to financing is 
indeed a problem for small business, why is the government not 
addressing that issue.  Rather than solving the problem, the 
government is trying to deal with it by coming up with another 
government program.  Its answer is not to fix the problem but to 
create a government program that will in the end cost taxpayers 
even more money to try to paper over the real problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about cutting taxes?  This government has implemented 37 
tax increases since it came to power.  It is choking the life out 
of ordinary average Canadians who face a tax burden that is 
difficult to meet.  Why?  So it can fund all its programs like 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister mentioned that this does not apply to farmers in 
Canada but there is another program for farmers.  Again this is a 
clear illustration that the government's answer is just to create 
more bureaucracy and more government programs because it does not 
understand the simple concept that it cannot possibly tax 
Canadians, send that money to Ottawa, run it through the 
inefficient bureaucracy that everybody knows exists here and come 
out with a more positive impact than if it had just left that 
money in the hands of Canadians in the first place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the minister discussed was the registration fee of 
2% to qualify for a loan under this program and a 1.25% annual 
administration fee.  Does he not understand the extra burden that 
would place on a business that is already considered marginal in 
the first place? 
In theory this program is supposed to provide access to capital 
that would not otherwise be there, access to financing that small 
business owners could not normally get.  The banks would look at 
it, evaluate it and say this is not viable, you cannot meet the 
interest payments.  What is the answer?  The taxpayer is going to 
subsidize the loan and they are going to pay even higher interest 
rates.  Does the minister not understand that the viability of 
that business has now decreased even further, the chance of that 
being a successful venture?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said that some of the changes he has implemented 
are a step forward in streamlining the Small Business Loans Act. 
That may be true.  When we compare the old SBLA to the new CSBFA 
it may be that he has tinkered and improve some deficiencies. But 
what has that accomplished? What is the point in tinkering and 
improving an act that is bad, that in the end is harmful to 
business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the tinkering things that the minister has implemented is 
to replace the sunset clause with a regular review.  I would like 
to suggest that the sunset clause remain and that it be dated 
September 28, 1998, today's date, and that the sunset clause not 
only apply to this legislation but to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 does not deal with the underlying barriers to growth 
of small business in Canada such as excessive employment 
insurance premiums, high tax levels and a highly regulated 
banking system.  Further, it does not fix the problem of small 
business access to reasonable financing which both the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business and the auditor general note 
is the single biggest impediment to growth in that sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I initially was going to move a motion which stated that this 
House decline to give second reading to Bill C-53 at this time 
because the government of the day has done nothing to alleviate 
the underlying problems which truly inhibit the growth of small 
business such as excessive employment insurance premiums, high 
levels of taxation and a banking system which lacks competition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am informed that for technical reasons I have had to 
change the wording.  Therefore I move: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the 
word “That” and substituting the following: 
</UL><UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53, an act to increase the availability of financing for 
the establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of 
small businesses, be not now read a second time but that the 
order be discharged, the bill withdrawn and the subject matter 
thereof referred to the Standing Committee on Industry.

<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, while we in 
the Bloc Quebecois are extremely disappointed with this so-called 
review of the small business loans legislation, we do not agree 
with the Reform Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must realize how essential the Small Business Loans Act is to 
small and medium size businesses, despite what I heard. Our 
criticism of the legislation was not to say we should get rid of 
it but that, in reviewing it, greater care and attention should 
be paid to small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed that, while the legitimate concerns expressed 
by the auditor general and the Standing Committee on Public 
Account were taken into account, the need to assess the economic 
impact of small business and of the effect of small business 
loans on this economic impact were not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The truth is that, in Canada and Quebec, small and medium size 
businesses are crucial and that, even if they sometimes fold 12, 
24 or 48 months after having been set up, the economic activity 
resulting from the creation and growth of small businesses 
constitutes an extremely important factor. Studies have 
confirmed this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in the government's logic, the economic contribution of 
small business is not taken into account. I find it unfortunate 
that, if he did not wish to amend the act immediately, the 
minister did not see fit to increase the number of areas where 
pilot projects could be conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the possibility of granting loans, in certain 
circumstances, for working capital funds has been eliminated. In 
light of the fact that the studies I have come across were not 
conclusive, why not look at the actual impact of inadequate 
funding on the death of small businesses? Why not consider 
growth problems on the basis of inadequate funding? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One could say that, in a way, insufficient funding is worse than 
no funding because it does not allow businesses to develop as 
well as they could. The same is true of seed money: not giving 
enough is increasing the chances the business will not survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Loans are not all that is required for businesses to develop. 
Indeed, improvements are also required with respect to 
management practices and to the advice provided to businesses. 
As they are established or expanding, they must indeed be 
encouraged to visit the financial institutions before they spend 
all the money they had for their products, design, etc. and find 
themselves broke before the money lenders and thus forced to 
accept insufficient funding.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is true, conditions of management in the growth and expansion 
of businesses must be improved, but my argument is in favour of 
adequate funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, I question the title the minister gave to his 
new bill.  He is calling it the Canada Small Business Financing 
Act.  I say it is not the funding act, because with a bill like 
this one, I know of few emerging or expanding businesses that 
will not need other financing.  I think the title of the 
existing act is much more accurate.  It is the Small Business 
Loans Act.  This is one sort of loan. 
There will have to be other types of funding to enable 
businesses to start up in the proper conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must point out in passing that the minister is pleased to add 
the word Canada to the bill's title.  I realize his attachment 
to Canada, but I think that there is no need for the government 
to add the word Canada to every program it sets up, as if it 
feared that Quebeckers and Canadians might forget.  The effect 
will be quite the opposite, and that is the end of my 
digression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains a number of problems in its 
administration cleanup aspect.  I hope the minister will deal 
with these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when the minister says in his bill that Canadians 
will give out a maximum of $1.5 billion in loans, he is in fact 
not saying everything, because this $1.5 billion should be 
called, in jargon, a contingent liability limit.  In reality, 
given the costs the small businesses pay and the rates above 
prime, the costs of this program could reach 6.4% without 
costing the government's budget one cent.  However, the problem 
is that this $1.5 billion margin may prevent, in fact does 
prevent, all the credit that might otherwise be given out from 
being given out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that the minister has given 
himself increased powers in this bill.  The technical provisions 
in the act have been withdrawn, and the minister will be able to 
make the regulations he wishes. 
I agree that part of the regulations needed to be updated. 
However, the deletion of all of these provisions seems to me to 
be a major problem, especially since, as the officials in his 
department have acknowledged, the minister will now have the 
regulatory authority to reduce the scope of the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the regulations cannot go further than the 
legislation itself; that is normal. But by giving the minister 
the authority to make regulations and then by deleting these 
provisions from the bill, you allow him to ensure that the new 
legislation is not as generous as the current one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the bill authorizes the minister to launch pilot projects. 
In fact, the minister has already announced two such initiatives 
in very specific areas. I think we could and should have pilot 
projects in other areas.

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it may be helpful for people interested in capital 
leases and loans to the voluntary sector, I do not think the new 
spirit of the legislation can be found in these provisions. In 
fact, the only good news borrowers will find in this bill is 
that the small business loans program, where the loans are to 
some degree guaranteed by the government, is maintained. That is 
the only piece of good news. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rest of the bill raises fears that once the banks realize 
that government officials will now be able to assess their use 
of the programs, they will start to ask a lot more from 
borrowers, who unfortunately will go bankrupt. 
Since the government will not cover more than two years of 
interest, the banks will be forced to repatriate personal assets 
more rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course, the principle of self-financing is nowhere to be found 
in the bill.  This could be seen as a means of allowing the 
minister to factor in the conditions of the economic cycle.  But 
because the bill does not specify current conditions, and it is 
left to the minister to make regulations, we are left with some 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, however, say that the fact that funding does not have to 
be approved every year, but runs for five years subject to a 
comprehensive review, meets with our approval.  There will thus 
not be worries about the program coming to an end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have questions, however, about the comprehensive review. 
It should be conducted by a House committee, in this case, the 
Standing Committee on Industry, and it should look at the cost 
benefits from a budgetary as well as an economic point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has perhaps not been brought home often enough is that it 
is much better for an enterprise to be created, even with 
difficulty, and to employ X number of people for a few years, to 
generate wealth in the community, and not just wealth but 
economic activity as well, even if it unfortunately goes 
bankrupt two years later for lack of sufficient expertise.  This 
is infinitely preferable to the entrepreneur just working for 
himself. 
As often happens, he might recover and get back on his feet 
without the right advice at the right time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But, for the economy in general, for the economy of a particular 
region, it is far better for such economic activity to have 
taken place than for people to continue receiving the normal and 
necessary support of social programs, which would serve a much 
better purpose if these people could contribute themselves to 
greater economic activity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite what certain economists thought less than one year ago, 
it would be very surprising if recessions had disappeared from 
the economic world, and I can now say that they clearly have 
not. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the contrary, many of the people claiming a year ago, more 
than ever, that there would not be a recession are now the ones 
bringing up the spectre of a world-wide recession.  Although the 
crises being experienced in Southeast Asia, Russia and South 
America do not all have the same cause, nevertheless the 
globalization of markets can provide conditions for such a 
spread.  As we know, Canada is not immune, nor are the United 
States or Europe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those in the west are well aware of the heavy impact there  of 
the great difficulties being experienced by individuals and 
businesses in Southeast Asia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the circumstances, the Small Business Loans Act ought to 
have sufficient flexibility to allow the minister to inject more 
money into business loans in times of recession, particularly 
since we know this $1.5 billion figure for guarantees will never 
come close to being reached.  I invite my Reform colleagues to 
examine this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that the revision has been done merely from an 
accounting point of view.  It was necessary, but the Small 
Business Loans Act—which is what I would prefer it to still be 
called, because once again it will not be a “financing act” for 
small businesses since this program is insufficient—is an 
important piece of legislation,  but far from sufficient.  One 
need only re-examine the repeated complaints from the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business to know that this is so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more small businesses are denied credit, as they set up or 
expand, the greater the risk they face.  We know how frequently 
they go bankrupt and at times it is very clearly because of a 
lack of credit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what forces the provinces, and especially Quebec, in 
both the private and public sectors, to develop complementary 
programs.  Once again, according to what I hear from the small 
and medium size businesses that, in search of help, turn to 
their member of Parliament as a last resort, there is not enough 
money for unsecured loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And what about the fact that there is no provision for 
businesses in the knowledge sector?  The government makes a big 
fuss about the knowledge economy.  The knowledge economy needs a 
lot of capital. 
The only thing the government has done was to announce in the 
spring that $30 million would be available over five years for 
products, for content.  That is not nearly enough.  Canada has 
expended considerable effort on infrastructure and on electronic 
highways, but, in the area of content, there is no help for 
local artists, artisans and industrialists and no provision for 
these areas in this revision to the Small Business Loans Act.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore unfortunate that the old SBLA was not tightened 
up more and that the government felt only an accounting review 
was necessary without a thought to economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This act is vital to economic development and to job creation. 
It must serve this objective.  When it fails to do so clearly, 
it fails in its primary goal, and we will continue to go after 
the government on this point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, Thompson and Highland Valleys, 
NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a delight to have the opportunity to 
represent the federal New Democrats and to make some opening 
remarks with respect to Bill C-53, the Canada Small Business 
Financing Act.  This is a new form of the old SBLA, the Small 
Business Loans Act, that we have been debating in this House for 
20-some years, or perhaps even a bit longer than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to have a chance to participate in this debate 
for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that I have 
recently been appointed by the leader of our party to be the 
business spokesperson for the federal New Democrats. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been, in a sense, lobbying for this for quite some time 
and I have often asked myself why I felt this was important. Then 
I realized that one of the reasons is that most people I know 
today are either in some kind of business, have been in business 
or plan to be in some form of business.  They tend to be small 
businesses, small enterprises, young firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started to think about this and realized that one of my senior 
staff persons on Parliament Hill has been with me since the 
beginning, more than 18 years.  Her partner runs a small 
contracting business in the city of Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partner of one of my other staff members who has been with 
me for 14 years also runs a small consulting business in Ottawa, 
working for the private sector as well as government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The father of the newest addition to my staff, a young man 
recently out of Queen's University, has run a large cement 
contracting business in my constituency for many years.  Once he 
leaves Parliament Hill, he and his partner plan to open a 
printing firm in Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the people around me are used to the notion of working 
with business on a personal level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I started to reflect on the people who play a close role in 
our lives, our campaign workers, our campaign teams, the 
executives of our organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The president of my federal executive is an interesting man.  He 
is a member of the carpenter's union, but he also runs a 
construction company.   When he is unable to find work as a 
carpenter, he goes out and does small enterprise work for 
individuals, various firms and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My last campaign chair was a retired manager of B.C. Tel.  He 
runs a honey-producing business these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reflected back on some of the people over the years who played 
key roles in my campaigns.  My sign chair was the owner and 
manager of a retail postal outlet and the publisher of a magazine 
in British Columbia.  The deputy sign chair in my campaign now 
runs a fairly large contracting business in the construction 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The media chair was an individual who owns and manages a 
community newspaper.  The deputy media chair in my last campaign 
owns a media consulting firm and has done that successfully for a 
number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fundraisers tended to have a relationship with business. One was 
a partner in a large law firm.  One was the owner-manager of a 
health food store.  One ran an insurance company.  One was the 
owner-manager of a recreational vehicle outlet.  One was the 
owner-manager of a restaurant and pub.  There were others, but 
these were people who played a central role in my election 
campaign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The campaign advisers were interesting.  They included a person 
who owns and manages a hunting and fishing lodge in central 
British Columbia.  Another was a pub manager-owner.  Another was 
the owner and operator of a bowling alley and trophy shop. 
Another individual was a financial adviser.  He runs a private 
business as a financial adviser.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canvass organizers included a person who owns a trucking 
company.  Another is the owner-manager of a small retail outlet 
which sells children's wares, toys and that sort of thing.  One 
owns an electric contracting company.  One runs a recreational 
vehicle outlet.  One is an owner-operator of a hair salon. 
Another is a manager of a body shop.  One person runs a tour 
company.  One owns and runs a mining exploration company.  A 
number are in the silviculture business and many are small 
farmers and ranchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are just under 300,000 farmers and ranchers in Canada and 
a good percentage of those individuals have incorporated 
businesses.  I think it is fair to say that farmers now, almost 
by definition, have become business operators because of the 
complexity of the art and science of farming these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we often refer to people as being a rancher or a farmer, 
in essence they are running a small business, often incorporated 
for a whole variety of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I made soundings in terms of this legislation being 
proposed by the federal government it was not difficult to get 
reaction from people.  Many of them have used the program in the 
past.  Many of them wanted to use the program but were not 
eligible.  Particularly interesting were the number of women 
entrepreneurs who have started businesses and have had a 
difficult time accessing various types of financing.  They often 
referred to the frustration they have experienced with their 
bankers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say first that, in my judgment, this has been one of 
the better federal government programs in terms of actually 
helping small business.  There is a great deal of rhetoric in 
this House, and probably in legislatures across the country, 
announcing programs that are designed to assist the small 
business sector, but they often do not seem to go anywhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There might be a program, but after two weeks the funding is all 
used up.  It is on paper, but I think there is very little 
assistance to the small business sector when it comes to 
government programs.  I am not even certain that the small 
business sector often wants government programs to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer specifically in our area to the community futures 
program which has done an amazingly positive job in creating 
hundreds and hundreds of small businesses that otherwise would 
not have been created simply because they were able to access 
capital up to a maximum of $75,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about people who want to create enterprises in 
this country and create jobs.  I think all of us feel that there 
is an important goal for our country, and that is the goal of 
full employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ideally, if everyone was working at a decent job, a whole lot of 
problems that we face as a country would simply evaporate 
overnight.  A lot of societal problems exist because people do 
not have jobs.  Or if they do have a job, it is not a 
decent paying job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about creating employment for Canadians we 
have to acknowledge that most of the employment that is being 
created today and certainly most of the employment that will be 
created in the next number of years is going to be created by the 
small and medium size business sector of the country.  These are 
the people who will actually create the jobs.  They will be able 
to move rapidly to take advantage of changing markets and 
changing opportunities, whereas the larger firms simply will not 
be able to respond so quickly and so well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that it is our obligation to find ways and means 
to support, encourage and nurture that sector of our society in 
which jobs will be created in the next decade or two if we hope 
to bring this country to the level that we know it ought to be in 
terms of full employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say that the SBLA, the Small Business Loans Act, which we 
are about to change, has probably been one of the most effective 
programs we have seen.  It certainly is one of the most used 
federal programs in assisting business, and it is well 
understood. For those reasons I think we ought to be careful as 
we proceed with this new legislation called the Canada Small 
Business Financing Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say that federal New Democrats support this 
legislation in principle.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some serious concerns, which I will get to.  We 
particularly want to see it advanced at this stage for three 
reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is that it is a continuation of a program that has been 
relatively effective compared to other federal programs.  It has 
been constant in its purpose as a program to assist young and 
small firms in obtaining debt capital because of gaps in equity 
and capital for this end of the market particularly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program has been accountable.  In other words, a regular 
revisiting of this program by parliament tends to focus on areas 
that need to be changed.  This is one of the shortcomings in this 
legislation we worry about because it will not be coming back to 
parliament for periods of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An area that has been identified as causing difficulties in 
terms of financing for small business in Canada has been the 
recent move to leasing equipment.  Under the SBLA leasing 
equipment or leasing materials was not something that would be 
financed so this had to be change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area was the non-profit sector.  I think we are all 
appreciative that increasingly businesses in the non-profit 
sector need to find ways and means of supporting themselves.  I 
am thinking here of something like a child care centre. Under 
this new legislation it will be able to use this program to go to 
the banks and other financial institutions to get a loan so they 
can improve the service they provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the move to leasing which on balance is a positive 
move, the opportunity it opens to the non-profit sector is also a 
positive move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the two fundamental reasons we feel that this should 
be advanced further.  Once it gets to committee obviously some of 
the fine tuning will take place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to muse at this point as to where this notion of leasing 
requirement originated.  In my discussions with the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business I was told that its members 
have not been crying for this. I wonder if it is not the banks 
who maybe are trying to use this legislation because they want to 
get into the leasing business. They want to move into auto 
leasing first but pretty soon they will be leasing television 
sets and goodness knows what else if they get their way in this 
bank merger and the changes they are seeking to the financial 
legislation before us these days. I am a bit worried about that. 
I am going to flag it right off the top. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look through all of the briefing material for this new 
legislation and after speaking with a number of government 
officials who are in involved in this, there was one sector which 
I think was obvious by its absence. That is the sector dealing 
with women entrepreneurs.  If there is one thing we acknowledge 
today it is that the growth in the small and medium size business 
sector is being led by women, yet financing is a major problem 
that women have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am approached regularly by women who are so frustrated because 
the banks say “Yes, we will lend you the necessary money to 
start your enterprise but you have to get your husband to sign 
the form”.  They say “My husband is not in the business. He 
does something else”, and the banks say “That is just the way 
it is.  We would like to have your husband's signature”. This is 
a terrible situation to accept. One of the fundamental weaknesses 
of this legislation is the absence of dealing with this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area is that of aboriginal business.  As Canada moves 
toward more self-determination and self-reliance for our First 
Nations people, one of the problems they have is getting into 
business and creating job and employment opportunities for 
themselves and others.  Financing is a crucial matter and again 
it is not being addressed by this legislation.  Hopefully it will 
be in some other sectors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area is what we might call knowledge based business, the 
information technology business.  Someone wants to borrow some 
money from a bank or a financial institution and his only asset 
is himself. He is wearing his cap sideways and an odd T-shirt and 
goes into a bank to borrow some money.  Even if he is a brilliant 
individual who wants to start a knowledge based business and 
everyone knows he or she is going to be successful, well, the 
bank is not used to lending money to people who wear their caps 
sideways and T-shirts.  But that is the new reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more interesting businesses I was at on the opening 
day was that of a couple of young people who were opening up a 
tattoo parlour.  They had a business plan laid out and had 
demonstrated that this was going to be a money-making effort.  I 
guess most people in Kamloops will be wearing a tattoo one day if 
these people are going to be successful.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the way the world is.  These are small businesses, often 
home based.  They are not addressed adequately in this 
legislation.  Most people these days, the self-employed 
individual starting out in business are starting from that home 
based business.  They are not being adequately considered in this 
legislation.  I see this as another shortcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the equity issue of financing.  I realize this 
legislation is not the place to address this issue but I feel 
that I have to wave the flag.  When it comes to equity capital, 
parliament has to take this more seriously.  I may be wrong but I 
do not recall that there has been any real effort to address this 
problem which is faced by small and medium size businesses in our 
country.  I hope we can use this as a heads up and conduct some 
serious examination of the problems associated in this area and 
ways and means to overcome them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many concerns about this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am curious about maintaining the upper limit of $250,000. 
Under this type of legislation, the average loan today is about 
$86,000. It has come down from about $90,000 in 1997 and is up 
from $50,000 in 1994.  It is fair to say that people are using 
this program to access financing for their business when they 
have difficulty doing it otherwise.  These are small loans. There 
is a ceiling of $250,000 and hardly anybody uses that. Should we 
not visit that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation applies to firms that have over $5 million in 
sales.  When we look at the number of firms in this country that 
have sales in that category, do they need help under this 
legislation? Is this the best place to show support for those 
types of firms? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These questions are more of the musing kind than critical 
comment. On balance, we support this program with some 
qualifications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the fact that it does not seriously address the whole 
issue faced by women who are starting businesses today.  They are 
growing young businesses and are entering the market with 
entrepreneurial ideas that they want to see in place through 
production to sale, not export. There is the whole issue of 
aboriginal funding.  Home based business is crucial for 
increasing numbers of Canadians.  This is not addressed 
adequately in this legislation.  We have concerns that these 
sectors are not being properly addressed under this kind of 
legislation.  We need to be reminded of these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to use this as an opportunity to find ways and means 
to support the small business sector.  This is one of them.  It 
has been successful in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we cannot overlook the fact that small businesses are not 
very positively inclined toward the bank mergers.  As a matter of 
fact if the bank mergers as proposed are allowed to proceed, the 
two resulting banks would have 75% of the number of loans under 
this legislation.  By any definition that is real concentration. 
The small business sector is concerned about the ability of 
competition in the financing marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think I have run into a single person who runs a small 
business who likes this bank merger issue.  Not a single one, 
although there might be one whom I have not yet found. In my 
judgment there is universal condemnation of this initiative.  The 
Canadian Federation of Independent Business would largely 
substantiate that in terms of the work it has done with its 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, we will support this legislation at this principle 
stage.  We will be raising some of our concerns in committee to 
see if they can be addressed in this legislation through 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps other more appropriate initiatives can be taken by the 
federal government to acknowledge that the jobs of the future 
will be created not by the large corporate sector nor on balance 
by government, although government has a role to play in job 
creation in critical sectors. 
I am thinking of education and health care, child care, elder 
care, pharmacare, home care, those particular sectors.

know best. They are the people we live with and see every day on 
the streets of our communities. They are the people who should be 
receiving our support.  I believe that this piece of legislation, 
Bill C-53, is a step in that direction. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
you can hear me from way down here, but the positive of being 
down here is now we can always look right instead of having to 
look left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I rise to speak on Bill C-53, an act to increase the 
availability of financing for the establishment, expansion, 
modernization and improvement of small business.  For the purpose 
of brevity, this bill seeks to replace the Small Business Loans 
Act with the new Canada small business financing act. In essence 
parliament will be attempting to guarantee that the principles of 
the success story known as the Small Business Loans Act will 
continue into the next millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1961 the Small Business Loans Act which was implemented by 
the Progressive Conservative government under John Diefenbaker 
has helped over a half million Canadian businesses.  In the 37 
years that have followed, parliament has shown its resolve to 
assist small business by continuously updating and innovating the 
act to ensure that it remains responsive to the needs of Canadian 
small and medium size enterprises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By and large this duty has been discharged with commitment and 
diligence.  I remind the House of this because the same hand that 
passes this torch on will be expecting much of us. Since its 
inception the Small Business Loans Act has experienced a 
successful repayment rate in excess of 94% of all loans. When we 
consider that during this period the program has guaranteed loans 
worth $22 billion, the numbers become all the more impressive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997-98 the Small Business Loans Act borrowers reported that 
they would create 74,600 new jobs. This is even more significant 
when we understand that over 50% of all loans made under the 
provisions of the act would never have been made under 
conventional lending practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is easy to believe when we note a 1996 study entitled 
“Economic Impacts of the Small Business Loans Act”.  The study 
found that approximately 45% of the borrowers in the sample were 
companies that were less than one year old.  In comparison, only 
5% of non-SBLA loans went to start up firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much has already been done to facilitate the work of this House 
as well as the industry committee when it begins its in-depth 
examination of Bill C-53.  To date, a comprehensive review of the 
financing needs of small business has been completed with special 
emphasis on the following areas:  the economic impact studies; 
the compliance and default studies; the stakeholder 
consultations; the cost benefit analysis and future evaluations; 
and the capital leasing studies. As well, our hon. colleagues in 
the other place finished the committee report entitled “Review 
of the Small Business Loans Act”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In dealing with this bill, I would like to stress both what has 
been included and what has been excluded.  As for what is in this 
bill, many provisions of the Small Business Loans Act have 
remained unchanged.  The loan loss ratio remains at 85% of the 
cost of claims for loans in default.  This is the same rate that 
it has been since 1995.  Lenders remain responsible for the 
remainder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of this House will recall that the Liberal government 
reinstated this ratio in 1995 after the Conservative government 
had reduced the risk to lenders in 1993. The Conservative 
government did this to encourage a greater participation by the 
financial sector in the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a government sets up a program like the SBLA which 
guarantees loans for small businesses, it does so for one very 
obvious reason.  Without such an act, loans would be labelled too 
high risk by lenders and they simply would not be given. 
Therefore I have to question the judgment used by the government 
when it increased the risk to lenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of attributing motives, this appears to be an 
instance where good politics took precedence over good policy.  I 
say this because since the Liberals did this, we have studies 
which show that small and medium size enterprise lender 
dissatisfaction has been steadily increasing. 
Rather than pointing fingers at lenders or borrowers, this 
legislation should be focusing on improving the environment for 
both.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few other program parameters which have not changed should be 
noted.  The maximum loan size remains at $250,000.  When this 
issue was reviewed it was found there was very little support for 
increasing this figure.  Until recently the Canadian Federation 
of Independent Businesses was arguing for a reduction of the loan 
threshold.  One notable exception to this is the tourism industry 
where many have called for a doubling of the $250,000 threshold. 
This has been due in part to the significant capital investment 
required for facilities. The percentage of the costs of eligible 
capital assets accepted for financing remains at 90%.  This is a 
reasonable figure and there is no need to review it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a shortcoming with this bill that lies in its 
failure to come to grips with the issue of the lack of access to 
the Small Business Loans Act that currently exists for knowledge 
based industries.  The minister raised hopes when he asked for a 
report that asked for the Small Business Loans Act to be expanded 
to target knowledge based industries.  Unfortunately when the 
answer comes back that something definitely needs to be done, he 
chooses to ignore it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowledge based industries are among the most dynamic job 
producing companies in Canada today.  The problem lies in the 
fact that their major assets are intellectual and thus are not 
capable of being financed under current criteria.  So what are we 
to do, ignore them?  Based on the industry estimates which I read 
this year, the same estimates which place so much emphasis on the 
importance of thriving as a knowledge based economy, I am more 
than a little surprised that we have no firm plan from the 
minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not my intention here to cast aspersions but in the past 
the Minister of Industry has indicated his willingness to 
encourage the development of our knowledge based economy.  My 
party stands ready to assist with this.  Perhaps Bill C-53 is the 
vehicle we can use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn my attention to the specific changes that will come about 
if Bill C-53 is implemented.  First, there is a mandatory program 
review provision.  If passed, this would mean the end of the 
current provisions that require an automatic ending of lending 
authorities if a new bill is not passed as we saw last year with 
Bill C-21.  While we are still a little short on the details that 
would constitute this review process, in general terms it appears 
to be a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that for the following reasons.  Under the current system, 
the government is in a situation where it must present a bill to 
parliament in order to keep the program alive.  This bill could 
potentially contain clauses the government of the day would like 
to slip through while at the same time keeping the opposition 
handcuffed by the inherent time constraints.  After all, who 
wants to be the party that takes the blame for the demise of such 
an historically important and successful act?  With this in mind 
the review process is a better way to deal fairly with any 
necessary changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the proposed process the review would see data collected 
over a five year period prior to the review used to give 
parliamentarians and policy makers the tools needed to evaluate 
where changes need to be considered.  At the end of the five year 
period, currently designated as March 31, 2004, the minister 
would have 12 months in which to cause a comprehensive review. At 
this point we are not prepared to comment on the reasonableness 
of these time constraints as we look forward to reviewing them at 
the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 proposes a new component to the act, the idea of pilot 
projects both for capital leasing and for the voluntary sector. 
Capital leasing has been an ever growing and popular financing 
option for small and medium size enterprises.  This particular 
type of lease ensures that the lessee will own the equipment at 
the end of the lease.  A provision of this nature serves to 
protect the interests of taxpayers as the equipment will become 
an asset of the company at the end of this lease. Or so one would 
believe if one were to read the memorandum that was distributed 
by the minister to all parliamentarians. 
However, Industry Canada's report “Access to Financing for Small 
Business: Meeting the Changing Needs” is not so definitive in 
its treatment of capital leases.  I refer to page 17: “Capital 
leasing is the leasing of equipment for the major part of its 
useful life, with the expectation that the lessee will obtain 
ownership of the equipment”.  If the intent of the bill is to 
guarantee that all capital leases under the program will be lease 
to own agreements the wording should be carefully considered.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present the leasing industry does not approve leasing for 
firms under two years old seeking less than $100,000. This 
typically excludes the majority of present Small Business Loans 
Act borrowers.  Parliamentary committees will be consulted for 
the implementation of such a pilot project.  In doing so, I trust 
we will come up with a program which is responsive to the stated 
needs that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other proposed pilot project deals with the voluntary 
sector.  The document “Securing Our Future Together” makes a 
commitment to reviewing federal small business programs with a 
view to extending their mandate to the voluntary sector.  This 
program raises many questions.  In recent hearings conducted into 
this issues witnesses generally were opposed to extending 
provisions of the Small Business Loans Act to the voluntary 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the reasons cited included costs as well as instability 
of revenues.  These are legitimate concerns and I also would be 
concerned if we were to put in place a program which would allow 
non-profit or voluntary organizations to unfairly compete with 
other business interests.  This is something that needs to be 
more thoroughly explored at the committee stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contingent liabilities are a new addition to the act.  The claim 
being made is this is somehow necessary to shield the taxpayers 
against incurring more than $1.5 billion liability should all 
loans default.  Based on the fact that the program as it stands 
is only experiencing a 5.6% default rate coupled with the fact 
that the program would have to be five times larger for such a 
large payout to be made, I am suspicious of this clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A cynic might suggest that this is merely window dressing and 
marketing to make the government appear fiscally responsible. The 
reality is the threshold is set so high it will never come close 
to being tested but it does sound nice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cost recovery is a worthy goal of the program. Toward that 
achievement, Bill C-53 seeks to allow the government the ability 
to restrict access to program loans or guarantees. Too little has 
been released on this clause to discuss it with any depth and I 
would caution that any legislation covering this area must be 
generous in scope with allowance for various contingencies.  We 
have a heavily regulated financial services sector already.  If 
any abuse of process is suspected other avenues may exist to 
achieve compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next area I wish to address is that of the proposed 
accountability framework.  This proposal by Price Waterhouse will 
access the Canadian small business financing act over the next 
five years.  Several criteria will be used, including the 
visibility of the program to potential borrowers, its impact on 
creating and maintaining jobs and the performance of the 
borrowers.  The auditor general in his report on management of 
the small business loans program points out that claims audit 
procedures need to be strengthened.  This is an area that will 
have to be dealt with with great sensitivity to the viability of 
the program as a whole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the reason this act exists is due to the 
undeniable fact that a problem exists.  The problem was the 
unwillingness of banks to lend to small and medium size 
enterprises.  Any attempt to change the program so as to put 
greater compliance demands on lending institutions will only 
result in fewer small businesses getting the financing they 
desperately need.  While I am not opposing the provisions at this 
time I am suggesting that we tread carefully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I would like to address a clause in the Industry Canada 
review of the Small Business Loans Act.  Specifically in the 
booklet “Meeting the Changing Needs” on page 17 there is a 
reference to asset transfers.

<A HREF="#LINKT32"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Included in this is a reference to non-arm's length transfers of 
assets of going concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue I raise is that specifically itemized as being 
excluded from the CSBFA act guaranteed loans would be the sale of 
a business from a parent to a child.  This needs to be reviewed 
and for very good reasons.  We no longer live in a time where the 
purchase of family businesses is financed by long 
apprenticeships, that is to say children working at below market 
value with the understanding that some day the businesses will be 
theirs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather, the inherent value of small businesses represent the 
equivalent of an RRSP to many business owners.  This provision 
would result in children being unable to secure the proper 
financing.  What would happen then?  I suggest that parents who 
are facing the insecurity of retirement would be forced to look 
at selling their business to a non-relative who would not know 
the ins and outs of the particular company and would have access 
to the Canadian small business financing act loan guarantees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is this fair?  I think not.  At a time when high taxes and a 
lack of opportunity are leading to brain drain and breaking down 
the family unit, we do not need to make the situation worse with 
punitive anti-family legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again I look forward to working at the committee level to 
see if we can change this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer some comments on the debate 
today because it concerns a subject that is very near and dear to 
my heart, small business.  Having been in small business for over 
20 years, when I had a real life before I became a politician, I 
was aware of many things that were lacking in what it took to run 
a successful small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot let this debate go by without revisiting a couple of 
things that this government has failed to recognize.  At the top 
of that list is the level of EI premiums. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses and the people they employ are currently being 
overcharged by some 33% on EI premiums that are necessary to not 
only sustain the program but also to provide a reasonable rainy 
day fund in case we have a downturn in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only do we have that rainy day fund available but the 
finance minister has decided that he wanted to create a hurricane 
fund. We now have a surplus of $20 billion in EI premiums for 
this year.  Let me clarify that.  There are many workers who 
think there is $20 billion in the fund but in fact all that is 
there is an IOU from the finance minister who has scooped the 
entire pot and it looks like he is intending on defying or 
changing the law that governs EI surpluses so he can continue to 
scoop an extra $6 billion per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know members want me to conclude but I cannot stop without 
talking about the high taxation level.  Canada is the highest in 
all the G-7 countries.  Small businesses are stressed under a 
burdening tax regime that makes us uncompetitive.  I would like 
the member from the fifth party to elaborate.  I know this is the 
Reform issue but I am sure the Tories can try to elaborate on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Just before the hon. 
member for Markham responds, I make the point that this is a 
small business act.  We are allowing a fair amount of latitude in 
the questions and comments and debate but let us try to touch 
every once in a while on the touchstone of the bill that is on 
debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could not agree more that 
there is a virtual surplus of over $20 billion. We know a tax on 
unemployment insurance is really a tax on small business and 
other employment. The government should be reducing that.  Also 
we are too highly taxed in this country . 
It was interesting to see over the summer when the Asian flu was 
starting to impact the dollar in Canada that all the money that 
was leaving those countries was not coming to this country but 
was going to the U.S.  I think a good reason for that was that 
investors viewed the risk they saw in this country as not being 
worth the payback.  Maybe our taxes are too high, both our 
personal income taxes and also the way the government is milking 
the employment insurance fund.

left who raised the issue of the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the weekend I saw a fellow on the street with a huge sign 
that said “Paul the pirate”.  I approached him to see what on 
earth he was up to and he said “The Minister of Finance is 
pirating funds that working people and small entrepreneurs have 
put into the EI fund for the last number of years.  He is 
stealing $5 billion this year”.  How can he do that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend from Markham made reference to the changes in the 
legislation that would result in a five year opportunity to 
review the success of the program, particularly the pilot 
studies, and that the minister would have significantly more room 
in terms of regulatory change.  I know there has been a change in 
government policy, perhaps in every department, where more 
emphasis is being given to providing responsibility and authority 
to the minister to change regulations having to do with certain 
pieces of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. friend from Markham not have some concern about 
this area in terms of ministerial influence, in terms of 
adjusting or changing legislation, in terms of where that might 
take us? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, does he feel, as I do, that there is a crucial area in 
the field of financing for tourism related projects?  I do not 
think this legislation meets that area of the economy in any way 
and it is something that we should be looking at as

is the knowledge based sector.  I believe that at least 10% of 
all funding should go to the knowledge based sector because the 
knowledge based sector is the future of this country.  We should 
be willing to take a risk and look after that industry too.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-53, an 
act to increase the availability of financing for the 
establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of small 
businesses, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, at the 
end of August, we all witnessed how volatile and unpredictable 
economic forces can be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stock markets and national currencies were whiplashed overnight 
during a sudden explosive global crisis of confidence. 
Fortunately it was short-lived panic, but at times like this 
every sector of the economy feels vulnerable.  Particularly 
vulnerable to cyclical economic shifts are small and medium size 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many do not have the financial resources to wait out economic 
swings.  Even in periods of stability, largely because of the 
difficulty of getting adequate credit at reasonable rates, it is 
a formidable challenge to manage a small business profitably. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, manage and succeed they do.  The vision, the energy, 
the perseverance and the plain hard work of Canadian 
entrepreneurs have made small business an absolutely 
indispensable component of our national economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These businesses continue to be the fastest growing segment of 
the economy.  They also continue to be the biggest generator of 
jobs by far in every region of the country.  It is obvious that 
this community will continue to benefit many Canadians if we take 
the measures necessary to facilitate its health, expansion and 
profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An important contribution that we make at this time for this 
sector is to provide it with stability.  The House can go a long 
way to help establish a climate of stability for small business 
by giving its approval to Bill C-53, the Canada Small Business 
Financial Act.  This stability is provided through the bill which 
will continue to provide the small business community with access 
to financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maintaining the program on a cost-recovery track will enhance 
the certainty of continuing taxpayer support for this important 
risk-sharing program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are eliminating the aggregate lending ceiling which has 
created uncertainty about the program in recent years and 
replacing it with a more realistic mechanism to continue the 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will enhance lenders' and borrowers' confidence that the 
program will be there in the future to facilitate financing. 
Stability will be enhanced by eliminating the sunset clause and 
replacing it with a regular review during which lending will 
continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, by maintaining most of the parameters of the current 
legislation, stability is further ensured.  Everyone who deals 
with the program knows where they stand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also contains a major benefit for Parliament.  This is 
the provision for a recurring five year parliamentary review of 
the Canada Small Business Financing Act program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also provides for the development of a comprehensive 
accountability framework which will give Parliament improved and 
more accurate data and performance measurements against which to 
evaluate the program's financial standing, its efficiency and its 
success in meeting cost recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program evaluation framework and the performance measures 
that are being developed will also address the concerns raised by 
the auditor general and the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts.  When he appeared before the committee, the auditor 
general stated that the program was generally well run, with a 
minimum of costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The program, as hon. members know, has since been subjected to a 
comprehensive review, analysis and assessment.  This review took 
account of the observations and recommendations of the auditor 
general.  This will eliminate the periodic concern that the 
program will not be available and will permit Parliament the time 
it needs to carry out a careful review of its operation.  This 
has not always been possible in the past because of the deadline 
on lending authority created by the sunset clause. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister launched a review last November he set three 
goals for any program that would emerge as a result.  He wished 
to ensure that the program would remain relevant to the needs of 
small business, be financially self-sustaining and have an 
adequate accountability framework. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The comprehensive review conducted by the department included 
examining issues with borrowers, potential borrowers, lenders and 
major industry associations. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1355"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This review included a series of studies in the following broad 
areas:  economic impact studies, compliance and default studies, 
stakeholder consultations, cost benefit analysis, and future 
evaluation and capital leasing studies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In launching the comprehensive review the Minister of Industry 
set the goal of developing an appropriate accountability 
framework for the program as one of the three conditions for 
continuing the program.  The framework is intended to provide 
parliamentarians with answers to questions that have frequently 
been asked about the program, questions such as the relevance of 
increasing access to financing for small business; the need for 
continuing federal government involvement; its impact on the 
creation, maintenance and displacement of jobs; the performance 
of borrowers; whether the program as designed meets its 
objectives; whether it overlaps with other programs; whether 
small businesses have other financing needs not met by the 
program; and whether program costs can be predicted accurately 
and recovered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to this, the framework will also report on progress 
toward achieving cost recovery and the reliability of forecasting 
for the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pertinent information that parliamentarians will need to 
accurately measure the performance of the program will be 
provided through better methods of collecting data. 
Administrative changes and new regulatory provisions will ensure 
that information is collected.  For example, the new legislation 
requires lenders and borrowers to provide certain information 
needed for program evaluation.  An accumulating database will 
monitor performance and aid in assessing the targeting of the 
program.  More categorized information on program use and on 
impacts such as job effects will be included in the annual 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a provision in the bill for recurrent five year reviews 
of the program.  These will be conducted with the evaluation 
framework and empirically sound performance measurements.  They 
will provide the House with the information it needs to make 
decisions about the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The accountability framework for the program that I have just 
described is the kind of tool that this House needs to make 
well-informed judgments and appropriate decisions on complex 
issues that have a direct bearing on the livelihood of millions 
of men and women, the small entrepreneurs in this country and the 
millions more that they employ. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members of the House are well aware of the crucial 
significance of small business.  I also know that each one of 
them would want to have available the best evaluation tools and 
the most reliable information possible when making decisions that 
can affect the health and prosperity of the small and medium size 
business sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is for this reason that I am glad this bill has been tabled 
so early in this session so the industry committee can have a 
thorough review before passing it on to the other House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is supposed to be part of our Canadian 
social safety net.  Instead of the fund being insurance for 
workers who get laid off, this government has been using the EI 
fund as its own personal piggy bank, piling up a surplus of $20 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister is even trying to keep the premiums high 
rather than cutting them as the law requires.  That this 
government sees itself as being above the law is the best 
argument yet that the EI fund must be removed from this 
government's back pocket and administered instead by a board of 
private sector employees and employers.  It is their money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's EI administration inside general revenues is 
nothing less than legalized theft.  If this was in the private 
sector— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, once again I think we are 
getting a little bit close to the line.  Words such as “theft”

launch a national research program to address and remedy the 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This research is being undertaken by the trade research 
coalition which was established by the Minister for International 
Trade following the overwhelming success of last November's

20 years now, the Fusiliers de Sherbrooke have been connected 
with an important annual fundraising event for the Fondation du 
Centre universitaire de santé de l'Estrie.  Over the years, this 
foundation has collected over $15,000 at this event, which is 
held at the Sherbrooke armoury.

unacceptable behaviour that took place at a regimental dinner 
held by the Fusiliers on September 12.  Until the investigation 
into these incidents is completed, the armoury cannot be used 
for social events. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at this objectively.  The community ought not to be 
punished because a few individuals acted in an unacceptable 
manner.  I am asking the minister to look into this matter, 
which merits special attention, and to take the necessary steps 
to allow the foundation to hold its fundraising event as 
planned.

<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there is a law that says when the finance minister overtaxes you 
with employment insurance premiums he has to return that money. 
That is the law.  It is a law that limits the tax grabbing power 
of the minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we hear that the minister wants to change that law.  Will 
the finance minister tell Canadians here and now that he will not 
change that law, that he will not continue to rob Peter to pay 
Paul? 
<P><A NAME="LINK67"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, first of all let me say that no specific proposition has 
been made to cabinet.  We have, however, had an important debate, 
a debate which has existed since 1986 when the auditor general 
insisted that the EI account be consolidated with the 
government's general funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that governments have to make choices and those 
choices involve a reduction of EI premiums, absolutely, but they 
also involve a reduction in personal income taxes and they 
involve spending in important areas like health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must have that debate and the government looks forward to 
having that debate in the House and across the country. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we 
can talk about choices any time.  We are happy to do that. 
However when it comes to employment insurance there is no choice. 
The law says that the minister must give that money back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is he going to change that law to get his hands on the money 
that the law says he is not entitled to? 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the debate that is required in this country in an era of 
considerable global volatility when country after country outside 
our borders is in recession is:  Is the government going to give 
up that area of its financial manoeuvring which prevents us from 
going into a deficit? 
Is the government going to maintain a balanced approach?  Are we 
going to reduce debt?  Are we going to reduce personal income 
taxes?  Are we going to reduce EI premiums?  Are we going to 
invest in health care?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
according to the chief actuary Canadians are paying 33% more than 
they have to.  This is a $6 billion a year tax grab. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the finance minister not just give the money back?  Why 
does the minister not just drop the money and walk away, slowly, 
and keep his hands where Canadians can see them? 
<P><A NAME="LINK71"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

payroll taxes are substantially lower than those of most G-7 
countries including the United States.  Our personal income taxes 
are higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why will the Reform Party not engage in a debate as to the 
proper allocation of those fundings?  Why will the Reform Party 
not debate the future of health care?  Why will the Reform Party 
not take a proper attitude toward the global economic crisis that 
surrounds our borders?  Why will the Reform Party not deal with

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr.

understand a direct question.  It is clear that the finance 
minister is thinking about changing the law that deals with the 
EI surplus.  We are talking about $6 billion here.  That is a lot 
of money out of the pockets of Canadian workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we want to know, what they want to know, what all of Canada 
wants to know is:  Does the minister intend to change the law so 
he can get his hands on the $6 billion of EI surplus he is not 
entitled to?  Is he going to change the law or not?  It is real 
simple.

choices.  The government's choice is to proceed on a balanced

</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask members of the Reform Party if Canadians are entitled to 
know their position?  Are they in favour of health care?  Are 
they in favour of lower income taxes for Canadians?  Are they in 
favour of reducing debt?  Are they in favour of reducing EI 
premiums to the extent we can afford?  That is the issue.

essentially belongs to the workers and businesses that have 
contributed to the fund.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, since

every year. Last year, we reduced them by 20 cents, for a total 
of $1.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We intend to continue with a balanced approach. This means that 
we will invest in health. It also means that we will lower 
personal taxes for Canadians. We will reduce the debt and

deserves. 
<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, when 
the Minister of Finance tells us about choices, he forgets an 
essential reality, namely that three out of five people who are 
currently unemployed and who paid premiums—in some cases 
throughout their working lives—never qualify for benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not think that it is illegal and also 
profoundly immoral to act in such a fashion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Bloc Quebecois leader talks about morals. The Bloc wants us to 
lower employment insurance premiums by $5 to $6 billion. They 
want us to reduce taxes by $10 billion while at the same time 
making a massive $11 billion investment in transfers to the 
provinces. The total cost would be in excess of $25 billion. I 
wonder what planet these people live on.

shocking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only 42% of the unemployed manage to get employment insurance 
benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that everyone can see the damage done by the employment 
insurance reforms, how can the Minister of Human Resources 
Development tolerate that his colleague, the Minister of 
Finance, is preparing the legalize the misappropriation of 
billions of dollars from the fund's surplus, when 6 out of 10 
unemployed persons are not entitled to benefits? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I have stated repeatedly in 
the House, our government is concerned by the drop in 
participation in the employment insurance system over the last 
few months and the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This tendency has existed for the last ten years. It has reached 
a point where I have asked Statistics Canada to tell us why the 
participation rate has fallen over the last few years. I hope 
the information we obtain will be useful to us, in October, so 
that we can understand the problem better and take appropriate 
steps to correct the situation.

and misappropriate the surplus in the employment insurance fund, 
are we to understand that the Minister of Human Resources

been made in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is absolutely obvious, and you have my assurance, that in 
discussions concerning the surplus in the employment insurance 
fund, in my capacity as Minister of Human Resources Development, 
I will continue to apply the policy of the government, whose 
priority is to help Canadians get back to work, because that is 
what the unemployed expect from us. And I will continue to 
ensure that the employment insurance system serves Canadians wel

ways that are really open to all the provinces.

course of action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does he realize 
that, by opting for a general tax reduction, he would have

complete nonsense? 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe:</B> They do not have boats to sell.

have us believe that the letter that Mrs. Freed was referring 
to was written recently and that in fact her confidentiality had 
been breached recently. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The initial letter was written in 1995.  Indeed the letter did

it has happened again. She wrote the letter on August 24 of this

</I></B></P><P align=left>These are questions a real justice minister from Edmonton

Minister of Justice, because she is from a certain region, should 
answer questions that are not under her direct jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that the Prime Minister is following the 
requirements of the Constitution.  If the hon. member and his 
party do not like the Constitution then let them propose to the 
provinces to begin the process of formal amendment, not call for 
an election which is an election for life and for which there is 
no public accountability.  That is not democracy either in

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the Deputy Prime Minister in his response just a moment ago to 
our member accused him of abusing his authority in the House by 
directing a question to the justice minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I think you realize in the chair that our member 
has a responsibility to direct a question, as you so said last 
Thursday in the House, to the government or to a member of the 
government.  The Deputy Prime Minister is completely incorrect in 
his response and should apologize to the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I do not want to get into a debate about 
this whole thing, but perhaps on both sides we tend to exaggerate 
a little bit.  I know we are just coming back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am going to permit the government House leader to intervene on 
this matter, but I do not want to enlarge it too much. 
<P><A NAME="LINK169"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the House and the Chair will be 
fully cognizant of the fact that under Beauchesne's it is 
specifically prohibited for any member to ask a minister a 
question regarding regional responsibility.  On several occasions 
last week this occurred and in a tangential way there are always 
attempts to bring this back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice, as the minister from Alberta, or I as a 
minister from Ontario, cannot answer questions in our capacities 
as regional ministers.  This is quite clear in Beauchesne's and 
it is equally clear that the Deputy Prime Minister was perfectly 
correct in bringing this matter to the attention of the House 
today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Colleagues, as you are all aware, when a 
question is posed it is posed to the government.  Ministers 
cannot be queried on their political responsibilities; it is 
their ministerial responsibilities.  That is why I said at the 
beginning that the preamble to the question itself was 
questionable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Colleagues, we have quite a leeway in asking questions but 
sometimes you force your Speaker, you force me, to intervene 
before I get to the question.

not a point of order, and we will let this matter rest at this

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I view this charge or any charge against another member to 
be very serious, I withheld bringing this matter up until now 
because I needed to confirm all the facts which I have completed 
this morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into the details of the charge I need to briefly 
comment on the authority and the responsibility of the House in 
this regard.  This charge, while separate in itself, does involve 
other jurisdictions such as the Board of Internal Economy and the 
Treasury Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will submit— 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I am sure the hon. member is very much 
aware of what he is doing here.  What he is doing is charging 
that a criminal act, an illegal act, has taken place by one of 
the members of this House.  He has of course the option, not 
under a point of privilege but under a substantive motion, to 
bring this charge to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make it clear and I want to understand what the member 
is doing.  Is the member bringing a specific charge, a 
substantive motion, then, against one of the members of this 
House?  Could he answer that question now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my charge was clear.  It is 
the improper use of public funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  My colleagues, we are not dealing here with 
a question of privilege.  We are dealing with a substantive 
charge against another member of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is what the hon. member is doing, I am going to listen a 
bit more, but a motion should be brought to this House.  I want 
to make it clear that this is not a question of privilege that we 
are dealing with now.  We are dealing with something altogether 
different, and I want to know that the hon. member understands 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will continue with my 
statement.  As I was going to say at the end of my 
presentation—and I am prepared with the motion here—I was 
prepared to say if you rule this to be a prima facie question I 
am prepared to move the appropriate motion.  I think if I can go 
on then you can further make an assessment if you so wish.  Do 
you instruct me to proceed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  At this point I am going to instruct you to 
proceed, but I want you to know that this is not a question of 
privilege we are dealing with.  I want to hear what you have to 
say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, before I get into the 
details of this charge, I need to briefly comment on the 
authority and the responsibility of the House in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This charge, while separate in itself, does involve other 
jurisdictions such as the Board of Internal Economy and the 
Treasury Board.  I will submit precedents demonstrating that a 
breach of the rules under another jurisdiction embodies a breach 
of a standard of behaviour for members of parliament that 
Speakers have considered in the past when deciding prima facie 
questions of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, I will argue that the jurisdiction of the House 
over its members and its right to impose discipline is absolute 
and exclusive, and that the conduct of members that touch on or 
is part of another jurisdiction does not preclude the House from 
taking action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But first I will present the details of my charge against the 
member for Saint-Maurice.  It has been brought to my attention 
and to the attention of the public by journalist Sean Durkan in 
articles published in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> on August 2 and August 
5, 1998, that the Prime Minister used taxpayers' money to pay 
campaign workers which helped him secure a victory in his riding 
in the last election and the election before that.

<A HREF="#LINKT51"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The records of Elections Canada, which I have here, will say 
the Prime Minister's office paid campaign workers $43,389 with 
taxpayer money.  This is more money than the average candidate 
gets to spend on the total of their campaigns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Durkan reported in the Ottawa <I>Sun</I> that an official in 
the Prime Minister's office confirmed that this money was spent 
deliberately.  In the same article there is confirmation from 
Treasury Board that its guidelines for cabinet ministers 
regarding paid staff during election campaigns apply to the Prime 
Minister and that they were breached by the Prime Minister. These 
guidelines can be found on page 19 at section 3.5.6 of the 
document entitled “Guidelines for Ministers' Offices” dated 
June 6, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national director of the Liberal Party confirmed with the 
<I>Sun</I> that the Prime Minister kept about 15 of his political 
staff on the public payroll during last spring's election 
campaign and also paid campaign workers with public funds when he 
led the opposition in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reviewed the rules set out by the Board of Internal Economy 
regarding this issue and it is clear that the Prime Minister 
breached the rules set out by the Board of Internal Economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, at the end of my presentation I will provide you 
with a copy of this rule, copies of the news articles and the 
relevant sections from the records of Elections Canada and the 
guidelines from Treasury Board. I will now address why and how 
this House should take up this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to page 115 of Erskine May's 21st edition, page 192 of 
Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in Canada</I> and to a 
Speaker's ruling from <I>Hansard</I> of October 29, 1980.  These 
references describe acts which may constitute contempt as having 
no limits and how it would be impossible to discount any act or 
omission as a contempt just because there were no specific 
precedents for that act or omission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since there do not need to be clear guidelines in the way of the 
usual precedents, a Speaker, in deciding these matters, may have 
to consider some other standard of measure.  I will present 
examples where it is apparent that Speakers use the standards of 
behaviour found and set out in the common law as guidelines for 
appropriate behaviour for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to the responsibility of this House and the conduct 
of members, I will establish a parallel between the common law 
and the laws of the Board of Internal Economy and the Treasury 
Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples where the House involved itself in 
matters relating to members of parliament and the law.  In many 
of these cases the Speaker ruled in favour of a prima facie 
question of privilege allowing the House to consider whether or 
not the violation of the law was offensive and inappropriate 
behaviour for a member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is not that the violation of these laws has anything to 
do with the jurisdiction of the House but they represent 
standards which the Speaker can use to determine that a charge 
against another member is valid enough to be considered prima 
facie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With that in mind, I refer to page 103 of the 21st edition of 
Erskine May:

necessary authority without the compromise or delay to which 
recourse to the ordinary courts would give rise. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Citation 46 of Beauchesne's sixth edition tells the story of the 
House taking action against a member for an old conviction of 
forgery with respect to the granting of timber limits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1891, for instance, there was the case of Thomas McGreevy who 
was charged with scandals in the public works department.  The 
House was satisfied that there was enough evidence against Mr. 
McGreevy and took action before the courts came to a conclusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the member for Charlesbourg was charged by another 
member for sedition even though the matter had been raised in the 
courts.  The Speaker in ruling that the matter was a prima facie 
case of privilege was not concerned with the details of the 
Criminal Code nor the court case itself.  The Speaker was 
influenced by the fact that sedition is a serious charge and 
considered as evidence the facts contained in the letter sent to 
the Canadian military from the member for Charlesbourg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In both the 1995 case and this 1998 case there were reports in 
the media complaining of an activity of the members and a concern 
that nothing can or will be done under the law.  Another 
similarity is that in both cases the evidence was conclusive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 1995 case the House took up the matter independently from 
the common law and independent from any guidelines set out by any 
other body. It is my hope that the House will do the same with 
this 1998 case against the Prime Minister.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As stated earlier, the conduct of a member measured against the 
standard of appropriate behaviour set out by a law often adds 
sufficient weight to the argument against the accused member, 
resulting in the Speaker's ruling in favour of a prima facie 
question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other references setting standards can be found in the second 
edition of Joseph Maingot's <I>Parliamentary Privilege in 
Canada</I> on page 238.  It states that while the standing orders 
refer only to offering money for the promotion of any matter 
before parliament, the House would treat equally severely the 
acceptance of money by a member for anything a member may do.  In 
the final analysis “the House of Commons may set whatever 
standard it sees fit in respect to the conduct of a member”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Board of Internal Economy has set a standard for all members 
of parliament when it created bylaw 305.  The Treasury Board has 
set the same standard for cabinet ministers in guideline 3.5.6. 
Both these bodies consider the use of public money in the way the 
Prime Minister has used public money as improper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, in authorizing and accepting public money to 
help him win an election, violated a serious bylaw and a 
guideline, bringing into question his integrity as a member of 
parliament. The Speaker must take into account the violation of 
this bylaw and the guidelines of the Treasury Board in his 
determination as to the validity of this charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other matter that must be addressed is that this violation 
has been reported in the media and the impression left in the 
public's mind is that one of the members of this House has acted 
against the law and because of his position is exempt from the 
law.  The article of August 5 says: “Guess what folks?  If our 
Prime Minister doesn't like the rules, he can break them and 
there's nothing we can do about it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there is the impression left in the minds of the 
members of this House that the Prime Minister is more equal than 
other members with respect to their privileges and their standard 
of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that both these impressions are serious enough on 
their own merit to be considered by this House on a question of 
privilege.  Such impressions left unchallenged cast a dark shadow 
over this institution.  Accordingly, I believe this House must do 
three things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it must invoke consequences against the member for 
Saint-Maurice for his improper use of public funds.  Second, it 
must clarify the impression left in the public's mind that a 
member of this House is above the law.  Third, it must return 
confidence to all members of this House that the Prime Minister 
or any other member does not enjoy special privileges above those 
enjoyed by the rest of the members of this House with respect to 
their conduct as members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you rule this to be a prima facie question of 
privilege, I am prepared to move the appropriate motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B> Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion is that the matter of the member for Saint-Maurice

</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not view this to be a specific enough charge and I would

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my notes are at the table, 
but when I started speaking I believe my comment was the improper 
use of public funds which is a violation of Treasury Board.  It 
is a violation of the Board of Internal Economy rules and the 
Elections Canada Act.  It is pretty specific. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  What I require from the hon. House leader of 
the opposition is a specific charge, a specific motion to be 
written out and put in my hands, not a referral to a committee. I 
want it in writing so that I will know specifically what the hon. 
member is referring to.

what the government House leader has to say, if the opposition 
House leader wants to proceed in this fashion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK175"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know that you are seeking 
further information from the opposition House leader.  I will not 
comment on that.  I am sure those arrangements can be made at 
another time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understood the allegation, it was described as the matter 
of.  I believe what we are referring to is an allegation as 
opposed to the matter of.  In other words, nothing here has been 
proved nor acknowledged to be as the hon. member has said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I understand correctly what has been alleged is that the 
Prime Minister's exempt staff disobeyed Treasury Board guidelines 
which require that staffers working on a campaign must do so on 
their own time and not during office hours.  I believe the member 
also alleged that the rules applying to the Board of Internal 
Economy for the employees of the House of Commons also apply to 
others who are not employees of the House of Commons.  I believe 
that is the second point he raised.  In view of the imprecision, 
it has to be gleaned that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I suggest that the salaries of ministerial staffers are 
paid for by government funds.  That is why the guidelines provide 
that staffers who work part time on campaigns must do so outside 
regular office hours.  There is difficulty in ascertaining what 
are off-hours particularly in offices such as the Prime 
Minister's given that people work very long hours and the hours 
of work vary on a daily basis.  Staffers as we know, especially 
those of us who have seen how hard the Prime Minister works, may 
work at all hours of the day and evening and sometimes even later 
than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure complete transparency accounts followed the Chief 
Electoral Officer's guidelines concerning campaign workers.  The 
value and the number of hours worked by staffers on the Liberal 
campaign on a part time basis were estimated.  This sum was 
accurately recorded in the party's election expense return as a 
contribution to the Liberal party.  The Liberal Party then 
settled the cost of these salaries with the Government of Canada 
and paid the amount.  To remove any doubt, salaries have been 
paid back to the government so that no one would actually make 
the allegation that has been made today, or at least if it was 
made, it would be totally invalid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Treasury Board guidelines referred to earlier today, albeit 
somewhat indirectly as the Chair has just reminded us, say 
“Should a member of the minister's or secretary of state's 
exempt staff decide to become actively involved on a full time 
basis in a federal, provincial or territorial election or 
by-election, the member is required to take leave without pay or 
resign their position”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following sentences are the operative ones: “If a member 
becomes engaged in campaign activities on a part time basis, 
their involvement must be on their own time and not during 
regular office hours.  No vacation leave or any other form of 
leave with pay will be permitted for election purposes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Elections Canada Act provides that labour donated to a 
campaign which is paid for from a source other than the 
registered party must be recorded as a contribution to the 
registered party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party returns for the June 2, 1997 general election, 
and those can be proven, included a contribution of $43,389 which 
represents the salaries of several of the Prime Minister's staff 
who worked part time on the Liberal Party's campaign.  The cost 
was correctly recorded as a contribution.  We did this in order 
to be more prudent than was absolutely necessary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, to address the fact that the salaries of such workers 
were paid by the Government of Canada and not the Liberal Party 
of Canada at that time, the Liberal Party subsequently reimbursed 
the government for the cost of the salaries.  In other words, not 
only were the rules strictly observed, but we went overboard to 
ensure that nothing would be seen, albeit incorrectly, as being 
untoward. 
The allegations made by the member are incorrect.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the member informs us that even if contempt is not 
defined and not restrictive, the Speaker should rule nonetheless 
that this issue is one of contempt of the House.  It is correct 
that contempt is not strictly defined in the rules but that does 
not mean that Mr. Speaker nor the House should get themselves 
involved every time someone from the newspapers alleges there has 
been what he considers to be a breach of the law, even when such 
is not a breach of the law in particular.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have heard allegations at this time 
but I am loath to proceed unless I have a specific charge in

charge in front of me so that I can have a look at it, I am not 
saying that this action would be terminated here.  I am saying 
that I want to see the specific charge that is going to be made. 
I invite the hon. opposition House leader to submit that to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the absence of that, I will let this point move on for now. 
If necessary, I will come back to it.  But first I want to see 
the very specific charge.  For the time being this matter is held 
in abeyance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Does the member have a point of order 
outside of what we are discussing?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Then we are not going to address this right

was no specific charge?

received the specific charge.

could not say that I did not hear that.  I must ask the hon. 
member with all respect to you, would you please withdraw those 
last comments.  I invite you to withdraw your final comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am frustrated but I will

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>CANADA SMALL BUSINESS FINANCING ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-53, an 
act to increase the availability of financing for the 
establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of small 
businesses, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House broke for question 
period there remained a period of five minutes for questions and 
comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I would like some enlightenment on the issue of revising 
Bill C-53.  I have heard a few comments from members in the House 
that specifically the revisions to the Small Business Loans Act 
would increase the ability of small businesses to attain 
financing within Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, my question goes to the fact that I have heard this 
program has been in place for 37 years.  If we are actually 
trying to allow companies to have access to capital and if we are 
trying to make it easier for companies to have access to capital 
through this program, why has the program been carrying on for 
such a long period of time and now finally, after 37 years, we 
are introducing changes to the program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not an indication there is a problem with the small 
business financing approach of the government?  Maybe we need to 
look at an option of creating more competition among lending 
institutions and allowing them to go that route rather than to 
continue with a program like this one.  Maybe the hon. 
parliamentary secretary could clear that up for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the comments 
made by my colleague, but he must understand that in each 
government program there is always continuous improvement going 
on to make sure that we are in with the times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last spring when Bill C-21 was brought forward it was requested 
by all parties that extra time be taken in the House to review 
the Small Business Loans Act.  This has been done.  During the 
various committee debates witnesses will be brought forward to 
review the Small Business Financial Act and to understand the 
benefits of it.  There are benefits right across the country. 
The Small Business Loans Act has proven in the past that it 
assists businesses in areas of a little higher risk to make sure 
they get financing.  There has obviously been much improvement 
over time to this act.  Again, we have done an extensive review 
from the time Bill C-21 was approved until now.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The industry committee, including my colleague opposite, will 
have a chance to review all the statistics.  The report of the 
Small Business Loans Act was tabled today in the House to allow 
all of us to take a look at the report and to move forward on the 
new bill in the House of Commons. 
<P><A NAME="LINK210"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am particularly pleased to talk about the Small Business Loans 
Act and the impact of the changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a member from the Reform Party asked the previous speaker 
in the question and comment period about a suggested reform, it 
was implied that we somehow made the atmosphere more competitive 
for lending institutions instead of dealing with people in small 
businesses who need assistance.  I guess I should not be 
surprised that someone from the Reform Party would see that the 
goal would somehow be to help banks and lending institutions 
instead of helping people access the money they need to expand 
their businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly that is one of the fundamental differences between this 
side of the House and that side.  We understand the reason the 
Small Business Loans Act has been such a success over the past 37 
years.  It has made available a reserve of capital to people who 
otherwise would not have access to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does it work?  The bank gets a bank guarantee for 90% of the 
loan.  The loan is also targeted specifically to an asset that 
would be added to the business.  It could be leasehold 
improvements.  It could be a die-cast machine.  It could be a 
transportation trailer, something that can actually have affixed 
a value which could be recovered if the small business were not 
successful and winds up owing the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority—well over 90% or closer to 95%—of small 
business loans are paid back, but there will always be as in any 
economy from time to time the odd problem.  As a result we have a 
situation where some value will be added to the product financed 
by the lending institution.  In essence that is what this bill 
does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member opposite also asks “What are the changes?  What is 
new?”  I invite him to take a look at them because I think they 
are quite significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, one of the changes in this act will allow for the program 
to continue with a five year review instead of eliminating the 
ability to lend.  That has been one of the problems in the past. 
There is a little black hole, a spot, a period of time, when it 
needs to come before parliament to get restarted or kick-started. 
This will allow for a five year mandatory review, but the lending 
authority side of the legislation will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and I find this particularly interesting, is that we are 
looking at a capital leasing pilot project.  In some ways this 
does exactly what the member opposite in the Reform Party was 
asking.  It expands the marketplace to allow leasing companies 
now to access a loan guarantee from the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an option for businesses in many cases that need to 
acquire very expensive equipment in the transportation or 
manufacturing sector. 
Perhaps they are at their maximum in terms of a line of credit or 
something of that nature with the bank, or they do not have the 
personal assets or the corporate assets to back up the loan, so 
they go to a leasing company.  This part has not yet been 
designed, but it seems to be a positive change that would allow 
leasing companies across Canada to access loan guarantees and 
would encourage them to make loans to small business.

<A HREF="#LINKT59"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third reform in the bill is a voluntary sector pilot 
project, which is extremely exciting.  People in the voluntary 
sector who do such good work in the community may from time to 
time need to acquire something of a fairly substantial capital 
nature.  This will allow them on a cost recovery basis to access 
money through the Small Business Loans Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are three of the changes the act will put in place that 
are very positive.  It is not designed to favour big banks or 
lending institutions but rather to offer them some security when 
they are in a situation where they otherwise might not make the 
loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Small Business Loans Act requires that the applicant fill 
out a very extensive business plan.  It requires that the 
applicant does the homework.  That is a positive thing, aside 
from the fact that it may give the government, the taxpayers and 
the lending institution more confidence in understanding how the 
loan will be repaid.  To fill out a detailed business plan small 
business entrepreneurs have to understand their businesses, their 
problems and their strengths.  It is very positive that the 
application is as detailed as it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city of Mississauga in my riding of Mississauga West is 
known as a city of small businesses.  Many of the businesses will 
benefit from the changes in the bill.  Many of them have 
benefited over the last 37 years from the Small Business Loans 
Act which has been put forward by everyone who has held 
government in the country over the last 37 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 the business directory in Mississauga listed just under 
10,000 business.  Out of those 33% had between one and four 
employees and another 25% had between five and nine employees. 
Almost 60% of the businesses in Mississauga have fewer than 10 
employees.  When we add in the other 10 to 20 employees it is 
18%.  Almost 80% of the businesses in my city run businesses with 
fewer than 20 employees.  In an area like mine some understanding 
of the significance of small business is critical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was privileged in 1988-89 to be appointed as the small 
business advocate by then Premier David Peterson in the province 
of Ontario.  We did some analyses.  Every year the small business 
advocate would file a report with the Ontario legislature on the 
state of small business.  We found that the top three problems 
concerning small business in those days—and from my prospective 
in Mississauga they continue to be the top three problems—were 
access to properly qualified and trained staff and the ability to 
keep them once they have been trained, the taxation burden, and 
access to capital. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Small Business Loans Act improves access to capital for 
small businesses.  It lays out the ground rules so they 
understand what is involved and gives some confidence to the 
financial sector that these loans can be made without total fear 
they will not be paid back.

<A HREF="#LINKT60"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of taxation, it is my view that small business, not 
unlike every other sector of our society, feels that we are 
indeed taxed too high.  The finance minister made announcements 
on tax reductions in the last budget and there will be more 
announcements coming on tax reduction.  I would suggest to all 
members, when I hear all the hue and cry about employment 
insurance premiums, et cetera, that the small business people in 
this country want to have a fiscally responsible and prudent 
government.  They want to see us tackle the debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have round tables four times a year in my community with 
business people and the number one issue I hear about from those 
business people is that we have to get a handle on the debt.  The 
debt alone is a serious problem.  These business people want us 
to have a proper, responsible financial plan and the small 
business loan legislation is part and parcel of it.  It is one of 
the legs in the stool that will continue to make our economy as 
great as it is. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member for Mississauga West said that under this program 
the banks would get a guarantee.  In other words, taxpayers would 
guarantee the loan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then the member made the point that the money can only be lent 
for assets.  The first example he gave was leasehold 
improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a perfect example of the problem with this government. 
We have career politicians making decisions for business who are 
completely out of touch and without any understanding of the 
realities of running a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to leasehold improvements, the member clearly does 
not have a clue what they entail.  A leasehold improvement is an 
asset to a business.  However, if the business fails it may be a 
liability to the next person.  In many instances leasehold 
improvements are not consistent.  They are not what is required 
of the next business coming in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, there may be a liability on the business if the 
venture is not successful.  There may be a requirement for them 
to remove those leasehold improvements, in which case they would 
be destroyed and the asset would become a liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have made leasehold improvements to businesses.  In fact I 
borrowed money under the Small Business Loans Act for leasehold 
improvements.  I am an example of a business person who was 
unnecessarily burdened by government excess regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would have qualified for a bank loan, but the bank said that 
the government had a plan which the taxpayer would guarantee, and 
I was forced to pay a premium on it.  That is one of the ways in 
which the mentality of this Liberal government ends up burdening 
small business people such as myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason government members do not understand that is because 
they are career politicians.  The hon. member for Mississauga 
West said that in 1988-89 he was appointed small business 
advocate by Premier Davis.  That member's connections to politics 
and getting appointments to different things goes back years and 
years.  I would not be surprised if he was a lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member said that we found what the top three problems were. 
Notice that the member said “we found”.  He did not say “I 
know what they are”.  How would he know?  He is not a small 
business person and he is out of touch with the needs of small 
business people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that taxation was a problem.  If that is the problem, 
then why is he in a government that has increased taxes 37 times 
in the last four years?  That seems to be an inconsistency to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also said that access to capital or financing was a 
problem.  My only comment to that is, why has the government of 
which he is a member not lowered EI premiums, reduced taxation or 
ended the excessive burden placed on business by government 
regulations?  Why is the member part of a government that acts 
against small business?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, some of those comments 
hardly merit a response.  The hon. member's personal attacks 
about my background notwithstanding, if it is of any interest to 
him or if anyone really cares, I am indeed a small business 
person.  The problem is that while I am here in Ottawa my 
business seems to be getting smaller because I am spending too 
much time here.  In any event, I found that comment to be 
somewhat irrelevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the real issues here is the access to capital for 
leasehold improvements.  The hon. member says that I do not know 
what I am talking about.  I would tell the hon. member that the 
small business community out there faces extraordinary capital 
requirements to effect leasehold improvements so they can 
increase their sales, so they can market their products and so 
they can do more business.  The gentleman from the Reform Party 
says that is a liability? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not a liability.  Without leasehold improvements many 
small businesses would simply not be able to function. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mentality that is there is just trying to find something 
wrong with the legislation, rather than recognizing the fact, in 
a non-partisan way, that indeed the Small Business Loans Act has 
been a success.  This bill will make it more successful, will 
refine it and make capital available to small businesses.  Why 
does the hon. member not support that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer (Edmonton—Strathcona, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill 
C-53 with my hon. colleague from Saskatoon—Humboldt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53, an act to increase the availability of financing for 
the establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of 
small business is the government's attempt to put a band-aid 
solution on the problem of small business access to financing, a 
problem the Liberal government has helped to create. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mandate of the Small Business Loans Act is to facilitate 
debt financing to small, young businesses that would likely not 
obtain it otherwise.  This mandate, which will be maintained 
intact under Bill C-53, essentially dictates that the government 
and therefore the taxpayer should take on more risk than private 
lenders are prepared to incur.  Even with the changes contained 
within Bill C-53 the taxpayer still covers 85% of any small 
business loan defaults. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any member of the House can ignore this point. 
Whether the members choose to support or oppose this bill, it 
must be remembered that the essential aspect of Bill C-53 is to 
provide high risk loans that the private sector cannot or will 
not provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the House believe this is a fair risk to place on 
the shoulders of Canadian families, they should support this 
bill.  If they believe it is an unfair risk to place on 
taxpayers, they should oppose the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two questions immediately came to mind after reviewing Bill 
C-53:  Why should the taxpayer take on more risk than the banks? 
Is there no other way to ensure that small businesses have access 
to much needed investment capital? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is widely understood in economic circles that government 
intervention leads to a misallocation of resources.  This is not 
free market sophistry, it is the thinking of Nobel laureates like 
Milton Friedman, James Buchanan, Gary Becker and Frederick Hayek. 
We can trust the opinions of some of the greatest economic 
thinkers in the world or we can trust a government that continues 
to put obstacles in front of business in the form of more 
government regulations at the cost and peril of Canadian 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The intervention by the government maintained by Bill C-53 will 
remove important market forces from the lending processes and 
will lead to the funding of less viable business ventures.  This 
may help to garner political support for the Liberals, but will 
continue to do nothing to foster a healthy economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to my first question about why the Canadian taxpayer 
should be expected to accept such high economic risks, the answer 
provided by the Liberals seems to be so they can win political 
favour.  This government seems to have no concern for the average 
Canadian families who struggle every day under the highest tax 
burden in the G-7. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, clause 5 of Bill C-53 illustrates the government's 
indifference to the fact that it is playing politics with the 
paycheques of Canadian people. 
This clause refers to the minister's liability should a loan not 
be repaid.  However, it is clear that the liability is that of 
the Canadian taxpayer.  It is not the industry minister's problem 
if high risk loans are defaulted on, it is the taxpayers'.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of risk should be examined more closely.  Risk is a 
key element in the proper functioning of a free market.  If it is 
artificially lessened or eliminated from market interactions, it 
leads to a misallocation of scarce resources.  That is, lending 
institutions will be less inclined, despite the provisions for 
due diligence contained in Bill C-53, to evaluate the long term 
viability of a business venture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This situation will lend itself to the financing of 
unsustainable market ventures and it is the taxpayers under this 
regime who will inevitably be the losers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is supported by the government's own statistics which show 
that the default rate under the SBLA was about 6%, while the 
private sector was at approximately 1%.  This is substantial when 
we consider the amount of money at stake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry proudly claims that the taxpayer has 
only a $1.5 billion liability.  This is not an insignificant sum 
of money.  The Canadian taxpayers are at their breaking point and 
someone has to say enough is enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone in this House understands the vital role small business 
plays in the Canadian economy.  Both my colleague from 
Saskatoon—Humboldt and I are small business operators.  We both 
understand the difficulties small business owners face.  High 
taxes and regulations come first to my mind when I think of how 
tough it is to survive in a small business.  If payroll and 
income taxes were lower, life would be easier for all small 
business owners.  But the government does not care enough to do 
anything about these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of small business on the Canadian economy is 
substantial and Reformers have always supported the needs of 
small business.  However, Bill C-53 is not a debate about whether 
small business is valuable, it is a question of whether small 
businesses can get access to financing without the government 
intervening in the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High risk small business ventures can be financed in a 
competitive banking system provided the lenders are not 
unnecessarily restricted from conducting their affairs in a 
manner that allows them to incur risk without incurring losses. 
The Reform Party is committed to getting government out of the 
business of doing business and out of the pockets of average 
Canadian families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill further entrenches the government's role in the 
banking industry.  Bill C-53 and its predecessor, the Small 
Business Loans Act, allow the government to ignore the real 
obstacles to small business financing.  No more taxpayer dollars 
should be placed at risk until the government has deregulated the 
banking industry to create real competition.  At this point small 
business access to financing can be reviewed and new legislation 
can be tabled if the government can demonstrate a legitimate 
market failure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government just cannot seem to get the fundamentals right. 
It has tinkered with the Small Business Loans Act and has made 
improvements recommended by both Reform and the auditor general. 
However, if the government really cared about small business 
access to financing it would create more competition in the 
banking industry, it would lower taxes and reduce the regulatory 
burden faced by small businesses which now consumes the 
equivalent of almost 12% of GDP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 plays politics with the taxpayer's paycheque.  It 
demands that the taxpayer take on more risk than the banks by 
guaranteeing loans.  Let us get the government out of the 
business of doing business and off the backs of the Canadian 
taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-53 does not address the problem of small business access 
to financing and places a financial liability on the taxpayer 
that is higher than the level deemed acceptable to the private 
sector. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, for a recap in French of the main thrust of my speech for 
those Canadians whose preference is for that language. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the present object of the SBLA, which will be 
maintained with Bill C-53, the government and consequently the 
taxpayer are taking greater risks than the private lenders. 
Even with the changes proposed in Bill C-53, the government 
covers 85% of any unpaid amounts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are two important questions.  Does the Minister of 
Industry think it is reasonable to use tax dollars in such a 
risky manner?  And why should the taxpayer take more risks than 
the banks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In economic circles, people are very much aware that government 
intervention always goes along with poor resource allocation. 
The government intervention set out in Bill C-53 will do away 
with important market forces, in the process of making loans, in 
favour of loans to less viable businesses, and this will do 
nothing for economic prosperity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 of Bill C-53 demonstrates the government's total lack of 
scruples about playing political games with the Canadian 
taxpayers' dollars. 
This clause addresses the minister's responsibility if a loan is 
not paid back.  It is clear, however, that responsibility falls 
to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the matter of risk, when a risk is eliminated—one of the 
key elements of a properly functioning open market—a moral danger 
is created.  In other words, the lending institutions are less 
inclined, despite the obligations for reasonable diligence 
imposed by the law, to assess the long-term viability of 
businesses.  As a result, non-viable businesses will end up 
receiving funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under such an arrangement, the taxpayer is inevitably the loser. 
Government statistics support this thesis.  In fact, the 
default rate under the Small Business Loans Act is 5.6%, 
compared to 0.8% in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small and medium sized businesses play a vital role in the 
Canadian economy, and the Reform Party has always supported the 
needs of that sector.  The purpose of debate on Bill C-53, 
however, is not to determine the value of small and medium sized 
business, but rather to determine whether these can access 
financing without government intervention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out that the importance of small and 
medium sized businesses in the Canadian economy cannot be 
under-estimated.  The question we need to ask ourselves is the 
following: Is it possible to use deregulation in Canada to 
create a framework that will provide financing in a more 
efficient way?  I believe the answer is yes, and that is why I 
cannot support this bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great intent to the member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very surprised the Reform Party has taken the position 
today to argue against the Small Business Loans Act, an act which 
has been in place for over 37 years.  It has been very 
successful.  I think the member earlier said if it has been 
around for 37 years, what is wrong with it?  Something that has 
been around for 37 years is a testament to its success and the 
need for it within our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member seems to talk about a perfect world.  Maybe on the 
Reform benches it is Christmas every day, I do not know, but the 
reality is that it is not a perfect world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Institutions not only in Canada but worldwide and banks often 
are short term lenders.  They lend basically on current assets. 
This program addresses the concern for longer term assets, fixed 
assets.  We talked about capital leases earlier. This is money 
that actually goes over a longer period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about a burden on the taxpayers of Canada but 
the reality is that these are also the employers.  These are the 
people who get jobs from these very businesses.  They are also 
the taxpayers.  We have created jobs.  We have created taxpayers 
by assisting these businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member seems to think the SBLA program is a subsidy. 
He talks about the program as if it is a subsidy.  I can assure 
him that people applying for these loans face the same screening 
devices as for any other form of loans and they are rejected on 
the same basis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about a 5.6% default rate, but he fails to 
acknowledge the fact that 94% of these loans are successful. I 
suggest to the member that in spite of what he wants to do in the 
regulatory environment of banks that without government support 
in this area of those 94% of successful loans, those successful 
jobs would never have been created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very surprised that the member and his party would be 
opposed to the best interests of small and medium size businesses 
today.  I would like him to comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. member 
hit it on the head when he said that 94% of those loans were 
actually successful.  My question throughout my whole discourse 
is why is the government involved in that process if in fact the 
private sector can do it itself. That is the key. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member even mentioned the fact there is scrutiny placed 
on these businesses going through the process of applying for 
these loans.  That can be done without government intervention as 
well.  He reaffirmed that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member also mentioned that it is not a perfect world. I 
would say that it is not a perfect world especially for small 
business in this country because of all the obstacles this 
government has placed in front of them.  What the Reform Party is 
trying to do is stand up for small businesses in allowing those 
small businesses to create opportunities for themselves and not 
try to create this false impression that wealth and jobs are 
created by governments.  As we have seen, there is a limited 
growth when it comes to that.  The taxpayers' money is 
unfortunately recycled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing the hon. member mentioned which I would like to 
address was the issue I had brought forth earlier.  The program 
has been in place for 37 years, yet I continually hear from the 
members opposite that the single most important concern from 
small business continues to be the access to credit.  If the 
program has been so successful, why are there still so many small 
businesses that are not achieving the financing for their 
enterprises or their businesses? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a small business person myself, one of the biggest problems I 
had looking for financing was not because the government had 
created a program that was going to secure financing for me, the 
biggest problem was the fact that there was not enough 
competition willing to lend to me and other small businesses 
across the country.  This is why we cannot confuse the issue, as 
the Liberals have done, in this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not an issue of not supporting small business.  That is 
exactly what we want to do in the Reform Party.  We would like to 
support small business. We would like to support the free market. 
We believe that can be well achieved by getting government out of 
the regulation that it continues to create and which continues to 
put obstacles in front of small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us create an atmosphere of positive competition in this 
country where real entrepreneurs have the choice through the 
access to capital.  Let us work with businesses to do that not in 
a way that creates more regulation and unfortunately keeps some 
entrepreneurs out of the loop, but let us try to widen that so 
everyone has an equal chance in achieving financing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Bonwick (Simcoe—Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, make 
no mistake in what the hon. member had to say. Very clearly he 
does not support government sponsored small business loans.  Yet 
he clearly identifies access to capital as one of the greatest 
deterrents to expansion and creation of small business. If that 
is not an obstacle against small business, then I do not know 
what is. Small business loans work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a government we encourage schedule A banks to get involved 
and create a higher level of loans to small and medium size 
business, but we also appreciate the fact that when starting out 
some businesses in fact do require extra support.  We do not 
pretend that we would be setting the exact guidelines on how 
schedule A banks will extend funds. We see ourselves as a 
partner.  My hon. colleague very clearly outlined that 96% of 
these do work, 96% of these small businesses that are securing 
loans work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give the hon. member a scenario and I would be 
curious what his response is.  I would also ask him to take some 
time out and actually visit some of the people, some of the small 
businesses, the mom and pop stores, the mom and pop businesses 
around this country that have qualified and succeeded. Tell them 
that the government should not have been involved, that the 
government should not have been partnering with the banks and 
with the small business community to allow that job growth and 
job creation to take place.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be interested in the hon. member's comments on this 
scenario.  An average Canadian has a great idea for a business, 
an idea which both I and the person think is very viable. The 
person has the management expertise and ability to carry forward 
that idea but he or she is missing one small thing.  He or she is 
missing equity and therefore does not meet the basic lending 
guidelines set in place by schedule A banks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The banker sees an opportunity.  Understanding of course that 
there is some onus and some responsibility on the banker as well 
and a certain amount of prudence in regard to lending, the banker 
sees there is an opportunity to extend funds, and this is 
typically not the only source of funds I might add, to this small 
business, to this great idea, to this Canadian to succeed if in 
fact there is partnering. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that does not take place, that small business will not get 
off the ground because traditional lenders require some equity. 
They require a capacity with respect to 25% or 30% equity.  When 
government partners with schedule A banks and with small business 
people, it allows some latitude in this area for these small 
business people to create a business or to expand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has been a very effective tool for small and medium size 
business all across the country.  Bankers and branch managers who 
are very active in the community will tell us that.  Small 
independent business people will tell us that.  I am also saying 
that.  I have business people in my riding who have qualified for 
it and have been successful simply because it would not have 
taken place if they had to qualify under the strictest of 
traditional lending guidelines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member was talking about accessing taxpayer 
dollars for small business, does he not consider small business 
an integral part of our national economy?  If great Canadians 
with great ideas have small business opportunities, does the 
member not see a role for the government to play if traditional 
lending guidelines are not being met? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rahim Jaffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will begin by putting to 
rest the hon. member's concerns.  Being a member of a small 
business association within the area that I did business prior to 
being elected, one of the biggest concerns people within that 
organization raised was not so much that they did not think 
access to capital was an important issue, I do not think anyone 
is arguing that, but what they did raise was that there was 
limited choice, as the hon. member mentioned, with traditional 
lenders.  That is the whole problem of our system and the problem 
I tried to raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot fix the problem with band-aid solutions as we have 
seen in the Small Business Loans Act and the revised version. We 
need to address the issue of choice within the financial sector. 
That is the issue we are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and all its members in opposing this bill are 
telling the government that it is time to address the issue of 
access to capital with the issue of choice.  Do not continue down 
this road of government regulation which unfortunately continues 
to put obstacles and additional costs in the way of small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member really felt that he was putting business 
first, I think he would come to see the same light the Reform 
Party has seen. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Broadview—Greenwood, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have to begin my remarks to my friend from 
Edmonton—Strathcona by going back to 10 years ago when I came to 
this House.  One of the first things I noticed at that time when 
we were in opposition is that we only had one member of 
parliament in western Canada. 
A little team in our office organized a program called the best 
of the west.  We had some bright, articulate, liberal minded 
university students come to Ottawa, get used to working on the 
Hill and develop ideas on public policy so that one day they 
could come back as elected officials and take some of those 
thoughts and ideas and represent the regions.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Edmonton—Strathcona was one of those young 
university students who was on my staff for that best of the west 
program.  I am happy to see him in the House, but I am shocked to 
see that he did not learn some of the Liberal values, vision and 
principles that we worked on during that period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be very specific about an experience we had 10 years 
ago.  At that time we were in opposition.  The member was around 
when the then Conservative government brought amendments to the 
Small Business Loans Act before the House.  It was at a time when 
the banks were doing very little for small business men and 
women.  The Conservative government amended the bill to try to 
urge and push the banks to provide more access to capital.  At 
that time this was not a Conservative idea but it had the insight 
and the understanding that it was listening to small businesses 
when they were saying they were getting turned down on a regular 
basis.  The Small Business Loans Act with the government 
guarantee was something that would make sure the small business 
realm would stay healthy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stood in this House in opposition and supported the 
government's amending that bill.  We got it through three 
readings in one day.  In opposition we are not there just for the 
sake of opposing.  If the government comes up with a good piece 
of legislation, which the member knows from experience, then we 
support the government.  To this day we still do not have the 
banks doing enough for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the member to stand up in the House and say that he 
thinks the banks and financial institutions are doing a great job 
in providing all kinds of capital for small and medium size 
business men and women.  I challenge him to stand up and say that 
in his own riding.  What will happen if he says that?  He will be 
blown out of here so fast that he will not know what hit him. 
His riding is no different from my riding.  Even with the 
pressure this government has put on banks in the last few years, 
with the pressure from the Prime Minister and the Minister of 
Finance and every member of this side of the House, it is still 
tough to get banks to shift from words to deeds and actions 
toward loaning capital to small business men and women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what this government has done, what this Minister of 
Industry has done repeatedly since he has been in charge of this 
portfolio.  This is my third time since we have been in 
government that we have amended this bill.  Each time we fine 
tuned it.  We have been responsible with the fiscal framework. To 
stand in the House and suggest that the Small Business Loans Act 
is really nothing more than government intervention and that it 
is counterproductive to small business defies logic.  It defies 
experience.  His words are so distant from reality.  It boggles 
my mind.  I am stunned that somebody who used to be on my staff 
would come up with such stuff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say to my dear friend that I do not want him to loose 
some of those great Liberal principles that he once had.  He can 
loose them in certain sectors. 
I appeal to him not to walk away from small business men and 
women.  It does not matter whether you are a member of the 
separatist party or a member of the Conservative Party, whatever 
party you are with, the economy of this country is run by the 
small business men and women.  They are creating 80% of the jobs. 
If we have to guarantee a float of about $10 billion and if in a 
bad year $1 billion goes bad but it meant that there were tens of 
thousands of entrepreneurs out there creating jobs and creating 
vitality, so be it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a notion of letting banks do it on their own.  Is there 
anybody in the Chamber who believes we should stand back and 
trust the banks to look after the small business men and women in 
the country and that they would do a great job?  I defy anybody 
to stand up and say this would happen.  I will never desert my 
core values when it comes to small business men and women.  I 
will never waiver or walk away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is part of the reason why I came to Ottawa early today, to 
support the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Industry. 
The bill should pass all three readings the same day with all 
party support, just the way we handled it when we were in 
opposition.  No member of parliament in the House cannot ever be 
seen doing anything other than putting our shoulder to the wheel 
for small business. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, you can tell it has been a long day when the member 
opposite stands up and tells the House and the television 
audience how much his government and minister have done for small 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a lot of small businesses right now that are taking 
some Tylenol, some Pepto-Bismol because that speech must not only 
give them headaches but make them absolutely nauseous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say they do not want to stand in the way of small business 
and that they are helping small business.  They have breached 
their obligation to small business. They have thrown up obstacles 
which small business has to struggle over just to do what it 
wants, to try to make some money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about the incredible tax regime that the Liberal 
government has laid on the backs of small business. Where does 
the money come from that the government says it is giving to the 
small business program?  It rips it out of the pockets of small 
businesses and then it comes like heroes and tries to give it 
back to them.  The best thing it could do is to stay out of the 
pockets of small businesses and let them get on with business. 
That would be better than any program it could put on the table 
for small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Liberals stand up in the House and say how good they 
are to small businesses while at the same time they are taxing 
them by over 33% more on their EI premiums?  They are ripping it 
out of their payrolls, their investment capital and their 
profits.  How can they stand there and say how good they are 
being to small business?  It is astonishing and it is dishonest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member just threw 
me a lob ball that I do not deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For 10 years we have been talking about the notion of 
comprehensive tax reform and I will admit that this is a very 
tough, complex issue.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member knows that I have worked on this issue in a very 
diligent, focused way.  When the Reform Party came to this House 
and became Her Majesty's Loyal Opposition, I was excited and said 
at last we have a group of men and women here who will help 
produce a critical mass of debate so that we can really shake the 
tax system in this country and get something going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the first time this member has stood and talked on this 
issue about tax reform since we have come back.  Where is the 
Reform Party on tax reform? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been advocating simplifying the tax system for the last 
few years.  If I had my way, I would abolish federal income tax 
for small business in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not understand how things get done in this Chamber.  It 
is give and take.  We have a bill today which Reformers should be 
supporting us on and they are running the other way.  They say 
they are going to oppose.  There is an issue where I think they 
are on the right track in terms of comprehensive business tax 
reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They hide it. Bring forward the debate and there will be many of 
us on this side of the House who will support the idea.  Bring it 
forward in a consistent, steady as she goes way. Don't just throw 
it up every now and again because they find there is something 
worth saying and the only thing they can throw out is tax reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pray that the Reform Party gets on to the game of 
comprehensive tax reform.  Just like the Minister of Finance said 
about two weeks ago, we do need it but both sides of the House 
have to engage in the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Durham, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have 
always respected the hon. member who just spoke for his 
work in the area of small and medium size business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting that the members opposite talked about the 
tax situation.  What people possibly do not understand is that 
with the small business tax deduction available to incorporated 
small businesses that have incomes of $200,000 or less in Canada, 
they are treated probably the best of the OECD countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I really question whether we could consider that an obstruction. 
This government and governments before us have recognized the 
concerns of small and medium size business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am concerned by the opposition members who clearly are opposed 
to the Small Business Loans Act itself, not just to this 
legislation.  They talk endlessly about a subsidy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have practised in the small business area.  A lot of my 
clients would have been very surprised to think that what they 
were doing when they walked to the bank and paid prime plus 3% 
and paid a 1.5% or a 2% service charge to access the SBLA program 
was paying a subsidy.  I do not think anything could be further 
from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is 94% of these loans are effectively repaid under 
the terms and conditions.  Why 94%?  The reality is that when 
there are new start-up companies there is a significant amount 
of risk involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are banks not interested in taking those kinds of risks? 
Some of the members opposite say we should change the regulatory 
burden and somehow the financial institutions, banks in 
particular, will become great lenders to small and medium size 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out one obvious factor.  When they start talking about 
banks, they have to think where did their capital come from, 
where do they get their capital to loan to small and medium size 
businesses.  They get it from the depositors of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then they have to start asking constituents in their ridings if 
they want to see all their savings being allocated more toward 
small and medium size businesses which have high significant 
start-up costs and risks and the possibility of loss on their 
deposits. 
That is the real issue we should be talking about.  We can 
legislate and regulate all we want, but the reality is that there 
is a dichotomy within our economy that requires some kind of 
assistance.  When I say assistance I do not mean subsidy.  I do 
not mean a grant to small and medium size business.  I mean 
something that will fill that gap and allow small and medium size 
businesses to access the capital they require.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned earlier in one of my questions and comments that our 
banking institutions quite often are more oriented toward short 
term lending.  This is not just true of the small and medium size 
business sector but also of farms.  That is why we have the Farm 
Credit Corporation.  Often the supply of long term capital, 
patient capital, is missing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Small Business Development Bank has given over $21.7 million 
to about 110 businesses in my riding of Durham.  This has created 
many jobs in my riding.  Small business operators are happy about 
the process and happy they have been able to access that money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members talked about access to capital.  The reality is 
that 85% of those loans are guaranteed.  That means that 
somebody, the banks in particular, are picking up 15% of the 
liability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the act is to move us more toward cost recovery. 
I would have thought the Reform Party would have applauded that. 
Yes, there have been incidents in the past where the program has 
actually cost the taxpayer some money.  However, by reducing the 
amount of the guarantee by the government, plus the fee structure 
that is put in place, we are moving more toward not costing the 
taxpayer one cent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This seems to be something that is totally missing the Reform 
Party which keeps talking about subsidies.  The reality is in the 
successful operation of the bill it will not cost the government 
any money.   I note we have restricted our total liability to 
$1.5 billion.  That is a lot of money.  I think one member of the 
Reform Party mentioned that is not small change.  I agree.  It 
does not mean we will lose $1.5 billion.  In fact, the way the 
program is structured it reduces the liability on a bank by bank 
or institution by institution basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members said they wished there was more competition.  The 
reality is that this act actually breaks down the number of 
lenders.  There are approximately 1,500 lenders in Canada who can 
access this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the legislation does which I find very exciting, 
very attractive, is that it talks about capital financing or 
capital leases.  Unlike the member who got off on leasehold 
improvements, what it really means is financing leased equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Durham, and indeed I believe in most of Canada, 80% of new 
business formations are service industries.  What do they 
require?  They require the technological equipment to make them 
efficient and productive in the business community.  Often that 
is computer equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is a situation where the government is saying that they do 
not have to put all their money into computer equipment if it 
takes it over on a long term lease agreement.  This gives a very 
important incentive for small and medium size businesses to be 
technologically efficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were told time and time again in the House how important it 
was that Canada be competitive in a global environment and that 
its small business sector be competitive in a global environment. 
I am happy to say this legislation addresses that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of the comments and earlier studies done by the auditor 
general talked about the need for more accountability by 
parliamentarians.  I note that one of the provisions in the 
legislation is to study the program on a case by case basis and 
not just the defaults.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this legislation we as a government were sent information 
by the financial institutions on cases where default had 
occurred.  We could then question whether they had met the 
parameters of the act, et cetera.  This legislation expands the 
whole accountability framework by basically allowing the 
government to look at the whole range of lending going on within 
those financial institutions.  This is very important because we 
can monitor whether or not that system is meeting its objectives 
and the demands of small and medium size businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress too much that I believe this act is an 
improvement.  Some members have said that it has been around for 
37 years and we still have not accessed the capital problem. That 
should not be unusual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our economy is growing and some of the small businesses have 
become big businesses and moved on.  Fortunately many other 
businesses stand in their place and continue to expand.  That is 
why we need the constant support of government for the small and 
medium size business sector.  These businesses pay taxes and 
create jobs.  As many of my other colleagues have mentioned, they 
are the fastest creators of jobs in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am surprised by the policy of the Reform Party 
that would object to something that has been successful and which 
the small business community applauds.  On behalf of the small 
business sector, I point out to the Reform Party that this not a 
subsidy; it is just good business.

<A NAME="LINK222">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-53, an 
act to increase the availability of financing for the 
establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of small 
businesses, be read the second time and referred to a committee; 
and of the amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Eric Lowther (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few brief comments and perhaps a question for the previous 
speaker from the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to clarify a couple of things that have been said back 
and forth here.  First, the Reform Party is very much concerned 
about the health of small business in Canada.  I guess the debate 
here today is whether or not the changes to the SBLA really help 
small business.  Is it the best place where we can spend some of 
our efforts to help small business? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our approach is adding to the amount of money that is available 
to small business ventures.  The SBLA is perhaps one way to go, 
but we do not feel it is the best way to go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to a letter I recently received from the Canadian 
Restaurant and Food Association.  I will read from it and ask the 
member to comment on what would really help small business.  The 
letter states “As noted in previous correspondence, the huge and 
growing federal payroll tax burden on food service businesses is 
constraining job growth among the association's 40,000-plus 
members.  Economic theory and empirical evidence both support the 
strong correlation between significant payroll tax reduction and 
employment generation, particularly in labour intensive 
industries like food service”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one industry that is pointing to the common sense 
solution to help small business.  We seem to put huge burdens 
like high taxes, and the high payroll taxes to which this 
association refers, in front of small businesses and then help 
them to get access to capital so they can effectively go out 
there and hang themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT71"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member across the way comment on the relative priority 
of expanding the SBLA as opposed to giving small business, 
particularly those in this industry, a break on payroll taxes? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am happy to reply to 
the member for Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the issue of payroll taxes.  All of us would like 
taxes, no matter where they are, to be lower than they currently 
are.  We have heard the Minister of Finance say it in his view, 
and indeed that of the Prime Minister, taxes in Canada should be 
reduced.  I am very heartened that we are actually moving in the 
right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer the member's direct question, I suggest that he should 
read the OECD report on Canada's economy.  It will show that 
payroll taxes in Canada are one of the lowest in the OECD.  In 
other words, once again we are looking at the competitive global 
environment in which we are competing.  The reality is Canada's 
payroll taxes are one of the lowest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that is something of which we should be totally 
and utterly proud.  Certainly we would like to reduce taxes at 
all levels, but relative to the ability of the restaurant 
industry to compete both domestically and in the tourist 
industry, which is very related to international competition, our 
payroll taxes are one of the lowest.  They already have a 
competitive advantage because of that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of the people of Surrey Central who oppose Liberal 
government Bill C-53, an act to increase the availability of 
financing for the establishment, expansion and improvement of 
small businesses in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lofty claims of the title of the bill as we shall see are 
not accurate.  The contents of Bill C-53 do not live up to the 
claims in the title of the bill.  It looks on the surface very 
good, yet it needs improvements and we need to modernize the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers, Canadians without jobs and Canadian small 
businesses are disappointed with Bill C-53 that we are debating 
today.  On this side of the House we wish the government would 
introduce legislation that would be of assistance to Canadian 
small and medium size businesses.  The official opposition would 
support modernization of the small business loans program and 
would like to support the improvements in financing for small 
businesses, but what the Liberals are proposing is not good 
enough.  No one is fooled by Bill C-53.  The Liberals are 
ignoring small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier we debated Bill C-21 to extend the Small Business Loans 
Act to March 1999 and to raise the government's total liability 
to $15 billion.  The official opposition opposed it because the 
government was failing to address the real issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not listen to the official opposition or the 
other opposition parties, to small businesses, to the Canadian 
Federation of Independent Business or to the auditor general. In 
terms of the Small Business Loans Act the auditor general has 
some concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, I would like to address some of the main concerns 
the auditor general has cited in his report. There is a need to 
define the results expected from the SBLA program.  We need to 
ensure that it is designed to maximize its impact.  The 
department needs to clarify expectations and to develop 
indicators of the program performance in establishing, expanding, 
modernizing and improving small businesses.  What is needed is a 
performance evaluation framework to ensure the program is 
achieving its intended results. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need to strengthen SBLA program management and 
delivery mechanisms. Incrementally, it is also critical for the 
purpose of this program that lending should be additional to 
lending that would have occurred anyway and not merely replace 
it. The latest study indicates that only 54% of loans, 
particularly to newly created enterprises, could be considered 
incremental. It is important for Industry Canada to define the 
levels of incrementality it expects for these loans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department should provide parliament with better information 
to assess whether the program is achieving its objectives.  For 
example, the auditor general estimated that the program will 
incur a net loss of $210 million for loans issued between April 
1993 and March 1995.  This compares with a surplus of $72 million 
reported for those years on a cash basis.  The difference occurs 
because the department does not include a provision for loan 
losses in its annual report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last two years, Industry Canada has placed considerable 
emphasis on moving the program toward full cost recovery.  Under 
the present fee structure and loss sharing ratio, it is uncertain 
whether full cost recovery will be achieved. The department 
should carefully study the extent to which the objective of 
increasing the availability of loans at reasonable rates can be 
achieved simultaneously with the objective of full cost recovery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not listen to the opposition parties, nor to 
the small businessmen, nor to the auditor general. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department needs better tools to properly forecast future 
loan losses and monitor any changes in its loan guarantee 
portfolio.  For example, the auditor general finds that the files 
did not show information on thorough credit risk analysis.  In 
some instances, lenders had charged administration fees for 
granting loans, contrary to the act.  Also, related borrowers 
were found to have obtained numerous loans whose total exceeded 
the $250,000 loan limit to operate the same business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These practices are contrary to the intent of the act which we 
are debating today.  Currently there are no provisions under the 
SBLA to prevent this particular abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Federation of Independent Business would remind the 
government to stick to its knitting with respect to this program. 
It says that working capital needs should not come under SBLA 
because it could ruin the entire program. The government should 
test a program on its own merits and see whether it works because 
lending for working capital purposes is a different game 
altogether. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We worry about the long term sustainability of the SBLA program. 
Every conceivable need cannot be put under the umbrella of the 
SBLA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must reject the suggestion that the only way the 
banks will lend to a small business is under a credit guarantee 
scheme.  SBLA in no way is to be used by the banks as their 
response to the broad financing problems experienced by the 
majority of small firms in Canada.  The objective of SBLA is to 
ensure the sustainability of this program and keep it effective 
and relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present SBLA loan size threshold is $250,000.  There should 
not be any increase in the threshold because the average loan 
size is well under $100,000 for small businesses.  If the limit 
is increased, it will create problems related to larger firms 
trying to beat the system.  They will abuse the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Similarly, the sales volume threshold is set too high. 
According to the CFIB only 7% of firms are larger than $5 million 
and 18% of firms are larger than $4.2 million. Statistics Canada 
numbers indicate much the same.  Loans of this size are beyond 
the fundamental intent of this program.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The SBLA application forms also must be transparent.  Loan 
officers should fully explain the opportunities and the costs of 
this form of financing. Many loan applicants do not know what 
they are receiving.  They do not know they are receiving money 
under a government guaranteed program for which they are paying 
the premium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past the method of assessing the program has been a 
weakness. Tighter monitoring and program evaluation is a must. 
For those issues that are fundamental to the program, for 
instance, structural changes to the program such as lenders 
permitted, loan thresholds, qualifying loan recipients, et 
cetera, these should be dealt with under this legislation, not 
regulation, in order to ensure accountability and transparency 
under the program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to differentiate between loans under the SBLA 
and normal bank loans. Solutions practical to small firms must be 
pursued with more vigour.  Better solutions to the equity issue 
for small firms will do much to build not only the financial 
health of the firm but also its ability to grow and contribute to 
the economy in terms of jobs and wealth creation. The outcome 
would be less reliance on government subsidized credit guarantee 
programs such as the SBLA.  Government should use instruments of 
fiscal policy to resolve the equity gaps for small firms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation governing the program has remained unchanged 
since 1961 with respect to the types of assets eligible for 
financing.  It needs to be reviewed and will need to continue to 
be reviewed as our economy becomes more complex.  For example, 
the service sector and the knowledge sector are expanding and 
create significant numbers of new jobs.  The Small Business Loans 
Act needs to take into account the needs of these sectors. At 
present the SBLA is not considering these needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Financial institutions are coming up with new services and new 
products.  Are these institutions able to take full advantage of 
the SBLA?  Are the Liberals investigating the financial, service 
and knowledge sectors of our economy in order to ensure that 
small businesses in these sectors are receiving the assistance 
they need to develop, to compete internationally and to create 
jobs at home for Canadians?  The answer is no.  By introducing 
Bill C-53, the Liberals are not concerned.  They are not looking 
to the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For about 10 years the CFIB has been fighting the changes the 
Liberals are going to make with this bill.  Before the Liberals 
came to power, the Tories were trying to increase the financing 
along the same lines as the Liberals are finally doing with this 
bill without cleaning up the operations of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The CFIB has been saying that if the current abuses of the Small 
Business Loans Act were curbed and if the parameters of the 
program were restricted, this program would require less of an 
allocation of funds while being effective in meeting the 
program's objectives. The Liberals are not addressing these 
issues in Bill C-53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thresholds for financing are too high.  The legislation 
defines small businesses as those firms that have up to $5 
million in sales.  That is not a small business.  That is a 
medium business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1998 CFIB presentation is remarkably similar to its 1993 
letter to the prime minister. 
In other words the CFIB has been asking for these changes for 
five years.  What does the minister responsible for small 
business give us?  Bill C-53 indicates only the amount of money 
that Canadians can lose on small businesses that fail.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If the size of the loan and the size of the annual sales of the 
business were reduced, we would have a system that serves small 
businesses.  We would also have a system with a drastically 
reduced rate of abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses create jobs.  It is not the government that 
creates jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why should Canadian taxpayers support the increase in the amount 
of money taxpayers are on the hook for if the program is flawed 
and we are not fixing the program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the same government that gives big businesses big 
subsidies. The Liberals have just given Bombardier a $25 million 
interest free loan.  Do the Liberals give interest free loans to 
small businesses?  No.  Canadians know they do not.  The Liberals 
are also giving big corporations sole source contracts, for 
example a $2.85 billion sole source NATO contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is not in accord with the Liberal government 
but is in accord with successful business. We will continue to 
push for transparency in government.  It is not enough for the 
government to say that the loans are fully repayable on 
commercial terms.  At the heart of it, we want to see it as a 
payment so that taxpayers can be confident that arrangements can 
be made.  We will welcome Bombardier's help in pushing the 
government to implement a reporting regime that would protect 
both the company's competitive position as well as allow public 
scrutiny of the grant program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians know the abuses in the small business loans program. 
We know that the parameters of the program need to be 
constricted.  We know that a lot of work needs to get done so 
that financing is available to small businesses in our country. 
Helping our small businesses access financing is one of the most 
important things we can do for job creation in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are tinkering with the small business loans 
program. The Liberals do not see the need to improve the program. 
There is a need because if the problems of the program were 
addressed, there would be more financing for small businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses face a high tax burden.  The government has 
placed tax increase after tax increase on Canadian businesses and 
individuals.  We must not forget that individuals own small 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Payroll taxes, including the CPP and EI premiums, and the GST 
are killing jobs in Canada.  The personal and retail tax rates 
are killing small business owners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are doing nothing about the underlying economic 
problems small businesses face. The Liberals by ignoring these 
issues are killing job creation.  I want to find out from my 
colleagues, where are those jobs which they promised? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals are failing us in this regard.  They are not taking 
advantage of the opportunity Bill C-53 offers to create jobs. 
They are not even doing what the CFIB has been asking them to do 
for the last 10 years.  The CFIB represents 90,000 businesses 
across Canada from virtually every sector of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can see the long laundry list of problems and areas that need 
to be improved in the operation of the small business loans 
program which the CFIB presented to the Standing Senate Committee 
on Banking, Trade and Commerce in July 1998. The CFIB's 
presentation to the committee refers to the CFIB's 1993 letter to 
the Tory minister responsible for small business. 
The department should look into and correct various elements of 
the act such as capital leasing and delivery mechanism.  Lack of 
working capital is not covered in this bill. The department needs 
better tools to monitor the loan program. The department needs 
better forecasting techniques. The department is not reviewing 
risk analysis in this bill.  Loans made to related parties and 
charging of administration fees are not reviewed.  Related 
articles in the Income Tax Act need to be fixed so that this bill 
can be effective.  The financial information presented to 
parliament is not enough, following a cash basis versus accrual 
system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no provision for losses on outstanding balances in this 
Small Business Loans Act which is $6 billion.  The borrower is 
not guaranteed but the bank is guaranteed for its bad decisions. 
Thus the objective is to promote the small businessman and not 
the small business.  The job creation record is very bad.  The 
displacement effect is negative.  Job creation figures under SBLA 
have been inflated by this government as much as five times. 
Industry Canada does not do an audit of an account until a file 
becomes a claim file.  A complete cost benefit analysis has never 
been done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The list is long but my time is up. I urge Industry Canada to 
look into these conditions so that we can improve and make this 
program effective.  Therefore we cannot support this bill.

listened very intently to my colleague from Surrey Central. But I 
am really not sure what is happening.

It wants to support small business but not through the Canada 
small business financing act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to clarify his position.  I did hear 
that there are items like audits and so forth which by the way, I 
would like to inform my colleague, are included in the bill.  So

probably is not up to date on how many recommendations from the

</I></B></P><P align=left>When we debated Bill C-21 we had concerns and we mentioned them. 
The auditor general has a full chapter on this, chapter 29, and 
he has included all the details.  I had a long list of the 
changes which are expected to be made in this bill so that this 
bill can be effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will support this bill once it is effective.  It will be a 
good bill provided these changes are introduced which are not 
introduced at this time.  Who would not support modernization and 
improvement to small businesses?  Who would not support 
increasing the availability of financing for small businesses for 
their expansion?  We will, but only when this whole program is 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system is abused.  The banks are using all kinds of 
practices to abuse the system. 
It is not the small businessman who is taking advantage of the 
system.  There are many examples that can be put together.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Wentworth—Burlington, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to draw the attention of the House and anyone 
watching this debate to the fact that there has been quite an 
innovation introduced into this bill that I am very much in 
favour of.  I do not think members of the House have noted it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the suggestion that the small business loan program 
will be extended as a pilot project to the voluntary sector.  In 
other words, the minister is suggesting this at least as an 
experiment to see what it is like to provide loan guarantees to 
organizations financing charities and non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is important here is that very clearly the not for profit 
sector is taking more and more of a role in society in providing 
certain social services, certain benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many senses this is a positive thing and in another sense it 
is a negative thing.  What it really means, especially in 
Ontario, is that the Ontario government is getting out of 
providing the social services that governments normally provide. 
It is leaving it to non-governmental organizations like charities 
and non-profit organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This minister has recognized that there is a major change coming 
in society.  He is obviously, in this legislation and in the 
regulations that will follow, preparing for it by providing at 
least an experimental try at how we go about financing or giving 
loan guarantees to those who would finance not for profit 
businesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are dangers to this because not for profit organizations 
operate as businesses but they have advantages in the sense that 
they do not have to pay taxes.  If they are a charity, they 
actually can issue tax receipts that help them cut their costs 
when they enter into the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lot of controversy out there right now with not for 
profit organizations competing with for profit organizations in 
the marketplace. As an example, in my riding there is quite a 
controversy about the YMCA coming in to build an enormous 
facility for one of my communities.  It will be financed entirely 
out of memberships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The YMCA is a charity and the complaint is that private 
entrepreneurs who are selling fitness in the area are complaining 
that they are getting unfair competition from a charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some merit to the complaint of for profit companies 
when they find themselves up against a charity or non-profit 
organization that has the advantage of tax receipts or tax 
breaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another instance is in Winnipeg where the Habitat for Humanity 
charity is in competition with a for profit used lumber recycler 
called Happy Harry's. Happy Harry creates jobs.  He pays taxes 
and he is up against a non-profit organization that has 
advantages in the marketplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The warning is simply this.  A not for profit organization is an 
umbrella term for non-profit organizations that do not pay taxes 
and for charities that do not pay taxes and issue tax receipts. 
Those are two categories of not for profit organizations that 
stand to benefit from the proposal in this legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot assume that because this is a non-profit organization 
or a charity it will be running more efficiently.  The reality is 
that no matter what kind of business someone is in, if there is a 
profit incentive it usually leads to efficiencies.  Take away the 
profit incentive then we run into the danger of a lack of 
accountability in the actual organization, the actual costs and 
the revenues and expenditures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I think this is a very intriguing and interesting 
experiment proposed by the minister and it is a good thing that 
we do this pilot project, I stress that we need to have a strong 
debate at the committee level and we need to make it very well 
known in the entire business community that we are proposing this 
initiative.  We then may find a way we can support particularly 
charities that are engaged in business activities to the public 
good.  However, we have to define the parameters and those 
parameters can only be defined through proper debate in this 
House and in committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is certainly a pleasure to rise today and speak in 
this debate on Bill C-53.  I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague from Prince George—Bulkley Valley should we have time 
left. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The title of this bill is a real mouthful in itself.  Bill C-53 
is an act to increase the availability of financing for the 
establishment, expansion, modernization and improvement of small 
businesses.  It sounds like we are going to be all things to all 
people here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every area of economic activity we find taxpayer sponsored 
programs whose objectives claim to be that they will help people 
work more or expand their businesses or make more money.  The 
problem is this is precisely what people naturally want to do 
with their businesses in the first place.  What we see is that 
many of these government efforts are actually taking resources 
away from people in taxes who would otherwise prosper on their 
own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some members of this House may accuse me of preaching some form 
of economic Darwinism, that the government should disappear and 
let the strong survive at the expense of the weak.  I do not 
believe this would be a formula for success right across the 
board.  There are many situations in which incentives can be 
provided to encourage certain outcomes but clearly we cannot be 
all things to all people and we have to let small businesses make 
many choices on their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, people naturally want to succeed.  That is the 
direction that many small businesses like to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a variety of things a government can do to encourage 
business success, just as there are many things it does to defeat 
that success, and this bill does little to address either side of 
those conditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment we have many questions about government 
participation in small business financing.  The auditor general 
raised several of them in his spring report.  His figures 
indicated that 46% of loans under the SBLA could have been 
handled privately through normal financial channels.  We have to 
wonder if a moral hazard is not at work here.  By that I mean 
because the banks have a way to deflect risk on to the taxpayer 
through this program, are they inclined to get on the SBLA 
bandwagon because it is there? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no hard numbers to say this program is the difference 
between success or failure at getting that financing. We know 
that the CFIB places a high priority on access to financing as a 
major factor for business success, and I do not question those 
numbers, but do we have in this bill the best or most effective 
way of doing that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recent figures indicate that 80% of small business loan 
applications are successful but we have no figures to indicate 
whether that is an optimum level or not.  Is 100% a healthy 
level, for example, or would that expose lenders to extraordinary 
risk?  In other words, should the government step in and drive 
that loan approval rate up to 100% as a policy objective using 
taxpayer money to subsidize it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a small business owner in a couple of different fields, I 
have a great deal of sympathy for people who want to go into 
business and need that first boost of capital to get them going. 
Of course that does not mean that everybody with the same dream 
is equally qualified to pursue it, so there are bound to be 
rejections for a variety of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at where those applications ended up we see that 68% 
went to the chartered banks, 27% went to other financial 
institutions, credit unions and such, and 11% went to the small 
business loans program.  No one on the government side of the 
House can say that the 11% would go without financing if the SBLA 
were not there.  As we know from the principle of moral hazard, 
people choose the easy route only if it is available.  Without 
the vast web of bureaucratic programs paid for by an equally vast 
web of taxation, factors in the financial services sector of this 
country could behave in a different fashion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it is, the number of high risk loans has been increasing 
along with the default rate and bankruptcies, although Industry 
Canada has so far kept that report very close. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of missing documents, we also have to wonder about the 
cost benefit of this program.  This is one argument that pops up 
to try to legitimize many government programs, particularly when 
taxpayers see those billion dollar bottom lines starting to add 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the finance minister often reminds us, governments have to 
make tough choices.  What we rarely see is this government making 
a choice to give up on a cherished boondoggle when it is shown 
that money is not being spent in a way that has a clear, positive 
return to the taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often we see good money chasing bad in a futile effort to prove 
that a program is working, not because it was wrong or 
unnecessary in the first place, but because not enough money has 
been poured down that sinkhole.  This kind of thinking is 
epidemic in government and never leads to good choices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be looking at innovative new ways of making financial 
support more available to our small and medium business sector. 
In many countries around the world, and I understand even in 
certain regions of this country, there is a system of micro 
lending.  Loans as small as a few hundred dollars show a 
tremendous return on the dollars placed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a system in the U.S. where lenders are required to 
commit 6% of their profits to the communities in which they are 
located.  Of course there are hundreds of banks in the U.S. 
versus a dozen in Canada, so the locality does not have the same 
relevance.  But perhaps there is a way to implement such a 
requirement in Canada, as long as it does not lead us back to the 
same situation we have now where the government seeks to force 
choices on its lenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think more important than inventing new government programs, 
however, is taking a good look at the environment that exists for 
business in Canada.  Should we be rushing to enact this kind of 
legislation when this government has yet to digest the Mintz 
report on business taxation?  The professor warned that 
governments were relying increasingly on profit insensitive 
taxes; taxes and charges that were not related to whether the 
business was succeeding or failing, but were demanded of the 
business owners regardless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in recent years an explosion of user fees, which 
are not by themselves a bad thing.  That is, they are not bad if 
the fee goes to the service being charged in the first place. 
This government is not alone in preferring to pour all of its 
revenues into one basket, but it has a lot to answer for in many 
areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gasoline taxes are outrageously high by themselves, but we see 
very little of this windfall going toward transportation 
infrastructure that would assist businesses of all kinds.  Worst 
of all are the payroll taxes that are a direct and undeniable 
killer of jobs and entrepreneurship in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only does this government insist on imposing ridiculously 
high rates, it also raises rates such as the CPP under the 
auspices of what I mentioned earlier.  Is the program not 
working?  Pour money down that sinkhole. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The case of employment insurance premiums has already been 
broached in this House and by no means are we done with that 
topic.  Yes, the premiums have been reduced from the highs under 
the former government, but this government's own experts are 
declaring that they must go lower.  Under the law they are 
supposed to go lower, but the finance minister, instead of 
returning money to employers and employees, threatens to change 
the law and keep the money for choices that have nothing to do 
with the original tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians should take note that the finance minister has in fact 
already taken that money to apply against his deficit last year, 
so it is actually part of the Liberal smoke and mirror budget 
plan to argue about where else to spend money that is already 
owed to another program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is that this bill is a questionable necessity and fails 
to address the real needs of the business constituency that it 
claims to help.  What entrepreneurs in Canada need is the ability 
to keep more of the profits they generate.  Capital gains taxes 
need to be at least minimized and at best eliminated.  Payroll 
taxes need to be kept low and directed where they were intended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has to be a serious study of the burden of paperwork and 
overlapping regulations that exist in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The GST regime should be overhauled for one thing, but the 
layers of bureaucracy between federal, provincial and municipal 
administrations have to be examined as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employers need a flexible, well educated, motivated labour 
force.  Workers obviously need to keep more of their money as 
well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, this government has to take a serious look at the 
flexibility and competitiveness of our whole financial services 
sector.  We have the MacKay task force report to look at.  We 
should take the opportunity, use our combined imagination and 
innovation in reforming the regulations of this industry to 
provide real access to reasonable cost financing for business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that this government is in such a hurry to 
push through Bill C-53 without answering some of the problems 
that have been mentioned here today.  What Bill C-53 represents 
is not a helping hand to business but the hand of a government 
stuck in the past with no new ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly commend and agree with my colleagues on their motion 
earlier today to send this bill back to committee for more study.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George—Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise again in the House to speak to 
Bill C-53. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am probably somewhat qualified to speak about small business 
and some of the challenges it faces, particularly when it comes 
to financing, having spent my entire life before politics in 
small business.  I certainly understand the challenges that small 
business faces today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The thing that really disturbs me about the Liberal government 
is that it truly believes that the best help it can give to small 
business is to be in its face with programs, regulations and 
plans.  It thinks it is being of assistance to small business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>CFIB surveys over the last few years have asked the question: 
What can government do to help you?  The number one answer, year 
after year, has been “Just get away from us and let us run our 
businesses.  We know better than you how to run them”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government does not understand that request.  It 
believes it has to be involved in every single part of the 
economy and in businesses whether they are large or small, either 
through regulations or programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not convinced that it is the government's place to be a 
guarantor of small business loans through its small business 
program.  I think the small business community in this country 
would be quite happy for government to get out of that and let 
the private lending sector look after their requirements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are those who say that the banks are not doing it.  I 
think that the regulations which are in place are a disincentive 
for banks to get involved in small business financing.  They are 
trying.  Let us give them credit for what they are trying to do. 
But the fact is, if we look at the banking community in other 
countries, and we will take the U.S. as an example, they have 
some very creative ways of lending to small business that we do 
not have in Canada because our regulations do not permit it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember in the 1980s there were many small businesses moving 
from Vancouver down to Bellingham and Blaine in the state of 
Washington because the banks down there were saying “Come down 
here and we will show you how you can establish your business, 
how you can expand your business and even how you can start up a 
business”.  The banks would provide the funding.  They had a 
number of plans and options, ranging from some sort of 
involvement in the company itself that was phased out over a 
number of years while the loan was being paid off, to some very 
creative venture capital financing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We simply do not have that in Canada because the government's 
regulations have forbidden it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best thing this government could do, instead of bringing in, 
extending or amending yet another program that will keep it 
involved in small business lending, would be to get out of the 
way of bona fide private lending institutions and let them do the 
lending.  Let them bring in some sort of risk-based lending for 
small business.  They have said in their presentations that they 
think this is a possibility, if they were allowed to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many people in the country who have some great ideas 
about how to start a small business, whether it is a small 
home-based business or a business they are going to set up in an 
industrial park or retail area, but they just do not have the 
assets needed to go to the traditional lending institutions to 
get the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They cannot do it through small business loans either.  They 
have to have some sort of security to offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the traditional lending institutions were permitted to bring 
in creative lending for small business, right down to micro 
lending, then I think this would probably be the greatest gift 
the government could give to small business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are even greater disincentives to small business that this 
government refuses to recognize.  I cannot talk about small 
business without talking about the incredibly burdensome tax 
regime that the government has laid upon the backs of small 
business in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Small businesses create about 90% of the employment in this 
country, and yet they are overburdened by the current tax regime. 
Taxes eat into their profits.  Taxes eat into their opportunity 
for expansion.  Taxes eat into their opportunity to hire more 
employees.  The regulations are all very costly.  These are all 
tremendous disincentives for small business to grow, prosper and 
expand, and yet the government does not recognize it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not just talking about the regular corporate taxes they 
pay.  The government has effectively decided that it is not going 
to change the capital gains taxes which small businesses have to 
pay.  No matter how many times the CFIB has told the government 
that the capital gains tax is a terribly burdensome tax, the 
government has done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to the member for Broadview—Greenwood who said 
earlier that the Reform Party has just woken up to the plight of 
small business and taxes in this country.  Since 1993 when we 
arrived in the House we have been talking on a daily basis about 
the tax regime in this country.  Since 1988 we have been talking 
about the tax regime in this country and how it affects people in 
every walk of life, small business or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, that is why there were 52 of us elected in the 
1993 election.  We were talking about the very things that were 
bothering Canadians.  That is why, contrary to the wishes and the 
dreams of the Liberal government, we returned in 1997 as Her 
Majesty's loyal official opposition, to the surprise of the 
Liberal government.  We were talking about taxes.  We were 
talking about a government that was in the face of not only 
private citizens, but small businesses all across this country. 
Those are all disincentives.  That is why we are here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will talk about this on a daily basis.  We will never stop 
because it is a big issue in this country.  When we talk about an 
engine that creates 90% of the employment in this country, it is 
not something we could ever stop talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we find that the government is about to do it again with the 
EI surplus.  The finance minister knows very well that a surplus 
over a certain level, according to the guidelines that have been 
set down by the EI commission, has to be returned to the people 
who pay into the fund in the form of EI premium reduction.  That 
is perfectly clear.  That is what the law says. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister, by continuing to take the surplus after 
the date laid down, will be breaking the law.  It has come to our 
attention that he is going to change the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I pointed out the other day in question period, it is sort of 
like Jesse James making bank robbery legal.  We can draw the same 
comparison.  He did not want to break the law, so he changed the 
law to make it legal to rob banks.  That is what our finance 
minister is going to do.  He is planning to change the law.  He 
is going to scoop that $6 billion over and above the allowable 
rainy day surplus, the amount set down by the commission to 
sustain the EI fund, when that money should be going back into 
the hands of the employers and the employees in the form of EI 
premium reductions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each percentage of increase in EI premiums costs about 40,000 
jobs in this country.  Each time EI rises by 1% that is 40,000 
jobs.  It is estimated that since 1988 when the Tory government 
was in power, the way it set EI rates cost the country 130,000 
jobs.  The Liberals have reduced it somewhat but it has another 
$6 billion to pour back into it by reducing it by one per cent or 
one and a half per cent more.  If we work the numbers back, that 
would probably create 40,000 or 50,000 jobs.  Who would not want 
that? The unemployment rate in my city is at about 17% right now. 
If we had some tax relief and if we had a premier who knew 
something about how to run a province we might have an 
unemployment rate that was comparable with that of the rest of 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberal government believes this bill will be a big 
help to small business in Canada, it will not be.  The best help 
the government can provide is to lower EI taxes.  It can reduce 
regulations, in particular the federal-provincial regulations 
that overlap and cause a lot of confusion and expense to small 
business.  In general it can get its hands out of the pockets of 
small businessmen and let them do business.  Let them continue to 
expand, be prosperous and hire people in this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments would normally have been included in a regular 
omnibus bill.  I felt that several were too important to wait 
until the next major criminal law amendment package.  The 
government is particularly concerned about making changes to the 
Criminal Code year and a day rule and conditional sentence 
provisions, and the provinces are seeking other important changes 
so we have decided to proceed with them at this time. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament has the responsibility, and the constitutional power, 
to pass legislation on criminal law, but the provinces are the 
ones responsible for their application.  We must therefore take 
into consideration what the people who administer these 
administrations tell us works and what does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We meet with the provinces regularly, and take their 
expectations into consideration in drawing up action plans 
relating to criminal law.  Many of the proposed changes to the 
legislation are the result of that process. 
When these changes are being deliberated, we need to keep in 
mind that they are the outcome of provincial demands and 
proposals, and that the provinces play a significant role in the 
application of criminal law in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of my colleagues to some of the more 
important changes were are proposing.  Concerns have recently 
been expressed about the Criminal Code rule which limits 
prosecutions for homicide and other offences which involve the 
death of the victim.  These offences can be prosecuted only if 
the victim dies within one year and a day of the last act of the 
accused on which the offence is based.  Needless to say, this is 
a very old rule.  It predates Confederation and the first 
Criminal Code of 1892.  Authors have traced it in English 
criminal law back to the middle ages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the modern era the rule can only serve to block prosecutions 
which could now be placed before the courts on their merits.  It 
has been criticized by lawyers and academics.  After due 
consideration this government agrees that it should be repealed. 
Modern forensic science has increasingly made it possible for us 
to prove that the accused caused or contributed to the death of 
the victim even where the victim survives for an extended period. 
At the same time advances in medical science can result in 
victims who would have died quickly in earlier eras surviving for 
extended periods on life support systems before they eventually 
succumb to injuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such cases are best placed before the courts for a determination 
of whether the accused committed a crime which caused death.  The 
year and a day rule prevents this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation proposes to simply repeal the time limit.  This 
would leave the existing Criminal Code and case law rules for 
establishing the causation of death intact.  Essentially the 
rules say that where the accused is proven to have done anything 
which contributed to the victim's death in any way, the accused 
can be convicted of having caused that death if the contribution 
was more than minimal or negligible.  This was always the case 
where victims died soon after the offence.  We now propose to 
apply the same principle regardless of when the victim dies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot reopen cases where the year and a day period has 
already expired when the repeal takes effect.  The charter 
prevents parliament from creating retroactive criminal offences 
or expanding existing offences to capture actions which would not 
have been caught by the legislation when they occurred.  As a 
matter of policy, however, we are anxious to have the changes 
apply as soon as possible.  There is a good argument that cases 
in which the time period is still running when the law changes 
may be be affected by the repeal without infringing the charter. 
The legislation provides for this.  There is also no reason to 
delay proclamation of this change.  The bill provides that the 
repeal will take effect on the day of royal assent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of Bill C-51, the government also proposes series of 
changes to sentencing provisions.  These address policy concerns 
and correct oversights which have been identified since the 1995 
overhaul of sentencing law. 
It took effect in September 1996.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important of these are changes to the provisions 
dealing with conditional sentences. These sentences are an 
important means of dealing effectively with offenders while 
ensuring that custodial resources are focused on those who 
require custody under established sentencing principles.  But 
concerns have arisen which must be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since September 1996 it has become apparent that in some cases 
where offenders breach sentence conditions they cannot 
effectively be brought before the courts and dealt with before 
the sentence runs out and the courts lose jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with this problem the amendments I am proposing would 
stop the running of time on the sentence when the offender is in 
breach.  The time period, starting when a warrant to arrest the 
offender was issued or the offender was arrested without one and 
ending with the conclusion of court hearings into the alleged 
breach, would not count as time served on the sentence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where an offender is found not to have committed a breach, to 
have had a reasonable excuse or there is some other compelling 
reason, the lost time could later be recredited by the court. 
Other than this, offenders will not get any credit for the time 
lost.  Stopping the running of the sentence will also ensure that 
the courts retain jurisdiction over offenders serving conditional 
sentences until they have served all their time without breaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If an offender absconds, his sentence remains in effect 
indefinitely until he can be arrested and brought back before the 
courts.  The amendments would also clarify arrest powers to 
ensure that those in breach of conditional sentences can be 
arrested on the same basis as if they had committed an indictable 
offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposed legislation also contains other changes to Criminal 
Code sentencing provisions.  The 1995 amendments created general 
rules for the administration of fine penalties and several of the 
proposed amendments will clarify the application of these rules 
to more specific offence provisions of the Criminal Code and 
other statutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where an offence carries a minimum prison term the amendments 
provide that a fine could be imposed in addition to the minimum 
but not instead of it.  Where the offence provision requires a 
minimum fine, the amendments would make clear that the general 
rule which requires the courts to consider the offender's ability 
to pay in setting fines does not allow judges to go below the 
mandatory minimum levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members who represent northern constituencies will know, 
a new diamond mine industry is beginning to take shape in the 
Northwest Territories. This is expected to bring employment and 
economic benefits to the territories, but the high value of uncut 
diamonds has raised concerns about the potential for theft and 
the possible use of diamonds as a means of smuggling or money 
laundering by organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To protect the new industry and Canadians, the proposed 
amendments would modernize old provisions dealing with the theft 
and illegal possession of precious metals and ores. The term 
previous metal would be replaced with valuable mineral to include 
diamonds and other non-metallic minerals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would also create a federal power to prosecute 
some offences where uncut diamonds are involved to respond 
effectively to organized crime and interprovincial smuggling 
activities.  This would be concurrent with provincial 
jurisdiction so that either level of government could prosecute. 
This would allow for federal prosecutions where an offence which 
started in the territories involved one or more provinces as well 
or where a major domestic or international organized crime 
interests are involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The law does not affect any existing provincial powers and would 
leave it open to federal and provincial officials to co-ordinate 
who would prosecute on a case by case basis. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fighting against organized crime effectively is a priority of 
this government, and we are proposing many other changes to 
fight various activities involving organized crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, 
if passed, would amend the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act so that persons found guilty of organized crime activities 
would not be entitled to any sort of accelerated parole review.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation would permit electronic surveillance in the case 
of serious offences involving prostitution and investigation of 
prostitution telephone networks and indirect involvement in 
organized crime. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Organized crime in Canada has also been linked to telemarketing 
fraud and related offences.  My colleague, the Minister of 
Industry, already has amendments before parliament to criminalize 
various forms of deceptive telemarketing activity and to allow 
wiretapping to investigate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this legislation I am proposing an additional amendment which 
would allow the proceeds of deceptive telemarketing offences, 
which can be a major source of income for organized crime groups, 
to be targeted using the existing Criminal Code proceeds of crime 
provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is concerned about telemarketing fraud and 
related practices, and we regard the confiscation of illegal 
profit as a major step to counteract it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has also been asked by the provinces for changes 
to Criminal Code provisions dealing with gambling.  Generally 
gambling is a criminal offence unless the activity involved falls 
within one of a series of exemptions created in the Criminal Code 
such as those for operations conducted or licensed by the 
provinces or parimutuel betting on horse races approved by the 
minister of agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes I am proposing would create two new exemptions. 
First, it would allow dice games in operations that are conducted 
and managed by the provinces.  Second, it would allow gambling 
operations on international cruise ships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House that changes are not intended to 
increase the level of gambling activity in Canada.  Nor do we 
expect them to have this effect.  What we are seeking to do is to 
ensure that gambling and tourism operations in Canada compete 
with those of other countries, especially the United States, on 
an equal basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dice games are not a major part of casino gambling, but casinos 
which offer them may have a competitive advantage over those in 
adjacent jurisdictions.  Ontario is particularly concerned that 
its operations offer a similar range of games to those in 
neighbouring U.S. states.  Once this amendment takes effect it 
will be up to each province to decide whether it wishes to allow 
dice games in its casinos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of international cruise ships, the amendments would 
allow Canadian registered cruise ships which fall under Canadian 
law regardless of where they are and foreign registered cruise 
ships in Canadian waters to offer gambling to passengers.  The 
changes also ensure that the operators of cruise ships which 
enter Canadian waters will not be charged with importing the 
gambling equipment in their casinos.  This is expected to provide 
direct benefits to the cruise industry itself and indirect 
benefits to tourism and other business in the ports where cruise 
ships call. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian registered cruise ships can compete effectively while 
abroad and foreign registered ships will not be deterred from 
calling on Canadian ports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cruise industry is an important and growing part of regional 
economies, particularly in the St. Lawrence valley of Quebec and 
the coastal waters of British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to be able to propose amendments which will address 
the economic concerns and interests of these provinces and their 
populations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area of the criminal law which is of concern to my 
provincial counterparts is that of prostitution.  Concerns have 
been expressed to my predecessor and myself that the 1997 
Criminal Code amendments making it an offence to obtain the 
prostitution services of a person under 18 would be difficult to 
prosecute.  The provinces had asked us to bring forward an 
amendment changing the offence from obtaining the services of a 
young person to communicating with a young person for that 
purpose.  I am happy to propose such an amendment in this 
legislation.  Similar wording in other prostitution offences has 
been held not to offend the charter by the courts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several changes in the area of search and seizure are also 
proposed in this legislation.  The Criminal Code already provides 
the courts with the power to authorize the use of electronic 
surveillance of telephones and specified locations. Where this 
permission is given, it also authorizes police to install the 
necessary listening devices, but the legislation says nothing 
about their subsequent removal. The proposed amendments would 
address this situation by clarifying that judicial permission to 
install and use these devices also includes permission to remove 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In many cases, the initial authorization runs out before police 
can safely go back to retrieve the devices.  In such cases, the 
proposed amendments would allow the courts to specifically 
authorize their removal. The wording governing a series of search 
warrant provisions would also be amended to standardize the 
provisions and ensure that only public officers who have law 
enforcement responsibilities and peace officers could execute 
search warrants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 the Criminal Code was amended to allow a justice who 
denies an accused person bail to also order that the accused not 
communicate with any witnesses or victims while in custody. This 
was identified by the provinces as particularly important in 
domestic violence cases where victims are often subjected to 
immediate pressure not to provide evidence or co-operate with the 
police. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provincial authorities have subsequently pointed out that these 
non-communication orders are effective only after the accused has 
been brought before a justice for a bail hearing. This could be 
several days after the initial arrest, during which time accused 
persons can and do contact victims or witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To respond to the province's concerns, the proposed legislation 
would create a parallel provision allowing the first justice who 
sees the accused after arrest to make an immediate 
non-communication order. Once imposed, the temporary order would 
bar communication while the accused is held pending the bail 
hearing.  It would be reviewed by the justice who hears the bail 
application, who could replace it with a non-communication order 
pending trial whether the accused is held in custody or released 
on bail. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is committed to the ongoing review of the 
criminal law and to the maintenance of effective legislative 
measures to protect society. As part of this effort, this 
legislation contains a series of other measures to address 
concerns about the legislation, adjust offences and punishments, 
modernize the statute and correct oversights enacted in other 
recent legislative initiatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will continue to monitor the legislation and bring forward 
further changes as the need for them becomes apparent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to the support of all members of the House for 
this important Criminal Code omnibus legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  In conformity with an order adopted 
earlier this day, I believe it is in order now to see the time as 
6.30 p.m. even though it is not quite that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until 10 a.m. 
tomorrow, pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
