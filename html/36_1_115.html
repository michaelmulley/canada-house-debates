it is unchecked, if it is not dealt with at the beginning, the 
frequency increases, the intensity of assaults increases and 
judgment becomes impaired.  It is very difficult to get out of 
the situation.  The risk of bodily harm or even death approaches 
certainty as time goes on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to introduce this bill as a small step toward 
addressing domestic violence.  The bill would require mandatory 
counselling for those convicted of domestic assault in addition 
to any other charges or penalties imposed by the courts.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
move that the third report of the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development, presented on Monday, May 
25, 1998, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take this opportunity to make my colleagues in 
the House of Commons and all of our citizens in this wonderful 
country called Canada aware of a most crucial report that was 
tabled by the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable 
Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The third report of our committee was entitled “Enforcing 
Canada's Pollution Laws:  The Public Interest Must Come First”. 
The report was tabled on May 25, 1998.  This being Environment 
Week, it is a most crucial time to bring this to the forefront 
and to apprise all of our members of the details of this 
committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pursuant to Standing Order 108, the Standing Committee on 
Environment and Sustainable Development proceeded to study the 
enforcement of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act and the 
pollution provisions under the Fisheries Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 24 recommendations.  These are the highlights of some 
of the recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most crucial that the Minister of the Environment provide 
the committee with amounts budgeted and actually expended for 
inspections, investigations and prosecutions related to the 
enforcement of CEPA and the pollution prevention provisions of 
the Fisheries Act and, also, that any report prepared for the 
review process of the department in relation to enforcement be 
provided to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee also recommended that the Minister of the 
Environment and the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans develop and 
publish a comprehensive enforcement and compliance policy in 
relation to the pollution prevention provisions of the Fisheries 
Act within six months of the tabling of this report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It recommended that the Minister of the Environment ensure that 
the regulated parties are informed of their legal obligations 
under the federal environment laws and that such laws and 
regulations continue to apply and that they must be observed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many instances in which agreements are made between 
provincial jurisdictions and federal jurisdictions which fail to 
highlight that federal legal obligations are still in tact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recommended that the new CEPA legislation, Bill 
C-32, enable inspectors and investigators to be designated and 
given the full powers of a peace officer.  Bill C-32 is now being 
reviewed under the House process.  Our inspectors and 
investigators who are out in the field have little power to issue 
fines, aside from creating warnings and starting the prosecution 
process.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also recommended was that the minister establish without delay a 
professional intelligence gathering and analysis capacity.  This 
is most crucial because pollution affects our communities, our 
health and our families.  We must therefore establish an 
intelligence agency among police officers like the RCMP, the 
provincial police and the customs officers who control our border 
crossing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was also a recommendation to have whistleblower protection 
for anything dealing with federal obligations.  We have many 
labour groups working in our ports, our manufacturing companies 
and our industries who may be aware of infractions and must 
therefore have whistleblower protection in order to protect their 
careers.  There will be instances where they must extend their 
authority and highlight the infractions that their company or 
their employer may be inflicting on our environment.  This is a 
most crucial recommendation that challenges this government to 
consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should revise the current structure of enforcement 
and establish regional branches and that the decisions not made 
by officials having managerial functions must be made by members 
of the enforcement personnel.  Enforcement decisions must be made 
by enforcement personnel, not managerial or political decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation is delaying the signing of the proposed 
subagreement on the enforcement under the Canadian council of 
environment ministers.  Under the harmonization accord that was 
recently signed there was a subagreement called enforcement which 
was supposed to be introduced later.  We strongly recommend that 
this be delayed because the present enforcement structure and the 
federal responsibilities presently are not being complied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should publish all enforcement data relating to 
CEPA, the Fisheries Act and the manganese based fuels act.  All 
these must be published for the media to scrutinize for the 
public's interest and for leaders and politicians in the 
legislatures of the provinces, the territories and the House of 
Commons to scrutinize the abilities of the enforcement of this 
country.  These environmental laws are most crucial for the 
future health of our children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister should be required to publish and table officially 
in parliament a detailed annual report on the enforcement actions 
taken in the previous year relating to all the laws and 
regulations of Environment Canada mandated under CEPA and the 
Fisheries Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Presently we hear instances that the fisheries minister is 
required to table the report here in the House of Commons and has 
not been able to because the provincial governments have not been 
able to give him the data.  The harmonization accord has many 
holes in it.  If these different levels of government cannot be 
involved in providing a report to the House of Commons there is 
something drastically wrong with the relationship we have with 
the provincial departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major recommendation that challenges this government and 
the environment minister is to conduct an indepth study to 
determine whether methyl mercury released in the aquatic 
environment as a result of the creation of reservoirs, dams and 
hydro projects in the great rivers of our northern regions is 
accumulation in the fish and the food cycle.  This must be 
realized because under the CEPA regulations mercury is considered 
to be a natural substance and not a human induced toxin into our 
environment.  However, because the building of dams increases 
mercury in our food system we need to have an indepth study on 
how to address this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important recommendation that the minister is 
challenged to seek and the Government of Canada grant is more 
resources to ensure proper enforcement on the environment 
legislation.  Time and time again witnesses who were questioned 
in committee said there was a lack of resources as a result of 
cutbacks from program reviews one and two.  These were financial 
reviews, not environmental enforcement reviews for the protection 
of our environment. 
These were reviews to see where cutbacks should be properly made, 
surgically cut for the financial wellness of this country.  We 
see the financial well-being of this country.  We see an 
exuberant amount of surpluses in programs that previously were in 
deficit. Now is the time to draw a priority and consider the 
environment as a number one priority, especially in this 
beautiful country.

<A HREF="#LINKT3"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the report and the recommendations are a 
result of public meetings held from February 18 to March 26, 
1998.  The committee heard various witnesses from industry, from 
aboriginal peoples, from labour organizations, environmental 
groups and government officials, numerous submissions from 
stakeholders from across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this consideration we would like to note the bravery and 
congratulate the field staff members of Environment Canada who 
came out and were honest in their perception of the challenges 
they face in their daily operations as inspectors, as 
investigators in enforcing the CEPA regulations and the fisheries 
regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The key points in the report which are highlighted are 
Environment Canada's enforcement responsibilities and the need 
for effective enforcement, enforcement problems under 
federal-provincial-territorial agreements and involving the 
Canadian public, which is the most crucial aspect of the report, 
the public's right to know and the public's right to the 
protection of our environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw to the attention of the House a book that was most 
crucial.  A quote from this book is that citizens of nations 
should have a bill of rights.  The charter of rights and freedoms 
of this country should be considered to include environmental 
protection so that we are free of the poisons and the toxins of 
the many industries that indiscriminately induce these toxins and 
pollutants into our water, our air and our land, the very nature 
of the life we are going to depend on for future generation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In context we have the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. 
That is our bill of rights.  That is what defines the protection 
of our environment.  But the act is useless if it is not 
enforced.  Without a police officer system on a highway, who is 
going to keep track of the speed limits?  Who is going to keep 
track of the traffic infractions?  Who is going to keep track of 
all the violations that take place from day to day without the 
volunteer aspect that we expect from our citizens?  The CEPA 
regulations and this recommendation from the committee highlight 
that enforcement is a crucial aspect of the protection of our 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under CEPA there are 26 regulations that deal with PCBs, ocean 
dumping, clean air and water, CFCs, dioxins, furons and fuels. 
All these issues deal with every constituency in this country. 
All members of parliament should be aware of the implications, of 
the inability of the government and the department to enforce 
these laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Fisheries Act we also add fish habitat, the rivers, 
the lakes, the oceans and the coastlines.  We have the drastic 
results of the Atlantic fisheries and the decline in our fish, 
the Pacific coast, the changes in our environment, the protection 
of the fish species and the very economy that depends on it. A 
total of 32 regulations fall under CEPA enforcement and the 
fisheries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recent times there have been seven equivalency and 
administrative agreements with the provinces and the territories. 
Three are specifically under CEPA and two under the Fisheries 
Act.  One of them we highlight is Quebec, federal pulp and paper 
regulations, a major agreement between federal and provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Northwest Territories is defining a framework agreement in 
the five regional offices that comply with the enforcement and 
the interpretation, the Atlantic regional office, the Quebec 
regional office, the Ontario regional office, the prairie and 
northern regional office and the Pacific-Yukon regional office. 
These regional offices play an important role.  In some of the 
data we were provided with, between 1996 and 1997 there 701 
inspections under CEPA, 53 investigations were conducted, 2 
directions, 28 warnings, 5 prosecutions and 7 convictions.  In 
some cases investigations had begun in previous years.

<A HREF="#LINKT4"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Fisheries Act data for the same year there were 778 
inspections, 25 investigations, 1 direction, 8 warnings, 5 
prosecutions and 6 convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I highlight the major topics of the report, including the need 
for effective enforcement and limited resources as a result of 
the program review of the environment.  Environment Canada has 
realized a 40% cutback in its the financial budget.  There is 
also a loss of the Fraser River action plan that deals with the 
west coast.  The Fraser is a major river system.  The 
Pacific-Yukon budget has been cut by 30%.  This cut was effective 
on April 1.  Five hundred and fifty average inspections are 
expected to drop to three hundred and eighty-five as a result of 
the cutbacks. The cuts have a definite impact on enforcement. 
Vacant positions are not being filled, existing workloads and 
work expectations are insurmountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are issues of climate change and a need to research and 
collect data on the state of our environment and our fish 
habitat.  But the workload and the expectation is based on the 
existing workload which has been cutback by 40%.  In the Quebec 
region alone, 60% of its enforcement budget is actually used for 
enforcement.  We must direct these resources to where they are 
needed.  Existing vacancies in Quebec have been left unfilled for 
as long as two years although it is one of the most 
industrialized provinces in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Poor information supplied to the committee by the department is 
a major highlight.  We are still waiting for information from the 
department that was requested by our committee.  To date it has 
not materialized.  No on really knows how bad the situation is. 
No details are brought out on the enforcement versus compliance 
promotion and other activities.  Two inspectors in Ontario 
provide four to five days per company to verify the national 
pollutant release inventory, a new international compliance. We 
are making international commitments to do inventory on our 
national state of pollution but our workload is being carried by 
the existing staff. In B.C. areas, including non-industrial 
impacts, there are approximately 17,200 possible sites for a 
total of 16 staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Entire sections of CEPA are not being enforced in Canada.  We 
are trying to juggle and hope industry does not know much about 
the unenforced regulations and that Canadians believe the 
protection of our environment is of utmost importance.  But we 
cannot assume.  We must make sure enforcement of this law is 
taking place. Fifteen inspectors in the prairie region cover an 
area roughly 50% of Canada's land mass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992-93 there were 1,233 inspections concerning CEPA by 
inspectors, 93 investigations, 105 warnings, 2 directions and 22 
prosecutions. By 1996 the situation deteriorated.  We were down 
to 97 warnings, 15 prosecutions, no directions and no 
convictions, a clear reduction in environment presence and in 
regulatory enforcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deputy minister admitted at committee under intense pressure 
of questioning that there were inadequate resources in terms of 
environment enforcement. A KPMG survey highlighted that the 
voluntary measures expected from companies are inadequate, about 
16% efficiency compared with enforcement and regulatory 
compliance measures where 90% will comply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government continues to promote voluntary measures.  In 
many areas of the report, there is a lack of resources, a lack of 
enforcement and also a lack of real harmonization between the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is inadequate responsibility of reporting to parliament on 
the infractions to the fisheries habitat.  The provincial 
regulators and enforcers are supposed to provide this information 
to the fisheries minister.  He has still not been able to provide 
this report to the House of Commons for all the public in Canada 
to know.  He is legally liable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement between Quebec and Canada on the application of 
federal pulp and paper regulations was highlighted.  There were 
20 infractions in the same year that this was re-signed and 
renewed and no prosecutions were instituted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More alarming was the aquaculture memorandum of understanding 
between DFO and New Brunswick.  In that area there was rampant 
disease and marine pollution. Pesticides were dumped to control 
an aquaculture problem but the natural environment was being 
compromised as a result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1997 Ontario pulled out of its agreement with DFO to enforce 
fish habitat protection.  The existing enforcement officers out 
of the Ontario region are expected to carry out what the province 
of Ontario is supposed to be doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Existing resources have been cut back.  The expectations have 
increased and this report is a major highlight.  We must address 
the enforcement of our environment and pollution protection of 
this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg that this House understand the implications of this report 
and the challenge for this government to make the environment a 
number one priority, especially this week which is environment 
week.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>JUDGES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK20">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from June 3 consideration of Bill C-37, an act 
to amend the Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to 
other acts, as reported (without amendment) from the committee; 
and of Motion No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK21"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to rise at report stage of Bill C-37 to amend to 
the Judges Act after having been so rudely interrupted by that 
NDP procedural motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill seeks to raise the compensation paid to judges 
appointed by the federal government over the course of two years 
by 8.3%.  Already federally appointed judges on average are paid 
approximately $140,000 which is not exactly small change.  It is 
a significant chunk of public revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me make it clear at the outset that I and my colleagues in 
official opposition do not object to paying judges or anybody 
else who works for the public.  We do not expect these people to 
be disadvantaged in terms of their compensation.  We think fair 
compensation ought to apply to judges as it does to all other 
members of our public service, people who work for the crown. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns me in the bill is the double standard we are 
creating for one small group within those who work in the public 
sector, that group being federal judges.  It seems particularly 
strange to me at a time when frontline workers in the federal 
government, particularly frontline workers in the federal justice 
system, people such as frontline members of the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police, frontline members of the Correctional Service of 
Canada, frontline people who enforce our laws, receive little or 
no pay increases year after year.  However, those at the very top 
of the stratum, those who are already paid far more than most 
Canadians, would get the biggest increase. 
Quite frankly the approach taken by the commission which reported 
and in the legislation seems inequitable, unfair and 
inappropriate.

<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people on the frontline of the justice system like RCMP 
constables and correctional service officers are people who day 
after day put their lives on the line for the enforcement of law 
and order.  They are accountable to performance.  If they do not 
perform they can be dismissed.  If they make huge errors in 
judgment they can be dismissed or disciplined.  In other words 
they are accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the judges?  Are they accountable?  No, they are not. 
They are accountable to no one but themselves.  I submit the 
principle of accountability for compensation ought to apply 
throughout the public sector just as it does within the private 
sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When my constituents look at some of the judgments made by 
federal judges at various levels including the Supreme Court of 
Canada, what they see sometimes astounds them.  Other members of 
my party have made reference to some of the recent shocking court 
judgments by the people we are now proposing to raise their pay 
by 8.3%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, members will have heard recently about the Feeney 
case.  The court ruled that a man who was clearly guilty of first 
degree murder would be acquitted because a police officer entered 
his residence without a search warrant, after having knocked on 
the door and announced himself, to find the perpetrator of this 
atrocious crime in bed with blood on his person and throughout 
his trailer from the murder he had just committed.  It is 
unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now proposing to raise the pay of the judge who made this 
decision by 8.3%.  Not only is he not accountable but we cannot 
balance his pay with his performance.  We have a cast of people 
who are appointed without public oversight, without parliamentary 
scrutiny, by the sole discretion of the Governor General in 
Council, the Prime Minister, and are not accountable even if they 
make widely outrageous decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we say to these people?  We say they are not 
accountable.  They make bizarre decisions some of the time.  We 
cannot measure their performance but we will give them an 8.3% 
pay raise anyway.  It is just plain wrong.  It shows a completely 
contorted sense of priorities on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians families are now in the second decade of no after tax 
increase in their disposable incomes.  Frontline workers in the 
federal government have had no raises for seven years.  That we 
should talk about the best paid people in the country getting an 
8.3% pay raise is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday one of my colleagues pointed out that there is a 
clause in Bill C-37 dealing with survivor benefits, speaking of 
the spouses of judges.  There is a definition of spouse in the 
act, as there should be.  Every federal statute dealing with 
family benefits requires the term spouse and therefore defines 
the term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently Madam Justice Rosalie Abella of the Ontario Court of 
Appeal ruled in the Rosenberg case that the traditional 
definition of spouse, the definition which exists in Bill C-37 
and hundreds of other federal statutes, the definition which is 
rooted in 1,000 years of common law history and 3,000 years of 
the Mosaic law tradition, is no longer applicable to all federal 
statutes including the one we are debating today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are proposing to give Madam Justice Abella an 8.3% pay raise 
after having made a decision contrary to the interest of the 
government, contrary to the interest of justice, contrary to any 
kind of public accountability.  This justice was appointed 
without any kind of oversight or scrutiny by the public, by 
parliament or by elected representatives of the people.  She was 
appointed behind closed doors by bureaucrats in the justice 
department offering their short list of candidates to the 
politicians in cabinet to choose one name over another.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have a moratorium on pay raises for judges of the 
federal government until or unless there is some kind of 
accountability.  Once again, compensation must be linked to 
accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the opposition have called for the establishment of a 
parliamentary committee to review and comment on judicial 
nominees by the federal government.  At least then we could have 
some kind of screening process to make sure that irresponsible, 
ideologically driven, radical judges like Rosalie Abella do not 
find their way on to the bench.  If people like Rosalie Abella 
want to legislate their political agenda I suggest they run for 
public office as has everyone in this place and not sit on the 
bench where they think they can unilaterally impose their 
political agenda, peculiar as it may be, on the rest of 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time has come for us to review the entire process of 
appointments of judges and the enormous undemocratic power which 
our courts exercise.  Until we have done that we cannot and 
should not offer them a reward in terms of a 8.3% pay increase 
until they are finally accountable for the decisions they make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  Before we continue 
the debate I would like to put on the record of the House the 
fact that it is quite permissible to speak in general terms about 
the judiciary.  However it is not appropriate to speak about a 
specific judge or to impugn motive directed to a specific judge. 
That is not appropriate.  It is appropriate to question the 
judiciary in general terms but not specific judges. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for those word of wisdom in guiding the House 
along a proper path of decorum and wise speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-37.  When I rose to 
speak to the bill on March 30 I suggested several areas of the 
bill that should be considered for amendment to ensure its stated 
intent could be achieved.  I rise today to emphasize to members 
of the House the need for such changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of Canada's judges may well deserve a reasonable raise of 
certainly no more than 2% which is what lower paid employees are 
getting in the public service.  By way of general comment, 2% on 
$20,000 is much less than 2% on $140,000.  The lowest and the 
most needy in society are getting a much lower dollar to take 
home and buy the basic necessities of life than the higher paid 
in society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Low salaries are typical of the justice sector in general, 
especially in the area of law enforcement.  I understand a new 
mechanism for determining salaries of Canada's judges is needed. 
As one of my hon. colleague's pointed out earlier, the bill will 
increase the salaries of judges by 8.3% over two years.  Most 
Canadians would agree this is an unreasonable proposition, 
especially when we consider judges' salaries in comparison to 
those of other members of the law enforcement community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The lowest paid in this public sector still suffer financial 
hardship due to the broken promise of the government for a 
resolution, for example, of the pay equity issue. 
Here again we are dealing with people making in the neighbourhood 
of $20,000 to $28,000 a year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also speak specifically about Canada's national police force, 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.  Along with that group, I 
suppose, one could include crown attorneys, clerks and 
paralegals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>RCMP officers put their lives on the line pretty well every day, 
but have only received their first small raise since 
approximately 1991.  Police officers make headlines by saving 
lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House knows how Canada's judges have taken over parliament's 
role in changing, through interpretation, legislation.  The 
current issue that is of great concern is the change in the 
definition of spouse.  The Rosenberg case, which was referred to 
previously, has taken it out of the hands of parliament, which 
should rightfully deal with an issue as major as determining the 
definition of the word spouse.  I would like to think that at 
some point, possibly in the fall, we will be back debating that 
particular issue on behalf of Canadians to come up with a 
resolution out of this House as opposed to the courts doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like hon. members of the House to consider how a rank 
and file RCMP officer will feel when this bill is passed. 
Officers work every day in dangerous circumstances.  Many of our 
judges seem to be out of touch with the current standards of the 
average citizen in our community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently brought a petition to the House in reference to the 
Giles case in Manitoba.  One of the primary statements that I 
made in regard to that petition was that judges have to reflect 
the standards, the morals and the current beliefs of a society. 
Otherwise, what are they doing on the bench? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to another point with regard to Bill C-37.  It 
seeks to establish an independent mechanism for salary 
determination in order to maintain the independence of the 
judiciary.  There are two problems with this.  I agree in part 
with the intention of this because we certainly want judges to be 
independent.  However, they also have to be accountable and, as I 
said, reflect the society they are judging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's judges should certainly not fear salary cuts if they 
render decisions against the government.  However, the commission 
to be established under this legislation cannot hope to provide 
that independence.  I believe that the appointment process of one 
representative by the judges, one by the government and one by 
both to make up the tribunal does not lend itself to that 
independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government must move to prevent patronage appointments in 
the case of government appointments, which are undoubtedly going 
to occur under this legislation.  While it may be agreed that the 
judiciary should be independent of the government, this should 
not mean that judges are unaccountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that hon. members opposite can mention the systems in 
place for judicial review.  I realize that many feel that appeal 
courts provide all of the accountability necessary in our 
judicial system because they provide a mechanism whereby bad 
decisions can sometimes be reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, this does little to address the deeper problem, which 
is judges who make decisions that are offensive to their 
community standards.  In that case there is no mechanism for any 
accountability back to these members of our society.  It is here 
that the question of judicial accountability becomes tricky. 
Judges should, as we have already agreed, be independent of 
parliament, which might otherwise manipulate their decisions for 
political purposes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The judges should not be totally independent of the communities 
and the people they serve.  Judges who render decisions in 
keeping with Canada's laws and who use the flexibility provided 
them under these laws to render sentences in keeping with the 
expectations of their communities should be recognized for doing 
so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local communities should have greater opportunity to give direct 
feedback to judges' associations outside of the courtroom.  If we 
cannot move to a system whereby judges are elected by the people 
for fixed terms of office, we can at least give communities a 
voice in the process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This legislation should be amended to allow for the input of 
victims groups and community leaders in the salary determination 
process for individual judges.  The judges would receive this 
feedback on a yearly basis which would help to ensure that they 
reflect the values and standards of the public they serve.  The 
point is that there would be more immediate feedback in the 
instance of an extremely lenient sentence being given to a child 
molester or a probationary sentence being given to someone 
convicted of manslaughter.  The judges would find out right away 
that a large segment of society is against that kind of 
sentencing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that judges actually are public servants should not be 
lost on the House or on the judges themselves.  It seems that the 
concept that they are public servants is a missing ingredient in 
our society today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I consider the legislative action which has been taken and, 
in particular, the bill which we are debating today, something 
becomes obvious.  The government is not reflecting community 
values, standards and current thinking on appropriate 
compensation for public servants, the judges, who are the subject 
of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to comment on Motion No. 1 and the rationale behind 
the motion.  Clause 5 pertains to the increase in judges' 
salaries which will be 4.1%, retroactive to April 1, 1997.  No 
one is getting an increase retroactive to April 1, 1997 and the 
judges should not be getting one either.

focuses in part on salaries, it focuses on other things too. That 
seems to have escaped the attention of all of the opposition 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, attention should be given to the initiative to 
create unified family courts.  I see that the hon. member for 
London West is in the House.  She will know, because she 
practised law before the courts in London, that the unified 
family court, an experiment which began in the city of London, 
Ontario, has been a very great boon to that community. 
It has allowed the justice system to become streamlined in an 
area that is crucial to family life and to the good operation of 
a community.

</I></B></P><P align=left>When these disputes come before a court, it is important that we 
create a system that allows them to be dealt with as efficiently 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to comment on the mood of this debate, particularly with 
respect to the comments that have been made about specific 
members of the judiciary and the judiciary in general.  When I 
hear comments like “judges should be independent of parliament 
but not of their communities” I think that sounds good.  Judges 
live in communities.  They should be in touch with their 
communities. That is good.  That is why the government has 
created committees composed of members of communities who are not 
all judges but lay people as well.  These committees vet 
applications for judicial positions and pass judgment on 
applicants before they come to the minister's attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the implications of the statement that judges should 
be independent of parliament but not of their communities.  The 
hon. member seems to be saying that if a community group or 
people in the community do not like a judgment, even though that 
judgment is correct in law, then somehow they can yank the chain 
to bring the judge to attention and to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I heard a member from Calgary suggest, with respect to the 
Rosenberg decision, that a particular judge was promoting her own 
political goals and views.  These are very serious allegations to 
be made about a group of people, or even about specific people, 
who are themselves public servants and not in a position to 
defend themselves.  Before we use our privileges in the House to 
speak publicly, freely and without any repercussions, I would 
suggest that we be very careful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at other countries such as Cuba, or countries where 
we have concerns about the absence of democratic rights, we look 
for certain characteristics when we test them for their beliefs 
in democratic principles.  We look for a free parliamentary 
assembly where people are elected and more than one party can 
run.  We look for privileges for parliamentarians so they can 
speak freely.  We also look for an independent judiciary.  A sign 
of democracy is having systems in place which allow the judiciary 
to operate independently and not worry about whether their 
salaries will be paid or about whether they will be yanked back 
or punished by a community group with a particular agenda if they 
make a correct decision in law in relation to the constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reformers are playing with a very serious concept here. 
Judicial independence is more important than almost any other 
principle of democracy.  It is certainly as important as our 
right to speak freely in this House, and I would suggest that 
members opposite be very careful about how they use or abuse that 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must keep in mind that whether we are in opposition or in 
government, parliamentarians are part of the justice system.  We 
make the laws.  We are every bit as much a part of the justice 
system as judges, police officers, victims, criminals and 
litigants in civil law suits.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent on us when we are debating these principles to 
keep the level of debate at a point where we ourselves are not 
undermining the institutions that we value.  The institution of 
the independent judiciary is so fundamental to our democracy that 
it should be protected.  It should be nurtured.  It should not be 
attacked in an irresponsible and ill-informed manner.  I would 
suggest that that is what we are hearing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges cannot respond because it is not appropriate for them to 
respond.  It is not appropriate for them to respond because of 
their position.  That makes them sitting ducks for people who are 
promoting an agenda of fear and intolerance so that they can then 
use that to further their political agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very careful to preserve these precious rights. We 
have to be very careful to make sure that our judiciary is 
respected and is taken care of so that they can continue to do 
the fine job that they are doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those reasons, I will be opposing Motion No. 1 and voting 
against it.  I am very happy to be able to support Bill C-37.  I 
just wish we could hear some more about the good things that that 
bill is doing, including the unified family court.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>JUDGES ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK28">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-37, an act to amend the 
Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, 
as reported (without amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motion No. 1. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I listened to the remarks of my hon. colleague and 
friend from Windsor—St. Clair, who said we ought not to focus 
exclusively on salary as there are other elements to consider 
and discuss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fine, but at the same time, these other elements should not 
overshadow the judges' salaries issue. We can talk all we want 
about principles, judicial independence, separation of powers, 
Montesquieu and what not, but the fact remains that the bill as 
it stands contains a very important clause on salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague and friend from Berthier—Montcalm moved a 
motion, that is Motion No. 1 now before us, that would amend 
Bill C-37 by deleting clause 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, clause 5 does not make sense. It makes no sense at all. 
What difference would it make if there were no clause 5? Judges' 
salaries have already been raised by 2.08% on April 1, 1997, and 
by another 2.08% on April 1, 1998. This has already occurred 
without Bill C-37. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the government has decided to give them more, as if 4% and a 
bit, when the compound rate is taken into account, were not 
enough.  The bill gives them a 4.1% increase retroactive to 
April 1, 1997—that will fill their wallets—and another 4.1% 
retroactive to April 1, 1998, for a total salary increase, with 
the compound rate taken into account—and this will blow your 
socks off—of over 13%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While provincial transfer payments are being cut and unemployed 
workers are facing ruin—with a $19 billion surplus in the EI 
fund—, while the government plans to cut payments to the 
provinces by $130 billion between now and 2003, while the health 
transfer is being cut and the number of hospital beds is 
dropping throughout Canada, the government wants to give judges 
a 13% increase.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not saying that judges do not deserve it, we are not 
saying that judges do not do their work well.  We think they do. 
We are not saying that their work is not important; on the 
contrary, as a lawyer and legal expert myself, I feel that the 
work that judges do is vital in a society based on the rule of 
law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is that, as a society, we cannot afford this 
increase.  We simply cannot afford it. 
It is a question of choices and priorities.  It goes even 
further; it is a question of the kind of society we want to 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the Bloc Quebecois believe that any government's priority 
must be to help the most disadvantaged, those who are ill, 
elderly, unable to look after themselves, or need a salary or a 
decent minimum income in order to live in our modern society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government can always claim that it will not be able to 
attract quality candidates without an increase, but as far as I 
know, and I know the legal community well, there are waiting 
lists for judgeships.  The fact that the increase will be only 
4% and not 13% will not prevent anyone from applying, far from 
it.  There are waiting lists because the office of judge is 
prestigious and important.  There is more than the salary 
involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this government is showing poor judgement and 
deciding to give money to those it will appoint later on—because, 
let there be no mistake about it, these are political 
appointments, judges are not elected—rather than giving it to the 
men, women and children in our society most in need of 
government assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is with great enthusiasm that I support the motion moved by 
my colleague and friend, the member for Berthier—Montcalm, 
because the Bloc Quebecois is working for those who need it, not 
for the privileged few.

<P><A NAME="LINK30"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to take part in this debate on Bill C-37, an 
amendment to the Judges Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First I would like to comment that we really do not need a 
lecture from the member from Windsor on how we should or should 
not speak in this House.  We are all cognizant of the privileges 
that we need to exercise as members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the highest court of the land.  Whatever needs to be 
said needs to be said here.  We are superior to the Supreme Court 
of Canada.  We have a right to bring forward in this House the 
concerns of our constituents regarding the judicial injustice we 
hear about almost on a daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more people in this country are losing faith in the 
judicial system.  In fact 52% have little or no faith in the 
current judicial system.  We as members of parliament have a duty 
to bring their concerns and the injustices that our constituents 
want us to air to this House of Commons. If the Feeney case can 
illustrate a good example of this lack of faith in the judicial 
system, then the Feeney case should be illustrated and made 
reference to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill passes, the pay hike of 8.3% over two years for 
judges will certainly happen.  This is really not the time to be 
talking about wages.  As we know, members of parliament are 
getting blasted for the pay hike of 8% over four years even 
though members of parliament have not received a pay hike since 
1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I would like to address with reference to this 
amendment is whether judges need or deserve a pay hike.  My 
colleagues who have spoken before me on this amendment brought up 
the issue of need.  For the record I will quote from the salary 
schedule to make sure the people of this country know exactly 
what the current salaries are as of April 1998. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT14"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Supreme Court of Canada the chief justice makes a salary 
of $208,200.  If someone is just a justice in the supreme court, 
a salary of $192,900 is paid.  Under the Federal Court and Tax 
Court of Canada, the chief justice and associate chief justices 
earn a salary of $177,700 and justices earn $162,300. In the 
Superior Courts the chief justice and the associate chief 
justices earn $177,700 and the justices earn $162,300. Certainly, 
these salaries far exceed the salaries of members of parliament 
who sit in the highest court of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do these judges deserve a pay raise? The question can only be 
answered if judges are evaluated by an independent panel. 
Certainly it is ironic to see judges comment on decisions made at 
the provincial level regarding judges' salaries, when the judges 
themselves say that the provincial governments really do not have 
any business capping their salaries.  How ironic it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>MPs get evaluated every four or five years by the people who pay 
their salaries.  Judges should be evaluated to make sure that if 
they deserve a raise they get a raise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like to make is that judges are 
appointed for life.  Members of parliament are not appointed for 
life.  We certainly do need term limits on judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfortunate that Bill C-37 was not amended to develop a 
new process for the appointment of judges, to make it one that is 
more open and more transparent. We heard today that the current 
process is very patronage based. Today judges are appointed 
through a political patronage system, through their connections 
to the political system and political parties.  That is normally 
how someone gets to the bench.  We need to make this process much 
more transparent and politically accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in Manitoba the attorney general, Mr. Vic Toews, was 
criticized for getting involved in the judicial appointment 
process.  Personally I applaud the attorney general for Manitoba 
for his intervention. If he is acting on behalf of the people of 
Manitoba, he certainly has a right to make sure that the federal 
laws are complied with and that the best judges are appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point I want to bring to this House is that under the 
current federal agreement, in Manitoba three of the federal 
judges must reside outside the city of Winnipeg.  That is a 
contract the federal government made with the provincial 
government. Recently there has been pressure to reduce these 
numbers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that judges need to reflect the mosaic of the 
province. Considering that 40% of the population lives outside 
the city of Winnipeg, I believe that 40% of the federal judges in 
the province of Manitoba should also live outside the city of 
Winnipeg.  I would hope the Minister of Justice would agree with 
my opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should not be concentrating its efforts on pay 
raises for judges.  We should be concentrating on introducing 
victims bills of rights legislation and making substantial 
changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close by referring to an article printed in the <I>Free China 
Journal</I> dated May 15.  It was a surprise to me.  The title is 
“Victim recompense law passes”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Taiwan recently passed new legislation aimed 
to correct the public misconception that legal measures only 
protect the offenders.  A majority of citizens in our country 
certainly believe that the laws are there for the law breakers 
and certainly not for the law-abiding citizen. The legislature of 
Taiwan had just passed a law that provides timely compensation to 
crime victims and their families.  This unprecedented legislation 
stipulates that if the breadwinner of a family is killed during a 
crime, his or her family should apply for compensation for this 
sad state of affairs.

<A HREF="#LINKT15"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past the government also tried direct compensation. It 
found that direct compensation of this type was often difficult 
to obtain.  In many cases suspects could either not be positively 
identified or remained at large.  It made it impossible for 
victims to be legally compensated for those who committed the 
crime.  As a result those affected families plunged into a life 
of financial hardships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a good example that governments do care about the 
victims of their country.  This is a first step that they have 
taken to make sure that families are looked after.  I will send a 
copy of this news item to the Minister of Justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certainly many issues this government needs to address 
beyond that of pay increases for federal judges. The people of 
this country have waited for a long time for things to change. 
Unfortunately this government tends to spend its time 
concentrating on money issues rather than real issues that people 
have in mind. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak on Motion No. 1 related to Bill C-37, 
amendments to the Judges Act.  The motion put forward by the Bloc 
member is that Bill C-37 be amended by deleting clause 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 has to do with pay increases for judges. The way the 
pay increase would work is it is an increase of 4.1% retroactive 
from April 1, 1997 to March 31, 1998, and an additional 4.1% from 
April 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999.  At that time the salaries will 
be reviewed by a newly created body called the judicial 
compensation and benefits commission.  What this amounts to is 
that judges will get about an 8.3% increase over two years.   It 
is important to note that the average salary for judges at the 
moment is approximately $140,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few minutes ago in the debate the member for Windsor—St. 
Clair said that by talking about these judges and the outrageous 
decisions that they have been making we are undermining the 
prestige of the judges and the courts.  I say to the hon. member 
that it is not us undermining the prestige of the judges and the 
courts, it is the judges who make the ridiculous decisions that 
appear out there.  Many of my colleagues on this side of the 
House have given the most outrageous examples of decisions that 
have been made by judges over the last while.  I will be giving a 
few from my own area as part of speaking to Motion No. 1. If 
these judges were more representative of their community and our 
community values we would not be faced with these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In connection with the comments made by the member for 
Windsor—St. Clair, a poll last July showed that more than 50% of 
those polled have little faith in judges.  Surely that is a very 
good message to all of us that there is something wrong if more 
than half the population feels that judges are not doing the 
right thing.  It is time to address a major problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the North Vancouver area a number of my close friends are 
members of the RCMP.  In North Vancouver the RCMP looks after our 
policing.  Some members have told me about their frustration with 
judges and how difficult it is as a police officer to get some 
sort of charge against somebody and then get it to stick.  There 
are so many technical flaws or problems in the way of laying a 
charge in the first place and then to be successful in court to 
get somebody convicted.  Then to get them put in jail is a 
tremendously difficult thing to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very frustrating for police officers who know they are 
faced with this problem every day.  Police officers are working 
hard to keep our streets safe and to get these offenders dealt 
with. Yet starting constables have had their wages frozen for 
five years and the starting salary for a third year constable is 
in the range of $50,500 to about $52,400. 
That is $90,000 less than the judges who are making judgments on 
the sorts of criminals these police officers are bringing 
forward.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many of my colleagues have mentioned earlier, most Canadians 
now are starting to think about the justice system not as a 
justice system but as a legal system, a wonderful place for the 
judges to share experiences with one another and to talk about 
the technicalities and how they can find flaws in the things that 
parliament has passed as our laws. The will of parliament should 
be ultimate in these decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Lynn Valley area, like many other areas of the country, 
we have a fair bit of youth crime.  Of my constituents, like 
those across Canada, well over 90% would like to see significant 
changes to the Young Offenders Act and they would like to see 
some judges being a lot more particular about the sentencing of 
youth offenders.  For example, in May there was a court date for 
some young offenders in my riding who allegedly had committed a 
devastating crime in the Lynn Valley area in March. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they are alleged to have done is that in the middle of 
night they attacked a person in the street, beat him so severely 
that plastic surgery was required and practically trashed a 
person's house and their almost brand new car.  They were 
identified and arrested. But of course nobody could give out 
their names.  It was extremely frustrating to the father of the 
victim who wants to take civil action against these people but 
was unable to get names until recently when they appeared in 
court. There is a general feeling in the community that these 
people should be named, especially once they are convicted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a court date set for May.  Only a few of these 
defendants actually showed up in court.  What did the judge do? 
He said “you should tell your friends they really should 
appear”.  He set a new court date and put the case off for 
another few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is absolutely ridiculous and outrageous. Surely the judge 
should have issued arrest warrants immediately for those people 
who did not turn up.  Instead, it was almost a flippant comment 
for him to make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the sort of comment that brings judges into disrepute. 
Maybe they have been numbed by hearing so many cases that they 
just do not take anything seriously any more.  They are at this 
point where we have to start imposing minimum sentences for these 
judges to use.  Otherwise they are just not going to do anything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another case in the Vancouver area recently where a 
prisoner in the Kent institution escaped from the institution in 
a cardboard box.  He asked for a stand for his television set. 
He knew there were not any stands for television sets, so he then 
made the suggestion that a cardboard box would be fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The prison authorities found him a nice big cardboard box which 
he put under his TV set.  While the cardboard box was there over 
a period of a few months, he reinforced it with bits of plywood 
and stuff that he got from the prison workshop.  He knew a friend 
of his was going to be released at a certain date. On the night 
before he climbed into this box and his prisoner friend took it 
to his cell.  It was put in storage overnight as personal effects 
of the prisoner who would be leaving the next morning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At no time did the prison authorities ever check the box to see 
what was in there.  The following morning it was loaded into the 
trunk of a car and left with the prisoner who was being released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This prisoner who was in the cardboard box was then released 
from the trunk and he was out at large.  He was recaptured within 
a short time.  But he had already escaped numerous times from 
correctional facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ridiculous part was when he came to court for this crime, 
what did the judge do?  He sentenced him all right to a number of 
years in prison but he made it concurrent with the sentence he 
was already serving.  So there is no additional time.  It is free 
time. Escaping from prison means nothing.  They get it free.  Try 
it again, please.

get a private member's bill into this place which would get rid 
of these concurrent sentences and make people serve time for 
these types of crimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This prisoner had been into bank robberies and had been jailed 
for those a number of times and he has all these concurrent 
sentences.  They get time for the first crime but not for 
subsequent withdrawals so it does not really matter what they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are really pointing out here is that if judges will have 
their pay increased from the already very generous level of 
$140,000 per year on average, it is about time they were a little 
more accountable.  One of the things that the official opposition 
has proposed is that judges should be selected through a more 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we cannot get to the point where the constituents actually 
elect the judges themselves to truly reflect community values, 
let us at least have some sort of public process where 
parliamentarians or MLAs at the provincial level can at least 
grill and question, get to the bottom and background of people 
who are to be appointed as judges.  I think that is a reasonable 
approach.  It is a step we should be taking and before any of us 
agree to pass a bill like Bill C-37 with these very generous pay 
increases we should be insisting on accountability for judges.

Bill C-37 establishes the judicial compensation and benefits 
commission to inquire into the adequacy of the salaries and 
benefits of judges under section 26(1) of the bill. Inquiries 
will commence on September 1, 1999 and on September 1 of every 
fourth year after 1999, and the commission is to submit a report 
with recommendations to the Minister of Justice within nine 
months after the date of commencement. That is authorized by 
section 26(2) of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is to table a copy of the commission's 
report in each house of parliament as required by section 26(6). 
The minister is to respond to the commission's report within six 
months after receiving it as authorized under section 26(7).

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament is given no opportunity or authority to respond to 
the report.  Motion No. 2 gives the appropriate committee, which 
is the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights, an 
opportunity to review the commission's report, call witnesses, 
examine the commission's report and report its findings to the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we want this?  For one thing to determine on behalf of 
the people of Canada whether or not the recommendations contained 
within that report are fair to society at large, the people of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is being recommended in terms of pay raises by this bill is 
it is going to increase the pay for federal court judges all the 
way from $5,000 to $17,000 over a two year period.  It reminds me 
a little bit of the report that was tabled in the House 
recommending that members of parliament receive a 2% increase 
over the next four years.  This is at a time when so many 
families are struggling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Kim Hicks family, a family of six, is trying to make ends 
meet on approximately $30,000 a year.  They are having difficulty 
paying for dental treatments and eyeglass appointments. Thousands 
of families in this country are living under economic conditions 
today where they are struggling to keep the family body and soul 
together. If this bill is passed it will demand more money from 
those families by way of taxation in order to give judges a raise 
in pay.  These are judges who, as my colleague has indicated, are 
receiving on average $140,000 a year.  The chief justice of the 
Supreme Court of Canada receives over $200,000 a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not fair for this bill to command parliament to use its 
taxation powers to again weaken the economic stability of 
thousands and thousands of individuals and families across this 
country.  This applies equally to the report tabled in the House 
indicating that we as MPs deserve another 2% raise over the next 
four years. We are going to take money from these families that 
are struggling to provide for their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we going to tax them more?  Because judges need a raise 
and of course we need a raise.  This is wrong.  It is wrong 
because it is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to give the judges or the members of parliament more 
take home pay, why do we not offer them a tax cut?  I would 
sooner have a 10% tax cut than a 15% raise in pay.  But let us do 
it for all Canadians. And until we can do it for all Canadians, 
let us not put a greater burden on them by demanding that they 
pay more in taxes so that we and the judges can receive more for 
ourselves and our families. It is not right.  And it is not right 
because it is not fair.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest threat to the economic stability of individuals and 
their families is the unlimited and unrestricted power of 
government to tax away their wealth. It is absolutely wrong. When 
the commission makes its report saying that the judges' benefits 
should be increased at the expense of Canadian families and 
society at large, surely we must examine our own consciences and 
ask ourselves whether this is fair.  I think when most of us look 
in the mirror we have to say no it is not fair.  It is not fair. 
How can we compare an average salary of $140,000 a year for the 
judges with a family of six struggling to make ends meet on 
$30,000 a year? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this bill as it is worded goes through without any scrutiny, 
some of these judges are going to receive a $17,000 increase in 
pay over the next two years.  We as MPs will receive 2% a year, 
almost $5,000 more in the next four years.  We are going to 
receive that.  How?  By the force of law determined by the 
majority over there.  We are going to take that $5,000 for each 
one of us out of the pockets of the taxpayers, out of the pockets 
of the families that are struggling to feed, clothe and shelter, 
to educate, to care for their children.  We are going to do far, 
far more when we pass the bill that is going to give the federal 
judges in this land a raise of over 8% in the next two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong with this.  It is simply the 
unrestricted and abusive power of the House, of this government 
to tax the wealth away from the people in this country who make 
and create that wealth every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we are the highest taxed country in the G-7.  The 
average family spends more in taxes than it does on food, 
clothing and shelter.  One in five children are reported to be 
living in poverty.  What does that say about the families they 
come from?  They are living in poverty too.  Why?  Because 
approximately 50 cents of every dollar earned is paid toward 
taxes in one form or another.  This bill is going to take more 
from them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is reprehensible what we are doing to the people of Canada. 
We are sent here to stand on guard, to protect the rights of the 
Canadian people who have sent us here.  We are not protecting 
their rights when we do these kinds of things.  We are not 
protecting their rights when we demand 2% for ourselves and they 
have got to suffer more. That is not right.  It is not fair.  It 
is reprehensible and should be reconsidered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot go back to the people in Crowfoot and say this is fair 
and just.  I will go back and say it is wrong.  We are caught in 
the middle of this, all of us.  Why?  Because the government 
simply decides what it is going to do and it is going to do it. 
It is going to exercise its power to take money from them.  Why? 
Because the judges need more on top of $140,000 and we need more. 
It is not right.

gives me pleasure to speak to the motion of my colleague from 
Crowfoot.  He is asking that Clause No. 6 be amended so that all 
reports to the House tabled by the minister will be referred to 
the justice committee in order for it to conduct inquiries or 
public hearings in respect of the report and to report its 
findings to the House.  It is a very sensible amendment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it rather unusual to hear colleagues from the other side 
of the House, particularly the chairman of the justice committee, 
say that there are some really good points in Bill C-37.  If 
there are some really good points, then there must be some really 
bad ones.  I wonder why the government members do not recognize 
them and amend them.  I wonder why they do not enter into the 
debate and try to make some common sense out of what we want to 
achieve by making these amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Justice is to table a copy of the commission's 
report but parliament has been given no opportunity to respond. 
This motion would allow that to happen.  Like so many aspects of 
this Liberal government, its members continue to feel they do not 
have to be accountable to parliament.  By not including this 
amendment to Bill C-37, they will again prove how undemocratic 
they have become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time and time again this government has contributed to the 
declining role of parliamentarians.  We have seen this most 
recently at the hands of judicial activism.  For example, on a 
day to day basis we witness the rights of criminals superseding 
the rights of victims through the court imposed conditional 
sentences.  That happens every day of the week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most recently in the case of Rosenberg v Canada, a lesbian 
challenged the constitutionality of the Income Tax Act since it 
forced Revenue Canada to refuse to register her employer's 
private pension plan if it extended death benefits to same sex 
partners.  In the unanimous decision on April 23 the Ontario 
court of appeal decided to read a same sex definition of the term 
spouse into the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the government has an obligation to defend its stated 
position on the definition of spouse.  If an appeal fails, then 
the issue should be put before this parliament and it should be 
debated.  That is what democracy is all about.  When there are 
going to be changes to the definitions in our laws or any changes 
to the laws, they should be decided by the people in this place, 
the highest court in the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we are having that debate we should consciously and 
sincerely keep in mind the wishes of the Canadian people we 
represent.  We should ask what the Canadian people want to see 
come out of this House of Commons.  Then we should oblige them by 
being good representatives and entering into debate on their 
behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he was defending the need for Bill C-33, the former justice 
minister made this statement “We should not rely upon the courts 
to make public policy in matters of this kind.  That is up to 
legislators and we should have the courage to do it”. I think we 
all agree with that statement.  He made a very wise and good 
statement.  The only thing is that they say it in one place and 
they do not do it when they have the opportunity.  This kind of 
an amendment would help make these things possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It comes down to one question.  Is the current justice minister 
going to let the courts decide on such things as the redefinition 
of the term spouse, or is parliament going to decide?  As far as 
I am concerned I have seen too many decisions made by these 
higher courts that have become law.  They are beginning to run 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The highest court of the land is here.  We are the ones who are 
supposed to make the laws, not the Supreme Court of Canada.  It 
has a vital job on its hands but it is not to impose its will of 
nine unelected, unaccountable individuals on the will of 30 
million Canadians. We are the representatives of the 30 million 
Canadians and we must have the say as to what their will is 
toward the laws that govern this land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The courts constantly make an end run around the democratic 
process.  This is the same as the Minister of Justice merely 
tabling the report but not allowing it to be scrutinized by 
members of parliament.  It is the same thing as invoking closure 
on a number of bills. 
They do that all the time.  They are denying me as a member of 
parliament the right to represent the views of the people of Wild 
Rose.  By denying me the right to debate or scrutinize these 
issues, they are denying me the ability to serve the people of my 
riding, which is what I was sent here to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They come from behind closed doors and make decisions by a 
handful of a very few.  Then they tell all members of their 
particular party how they are to vote.  They had better vote that 
way because if they do not they will be punished.  What kind of 
representation is that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently I made a new friend in Airdrie, Alberta.  The gentleman 
is in his elderly years and is a veteran of World War II.  He is

just does not get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in his home visiting this individual.  What a shame it has 
come to the point where the following words came out of his 
mouth:  “I have a medal of honour.  I have a medal of bravery. I 
would like to give you these two medals to take back to the 
government.  Give them back to the minister of defence and tell 
him I don't want them because I didn't fight for the kinds of 
things that are going on in this country today.  The undemocratic 
processes that go on are not what I fought for”. He is demanding 
that we change things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He believed that his comrades in their graves across the seas 
who fought and gave their lives for this country during that 
great war would be turning over in their graves if they knew what 
was going on today with regard to the democratic process for 
which they fought so hard to try to maintain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage all members to vote in favour of Motion No. 2 to 
make the bill a little more bearable and to prove the worth of 
every member of parliament.  Members of the House should be given 
the opportunity to be the representatives many of us want to be 
and are unable to be because of undemocratic processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dictatorship should end, starting with these kinds of measures. 
Things should be brought before us to scrutinize.  Things should 
be brought into this place to let us debate the definition of 
spouse.  The little minority groups with power in their hands 
should not define these things for us and tell us what they will 
be.  The people at large whom we serve should have some say in 
the wages of a judge or the wages of an MP.  Let them be the ones 
who make decisions in this regard.  We should remember they are 
the ones who pay the bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a shame that this place is in a state where we know more 
about what is good for every Canadian in the land than the 
Canadian people themselves.  We know more and so we impose our 
will through all kinds of undemocratic measures.  There is no 
call for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the greatest country in the world.  It could be the

billions of dollars are being taken away from people who need it 
and as the aim of my motion was to prevent this increase of 
approximately 13% from being given to the judges, it is 
understandable that, if my amendment is passed, we will support 
the bill in its entirety, because there are good things in it, 
things that are in response to a decision by the Supreme Court

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to set things straight.  The basis of this bill is good, 
because the government is responding to a decision by the

minister, the minister tables it in this House and the Senate,

Justice and Human Rights is authorized to examine it and is very 
familiar with everything connected with the Judges Act and other 
related acts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Reform Party's amendments were passed, members of this

thing, the committee would have the very specific goal of coming 
up with amendments that would reflect the public's wishes. 
All members of parliament are elected to represent the 
constituents in their respective ridings.  We are, I believe, 
very well placed to know how the public feels about a given 
issue.  Right now, I am sure that a 13.8% increase for judges 
would not fly, when we know that they are earning, on average, 
$140,000 a year or thereabouts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee tasked with studying the report could report to 
this House that it had heard such and such a witness from the 
general public and that the increase was not warranted, or not 
large enough, because we do not know what shape the public purse 
will be in in ten years.  Perhaps that would be the time to 
increase the salaries of judges, public servants and people 
generally. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the poverty problem has been solved and the money currently

members of parliament, the Prime Minister and so on. But now is 
not the time, and if it had given serious consideration to the 
report, I think the committee would have told the minister not 
to raise the salaries of judges right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the parliamentary committee will have to give some 
thought to the amendment put forward by the Reform Party, which 
I think also responds to a rather widespread desire among 
members. We sit regularly on these committees, give a great deal 
of our time and take our job there very seriously. 
I for one at least work very hard at the justice committee and, 
given the time and energy we put into our committee work, we are 
not involved enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that, ultimately, an amendment like this one will 
enhance the role of MPs, perhaps, allowing them to make more of 
a contribution on a bill or a very specific aspect like the 
salaries of judges and all the various benefits they get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude by repeating that we will vote in favour of the 
Reform amendment because it supports the objective of 
transparency demanded by the public and, above all, the 
contribution the people of my riding and every riding across 
Canada and in Quebec want their elected representatives make.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rose yesterday to speak to Motion No. 1.  Today I rise to speak 
to Motion No. 2 put forward by my colleague from Crowfoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I start on a detailed analysis I would like to say that 
in general the motion is taking about bringing transparency and 
accountability to a system that has long been hidden behind 
curtains where arbitrary decisions are made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore the motion put forward by my colleague from Crowfoot 
is very important.  I ask all members to take a careful look at 
it.  As my colleague from the Bloc said, it brings transparency 
and accountability to this system. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rose yesterday in support of the Bloc motion asking that the 
judges' pay raise be not given to judges due to reasons I listed. 
The same rationale applies to me as well. I would be a hypocrite 
if I stood here and said I like the 2% pay raise that is 
to be given to members of parliament.  Those same 
arguments apply to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore I want to go on record that I am not in agreement with 
the 2% pay raise to be given to members of parliament because 
over the four year period that is a 10% pay raise compounded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion in front of the House asks the justice committee to 
view what the judicial compensation and benefits commission will 
come up with and have public hearings. What greater 
accountability is there than that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people of Canada will have a choice to say whether true 
compensation packages are in agreement with what the judges of 
this country are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It brings accountability to the judges too because when these 
hearings are held, people will have room to vent their views 
regarding how the judicial system has been conducting itself.  As 
members know, today this is under scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is viewed and seen that the judiciary is interfering with the 
wishes of the people as expressed through parliament by the 
charter of rights and coming to decisions that at times seem 
quite baffling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore it is very important that this benefits commission 
report is brought in front of the committee so that it can be 
scrutinized by members of parliament and by the Canadian public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another question regards where the laws of the nation are made. 
Are they made in the judiciary chambers or are they made in 
parliament? That is a very critical and important point in light 
of recent decisions made by people who have chosen to read what 
the charter of rights is saying as opposed to the wishes of what 
the Canadians want as expressed through the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Canadian public express displeasure and 
dissatisfaction on the way the judiciary can proceed if it is not 
held accountable? It can do that through the consultation 
package. It can do that when public hearings are made. 
Submissions can be made and attention can be brought to the 
judiciary regarding what the people of Canada feel.  This brings 
some kind of accountability to judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To some degree judges would be happy to see the feedback coming 
from the Canadian public on how they are perceived, although we 
understand quite clearly that they are the guardians of the law. 
They have to follow the law.  They have to interpret the law. 
They do not have to read into something when it is not there. The 
responsibility of a creating a concise law belongs to this 
Chamber.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why this compensation package is generous in everybody's 
point of view, in the opposition's point of view, but of course 
not in the government's point of view.  We know what its point of 
view is.  Its point of view is to spend money, keep the elite 
happy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said yesterday in reference to working class people that 
Canadians do not even dream of having this kind of compensation 
package.  But today I am speaking on Motion No. 2 where some 
attempt is being made to take the whole picture into account so 
that Canadians are served well through transparency and 
accountability of the judicial system. That is very important in 
their eyes.  It touches their lives every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Constitution guarantees judiciary independence.  We are not 
infringing on judiciary independence.  We are extremely proud of 
the fact that the judiciary is independent in this nation.  It is 
not under pressure.  It is not pressured to compromise on the 
decisions it makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless there still has to be accountability. Nevertheless 
the judiciary represents also the views of society. It is 
important that there be an understanding by the public and by the 
judiciary of what they expect of each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by appealing to all members of parliament to look at 
this motion and see that it is a small step toward dialogue 
between the judiciary and the Canadian public. 
<P><A NAME="LINK38"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reed Elley (Nanaimo—Cowichan, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as 
I did yesterday, I rise to speak against Bill C-37 but to speak 
in favour of the amendment put forward by my hon. colleague from 
Crowfoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The criticism we offer on this bill should serve as reason 
enough for Liberals to support the amendment that has been put 
forward by my colleague, the member for Crowfoot. However, as 
very often is the case in the House, the government will ram this 
bill through pretty much as it is.  It is not really interested 
in hearing any constructive criticism from the opposition or our 
attempts to make the legislation better.  It wants to ram it 
through and it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-37 will increase the number of appeal court judges from 
10 to 13.  It also will increase the number of unified family 
court judges from 12 to 36.  On the face of it this in itself is 
not a bad move by the government.  There is a terrific backlog in 
our courts across the nation.  More judges will facilitate the 
movement of these cases through the court system.

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, given the justice system's penchant for inventing 
rather than interpreting the laws these days, I do not believe 
that Canadians generally will see this as a positive move. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The recent supreme court decisions to redefine family in this 
country is very much a case in point.  I do not think Canadians 
in the long run are going to stand for the supreme court actually 
being in the business of making laws when, by our Constitution 
and our parliamentary tradition, the duly elected representatives 
of the people of Canada in parliament are the ones who should be 
making the laws, particularly on such important issues as 
definition of family. Those laws should be made here in the 
House, certainly not in the Supreme Court of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a bad trend across this country which has 
been recognized by Canadians and which we in the Reform Party 
will fight that trend as best we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would also raise judges' salaries retroactively by 4.1% 
and an additional 4.1% from April 1, 1998 to March 31, 1999.  In 
other words, judges will get an 8.3% increase over two years. 
Noting that their average salary now is around $140,000, most 
Canadians are going to ask whether they really need that kind of 
raise.  I wonder if the judges have come in on bended knee 
pleading the case that they need more money.  I rather doubt it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other Canadians who have been receiving only cost of living 
raises or perhaps no raise over the past few years will wonder 
why in the world judges need to receive an 8.3% increase over the 
next two years.  How cynical for this government to award judges, 
senior bureaucrats and its own ministers with large pay raises 
and bonuses while at the same time frontline police officers and 
low level public servants will receive little to nothing.  It 
does not make sense and it is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Granted, my friends across the way will cry out piously and wave 
their arms at me saying that is not true.  In March they gave 
RCMP members a raise.  My goodness, how good they were to them. I 
remind everyone that RCMP salaries have been frozen for five 
years.  The last stage of the increase calls for a .75% increase 
to take effect on October 1, 1998.  It does not make sense and it 
is not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill also seeks to establish a judicial compensation and 
benefits commission to inquire into the adequacy of the salaries 
and benefits of judges.  I want to spend a few moments to discuss 
that commission in some detail.  Indeed it shows that under the 
guise of judicial reform Liberals still have not lost their taste 
for pork barrel politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The creation of the judicial compensation and benefits 
commission provides the federal government with yet another 
opportunity to make patronage appointments and another 
opportunity for hardworking Liberals to be rewarded with a place 
at the trough.  The activities of this commission will commence 
September 1, 1999.  On September 1 of every fourth year after 
1999 the commission is to submit a report with recommendations to 
the Minister of Justice within nine months after the date of 
commencement.  Eventually the Minister of Justice is to table a 
copy of the commission's report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, that does not really matter because parliament is given 
no opportunity or authority to respond.  Again this underscores 
the lack of public accountability within this proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The commission will consist of three members appointed by the 
governor in council.  In effect, governor in council appointments 
are code language for patronage appointments.  One member is 
nominated by the judiciary, one nominated by the Minister of 
Justice and the one who acts as chair will be nominated by the 
first two persons nominated. 
The members will hold office for a term of four years and are 
eligible to be reappointed for one further term.  There is more 
opportunity for patronage.

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As Canadians can see, the appointment process is lacking in 
transparency and therefore credibility.  At no step in the 
appointment process does the public or parliament have a say. 
Reformers want to ensure the appointment process is transparent 
and publicly accountable in order to eliminate this kind of 
patronage.  In fact, our national Reform assembly in Vancouver in 
1996 accepted recommendations made in this regard.  The report 
outlined a more populace style of appointment, whereby a 
committee would review and interview candidates whose names would 
be put forward to the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That type of enlightened thinking is not present in this bill.  I 
suspect that is because Liberals are against anything that smacks 
of populism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will be unimpressed with this legislation.  Overall it 
does nothing to address some of the fundamental problems inherent 
in the justice system.  In fact, while pressing issues of 
criminal justice go unaddressed in this country, this is the 
third time the Liberals have amended the Judges Act.  There are 
better things for us to do in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the last parliament, in 1996, the government introduced 
Bills C-2 and C-42.  Both bills were inconsequential pieces of 
legislation and were of little significance to Canadians who are 
concerned about their safety, and rightly so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Liberal justice ministers have failed to introduce the 
victims' bill of rights which we in the Reform Party have 
advocated for many years.  It has been given a low priority on 
the justice agenda, as if they really do not care about the 
victims of crime in this country.  Both the present and past 
justice ministers failed to substantially amend the Young 
Offenders Act. Instead they tinker around the edges of it.  Both 
ministers have failed to limit the use of conditional sentences 
for violent offenders.  Instead the justice committee's time is 
spent dealing with these administrative matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other shortcomings in the bill, but I want to turn my 
attention just briefly to the amendment put forward by my Reform 
colleague from Crowfoot.  The amendment would give the 
appropriate committee an opportunity to review the commission's 
report, call witnesses and report their findings to the House. 
Does that not make sense?  Is that not democracy in action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon all of my colleagues in the House to support the 
amendment and defeat the bill. 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Bailey (Souris—Moose Mountain, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today in this debate because of a 
number of incidents which have happened across Canada in the last 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A year ago we were just getting over the terrible devastation of 
the Red River flood.  The devastation not only took away people's 
income, but in many cases it destroyed their property, it 
destroyed their lives and in some cases it destroyed families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We just recovered from that and last winter we had a 
terrible ice storm which again took millions of dollars and ruined 
peoples' lives for one year, two years or even more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the effects of these two national calamities go on, we 
stand here today debating a proposal to give people who are 
servants of the people an approximate 8% raise in salary.  This 
going on while hundreds of people have not even started to pick 
up their shoelaces from the disasters.  It is incomprehensible. 
Does the government not realize that we are elected as members of 
Parliament to serve the people? 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1305"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can I possibly respond to a letter I received the other day? 
It was from a single parent with two children whose income is 
slightly below the poverty line.  Are the people who are in dire 
need about to get a retroactive 8% increase?  The answer is no. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of people who have to file income tax returns 
who should not even be on the tax rolls.  When they see people 
being appointed to positions and receiving an 8% raise in 
salaries that are already $140,000, they cry out in a loud voice 
from ocean to ocean to ocean.  They do not cry “no”; they cry 
“no way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to follow the advice of this motion.  We need to listen 
to the words of my colleague from Calgary who says “Let us take 
this back.  Let us have a review of what we are doing”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I well recall when the famous charter of rights and freedoms was 
implemented.  I recall the statement being made that now we have 
the ability to make the laws.  Therein is the danger which the 
people have echoed throughout this country for the past two 
years.  They are saying “I thought we elected our MPs and our 
MLAs to make laws”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the newspapers in the past three months I have seen terms 
like “The tribunal orders the government”.  The word “orders” 
is used.  The tribunals are telling us what definition such terms 
as spouse and marriage will take.  This government has nothing to 
say about it because of the courts?  Democracy is wavering on 
some of these issues and it is wavering badly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to talk about my constituents.  At this time last year, 
between the two cities I represent, we had a very fierce hail 
storm.  The people out west could not tell whether it was crop or 
summer fallow.  That is how bad it was.  They did not lose 
$140,000.  Many of those people lost an amount which is double 
that of the wages of a federal judge.  Did they get retroactive 
pay? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have not pulled up their bootstraps from that and now they 
are facing a drought.  To add to that, there are hundreds 
thousands of acres, including those in the neighbouring province 
of Manitoba, that have had six nights of killing frost.  Seventy 
thousand people are sitting out there not knowing what their 
income will be this fall.  I am just referring to western Canada. 
But we are going to give a handful of judges an 8% raise on 
incomes of $140,000.  I cannot believe it.  I hope that all the 
people of Canada from coast to coast to coast who are listening 
to the debate today are aware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>About 18 months ago <I>Maclean's</I> magazine did a poll on what 
bothered Canadians the most.  Up near the top of the list was our 
court system.  They said that they were losing faith in our court 
system and now we are going to reward judges with an 8% salary 
increase. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any member of this House, on any side of the House, who 
represents any party in the House, should be thinking about the 
real producers of wealth in this country.  They should be 
thinking about the miners and about those who provide the food. 
They should be thinking about the people who are raising 
families, the unemployed and the youth who cannot find jobs.  But 
what are they saying?  We have a great country.  We just gave our 
judges an 8% raise.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is wrong.  This bill, as the amendment says, should go back 
to committee.  The government should have no fear of sending it 
back.  I do not care whether the session is almost over.  For the 
government to move closure on this bill will ring out across this 
land like no emergency has ever rung out.  The people will say 
“The government has done it again”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is robbing from Canadians to pay people a salary 
in excess of $140,000.  It is saying that the rest of the people 
can work it out for themselves.  The farmers, the people who live 
in the Saguenay, on the prairies, in the Red River valley and 
elsewhere will just have to pick up their own bootstraps.  It may 
take them 10 years to get back to normal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I beg the House to support this motion.  If anything, stall it. 
Send it back.  I think the judges can live on $140,000 without 
due concern.  I think that can happen.  I do not think our 
justice system is going to fall to pieces.  This is a good motion 
and I beg everyone to support it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to partake in the 
debate today.  There has been a great deal of bluster and a great 
deal of frank discussion about the merits of this particular 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To focus specifically on the motion before the House, what we 
are in essence contemplating and what the motion would have this 
House do is return this particular piece of legislation to the 
committee for further discussion and consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the previous speaker has indicated, it would hold this piece 
of legislation in abeyance until perhaps some of the more 
controversial elements of it have been dealt with in a more 
substantive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also calls for the review process to kick in.  Before the 
legislation is put in place there would be a further opportunity 
for scrutiny on some of the detail.  In particular, we have heard 
the official opposition voice its concerns about the salary scale 
that judges would enjoy should this legislation be passed through 
this House.  Then, of course, it will be further examined in the 
other Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a great deal of irony, of course, in the remarks of the 
official opposition, knowing that members of the House are 
contemplating raises for themselves.  I think we have to be very 
careful, very circumspect, when we speak to this topic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do take some exception to some of the personal attacks and 
some of the remarks that have been made about the judiciary.  I 
think we owe it to ourselves as parliamentarians to be very, very 
cautious indeed when we start to denigrate and question the 
integrity of the judiciary.  It is certainly not a simple 
solution to castigate the entire legal process and the players in 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can assure members that there are many problems within our 
justice system.  I do not think anyone in this country would 
disagree with that.  However, I believe that the majority of 
people who are presently working in the justice system are doing 
their best.  Although it is an imperfect system, when compared 
with other countries it is certainly something we should be proud 
of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is always easy to take the wrecking ball approach and knock 
down the system we have, but we must always be prepared to 
replace it with something that is constructive.  Unfortunately, 
there is a tendency at times to simply tear things down without 
having something positive to replace them with.  I feel it is 
important to have that on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion itself, I will indicate quite clearly, the 
Conservative Party supports.  We feel that there is an importance 
in this motion in that it calls for further credibility of the 
system and further transparency.  It would allow for greater 
public scrutiny and for the calling of further witnesses to 
testify. 
It is a positive suggestion and one that appears quite 
non-partisan in nature.  I believe this is very important when it 
comes to issues of justice because the benefits or the downside 
of justice issues really do not know political boundaries.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once more we see far too often in the House issues of health, 
education and justice becoming mired in partisan remarks and 
personal remarks.  We must sometimes be a little more tempered 
when we speak on the floor of the Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are certainly for the process of examination or 
re-examination as the case would be with this motion.  We are 
supportive in principle.  A positive suggestion has been put 
forward.  As a member of the justice committee I am not reluctant 
at all to delve into this question, to look at it further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many positive things about the bill itself, if I can 
speak momentarily about it in the broader scheme.  The suggestion 
that we will be having more unified family court judges will be 
of great benefit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation as well talks about a review process.  That is a 
process that would in future examine the question of 
compensation.  Let us face it.  What we need in the system more 
than anything else is good personnel.  We need judges who will be 
competent, judges who come from the practice of law and bring 
with them that experience.  That personal element does not come 
cheap.  We have to ensure that we will have individuals who are 
prepared in many cases to make sacrifices by leaving the 
profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supportive of this amendment.  We would suggest all 
members of the House similarly support the motion, and I will

I would like to ask the unanimous consent of the House for the

not yet been drawn, but some six months ago, I moved a motion 
calling for an inquiry into penitentiaries.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, 
Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to speak to Motion No. 2 
which is asking for legislation to establish a mechanism for 
reporting a decision made by a commission back to the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to support the motion.  Over the period of the four or 
five years that I have been here I have watched how parliamentary 
democracy is being undermined by a government which continues to 
transfer regulatory authority and other authority to boards, 
commissions and the executive branch of government, cabinet, 
without considering bringing those decisions to parliament and 
allowing elected officials to discuss, debate and make comment on 
matters that will have dramatic effects upon Canadians.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been very concerned about the tendency for this to occur. 
It is just another indication or another vehicle where we see 
parliament being removed from the decision making aspect or even 
the accountability aspect of what the government is doing.  That 
is a very dangerous precedent for us to support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As parliamentarians who have been sent here to represent 
Canadians, people across the country, it is imperative for us to 
be watchful that parliament retains its authority and its ability 
to watch and check things occurring in government agencies and 
boards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a need for an arm's length commission to make decisions 
on salary and pay benefits.  The concern raised by the electorate 
outside the House on pay increases for members of parliament is a 
good example of what happens when people have a benefit to reach 
in making decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An independent commission was established to look at the pay and 
benefit packages of members of parliament.  That commission put 
out a report.  The report from that independent body was 
completely ignored by the government.  We are faced with 
parliamentarians once again having to deal with changes to their 
pay and benefit packages.  That should not occur. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentarians should never be in a position of having to 
debate and having to support or not support their salary and pay 
benefit packages.  That should be totally removed from people who 
benefit from those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest the same point should be considered in terms of this 
commission.  We have a commission made up of individuals who 
belong to the judiciary one way or another, or who are attached 
through the justice department, the judiciary committee or 
whatever, to a decision on what pay and benefit packages the 
judges will be given.  That is wrong.  It should be an 
independent arm's length group that makes those decisions and 
those decision should be reviewed by the Parliament of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I may sound repetitive but I cannot express it enough.  I do not 
think Canadians are aware of what is happening.  I do not think 
Canadians realize how much authority and decision making is being 
removed from members of the House.  I do not think Canadians are 
aware of how powerless the House is becoming because of 
legislation that hands over responsibility and authority to 
non-elected boards and removes them from any accountability or 
follow-up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen it with parole boards and immigration review 
committees and this commission and that commission.  We saw it 
once again with the commission struck by the House, or by 
somebody, to review our pay and benefit packages.  Committees and 
commissions come up with decisions which do not have the support 
of the Canadian public that has no recourse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have often asked questions about semi-judicial committees and 
boards.  We have been told that they are arm's length and cannot 
be held accountable.  Who can hold them accountable if it is not 
the House or a committee of the House? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion makes a whole lot of sense.  All it is asking, as I 
understand, is for a commission to report back to a parliamentary 
committee so that the parliamentary committee can review its 
report and can make a judgment on behalf of Canadians whom we 
represent as to whether or not the report should be supported or 
the recommendations should be legitimized.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If for a moment we stop trying to hold commissions, committees 
and the executive branch of government accountable to parliament, 
we are undermining the whole parliamentary system that Canadians 
think exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have absolutely no problem and I would encourage all members 
of parliament to support the motion which asks for parliament to 
know what is going on, to be able to ask questions about what is 
going on, and to be able to bring it into the public forum so 
that the Canadian public knows what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much of what happens outside the House, committees, commissions, 
boards and the executive branch of government, cabinet, is held 
behind closed doors.  It is not public information.  The 
discussions are not public.  Whenever that happens Canadians 
become suspect and often with very good reason.  They become 
cynical.  They feel that if it is not a debate that is happening 
in public there must be something somebody is trying to hide and 
they become less willing to support the end result. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see it in the judicial system.  We see it in the 
parliamentary system.  We see it in the immigration system.  I 
could go on and on.  Canadians are losing respect and their 
support for what we are trying to do because of the things done 
behind closed doors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that in the 36th Parliament we do 
everything we can possibly do to bring our discussions and 
debates into an open forum.  We should not only allow Canadians 
but encourage them to participate in the discussions and in 
making decisions that have to be made about where Canada is to go 
in the next millennium, what kind of direction we should be going 
in and what end result we are trying to reach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one measure with which we can start opening up the 
process, opening up the dialogue, opening up committees, 
commissions and boards, and letting Canadians know that we are 
not afraid of talking to them or of including them in the 
discussions.  We should encourage them to enter into what is 
happening in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see support by all members of the House.  It 
would send a strong message to Canadians who are wondering what 
we are doing that we are open, have nothing to hide and want 
accountability.  We want to be able to bring forward boards and 
commissions that are accountable to parliament.  Then we could 
stand behind the decisions we make.  We could review issues in a 
House committee and the House committee could make suggestions. 
Then the executive branch of government could respect the 
decisions, the reports and the recommendations that come before 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a government and an executive branch of government 
that respected parliament and the decisions made by committees 
and commissions which are held accountable through parliamentary 
committees and parliamentary sessions of the House of Commons and 
its members, Canadians would become less cynical about government 
and about politicians and certainly less cynical about the 
justice system and the judiciary.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor—St. Clair, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take a minute to set out the government's 
position with respect to Motion No. 2 and to point out that 
Standing Orders 32(5) of the House of Commons already provides 
for the referral of any tabled report to the appropriate standing 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second part of my submission would be that Standing Order 
108(2) allows the justice committee or any other committee of its 
own volition to make a study at any time of a matter within the 
jurisdiction of the departments it oversees. 
As a result it seems to me that this is a redundant section.  I 
do not know if it is appropriate to override House standing 
orders by statute.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Standing Order 32(5) states that reports laid before the House 
in accordance with an act of Parliament, which is what this would 
be, shall thereon be deemed to have been permanently referred to 
the appropriate standing committee. The point is that it is 
already referred to us. It does not need to be referred by 
statute because the standing orders already do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights is free to 
determine whether public hearings are in the public interest.  I 
want to point out too that at the time of tabling, it is always 
open to the House to make a motion requiring the committee to 
report back. That has been done from time to time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights has a busy 
schedule but there is no reason why such a report could not be 
studied by it and should not be studied by it, if it is the will 
of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the member for her submission.  It is an interesting 
one.  It is helpful to have these debates, but I would suggest 
that Motion No. 2 is unnecessary in this legislation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK44"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to rise to continue debating Bill C-37, at this time 
on Motion No. 2 put by my colleague, the hon. member for 
Crowfoot.  It would amend the bill to require that a report of a 
commission established to review judicial compensation would 
require a hearing at presentation with discussion, debate and the 
appearance of witnesses at committee, presumably the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights chaired by the hon. member 
who just preceded me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That hon. member said during her remarks that already there is 
provision which can allow for reports of this nature to be tabled 
at committee and to be discussed at committee and commented on by 
witnesses.  That is at the discretion of the government. The 
report need not be tabled at committee.  It only is tabled at 
committee if the government decides that it should be tabled at 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeking to do through Motion No. 2 is to require 
full public scrutiny and transparency of reports of this nature 
so that the people who are paying the bills have a chance to 
comment on them at committee stage.  It is entirely different 
from the status quo arrangement to which the hon. member opposite 
referred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This really begs the question, whenever we have an opportunity 
to broaden parliamentary scrutiny of matters of this nature, why 
is it that the government is always opposed?  Why does it always 
oppose greater parliamentary scrutiny?  These people when they 
were in opposition were the great champions and heroes of 
parliamentary scrutiny, democracy and transparency in such 
matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever a motion such as this one is brought forward on a bill 
of this nature the government members always predictably oppose 
it.  I ask why.  What are they trying to hide?  Who would be 
harmed?  What damage would be done to parliament, to the 
government's agenda, to the independence of the judiciary were 
reports of this nature on judges' compensation to be tabled and 
heard with the comment of witnesses at committee? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that no damage would be done.  The only damage that 
could be done would be to the government's ability to control the 
agenda and to sweep these things under the carpet.  That is why 
the government is opposing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be consistent because we are going through a similar 
exercise right now. By way of analogy, the Parliament of Canada 
Act requires that after a general election a commission be 
appointed by the Governor General in council to review 
indemnities and allowances for members of parliament. This was 
followed of course by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following the election the government appointed the Blais 
commission, three independent Canadians to sit on a commission to 
review MP compensation.  This commission reported back to 
parliament but the hearings were held in camera without the 
appearance of witnesses. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1335"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have a report tabled by the committee on procedure and 
House affairs which has not had public scrutiny or input.  An 
independent commission is set up that reports but with no public 
comment, no opportunity for public scrutiny, no opportunity for 
witnesses to appear.  Then a report is tabled in this place and 
presumably will be passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a serious problem with this procedure, not just as it 
affects judges but also as it affects MPs or anybody else in the 
public sector.  When we are discussing raising compensation for 
people from the public purse, in a sense taking money from 
taxpayers, using the coercive power that we wield in this place 
to levy taxes on people, to pay additional compensation to 
ourselves or to others such as judges, that ought to be done with 
the greatest of possible public scrutiny. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely what Motion No. 2 seeks to do with respect to 
Bill C-37.  I really wonder why the government is opposing this. 
Once again, it raises the whole question not just of the 
compensation of judges but of the lack of transparency in the 
manner through which judges are appointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is probably the only one of the modern democracies that 
does not allow for candidates for the judiciary to first be 
screened by, questioned by or to testify in front of members of 
the national legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that our friends to the south require a senatorial 
review of judicial nominees before they can be confirmed.  It is 
a sensible policy because it ensures that there is a check and 
balance on the power of the executive in loading people who 
support its political agenda on the judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be mistaken.  While we have many marvellous 
hardworking justices who simply interpret the law narrowly and 
strictly, we also have on the benches of this country many judges 
who regard themselves as glorified legislators.  They sit on the 
bench and legislate from the bench.  They do not interpret the 
law.  They make the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have no means as the representatives of the people, as the 
guardians ultimately of the Constitution to ensure that the 
people appointed to that bench are going to interpret rather than 
to legislate from the bench. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask that we have greater transparency when it comes to 
compensation for judges in Bill C-37.  So too, we call for 
greater transparency in the appointment of judges so that the 
public and its representatives in this place, in the upper 
chamber, know what they are getting when the Prime Minister and 
the Governor General in council, when the cabinet decides to 
foist on the bench some radical politician who calls himself or 
herself a judge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also suggest that this principle should be applied throughout 
the public sector.  We ought not to isolate judges.  Whenever we 
are discussing compensation increases for senior people in the 
public sector, including ourselves, why should we not allow for 
complete, full and absolute public scrutiny? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know something, Mr. Speaker?  There is nothing to be 
afraid of.  It is quite possible that experts and ordinary 
Canadians would look at a proposed pay increase or adjustment to 
compensation such as the one proposed in Bill C-37, an 8.3% 
increase over two years and would say “Hey, this is well 
deserved.  These people work hard.  They have earned this 
increase”.  Let us not prejudge the wisdom of the public.  That 
is what we are doing by shutting out public commentary and expert 
commentary through witnesses on this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commented earlier that I find it hard to believe the kind of 
bizarre judicial decisions we see coming with greater and greater 
frequency from federally appointed judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commented earlier on the Feeney decision where a judge 
appointed by cabinet decided that a man who was clearly, 
unquestionably guilty of first degree murder was acquitted.  Why? 
Because an RCMP officer failed to secure a search warrant in a 
rural area in British Columbia when he followed the trace of 
evidence to this man's residence. 
What did he do?  He announced himself as a peace officer.  He 
asked for permission to enter. No one responded.  He went in and 
found the accused passed out on the bed covered in the blood of 
the murdered victim. The judge in that case, a judge appointed by 
the government without parliamentary oversight, allowed that man 
to be acquitted.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This happens all too often with respect to sentencing and 
conditional sentencing.  It happens all too often when judges 
decide they are going to make the law in their own image claiming 
some specious authority in the charter of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we are proposing to give those very same judges who are 
accountable to utterly no one but themselves a pay increase 
almost uncontemplated anywhere else in the public sector, and I 
would submit the private sector, in a country where people are 
earning less now than they did 20 years ago.  At the same time 
the government is telling us that we cannot even put such a 
report before a committee before it comes to the House to allow 
for proper disclosure and proper transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know from private conservations that there are members 
opposite who are very concerned about Bill C-37.  I ask them to 
test their whip for once and vote for greater transparency in 
this place by supporting Motion No. 2 on Bill C-37. 
<P><A NAME="LINK45"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise to support the amendment put forward by my 
colleague from Crowfoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment initiates the process to scrutinize and review the 
commission's report calling for witnesses and reporting its 
findings to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the record I would like to say that the concern is that the 
commission, which is comprised of three members appointed by the 
governor in council:  one nominated by the judiciary; one 
nominated by the Minister of Justice; and one, who shall act as a 
chair, nominated by the first two nominees.  Does anyone think 
they will be objective in their deliberations?  That is precisely 
the point and it is the concern of the public and our 
constituents. These members may not be objective as they have a 
vested interest in increasing their and their colleagues' 
salaries and benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue here is optics in that it just does not look right and 
it will not sell.  From a political point of view I cannot 
understand why the government would put forth such a bill with 
such an amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to briefly return to the issue of the 8.3% pay 
raise over four years.  The bottom line salary today of judges is 
$162,300.  If this bill passes there will be a retroactive raise 
of $13,000.  A lot of my constituents in Dauphin—Swan River do 
not even make $13,000 on an annual basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is not about a pay increase for judges.  If this 
government really wants to do some real work in terms of 
reforming our judicial system, it needs to deal with those issues 
and not about pay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How many people in my own riding would support this pay 
increase?  I do not think too many would. My constituents would 
say that there are lots of issues and problems in the judiciary 
system so why are we not addressing them first? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More and more people are feeling unsafe these days because of 
youth crimes.  For years we have talked about the Young Offenders 
Act.  In fact as early as 1991 when I was first elected as a 
councillor I remember very well a municipal initiative calling on 
the federal government to deal with the Young Offenders Act.  I 
remember filling out surveys sent out by the solicitor general's 
office asking for input on how the Young Offenders Act could be 
changed and reformed. 
Fortunately the municipal organization co-operated and did submit 
its surveys but unfortunately there was no response on the part 
of the government, and this is going back as early as 1991 and 
1992.  The people of this country want to see change but 
unfortunately the government at this level at that time did not 
deem it important enough to follow through on.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore people have very little faith in our judicial system, 
the lack of a justice system.  We have heard figures of 52% of 
the country having very little faith in the justice system.  Bill 
C-68 is another indicator where the government is treating 
law-abiding citizens like criminals.  The government knows that 
with expenditures of $1.2 billion projected to implement the 
registration of all firearms this has no effect whatsoever on 
crime control.  A whole new bureaucracy has been established and 
I am sure thousands of people will be hired to implement another 
bureaucracy which will cost taxpayers more money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many components to a justice system. My colleagues 
speaking on this subject indicated that politicians are included. 
I agree, politicians are part of the problem.  Perhaps they are 
the problem.  Politicians know that people want changes in 
sentencing practices.  The public wants changes victims rights to 
be addressed by the politicians. As I indicated, we all know the 
public wants changes in the Young Offenders Act.  The government 
has to be more accountable for this current situation. The 
government can respond to make judges more accountable and to 
make changes to the Young Offenders Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am basically trying to say is although we have said many 
things about judges I think the politicians need to take some of 
the heat as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments cannot use the judicial system as a vehicle when 
they believe it is expedient, as we have experienced in these 
latter years of our history.  Judges need to answer to this House 
because this is the supreme house of this country.

amendment put forth by the member for Crowfoot.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
Motion No. 2 was put forward by the Reform Party and adds a few 
lines after line 34 on page 3 of the bill: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“(6.1)  A report that is tabled in each House of Parliament

considering matters relating to justice”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment goes on with two other parts related to getting 
some accountability into the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some years ago there was an attempt to roll back judicial 
salaries as part of the cost cutting measures of the government. 
The supreme court actually ruled that any attempt to roll back 
judicial salaries was an interference in the independence of the 
judiciary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing that rolling back salaries is an interference in 
the independence of the judiciary but increasing its salaries is 
not.  Is that not amusing, that one is an interference and one is 
not?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The court ruled that the government had to set up a commission 
to set judicial salaries.  It issued it as an order to the 
government.  Theoretically the government does not actually have 
to obey the order.  It could say we are certainly not going to 
take orders from the judges.  But if the government did not 
accept the position put forward by the supreme court, it would 
find itself in court.  What a sort of rigmarolic circle we would 
get into then with the government trying to legislate itself out 
of court and the court trying to take the government to court and 
all from the starting point where the judges felt the government 
had no right to set their salaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the examples my colleagues have given throughout the day 
indicate quite clearly that the general public is quite 
dissatisfied with what is happening at the judicial level in this 
country.  The poll mentioned in July 1997 showed more than 50% of 
the population dissatisfied with the performance of judges.  The 
examples I gave in my speech earlier today are just from the 
North Vancouver area over the past few months.  They are 
decisions people were outraged to see, short sentences, failure 
of people to appear in court, no arrest warrants issued, simple 
instructions, please turn up next time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Judges are acting as if they are running classrooms and not 
courts of law.  This lack of confidence in judges has caused the 
opposition to look at this bill and ask what on earth is going 
on.  Judges are telling us what to do while as the supreme level 
of justice in Canada we should be setting the rules.  That is the 
reason for the number of motions being put forward to alter this 
bill. It is unfortunate that as usual the government will not 
accept any of them.  It will overrule all of them.  No matter how 
good the ideas might be, no matter how logical the arguments, it 
will use its voting power to overturn anything we propose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can get up and talk to the bill or speak in favour of any of 
the amendments here but we know in our hearts that none of them 
will pass.  If nothing more, at least we can get the message out 
to the people of Canada that we are speaking on their behalf, 
that we are telling the government side and this place that 
people are dissatisfied with what is happening in this thing 
called the justice system which the average person is now calling 
the legal system and is not even respecting it anymore for what 
it should be.  It is time we took action in this place to correct 
the problems.  That is the main thrust and the main reason the 
opposition is taking a position of opposition to this 
legislation.

Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Motion No. 2 put forward by 
my hon. colleague from Crowfoot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It deals with the issue of accountability.  That is where this 
amendment is going. It drives home the point that the commission 
to be set up under Bill C-37 to review the benefit packages and 
the pay of judges should be scrutinized.  If this amendment were 
passed the commission would come before the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights.  That is what this amendment 
accomplishes.  I do not see the problem with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Liberal member stated earlier that in her opinion she felt 
this amendment was redundant since the committees in exercising 
their independence already have the ability to call witnesses on 
virtually any subject that falls under their domain. As one of my 
Calgary colleagues indicated during his brief and brilliant 
presentation, everyone, certainly those in parliament, knows the 
simple fact that the government has a majority position in the 
standing committees.

parliamentary secretary who sits on that committee.  Those are 
the facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can pretend these committees are basically independent but it 
is simply not the facts.  The facts would indicate the cabinet 
and the minister responsible for that portfolio set the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly in this case the Minister of Justice and her 
parliamentary secretary and their appointed chairman of the 
standing committee all desire that this report from the 
commission not be reviewed by the standing committee. They crack 
the whip as they do in the House of Commons.  They get all the 
government members on the standing committee to stand and they 
simply would not bring that forward to be scrutinized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the point of this amendment because if this amendment 
were passed there would be no choice in the matter.  The 
commission's report would have to come before the standing 
committee and there would be public scrutiny through the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When looking at Bill C-37 and this 8.3% increase in salary that 
it will bestow on our judges, what is the view of the people in 
the real world?  What would they think about this piece of 
legislation? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been clearly laid out by a number of my colleagues, when 
we look the tough times a lot of people are having to make ends 
meet today, they would certainly question the need for judges who 
on average are making $140,000 a year to receive a retroactive 
pay increase of 8.3% at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something the average person has no control over. This 
is something that will ultimately result in higher taxes.  The 
money has to come from somewhere.  Where will it come from?  It 
will come out of the pockets of taxpayers and therefore this type 
of increase should be defensible.  It should be scrutinized by 
the general public through the standing committee, which this 
amendment calls for. I see my time has expired.  I always I get 
interrupted by question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I am sorry to interrupt the hon. 
member, but he knows how important question period is to the 
opposition as well as to the government.  I assure him that he 
will have five minutes remaining in his time after question 
period.

<P><A NAME="LINK87"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, today we received all the working papers from the recent 
health officials meeting in Edmonton. This was the meeting where 
the hepatitis C victims stormed out when they were not allowed to 
see the federal position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But now we know why the Prime Minister did not want the victims 
to see the federal position.  The federal position did not 
provide one dime in new compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister say he was willing to look at all the 
options and then instruct his negotiators not to provide one more 
dime in new compensation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK88"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is important for the Leader of the Opposition to understand 
the process in Alberta. Officials are meeting in order to explore 
a whole range of options. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The documents the member is referring to were referred to in the 
newspapers on the weekend.  I see that four days later the Reform 
Party is getting around to reading them. All the options are 
being carefully and methodically examined by officials so that 
when ministers are given the results of that work we will be in a 
position to make a decision. That is the way we think work is 
properly done. 
<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister's negotiators had two proposals, a do 
nothing proposal and a do next to nothing proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Prime Minister was willing to do was set up a few 
additional hospital beds so that the victims would have somewhere 
to die; not a word about additional compensation. But of course 
there was a warning about bad press that might come from that 
decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the Prime Minister not just admit he is stubbornly 
refusing to allow his negotiators to offer one more dime in 
additional compensation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I do not know why the Leader of the Opposition wants to ignore 
the process going on here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have people looking carefully at all the options.  Why will 
he not let that work go on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one hand he says he wants to have compensation for all 
hepatitis C victims and on the other, when governments 
responsibly and methodically look at the options with their 
officials, he takes some documents out of context and criticizes 
us for not coming to a conclusion before the work is done.  He 
ought to wait. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Preston Manning (Leader of the Opposition, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we prefer to hear from the Prime Minister rather than 
from the government's lawyer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the federal government's options put forward by its 
negotiators was labelled the status quo option.  I assume that is 
the Prime Minister's favourite option since he favours the status 
quo on everything. But in listing the pros and cons of this 
option the federal officials under the cons say it does not meet 
recommendations set out by Krever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Prime Minister finally admit that his preferred 
position on hepatitis C does not meet the recommendations of 
Justice Krever in his report?

</I></B></P><P align=left>It does no one any good for this member to take documents out of

and try to make some point in the House of Commons.  I would 
rather see the work done properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we have asked officials from provincial and federal 
governments to sit together, work on the details and look at the 
options.  When we have that information we will then make a 
decision.  That is the responsible way of approaching this. 
<P><A NAME="LINK93"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, these 
important documents pull the mask of compassion from the Prime

of compassion were just a cover for a policy of no compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister tell us that he would listen to all 
the options when he was secretly, behind the scenes, telling his 
bureaucrats to scuttle any deal for compensation? 
<P><A NAME="LINK94"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the documents to which the member is referring were referred to 
in newspaper reports on the weekend.  It was really breaking news 
for the member, I suppose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that all the options are being examined.  No 
decision has been made.  A decision will not be made on the new 
national consensus until we have all the information, which is 
exactly what the officials are doing. 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, some of 
these individuals came to the meeting ready to come up with some 
money.  Some of them came there saying they were uncertain if 
they could afford that.  But at least they came with an open mind 
to listen to all the proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister's officials came there with one thing in 
mind: no compensation for the victims. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the Prime Minister say one thing in public and then send 
his bureaucrats with another thing?  Why has be betrayed these 
victims again? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have said the same thing wherever we have gone, that we want 
officials to look at all the options so that governments will be 
in a position to make a decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Listening to the member for Macleod taking bits of documents out 
of context, I think it is important for him to remember the 
welfare of the people we are trying to help in this case.  I 
think it is important for him to remember he is a medical doctor 
as well as a spin doctor.

<P><A NAME="LINK123"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I understand that it is in the best interests of the 
travelling public to have two viable airlines in Canada.  That is 
why this government put in place measures a couple of years ago 
to assist Canadian Airlines with its restructuring plan.  That 
plan is working quite well.  Canadian Airlines is now making 
money, as is Air Canada which incidentally made $427 million last 
year and is doing very well.  It will do very much better as a 
result of these changes. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK124"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the more the 
Minister intervenes to keep Canadian alive, on artificial live 
support more or less, the more Canadians must pass through 
American airports to get to Europe.  This is simple enough and 
the minister ought to understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister admit that his policy for saving two Canadian 
carriers in Canada, which is in some ways hindering the 
development of Air Canada, is also doing harm to the Montreal 
airport, which is ending up as a satellite for U.S. airports? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I fail to see how designating Air Canada as the 
carrier from Toronto to Hong Kong seven days a week and five code 
shares of their choice, much of which will benefit the travelling 
public of Montreal, is somehow putting Air Canada at a 
disadvantage.  To the contrary.  The fact is these changes and 
further changes that are expected within the year will assist Air 
Canada in becoming more competitive.  It will give it more 
revenues. It will also do the same for Canadian Airlines.  That 
is the balanced approach, which is what this government believes 
in and we will stand by it.

<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the Canadian Taxpayers Federation released a report that 
indicates very clearly that Bombardier was one of the worst 
welfare bums in Canada.  It has received $1.2 billion in grants 
and subsidies over the last 15 years.  The Prime Minister gives 
Bombardier a lot of untendered contracts, 110 untendered 
contracts.  At least these followed the rules of providing public 
disclosure.  So why did the Prime Minister not follow that rule 
when the government awarded the largest contract valued at $2.85 
billion? 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in relation to this contract in Cold Lake and so on, I 
can quote “On May 2 I attended a supper in Grand Centre, Alberta 
to welcome a NATO delegation.  They are studying” and there is a 
lot of very good text in favour of all of that.  “The 
government-industry team has focused on the military and economic 
benefits of training there” and so on. The special evening “was 
an excellent example of western hospitality” and so on.  It was 
a great statement made under Standing Order 31 on May 6, 1996. 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
Prime Minister just does not get it when it comes to untendered 
contracts.  Frontec Corporation, part of the Bombardier 
consortium and part of that $2.85 billion contract, is about to 
receive another $550 million untendered contract. Our beef is not 
with Frontec.  Our concern is with the Prime Minister not 
following the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will the Prime Minister stand up and follow the rule of 
public disclosure, be fair, have fair competition and put all 
these massive contracts out for tender? 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

flags.  The guests were treated to a fabulous supper of Alberta 
beef.  It was a great display of unity and support” for this

response to a question from the member for Chicoutimi this week, 
the Minister of Transport said that he had had no request from 
Quebec's transport minister for financial assistance with 
respect to route 175 between Quebec City and the Saguenay.

containing a very clear request for help repairing route 175 in

Edmonton meeting?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

not working at all.  The fact that the family income supplement 
we introduced in our reform applied to total family income and 
not to individual income, as it did under the preceding 
government, was clearly unfair, and this was recognized in all 
the reports on how the system was working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also wanted to put the system on an hourly basis in order to 
give Canadians a fairer and more equitable system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we have a document that appears to have been leaked from the 
government House leader's office that indicates this House will 
recess on or about June 16.  I would like to find out from the 
government House leader if that is in fact true and ask him what 
the business is for the remainder of this session. 
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is an interesting question. 
If this was leaked from my office, someone has obviously misread 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This afternoon we will continue and hopefully complete Bill 
C-37, the Judges Act amendments at report stage, followed by Bill 
C-26, the grains legislation, then by Bill C-3, the DNA bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow we shall consider second reading of Bill S-2, the 
transportation safety board bill, and report stage of Bill S-3, 
the pension benefits legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As already announced, next Monday and Tuesday are allotted days. 
After the supply is disposed of on Tuesday evening, our 
priorities will then be the completion of Bill C-37, at third 
reading hopefully; concurrence in the Senate amendments to Bill 
C-4, the wheat board legislation; and the completion of other 
bills already mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, among other matters we intend to pursue the 
completion of the following:  Bill C-38, respecting the Tuktut 
park; Bill C-25, the defence legislation; Bill C-27, the 
fisheries bill; Bill C-20, the competition legislation; Bill S-9, 
the depository notes bill; Bill C-30, the Mi'kmaq education bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a heavy load to complete before the adjournment date set 
by the standing orders.  I intend to consult the other House 
leaders to determine whether we will require evening sittings to 
meet this deadline.  I hope that we do not, but as I have been 
saying for some time, it is clear that we have at least two more 
weeks of intensive work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the rumour mill has it that the House would be 
adjourning much earlier. 
Some people have even said, and quite irresponsibly, that we 
could be adjourning as early as June 12.  This is plain silly. 
There is more work to be done.  I would hope to be able to 
adjourn by June 19 if all goes well.

I wonder if the government House leader could comment in terms of 
legislation expected to be introduced but not passed by the 
summer break.  Can he tell us whether he expects that the House 
will have an opportunity to see the post-TAGS legislation and 
whether or not the government intends to bring forward 
legislation having to do with the implementation of the seniors 
benefit?  Certainly a lot of people would like to know whether or 
not the government intends to proceed with this.  They hope that 
it does not, but they would like to know what the government's 
plans are in this respect. Perhaps the government House leader 
could enlighten us on these two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria:</B>  Mr. Speaker, obviously it would be

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of Bill C-37, an act to amend 
the Judges Act and to make consequential amendments to other 
acts, as reported (without amendment) from the committee; and of 
Motion No. 2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  When the House broke for question 
period the hon. member for Prince George—Peace River had the 
floor. There were remaining to him five minutes in his allotted 
time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, as always it is a pleasure to rise to speak.  It strikes 
me as somewhat unfortunate, as it seems that the four or five 
times I have spoken this spring my presentations have been 
interrupted by that one hour question period. Today continues 
what has been set as a tradition for my presentations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remark at the outset in reply to the government House leader 
who just spoke about legislation we have to deal with and he 
hoped we would not have to have evening sittings.  I think that 
is certainly the hope of everyone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is, if the option is that the opposition just cease 
being opposition and we rubber stamp everything that the 
government has brought forward in order that we can get all this 
legislation, this heavy load as he called it, through, that is 
not going to happen.  If it requires that we sit well into the 
evening over the next couple of weeks, then that is what we will 
be doing in order to represent the concerns of Canadians who live 
and work out in the real world.  They have some very deep 
concerns with the legislation the government wants to ram through 
the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we adjourned the debate just prior to question period I was 
in the midst of talking about Bill C-37, specifically about 
Motion No. 2.  We are at report stage of Bill C-37, an act to 
amend the Judges Act.  Motion No. 2, which was brought forward by 
my colleague from Crowfoot, deals with accountability and having 
the reports of future recommendations by the commission that will 
be set up under Bill C-37 to consider judges' compensation, wages 
and benefits packages brought before the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I was getting at is that this is really an issue of 
accountability, of bringing an element of public scrutiny to 
these reports. In this way the general public can have some input 
through their opposition members of parliament at the standing 
committee as to what they feel is fair compensation for our 
nation's judges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What bothers Canadians most about the issue of an 8.3% increase 
in salary for judges?  I suspect that probably what bothers them 
most is some of the rulings that they see from some of the 
judges.  I want to be very clear in saying that it is some of the 
judges, not all of them.  A lot of them are making judgments and 
rulings that are defensible to the general public. 
Certainly increasingly it seems that there is one underlying 
theme running through a lot of the judgments that come down from 
our courts.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in talking to report stage Motion No. 1 of Bill C-37 I 
referred to three specific cases that are fairly well known in my 
riding of Prince George—Peace River, the Feeney, Solomon and 
Baldwin cases and ultimately the judgments that were rendered 
with those cases. My concern is I do not feel that in a lot of 
the cases where the judges are actually legislating or making law 
rather than fairly interpreting the law that their decisions are 
supported by the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear this increasingly from my constituents and I think the 
Feeney case is a classic example.  It does not seem to matter any 
longer whether an accused is innocent or guilty.  What seems to 
matter is whether it is legal or illegal. The courts seem to be 
more concerned about technicalities rather than guilt or 
innocence.  There is something sadly lacking in our legal system 
which is masquerading as a justice system today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will not be supporting this bill.  We do not feel that the 
Canadian public at this time will defend an 8.3% increase in 
judges' salaries when they cannot understand or support a lot of 
the decisions that these same judges are making.

I rise on a point of order.  It has come to my attention and I 
think to the attention of other House leaders and members of 
parliament that tomorrow there is a press conference scheduled in 
Room 130-S by Mr. Ernst Zundel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a matter of great concern to all members of parliament 
that the premises here should be used for this purpose.  I would 
like to register my concern and I am sure others may want to rise 
on the same point of order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker,

</I></B></P><P align=left>The conference to take place Friday, June 5 at 10.30 a.m. in the 
Charles Lynch press conference room, Room 130-S Centre Block, I 
think flies in the face of what Canadian people truly believe. 
This fellow is a well-known Holocaust denial spokesperson.  I 
cannot believe that the people responsible for the Charles Lynch 
conference room would allow such a thing to happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the government House leader to give this House the 
confidence that not only will this not occur but that it will not 
occur again as far as the booking of that facility for such an 
individual is concerned. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to reiterate the comments made by my 
colleagues.  I think this entire parliament and the House itself 
borders on being brought into disrepute by having a press 
conference hosted by this individual, given his statements and 
his well-known position, as was mentioned, on the issue of the 
Holocaust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It really borders on lunacy that this would be permitted to take 
place in this building which is supposed to be the bastion of 
tolerance and moderate thinking.  That this would take place on 
Parliament Hill really challenges the bounds of credulity when 
one considers that this is going to happen tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hoping there is some way that the government can remedy 
this.  I am anxious to hear the response from the government 
House leader. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I became acquainted with this 
condition around 1.45 p.m. this afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Upon being notified, I immediately contacted the officials of 
the Press Gallery on Parliament Hill who I understand have the 
responsibility for these premises.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expressed to them my dissatisfaction with the fact that this 
building, the house of democracy in our country, was going to be 
utilized in any way, shape or form for the benefit of one Ernst 
Zundel.  The people informed me that, in fact, the room was 
accessible to this person, but that they were going to look at it 
further, and I really hope they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I indicated that although I had not spoken to the other members 
of the Board of Internal Economy I was confident that I was 
speaking on their behalf when I expressed my displeasure at the 
fact that Mr. Ernst Zundel would be using part of the 
parliamentary precincts to host this press conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will know, of course, that the government itself does 
not administer any part of the building, much less that room. 
However, having heard the comments from other House leaders and 
being reinforced by their support, which I believe I am by the 
statements I have just heard, it is certainly my hope that those 
who are in charge of reserving this facility will change their 
minds forthwith and ensure that this press conference, if it is 
held at all, is held elsewhere and not in this building. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I think the representations made by 
the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona, the House leader of the 
official opposition, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and the government House leader 
will be drawn to the attention of those who are responsible for 
the administration of this room. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I stress, as the government House leader has pointed out, that 
it is not a matter which is under the administrative jurisdiction 
of the Speaker directly or of the Board of Internal Economy 
directly, but that it is under the administration of the 
parliamentary press gallery, as I understand it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure these remarks will be drawn to their attention 
forthwith and we will await developments.  I do not see any point 
in continuing a discussion on this point at this time.

<A NAME="LINK196">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from May 28 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act and the 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act 
and to repeal the Grain Futures Act, be read the third time and 
passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George—Peace River, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to rise again today at this time 
to address Bill C-26, an act to amend the Canada Grain Act and 
the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties 
Act and to repeal the Grain Futures Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into exactly what Bill C-26 does and why the

express my appreciation to all members involved in the decision 
that took place last Thursday when Bill C-26 was last before the

</I></B></P><P align=left>I was unavoidably committed elsewhere on that day. 
At first it appeared that I would not be able to have a final 
chance to address this particular legislation, but with unanimous 
agreement from all the parties it was decided to bring the bill 
back today and that allows me the opportunity to speak.  I 
appreciate that decision, particularly on the part of the 
government.

<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 will accomplish three distinctly different objectives. 
First, in repealing the Grain Futures Act, Bill C-26 paves the 
way for the Manitoba government to regulate the Winnipeg 
Commodity Exchange rather than having the exchange fall under 
federal jurisdiction, the Canadian Grain Commission to be 
specific, which it does at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my understanding that the exchange wants to offer trading 
of non-grain contracts, especially hogs, and the repeal of the 
Grain Futures Act will facilitate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I noted previously during second reading and at report stage, 
having the province of Manitoba assume responsibility through the 
Manitoba Securities Commission to regulate the Winnipeg Commodity 
Exchange is a positive step and one which we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, Bill C-26 will bring the Canada Grain Act under the 
umbrella of the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary 
Penalties Act, thereby permitting fines for violations of the 
Canada Grain Act and its regulations to be levied by the Canadian 
Grain Commission.  Because this legislation has a wider range of 
enforcement options which will allow greater flexibility, we view 
this as a positive step and therefore one which we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the third item which Bill C-26 accomplishes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because this government once more has failed to listen to the 
farmers and their representatives who appeared before the 
standing committee on agriculture, we find ourselves in 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-26 began with the establishment of the special crops 
rural initiative program committee.  This SCRIP committee is made 
up of producers and processors from the three prairie provinces 
and is assisted by a representative from the Canadian Grain 
Commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the committee has consulted with stakeholders and in 
April of 1996 it drafted a report called the “Special Crops 
Rural Initiative Program” upon which this bill is loosely based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of the recommendations made by the SCRIP committee are not 
included in Bill C-26, but will be laid out in regulations which 
do not undergo scrutiny by parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it would be impractical to set out specifics such as levy 
rates and deductibles in legislation, it would be more reassuring 
for farmers if certain limits were set out.  For example, the 
legislation could have ensured that the levy rate not exceed 1% 
of the gross value of the grain sale proceeds. This would provide 
comfort in the years to come that the levy would not simply 
skyrocket to an unreasonable level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government likes to wax poetic about the success of the 
consultative process through SCRIP, but we saw very early on that 
SCRIP recommendations were overruled by the Canadian Grain 
Commission when the levy was set at a higher level than 
recommended by the committee.  That is a rather ominous start and 
a cause for concern for farmers of special crops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The farmers who will be affected by this bill will be those 
producing beans, buckwheat, corn, fababeans, lentils, mustard 
seed, peas, safflower seed, soybeans, sunflower seed and 
triticale. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The production of those products or commodities is on the 
increase all across western Canada.  As a farmer myself, as 
someone who has farmed close to 20 years in the Peace River 
country, I can tell members that farmers are increasingly looking 
at these special crops as a way in which to diversify, as a way 
in which to try to spread their risk and as a way in which to try 
to increase their profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why there is a great concern about this bill and how it 
is being brought in, and more specifically, how the levy will be 
structured and administered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the licensing insurance scheme created under this 
legislation, there is an alarming lack of competition.  Even the 
parliamentary secretary confirmed that the Canadian Grain 
Commission developed this bill.  So there is indeed a high level 
of self-interest since the commission will also administer the 
plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present buyers and dealers are free to shop around for the 
best price on their bond.  I brought this issue up when the bill 
was before the committee and representatives of the Canadian 
Grain Commission were appearing as witnesses.  Under the present 
system there is a certain competitiveness.  The dealers, if they 
are licensed and are required to put up a bond, can shop around 
amongst the various agencies in order to purchase that bond. 
Under this new system they will not have that option.  They will 
not have that freedom of choice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, special crops producers are free to shop around for the 
best price for their product.  In doing so they have to recognize 
the potential risk if they choose to deal with an unlicensed, 
unbonded dealer.  If the buyer was to go into bankruptcy prior to 
them receiving payment for their delivery, they obviously would 
not be covered.  That option is available to the producer.  If he 
or she can see that there is a potential for a higher return for 
the product, they may indeed be willing to accept that risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All dealers will be licensed and insured with the Canadian Grain 
Commission acting as the agent and the Canadian Export 
Development Corporation becoming the single insurer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a suggestion by the government that sometime in the 
future one or both of these tasks could be contracted to the 
private sector.  I do not think I will hold my breath.  Without 
such a goal outlined in legislation I see no real hope that the 
Canadian Grain Commission will be willing to release its grip on 
the plan so that it can eventually be transferred to the private 
sector.  It is the farmers' money and they should run the 
insurance plan, not the bureaucrats.  We have learned time and 
time again that the bureaucracy is not very good at running 
programs and plans such as this, where the expertise, 
capabilities and resources already exist in the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While Bill C-26 does provide some positive developments for 
producers of special crops, it also reminds me of a runaway train 
that is increasingly getting beyond the control of the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to digress for a moment and refer the viewing 
audience at home to some other examples of legislation where this 
government has increasingly shown open disdain to listen to 
farmers, the people who will be affected by this legislation.  In 
some ways there is a trend here.  There is a similarity with Bill 
C-19. the labour legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a number of producers and farm groups who suggested that 
because Bill C-19 takes a small step forward under section 87.7 
in ensuring that the standard grains will continue to flow, even 
in the case of a pending labour disruption at the ports, and that 
ships will continue to be loaded that we should support Bill 
C-19.  But the point we have repeatedly made is, why is it that 
this government will not listen to farmers and amend legislation? 
Why is it that it will not listen to opposition members and amend 
legislation to improve it?  We have to settle for second best. 
We have to make do.  We have to simply say that there is some 
good in the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In defence of the government, there is some good in the majority 
of legislation that goes through this House.  The government is 
not bringing forward legislation just because it has nothing else 
to do.  I am sure that it is bringing it forward with the best of 
intentions.  However, the fact remains that almost all 
legislation, certainly all the legislation that I can think of 
that goes through this House, could be improved if only the 
government and its members were willing to listen, and in this 
case listen to the farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also reminds me of legislation that is going to come back 
before the House next week, Bill C-4, the amendments to the 
Canadian Wheat Board Act.  Here again the government has shown a 
tendency not to listen to the farmers and act upon their 
recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at what we had to give up to get this plan. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1530"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Farmers will be forced to pay for the insurance plan up front 
whether or not they want to participate.  They will then have to 
write to ask for their hard earned money to be returned to them. 
It is like a tax in that sense.  If they are lucky they will get 
a refund at the end of the year.  It is modelled on negative 
option billing which I recall the government repeatedly hailed as 
an unfair way in which to do business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Criticism of this aspect of Bill C-26 was abundant during 
witness testimony when the legislation was considered by the 
Standing Committee on Agriculture and Agri-Food.  During the 
month of April besides the Canadian Grain Commission we heard 
from representatives of the Manitoba Pulse Growers Association, 
Saskatchewan Farmer Consultations for SCRIP, the Western Canadian 
Marketers and Processors Association, the Western Canadian Wheat 
Growers Association, the Alberta Pulse Growers Association, the 
Saskatchewan Pulse Growers Association and the Western Barley 
Growers Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had an opportunity to appear before the committee even though 
the time was shortened and the bill was hastened through the 
process.  There was not a lot of time to hear from them about 
their presentations or for members, be they government or 
opposition, to cross-examine the witnesses to probe deeper into 
their concerns about the pending legislation.  We had the 
opportunity to have a substantial number of farm groups appear 
before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were very fortunate to have had the opportunity to hear from 
all these witnesses.  It is one of the best tools of 
parliamentarians to accurately determine the will of the people. 
As a result of their opinions the Reform Party moved a number of 
amendments at both committee stage and report stage to reflect 
that feedback. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, as I have said, it appears the government does 
not value the opinion of farmers and defeated our amendments that 
would have made Bill C-26 an improved piece of legislation in the 
opinion of special crops producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the time that I have remaining I would like to go over a few 
of the amendments the government has chosen to defeat.  At 
committee stage some Liberal government amendments to the bill 
were put forward and passed which Reform supported.  If I recall 
correctly they were supported by all the parties.  Some of them 
were technical in nature.  One amendment to clause 7 was to 
ensure that a producer's contribution to the insurance plan would 
be reimbursed after withdrawal from the plan in a more timely 
manner at the end of the season. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard repeatedly from farm representatives about negative 
option billing where everybody is in the levy.  They cannot opt 
out as it were.  They cannot say up front “No, do not collect 
this.  Every time I haul a load of one of the designated crops to 
the elevator I do not want that taken off my cheque”. They 
cannot do that.  It is taken off anyway.  They were also 
concerned that they would have to keep track of it throughout the 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note even with the amendment that it is unclear at this point 
just exactly how it will operate and how cumbersome the 
administration will be for individual farmers.  That concern was 
pretty unanimous in the farm representations we heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another Liberal amendment was basically an exclusion amendment 
which we certainly supported and applauded.  A concern was 
expressed by a number of farm groups representing western 
producers of special crops.  Even the Canadian Grain Commission 
said that at some point in the future perhaps this levy, this 
insurance and licensing scheme, could be expanded to include the 
six standard grains:  wheat, oats, barley, rye, canola and flax. 
A lot of concern about that was expressed by farmers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government brought forward this amendment to very 
clearly state that those grains would be excluded we supported 
it.

<A HREF="#LINKT58"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well motions were put forward by the other parties. What we 
heard really came down to two main contentions with respect to 
the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard that farmers were concerned about the way in which the 
levy would be collected.  They were concerned that like the GST 
it would be foisted on them.  They would have to keep track of it 
as they went along.  Then, if they did not want to have their 
crops insured with the dealer, they would have to keep track of 
the levy, which is 38 cents per $100 of sales, how much over the 
year had been taken off their cheques, and then apply for it. 
This would create additional bookkeeping they were not too 
interested in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were also concerned about the lack of freedom of choice. 
They felt once more that government was intervening in the 
marketplace, in their freedoms as business people, and that if 
they wanted to accept the risk of selling their product to an 
unlicensed, unbonded and uninsured dealer or buyer it should be 
their choice.  Once more they saw government intervening and 
telling them the way in which they should run their business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We brought forward a number of amendments at report stage to 
address this last issue.  The farmers were also concerned that 
the advisory committee the minister would be required to set up 
to advise on the administration of the insurance plan would have 
no power.  Under the legislation it does not have any power 
despite the fact that all administration costs and the costs of 
the insurance would be borne entirely by farmers through the 
levy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They were telling us the advisory board should be a board of 
directors that would administer and oversee the insurance plan 
and decide themselves.  It would be farmers looking after their 
own money since it is their money and dealing with it as best 
they could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition brought forward amendments dealing with 
all those concerns and the government chose to defeat them.  In 
light of the fact that the government consistently ignores the 
concerns and desires of western producers and western Canadian 
farmers, whether it is Bill C-4, Bill C-19 or Bill C-26, the 
official opposition, the Reform Party of Canada, cannot support 
Bill C-26 even though as I said earlier there is a lot of good in 
it.  The government will not amend or improve the legislation. 
Shame on the government.  We cannot support it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The positive effects of this bill are that it will better serve

</I></B></P><P align=left>I must, however, add that I have several reservations, which I 
have brought up in both the Standing Committee on Agriculture

specialized crop producers in the Canadian West, on the 
Prairies.  It is part of a reworking of legislation affecting 
that group. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a Quebec MP, I do not feel much affected by this bill, except 
to ensure generally that the producers benefit as much as 
possible from it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I were to meddle in this debate at a more technical or more 
detailed level, this would be interfering in matters that do not 
concern me, and I have no intention of doing so.  For example, 
where the voluntary contribution to the insurance plan is 
concerned, we have our own insurance plan and the whole strategy 
surrounding this debate is totally foreign to me.  I will not, 
therefore, try to get involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is obvious, however, that the interests of the specialized 
crop producers must be served, and we will therefore be voting 
in favour of Bill C-26.

Speaker, I appreciate the consent of the House.  I just left the 
reading room where we were having a familiarization program on 
our crime prevention initiative.  I appreciate the number of 
representatives of your staff who are participating in that 
exercise.  You are to be commended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to address the House today at third reading of Bill 
C-3 which provides for the establishment of Canada's national DNA 
databank.  The DNA identification act will make Canada one of 
only a handful of countries in the world to have a national 
system of this kind.  I am very pleased to say that this 
groundbreaking legislation is a major milestone in the 
government's safer communities agenda.  Public safety is my 
priority.  To that end Bill C-3 forms an important part of my 
commitment to Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our intention in the legislation is to create a practical law 
enforcement tool for police that will stand the test of time.  We 
have been mindful that this exercise involves a careful balancing 
of public safety measures on one hand and privacy rights which 
Canadians hold dearly on the other.  In this regard we have found 
the right balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the bill was introduced last September members of the 
House have proceeded cautiously in their consideration of the 
legislation. 
I believe this approach is laudable given the scope of the issues 
surrounding the use and potential misuse of DNA profiles and 
samples as well as the legal and ethical considerations. That is 
the reason Bill C-3 was referred to the committee prior to second 
reading.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encouraged amendments to improve it and had every expectations 
that we would come out of this exercise with a better bill.  In 
my view that is exactly what has been achieved. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now explain how Bill C-3 was drafted, how it is to be 
applied, what its advantages will be, and finally how it has 
been improved through the efforts of the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Introduction of the DNA Identification Act constitutes phase two 
of the government's strategy on DNA. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The introduction of the DNA identification act marked the second 
phase of the government's DNA strategy.  The first important step 
involved laying out the requirements for when DNA samples could 
be obtained for the purpose of criminal investigation.  As a 
result, in July 1995 amendments to the Criminal Code were passed 
to allow police to obtain DNA samples from suspects in criminal 
investigations with the use of a warrant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That legislation provided the police with an effective tool that 
has helped them solve hundreds of serious crimes.  It has been 
effective because it has been used to help eliminate suspects and 
secure convictions.  It has been instrumental in obtaining guilty 
pleas, thereby sparing victims the trauma of testifying and 
reducing overall investigation and court costs.  It has also 
withstood constitutional challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the DNA warrant legislation firmly in place, the government 
is proceeding to the next step of its DNA initiative, creating a 
framework for storing DNA samples and using stored DNA 
information in the investigation of serious criminal offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A national DNA databank will be an important tool to help police 
link a suspect with evidence left at a crime scene.  The ability 
to store and later retrieve DNA profiles will shorten 
investigations and help prevent further violence by repeat 
offenders.  This means better public safety for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, Bill C-3 will authorize police to collect DNA samples 
for offenders convicted of designated criminal offences.  These 
include the most serious personal injury crimes, including 
homicide and sexual offence, which are likely to be associated 
with DNA evidence being found at the crime scene. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Samples will be analysed with the resulting profile entered into 
the convicted offenders index of the databank.  The databank will 
also have a crime scene index containing DNA information 
retrieved from crime scenes.  By having this structure profiles 
can be cross-referenced to find a match in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The benefits of such a system are clear.  Stored DNA information 
will enable police to more quickly identify suspects where they 
have no leads and identify repeat offenders across police 
jurisdictions.  It also has the potential to deter offenders from 
committing future crimes as they will know that because their DNA 
profile is in the databank they will not be able to slip through 
the cracks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Throughout the development of Bill C-3 the federal government 
has sought the advice and expertise of many groups and 
individuals, including those on the front lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights 
held 15 witness hearings on the bill with representatives from 17 
different organizations, including police associations, victims 
groups and legal organizations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These consultations revealed strong support for the creation of 
a national DNA databank but there were also a number of concerns 
regarding Canadian values of privacy, public protection and 
individual rights guaranteed by the charter. To respond to those 
concerns and improve the overall effectiveness of the bill, a 
number of amendments have been made since the legislation was 
introduced last fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Various interest groups, including the privacy commissioner, le 
Barreau du Québec and the national action committee on the status 
of women, suggested that the bill did not contain sufficient 
safeguards to protect the use of DNA profiles from the samples of 
victims, cleared suspects and people who volunteer samples to 
help police.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, the government brought a motion to clarify that 
access to the information contained in the crime scene index 
shall be permanently removed if it relates to a victim or person 
who has been eliminated as a suspect in a criminal investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard that DNA analysis has come a long way since it was 
first used in the criminal justice system just 10 years ago. 
While the technology has matured at a swift pace, one thing 
remains constant.  DNA has the potential to reveal much more 
about a person than a fingerprint.  As one committee member put 
it, a fingerprint leaves an impression of me, DNA is a part of 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To ensure that DNA information is safeguarded and used only for 
the purpose of forensic DNA analysis, the bill sets out very 
limited access to the databank.  It prohibits any improper use of 
information and limits access only to those directly involved 
with its ongoing operation and maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To further protect the privacy of innocent persons, the bill 
contains a new provision specifying that access to DNA 
information shall be permanently removed where a person has been 
eliminated as a suspect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During committee hearings on the bill we heard from several 
witnesses and committee members that the proposed designated 
offence list could be expanded to capture other serious offences 
for which DNA evidence might be useful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee addressed this by adding infanticide to the 
primary list and expanding the secondary list to include 
dangerous and impaired driving causing bodily harm or death and a 
number of sexual offences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe these changes will be invaluable to police and will 
enhance public safety.  During the committee's hearings, several 
witnesses recommended that the retroactive scheme be expanded to 
include samples from not only dangerous offenders and repeat sex 
offenders but murderers who have killed more than once. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government acted on this by bringing in an amendment to the 
bill to allow DNA to be collected retroactively from such 
offenders.  This expansion will capture offenders like many known 
in Canada and will provide the police with valuable information 
to help solve outstanding criminal cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude by sharing the rationale for taking samples at 
conviction.  The police have expressed strong views that DNA 
samples should be taken earlier, at the time of arrest or charge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind members that police already have the authority to take 
DNA samples at the time of arrest where they get a warrant to do 
so.  They will continue to be able to use DNA evidence for 
investigative purposes in accordance with the DNA warrant scheme 
in place for almost three years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The departments of justice and solicitor general consulted 
extensively on this issue and the Standing Committee on Justice 
and Human Rights thoroughly reviewed it.  The vast majority of 
those consulted expressed the view that taking samples after a 
person has been convicted will respect the rights of all 
Canadians under the charter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also shared the position that taking samples at arrest or 
charge could pose a very serious risk of being struck down as 
unconstitutional.  Given that many individuals and organizations 
have continued to press for expanding this provision, my 
colleague, the Minister of Justice, sought independent legal 
opinion from three of Canada's most eminent justices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each one concluded that a proposal to take samples at the time 
of arrest for databanking purposes would not survive a charter 
challenge.  Some members have brushed the legal opinions aside 
and have argued that the charter is simply a road block to 
justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me remind the hon. members that parliament's authority to 
legislate flows from the Constitution.  The Constitution includes 
the charter which protects the fundamental rights and freedoms of 
all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is the duty of parliament to exercise its authority in a 
manner that respects the charter.  Taking samples for the 
databank at the time of conviction rather than at the time of 
arrest or charge will not prevent police from doing their job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will provide police with an effective investigative tool that 
will allow them to do their job and ensure that the authority to 
use this tool will comply with our constitutional requirement as 
recently defined by the supreme court. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said earlier, we have come out of committee hearings with a 
stronger bill.  It is the government's view that Bill C-3 is 
fundamentally sound.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are confident that we have found an effective balance between 
the need to provide the police with the tools they need to do 
their job and the requirement to respect the constitutional and 
privacy rights of all Canadians.  There is no question that the 
use of DNA evidence has been a significant breakthrough in the 
criminal justice system.  But we must be mindful that it is a 
powerful tool and one that must be safeguarded against potential 
abuse. The creation of a databank that can be upheld by the 
courts will go a long way toward protecting Canadians from repeat 
violent offenders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge members to support Bill C-3 so that we can proceed in 
creating Canada's first national DNA databank. I thank all 
members who have brought much to improve this bill for their 
participation in this exercise.

official opposition and the Bloc Quebecois. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there unanimous consent that we proceed in this way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK203"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general has indicated that there were long 
deliberations before the standing committee on justice.  There 
have been.  Many members participated in that and many expert 
witnesses came before the committee.  Many of us on the committee 
learned a great deal.  We learned what DNA means.  We learned how 
it is extracted.  We learned how it is banked.  We heard from 
many groups as varied as the national action committee on the 
status of women, police association representatives, the Canadian 
Bar Associations.  Many groups had an interest in this 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members in this House put forward amendments to the bill. 
They were well thought out amendments that concerned the way the 
bill would be in place and the process by which it would be 
accessed by both the police and the courts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general was correct when he said we attempted to 
achieve a balance between the civil rights of individuals, the 
privacy rights of individuals and the very compelling need for 
the police to have an important tool to help them fight crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of where a balance is met is always one that is 
open to debate.  Each of us would have differing views as to 
exactly where on the scale we ought to shift some of the weight. 
I introduced amendments, some of which were taken into account by 
the government and incorporated in the legislation.  Others were 
introduced in the House and have received support from most 
parties except the government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It was my request that the period of incarceration for someone 
who would breach the privacy laws be extended from two years to 
five but that was not deemed appropriate enough for the 
government to support it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that the House with the passage of this bill 
will provide the police with an important tool to more readily 
address and solve crime.  We cannot forget that the DNA databank 
is a tool of investigation.  It is one more weapon in the arsenal 
of the police to allow them to bring forward information 
essential to assist the courts, the judiciary and in some cases 
juries in determining guilt or innocence of an individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will assist the police in bringing forward charges and help 
them establish whether they have reasonable and probable grounds 
to determine whether a crime has been committed and a charge 
should be laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will help society.  It will citizens. It will help the 
police.  We must always balance that with the rights of the 
individual.  I expect my colleagues will address the issue of 
whether DNA samples ought to be taken at the time of arrest or at 
the time of conviction.  That was the subject of a motion put 
forward by the member for Crowfoot and it received extensive 
debate in this House.  My comments on that are well known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could not have supported that motion but it was still one view 
to balancing what is the best way to bring forward this 
legislation. There are others.  I do not think any member was 
discouraged from making their views known. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We debated this issue extensively and I think as a result 
Canadians are getting a typical piece of Canadian legislation. 
It is one whereby compromise has been made and one whereby we 
hope we have come up with the best legislation.  It is subject to 
review and there were amendments put forward during debate to 
ensure that it came before the House on a more regular basis.  It 
will be reviewed by the House in a few years to determine whether 
we made mistakes, whether changes need to be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge the many witnesses who came before the committee. 
Even though we may in some cases have disagreed with them, every 
member of that committee respects the views presented.  We 
engaged in great debate and dialogue with those individuals and I 
thank them on behalf of my party and on behalf of the House for 
coming forward, for making the trip to Ottawa to give us what 
they felt was important information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have struck a bill. It may not be the best but it is one that 
my party can support.  We have compromised to some extent but I 
think we still have protected the rights of individuals and 
provided the police associations with the necessary tool to fight 
crime.  That is always a difficult balance.  It is one that we 
have all struggled with but I think we have come up with the best 
we could.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>DNA IDENTIFICATION ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK208">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-3, an 
act respecting DNA identification and to make consequential 
amendments to the Criminal Code and other acts, be read the third 
time and passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  We will dispense with the period for 
questions and comments on the speech of the hon. member for 
Sydney—Victoria. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jack Ramsay (Crowfoot, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on Bill C-3 at third reading.  I have some 
concerns about this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party is firmly committed to restoring confidence in 
our justice system and providing Canadians with a truer sense of 
security.  This includes strengthening our law enforcement 
agencies by providing them with the latest technological tools to 
quickly detect and apprehend the perpetrators of the most violent 
crimes committed in our society.  DNA identification is that kind 
of tool. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If used to its full potential, the DNA databank could be the 
single most important development in fighting crime since the 
introduction of fingerprints.  To deny our police the full use of 
this technology in their fight against crime, as Bill C-3 in its 
present form does, is reprehensible and unacceptable because it 
maintains an unnecessary level of risk to the lives and safety of 
our citizens. If passed unamended, Bill C-3, an act respecting 
DNA identification, will provide Canadians with at least a false 
sense of security. Therefore the Reform Party cannot support this 
inadequate piece of legislation. The Reform Party fully supports 
the creation of a DNA databank. However, we do not support the 
limited scope of Bill C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does not grant our police forces full use of the DNA 
technology so readily at their disposal.  It is a tool that would 
help close hundreds of unsolved murders and rapes with an 
enormous potential to save lives by removing predators from the 
streets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 does not allow for the taking of a DNA sample at the 
time of charge.  It does not permit samples to be taken from 
incarcerated criminals other than designated dangerous offenders, 
multiple sex offenders and multiple murderers.  If a multiple 
murderer commits the murders on the same night we cannot take a 
sample from him.  The murders must be committed separately. 
Again, it is unacceptable from that point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3 provides a dangerous and unnecessary exemption.  It 
authorizes judges not to issue warrants for the taking of samples 
if they believe that in doing so the impact on the individual's 
privacy and security would be grossly disproportionate to the 
public interest in the protection of society.  We asked during 
committee hearings for an example of that. I did not hear a 
reasonable or common sense example of what that meant, what that 
part of the bill is really addressing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are hundreds of unsolved assaults, rapes and homicides 
where DNA evidence has been left at the scene by the perpetrator. 
DNA identification now offers an unparalleled opportunity to 
solve many of these cases and bring the perpetrators to justice. 
However, because of the government's irrational fear of violating 
the privacy rights of those responsible for these heinous crimes, 
it is restricting the use of this very important technology by 
our law enforcement people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands now Bill C-3 is a hindrance to more effective law 
enforcement and a safer society by these limitations.  Those 
responsible for shaping our justice system continue to express a 
willingness to place the lives and safety of innocent people in 
jeopardy.  I sometimes wonder if the government does not consider 
the lives of Canadians very cheap.

<A HREF="#LINKT65"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very unconcerned about the lives and safety of people in 
society although it expresses comments contrary to that.  Life is 
pretty cheap when we look at some of the decisions being made as 
a result of legislation passed by this place and the refusal of 
the government to move where it is obvious that it could move and 
where there is no obstruction except its irrational fear of what 
the Supreme Court of Canada might do with regard to the charter 
of rights and freedoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those responsible for shaping our justice system continue to 
express a willingness to place the lives and safety of innocent 
people in jeopardy whether by paroling violent offenders who go 
on to rape and murder again or by freeing convicted violent 
offenders through conditional sentencing or by tying the hands of 
our police officers through Bill C-3.  The safety of society 
seems to be a secondary issue to this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During report stage of this bill I introduced an amendment which 
would allow for the taking of samples at the time of charge from 
offenders with one previous conviction and retained for analysis 
upon conviction.  Our original amendment introduced during clause 
by clause review was to allow for the taking of samples from all 
persons charged with primary designated offences.  Since this 
amendment was defeated, we put forward an amended version at 
report stage taking into consideration the concerns raised by the 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government cited finances as one reason why it would not 
expand the DNA bank and allow for samples to be taken and 
analysed at the time of charge rather than conviction.  I 
specifically addressed the issue of cost, proposing that samples 
be taken upon charge but not analysed until conviction.  This 
would satisfy the Canadian Police Association's concerns 
regarding offenders who are released on bail pending trial 
skipping out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If offenders are guilty of a previous offence for which they 
have not been charged, they may not appear for their trial if 
they realize that upon conviction their DNA sample may be 
compared to DNA evidence left at the scene of unsolved crimes. 
This amendment was recommended by the Canadian Police 
Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other reason supplied by the justice minister for refusing 
to allow samples to be taken at the time of charge was that it 
would not withstand a constitutional challenge.  To date, a 
number of this government's bills have resulted in court 
challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario and the two territories 
are awaiting the Alberta Court of Appeal's decision on the 
constitutionality of Bill C-68, the firearms legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rape shield law, brought in by the former justice minister, 
has been deemed unconstitutional.  Conditional sentencing, also 
courtesy of the former justice minister, has been the subject of 
controversy in the courts.  In January a three judge panel from 
the Alberta Court of Appeal issued a ripping indictment of what 
it termed unimaginative and skimpy attempts to apply the new law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 50 page ruling the appeal justices detailed several major 
complaints they have on the way judges and lawyers have been 
applying the reform.  The Alberta court blasted judges for 
handing out poorly reasoned and lenient conditional sentences 
that amount to little more than house arrest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After Bill C-3 was reported out of committee and ready for 
report stage, the justice minister circulated to members of the 
standing committee three legal opinions on the constitutionality 
of taking DNA samples at the time of charge.  The legal opinions 
were expressed by the hon. Claude Bisson, the hon. Martin Taylor 
and the hon. Charles Dubin.  They all stated that the taking of 
DNA samples at the time of charge would be unconstitutional. The 
minister failed to provide any dissenting opinions such as that 
prepared by Tim Danson for the Canadian Police Association. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have examined the three opinions hurriedly provided to 
indicate that the taking of DNA samples at the time of charge 
would be unconstitutional.  They seem shallow and unconvincing 
perhaps because of their hurried nature.  The opinion prepared by 
Tim Danson for the Canadian Police Association was presented 
before the committee and we had an opportunity to examine it. 
We have not had an opportunity to examine the three legal 
opinions by the authorities that I quoted.  The committee has not 
had an opportunity to call witnesses or to ask witnesses who 
appeared before the committee questions about the three legal 
opinions.

<A HREF="#LINKT66"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to just touch on why I have a grave concern in this area 
and to quote from legal opinions.  The honourable Claude Bisson 
does not deal with the authority of police to obtain a blood 
sample from a person suspected of impaired driving from alcohol 
or drugs.  That authority is contained within the Criminal Code 
now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would he not deal with that?  If there is authority to take 
a blood sample now for impaired driving, why is there concern 
about taking a blood sample or a hair sample or a swab from the 
mouth?  Why, if the authority is there now and it is 
constitutional, would an amendment allowing for a blood sample to 
be taken at the time of charge for a primary designated offence 
for the purpose of DNA sampling be unconstitutional in the bill? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why the honourable Claude Bisson did not 
address this issue in his legal opinion.  Also, the legal opinion 
prepared by the honourable Charles L. Dubin makes the same 
omission.  It does not deal with the authority of police to take 
blood samples when individuals are suspected of driving while 
impaired by alcohol or drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That issue is covered to a certain degree by the honourable 
Martin R. Taylor in his legal opinion.  Yet it is difficult for 
me to understand the reasoning in this document, why it is 
constitutional to take a blood sample today under certain 
circumstances but unconstitutional to take a blood sample from 
someone not suspected of a crime but charged with a crime, of 
committing a primary designated offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say with consideration and respect that these three legal 
opinions appear to be hurried and not well thought through.  I 
want to quote one of them.  This is the legal opinion submitted 
by the honourable Martin R. Taylor, Q.C., who stated on page 4: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly some scepticism is to be expected in Canada today 
regarding the handling of bodily substances by public 
authorities.  When DNA samples pass out of the control of the 
arrested person into that of the State, the uses to which they 
may be put depend not only on the law as it is and may become, 
but also on the competence of those who take control of them and 
their willingness to obey the law.  The uses to which DNA may be 
put in providing personal information regarding the individual, 
while known to go well beyond the field of criminal 
identification, are at present only partly and imperfectly 
understood.  Such factors as these will, in my opinion, be found 
by the courts to render the taking of DNA samples against the 
will of the individual particularly significant in terms of both 
denial of reasonable expectation of privacy and invasion of 
security of the person. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems it is all right to take a blood sample in the case of a 
suspected impaired driver but when we start to talk about DNA it 
is altogether different. 
The word DNA seems to create a degree of apprehension, a degree 
of perhaps even fear.  The consequences of not properly guarding 
and protecting a DNA sample, whether we call it a blood sample 
taken for the purposes of determining if a person is impaired by 
alcohol or drugs, or whether it is a sample to compare with a DNA 
sample left at the scene of a crime, does not really matter.  The 
invasion of privacy has taken place.  We already have that in the 
criminal code.  It is already there.  What is the difference?

<A HREF="#LINKT67"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the security of the person there is no 
justification to deny on the grounds of privacy because the 
authority is already there, as I have said, to take a blood 
sample in the case of impaired driving.  That authority is there 
and overrules the privacy of the individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the other reason the honourable Martin R. Taylor 
pointed out, the invasion of the security of the person.  Privacy 
and security.  The point I am making and I am coming to is that 
thousands and thousands of blood samples are taken every day by 
doctors.  There are blood banks in clinics.  Every time we go for 
an annual check-up and a blood sample is taken it goes into a 
bank.  Every time a child is born a blood sample is taken from 
that child for obvious reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those samples are there for at least a period time.  I do not 
know how long banks hold them.  If there was a realistic concern 
as expressed in this legal opinion that the privacy of the 
individual were at stake and that somehow these samples would be 
used improperly, why is that not happening?  Why is there no 
evidence of that happening? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely the bank, the taking of samples and the databank designed 
through Bill C-3 provide the greatest protection of the gathering 
of blood samples and other samples anywhere in the country today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people are telling us different through their legal 
opinions.  They are trying to convince us that somehow there is 
lurking in the wings a successful charter challenge against doing 
what is being done all over the land based upon the fact that 
someone may use these samples incorrectly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no evidence that has ever been done.  There is no 
criminal offence as there is in the legislation for the improper 
use of DNA samples.  There is no offence legislated for anyone 
misusing the blood sample that I give during my annual check-up 
or those of anyone or the samples taken from human beings at the 
time of birth.  There is no evidence of this and this is not 
addressed in the legal opinions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is very important.  With the greatest respect, the 
government has obtained legal opinions that suit its purposes and 
has brought them forward to attempt to negate the clear legal 
opinion by Mr. Danson who prepared and submitted a legal opinion 
for the committee by the Canadian Police Association, clearly 
indicating that there is no constitutional concern about taking 
samples at the time of charge.

word “That” and substituting the following therefor: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Bill C-3, An Act respecting DNA identification and to make 
consequential amendments to the Criminal Code and others Acts, be 
not now read a third time but be referred back to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and Human Rights for the purpose of 
reconsidering Clause 17, in order to ensure that the taking of 
DNA samples at the time of charge be subject to review”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Debate is on the amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to participate in the debate on Bill C-3. 
This bill was considered at length in committee, and I must 
commend the work done by all members of the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While opinions differed, I would say even very significantly at 
times, discussions were always courteous.  The bill was examined 
responsibly and with professionalism and I thank the members of 
the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I would also like to thank all 
the witnesses who presented their views to the committee.  Their 
opinions were attentively listened to, unfortunately not always 
so attentively by the government members, but I will come back 
to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-3, which concerns DNA identification, is the focus of a 
number of societal debates in Canada.  Science has made such 
progress, especially in the field of genetics, that debates such 
as the one on Bill C-3 are giving rise to great moral, 
philosophical, ethical and, consequently, political questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To the great distress of many, I am sure, I will leave aside 
philosophical and moral considerations and limit myself to 
practical aspects and to the actual application of the 
provisions of C-3. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before going into greater depth in this area, I must, as a 
parliamentarian, lament the narrow-mindedness of the government 
in this matter.  The legislative process followed by Bill C-3 is 
comparable to the Liberal reign.  The scope is narrow, there is 
little movement and there is no interest in hearing not only the 
members of this House, but the many witnesses who came to 
express their various opinions before the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government, unfortunately, was trying to score 
political points with issues as important as Bill C-3. 
It is important to speak out against the Liberals' attitude, 
because the public will most certainly end up having to live 
with the consequences of this government's narrow-mindedness, its 
rigidity throughout the entire process of the debate on Bill C-3.

<A HREF="#LINKT69"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but admit that I am somewhat disappointed, because 
Bill C-3 is an innovative bill that will lay the groundwork for 
the use of DNA for a number of years to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must be aware that the technology of today will be obsolete 
in 5, 10 or 15 years, and the guidelines set out in this bill 
will be those followed when new technological advances come 
along.  This is, therefore, a very important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitor general's original initiative to create a DNA data 
bank on the most dangerous criminals in our society is a highly 
laudable one.  I should point out here that the Bloc Quebecois 
is in favour of this bill and will support it regardless, once 
this debate is concluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The partisan attitude of the Liberals, however, has blocked 
certain constructive amendments which, in my opinion, were 
essential to application of this legislative measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were 14 motions at the report stage, in order to clarify, 
modify or tighten up Bill C-3.  I myself proposed eight of them 
on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois.  The purpose of most of these 
was to ensure greater transparency in implementing the act, and 
particularly to protect the highly confidential information the 
data bank will contain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my New Democratic colleague mentioned earlier, this entire 
bill will be decided by the balance between the rights of 
individuals and the need to protect society.  The whole debate 
can be summarized by this dichotomy of individual rights versus 
protection of society.  Most of the discussions we have had in 
this House or in committee centred on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine for an instant the scope of information contained 
in the genetic index.  DNA profiles infallibly identify an 
individual from a hair, saliva or blood.  However, they identify 
not only the individual, but the individual's family as well.  A 
brother, a sister, a son, a daughter, a father or a mother may 
also be identified, to a lesser degree but be identified 
nonetheless, from the individual's DNA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the discussion of the rights of individuals includes the 
individual in question and his or her immediate family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Inappropriate use of information taken from the DNA could ruin 
or destroy an individual and his or her family, hence the 
extreme caution that we as parliamentarians and legislators must 
exercise in debating and passing this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I proposed an amendment to limit the use made of genetic 
information gathered.  The Liberal government autocratically 
refused to support the motion, unfortunately, probably because 
it came from a member of the opposition and a member of the Bloc 
moreover.  I think that is a shame. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the same vein, I proposed amendments to force the government 
to report on the application of the law. 
Once again, unfortunately, the government, for whom running the 
nation is a secret business, showed its contempt and refused to 
support us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It refused, for instance, to allow the privacy commissioner to 
report every three years on the use to which the data in the 
bank were put.  What are they afraid of?  We were asking that a 
agency independent of government be allowed to examine the use 
to which these data were put, so that this bill would respect 
the private lives of individuals, of Canadians and Quebeckers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I ask “What is the government afraid of?  The 
privacy commissioner?”  I find this most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on for hours—and I know members would like me to, but 
I must disappoint them—about particular situations that we have 
tried to correct, but that the government refuses to tackle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Knowing as we do the ideological narrowness of the Liberal Party 
and the tight leash on which the Prime Minister keeps his 
members, I was prepared to drop several, if not all, of the 
amendments I was sponsoring out of concern for integrity and 
public interest and in order to remove from the political arena 
a debate that is essentially apolitical in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A bill such as Bill C-3, which we know is important, should not 
be used to engage in petty politics.  I have always been 
open-minded and as non-partisan as possible, as apolitical as 
possible, but I must point out that this has not been the 
attitude of the Liberal government. 
I must, however, point out the open-mindedness of my colleague 
from the New Democratic Party and my colleague from the 
Conservative Party, with whom there were some good and frank 
discussions, despite our differing points of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I must admit I am disappointed with the government's 
general attitude in the way it handled this matter.  The 
proposals of my opposition colleagues and myself met with 
constant refusals to even consider them. I am convinced that 
those who speak after me will refer to this as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel obliged to point out that the Solicitor General, the 
sponsor of this bill, appeared before the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Human Rights on another matter, while we in this 
august Chamber were debating it.  This was evidence of his 
disdain—the word may be a bit too strong—the lack of importance, 
at the very least, that he attaches to a chamber of 
representatives duly elected by the people.  Once again, I must 
repeat how disappointed I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am greatly disappointed because he was not there when the bill 
was being debated to hear what we had to say and let us hear 
what he had to say.  While he was presenting another more or 
less important initiative in committee, we of the opposition 
parties could not be there.  We had to choose, because no one 
can be in two places at the same time.  We opted for the debate 
in this House, while unfortunately the Solicitor General did 
not, and I feel he too ought to have been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of the 14 motions debated in the House, it is important to 
mention that only three were supported by a majority of members, 
and therefore received government approval. Not surprisingly, 
the amendments recommended in Motions Nos. 9 and 14, in Group 
No. 5, were passed, having been moved by the bill's sponsor 
himself, the solicitor general.  The solicitor general 
introduced certain amendments and, wonder of wonders, his 
Liberal sheep followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very surprised, however, that Motion No. 13, which I 
myself moved, was agreed to.  Admittedly, it would have been 
ill-advised for the government to refuse to remove data with 
respect to individuals who are acquitted.  The opposition, the 
Bloc Quebecois anyway, was prepared for another no from the 
government. Statistically speaking, I presume that it is the 
exception that makes the rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the government could have done better and left aside 
the shocking partisan politics it has engaged in throughout 
study of this bill.  That having been said, the Bloc Quebecois 
is open-minded, and we will support Bill C-3, even though we have 
certain reservations about its application. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, we sincerely hope that the creation of this data 
bank gives police forces throughout the country all the tools 
they need to solve the unfortunately very large number of crimes 
being committed in our communities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  It is my duty pursuant to Standing 
Order 38 to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows:  the hon. 
member for Verchères, Varennes Tokamak project; the hon. member 
for Waterloo—Wellington, the Environment; the hon. member for 
Frontenac—Mégantic, BC Mine in Black Lake. 
<P><A NAME="LINK212"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I must say it is an honour for me to rise in the 
House and participate in this very important debate on Bill C-3. 
It touches on an issue that I know the mover of the motion, the 
member for Crowfoot, holds very dear to his heart as a former law 
enforcement agent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that other members of the committee, as mentioned by 
previous speakers, took an active part in the committee debate 
where we had a number of witnesses. It was certainly an exhibit 
of parliament at its best at the committee level where we had 
such a diverse discussion. There were a number of divergent 
opinions as was referred to by the previous speaker, the member 
from the Bloc.  It was very important that the process did not 
grind to a halt.  We had members moving amendments that 
unfortunately were not accepted by the government but the process 
itself did not bog down.  We are now at a stage where this bill 
is on the verge of becoming law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad and unfortunate situation that members often find 
themselves in is that they support the bill in principle and 
almost without exception, in its entirety but there are problems 
with it.  There is a flaw, a fly in the ointment so to speak. 
That fly is a significant one.  There is a significant 
opportunity with the passage of this bill to put into the hands 
of the law enforcement community the ability to fight crime in a 
very substantive way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To use the minister's own terminology about prevention in the 
area of crime, this bill if it was amended in the way that the 
some members on the committee had suggested, would allow for the 
use of DNA at the time of charge.  When I say at the time of 
charge, that in and of itself sets a certain standard, that 
standard being that reasonable and probable grounds had to exist 
for a person to be taken into custody and enough evidence had to 
exist to lay a criminal charge.  If the DNA could be taken at 
that point in time, it could be used in a very important way to 
match the DNA crime scene bank that would have evidence from 
other crimes that had remained unsolved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a golden opportunity.  We talk about the use of 
technology and the speed at which technology is moving.  This DNA 
data bank is not being used to its full potential in the manner 
in which this legislation has been drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset, I want to say that I do support the motion tabled 
by the hon. member for Crowfoot, the motion being in essence that 
the bill be returned to the justice committee for further debate. 
This arises from a situation where the government in its wisdom 
decided to seek legal opinions after the fact.  That is, there 
was a legal opinion rendered by the Canadian Police Association. 
They sought the opinion of an eminent criminal lawyer, Mr. 
Danson, who after considering the situation and looking at the 
practicalities of the use of DNA offered the opinion to the 
committee that in fact if DNA was taken at the time of charge 
this would withstand a constitutional challenge. The timing I 
have to submit is very suspect here.  The government chose after 
the committee had completed its deliberations to then seek the 
legal opinion of three very learned retired jurists who gave a 
contrary opinion.

<A HREF="#LINKT72"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not question for a minute the intent or the fact that the 
contrary opinion came back from these jurists.  In fact it would 
surprise me if it happened any other way.  We all know there are 
dissenting opinions constantly.  Constantly there are juxtaposed 
positions taken by those involved in the criminal justice system. 
That is part of the process.  That is part of the healthy debate 
and the adversarial nature of the practice of law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But here we have again an opportunity to use this legislation to 
the full degree of the law.  To be held back in essence is what 
is going on, to be held back by fear.  I would not call it an 
irrational fear.  I would not go so far as to say that this is 
not founded in common sense.  But I do suggest that we cannot in 
this chamber and we cannot as members of the elected body be held 
back or be in constant fear that if we pass a piece of 
legislation here that it may in some court in some part of this 
great land be struck down by one judge or a panel of judges who 
feel that it is perhaps beyond the bounds of the Constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gary Lunn:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
With apologies to the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, this is a matter with respect to 
quorum at the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans which is 
being held right now.  The chair of the committee has

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (Charlotte, PC)</B> moved that Bill C-302, 
an act to to establish the rights of fishers including the right 
to be involved in the process of fisheries stock assessment, fish

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I will be splitting my time with my 
colleague from Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe if members look carefully and examine what has 
happened since the election last year, this is the first major 
fisheries bill to be introduced in the House.  I am very pleased 
that it is mine and coming from the opposition side of this 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This sends out a certain signal to the fisheries community.  I 
do not think the government has been listening carefully to what 
is happening in the fishing community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has been abused by other countries in terms of offshore 
fishing.  Successive governments have never really stood up for 
our fishermen and outlined the rights of fishermen.  That is what 
this bill is intended to do. It is the fishers bill of rights.  I 
know the word fishers is more politically correct today but I am 
from the old school.  I still use the term fishermen.  I hope my 
colleague from Quebec forgives me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am attempting to do with this bill is give fishermen the 
right to be consulted.  Examine what has happened on the east and 
west coasts and with Great Lakes fishing.  We are also talking 
about Lake Winnipeg. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fisheries from coast to coast are in desperate straits.  What 
they need is some protection.  What we have to do is consult with 
the fishermen. I am convinced that had we consulted with 
fishermen from day one we would not be in the state we are in 
today where on both coasts of this country we are into a 
situation of vanishing stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have allowed foreign overfishing for years. As a result we 
have a fishery in Atlantic Canada that is almost broke.  Cod have 
virtually disappeared.  Groundfish in some areas have virtually 
disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not standing up to blame the present government because 
that would be wrong.  I am not standing up blaming the government 
I was part of from 1988 to 1993 because that would be wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been a succession of governments, regardless of political 
stripe, making errors along the way but never really standing up 
for fishermen.  Now we have a fisheries on the east coast that is 
virtually in collapse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other part of this bill I think fishermen will take a 
keen interest in and support is that when support programs 
for fishermen are being negotiated they have to be at the table. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether they are talking about support programs to move them 
from fisheries into something else or to buy back their licences, 
they have to be consulted from day one.  That has never happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where was the consultation from the very beginning in terms of 
the TAGS program?  It was a program basically invented in Ottawa. 
Again, I am not blaming any government.  It was invented by 
bureaucrats and administered by bureaucrats. From the very 
beginning there was no consultation with fishermen.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other problem I see where it would have made a big 
difference is on the conservation side if fishermen had been 
consulted.  There is no secret that in the early days of 
international overfishing our fishermen knew what was happening. 
They saw huge quotas granted to outsiders, outside countries 
coming into Canada and fishing our stocks.  The result was well 
known by fishermen at that time as to what would happen.  It is 
like the old story about Canadians.  We are much too polite to 
tell it like it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember the story of a Canadian in New York.  When a New 
Yorker stepped on his toe the Canadian looked at the New Yorker 
and said “excuse me”.  The New Yorker said “you must be 
Canadian”.  He asked why.  “Because you are the only people in 
the world who apologize if someone steps on your toe”.  Is that 
not what we have done internationally? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can remember when Premier Tobin stood up internationally for 
fishermen.  I was the first one to applaud him.  The former 
fisheries minister, Mr. Crosbie, was very congratulatory as well. 
We had a politician who for the first time in recent Canadian 
history stood up and told it the way it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might debate whether the outcome of that was successful.  At 
least the international community heard us.  All politics aside, 
it is something we should have done years ago.  What the 
fisheries minister was doing at the time was listening to those 
people he represented regardless of political stripe.  That is 
what we have to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Testimony was heard by the fisheries committee of what some of 
our fishermen go through in terms of income and cost of getting 
on the water or attempting to catch fish that are not there. Some 
of this is absolutely outrageous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Fortin on November 27 gave his testimony to the fisheries 
committee.  I use his testimony to show just how ridiculous the 
situation is.  This year he caught $40,000 worth of fish, gross. 
His earnings were $16,000, of which he paid $5,500 in fishing 
expenses, $5,400 in fuel, oil and other things, $5,525 in repairs 
because they were out of luck, $4,775 for electronic equipment, 
$1,500 in groceries because they live on the water for days. He 
paid $4,000 in car insurance because he has a family to support 
at home. He paid $1,400 for the CSST and $2,400 for other 
expenses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there was interest on the loan he had to take out from the 
credit union and taxes.  That is 25% of the boat payment. He has 
a deficit of $30,000 and $10,000 in expenses, and they still want 
to take his TAGS benefit back.  He said he cannot accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who in this House could accept that?  I think it goes right back 
to the bill I brought into the House.  Again I stress it is the 
first major fisheries bill to hit the House since the election of 
last year. There is a deficit on that side of the House in terms 
of what it could do today to pay attention to fishermen, the 
people the government is supposedly representing back home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just a small example of what has happened over the 
years.  What we have to do in the House is say fishermen have 
certain rights that cannot be taken away by governments. 
When rights are taken away to fish and to make a living, they are 
to make sure there is adequate compensation.  When the 
compensation package is decided upon fishermen will be at the 
table.  They will be there helping us make the decisions.  It 
will not be left to bureaucrats in their ivory towers in Halifax 
or in Ottawa. It will be in consultation with fishermen.

<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerald Keddy (South Shore, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, it 
gives me great pleasure to rise today to speak in the House to 
the motion of the hon. member for Charlotte on a fishers' bill of 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The state of the fishery in the country is far too often 
overlooked, specifically in Nova Scotia and certainly in the 
South Shore riding which I am honoured to represent and in my 
neighbouring riding of West Nova which is very aptly represented 
in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk to the people in the fishery.  We know the people in the 
fishery.  I am not a fisherman.  I do not contend to be a 
fisherman but I certainly have many constituents who are 
fishermen.  The South Shore riding is the largest single fishery 
riding in Canada with 800 and some registered fishing boats in 
Shelburne county alone.  Queens county has another 200 and some 
and Lunenburg county has 180.  It is a tremendous resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That resource is no longer there.  That resource has declined. 
As the member for Charlotte mentioned, it declined over the years 
because of bureaucratic intervention, because of government 
intervention.  He did not want to point the finger at anyone.  I 
do not think I am willing to do that either. Certainly all 
governments of all parties have made major mistakes in the 
fishery and I think to this very day they continue to make them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One difficulty I have with something called a fishers' bill of 
rights and the public right to fish is that I am not sure we any 
longer have a public right to fish.  We cannot simply buy a 
fishing licence today and go fishing.  There is no fish to catch. 
There are ITQs.  There are community quota groups.  There are all 
kinds of restrictions against fishing.  The public right to fish 
is something I am very much afraid we may have lost a long time 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even in new fisheries I have a number of cases—and I am sure 
members opposite have a number of cases—where people in an 
experimental fishery were not even granted the first licence to 
be given out in that fishery, whether it was an experimental 
shrimp fishery in St. Margaret's Bay or a clam fishery in the 
midshore, the endshore or the offshore.  The people who developed 
those fisheries, the people who did the experimental work, very 
often were overlooked when it came to licences in direct 
contravention and contradiction of the Fisheries Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Charlotte mentioned TAGS.  I would like to 
talk for a moment about the failure of TAGS to address the 
problem.  To begin with TAGS was designed for ice plugged ports 
in Newfoundland.  As an afterthought it was thought that it could 
apply to diminishing groundfish stocks in Nova Scotia.  They 
brought TAGS in combined with a licence buyout that did not take 
enough out of the fishery.  The TAGS program only covered the 
first $26,000 of gross landings by any fishing boat.  After that 
they had to buy it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us figure out what it takes to accumulate the first $26,000 
gross of a fishing year.  They pay for their steamboat licences. 
They pay for their crews.  They pay for their provisions.  They 
pay for their diesel.  They pay for their onboard catch 
monitoring.  They pay for any ITQ transferring they do. 
They have not made any money and they are over the $26,000 gross.

<A HREF="#LINKT78"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The people who tried to work were penalized.  The people who 
benefited from TAGS were the people who decided to sit back and 
improve their golf game or to go trouting.  For the fishermen who 
tried to continue to work and to feed their families it was a 
dismal failure.  That is the best thing that can be said about 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We move on to the situation these people are still in with 
diminishing fish stocks.  The south shore of Nova Scotia and 
parts of southwest Nova are extremely lucky.  We have a few fish 
left. We are a long way from having a successful fishery.  There 
was quota by every community group in Nova Scotia left in the 
water last year, quota they were unable to catch or quota that 
was not there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are encouraging the shacking of small fish.  Shacking is a 
term fishermen use for throwing fish overboard.  If they have a 
quota and they are only allowed 4,000 pounds of haddock what are 
they to do with the small ones?  They cannot afford to bring them 
ashore as little haddock are worth 40 cents per pounded compared 
to big haddock which are worth $1 a pound. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very dismal situation these people find themselves in. 
They are environmentalists and conservationists and they 
understand.  They also have families, mortgages and car payments 
and have to attempt to make a living.  The fishermen of Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick, P.E.I., Newfoundland and Quebec are in 
dire straits as a result of TAGS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at the effort out there on the ocean by dragger 
fleets, seiners and foreign fleets.  They have caught our bait. 
They have caught our food fish, our cod, our haddock and our 
halibut.  It goes on and on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This year Atlantic salmon stocks are expected to be at an all 
time record low of returning winter salmon to the rivers of 
southwest Nova.  These rivers are under stress.  We know acid 
rain has stressed the ability of the spawn to survive in the 
rivers.  This is not rocket science.  We understand that 
pollution is a factor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at an all time low and we have the most stringent 
conservation methods we have ever had.  No longer are estuary 
fisheries allowed at the mouth of rivers.  Mature salmon can no 
longer be kept.  Fishermen are encouraged to keep only grilse and 
only male grilse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aboriginal fishery takes male grilse out of the fish way for 
its allotment. This is not a threat to the salmon going upriver 
to spawn and reproduce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is a threat has been the fact that the federal government 
has allowed a foreign fishery in St. Pierre and Miquelon to buy 
the gear of the Newfoundland fishermen who sold their salmon gear 
to St. Pierre and Miquelon fishermen and set that gear in a 10 
mile swath 200 miles long out to the edge of the shelf.  No one 
in the House or on the fisheries committee or in the department 
will convince me that this has not affected returning fish to 
Nova Scotia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time we had a moratorium on commercial salmon 
fishing, which is indicative of the state of the fishery.  The 
real money in the fishery is made from haddock, cod and flounder. 
The sport fishery is important but the real money and the real 
livelihoods of the majority of the people are in the ground and 
lobster fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have more pressure now.  We have complete devastation in the 
fishery.  Now in the lobster fishery there are more lobster 
licences and more effort in the lobster fishery than there has 
been in the past 50 years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point is that the lobster fishery needs a much more serious, 
increased effort.  It is the sole provider of many families in 
Nova Scotia, South Shore and southwest Nova.  That fishery is 
under serious pressure.  I suspect it is under serious pressure 
in P.E.I, Newfoundland and parts of Quebec.  We have to be very 
careful how we treat that fishery if it is to survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my closing remarks I would just like to say a bit about the 
inability of the government to come forth with a proper buyout 
program for active licences.  The licences on the banks about 
which there is some discussion about buying, the licences that 
have not been used for five, ten, fifteen or twenty years, are 
not catching fish.  We do not have to worry about those licences. 
We should buy the active licences and put a restriction on 
bringing an inactive licence back into the fishery.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I certainly 
welcome the opportunity to speak to Bill C-302. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that is before the House is very laudable in terms of 
its intentions but is seriously flawed in terms of its approach. 
I can even agree with the intent of the member opposite in terms 
of what he is trying to do through a fisheries bill of rights.  I 
say laudable in its intention because the hon. member is as 
obviously motivated by a concern for Canadian fishermen and 
Canadian fishing communities as we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to say that this afternoon when we were dealing with 
a very important bill, the United Nations fishery agreement, his 
colleagues walked out of the committee.  Two very important 
witnesses were before us.  We were trying to deal with the issue 
of straddling stocks and getting a United Nations fishery 
agreement through in legislation so that Canada can be one of the 
initial 30 to ratify the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am disappointed and concerned about the opposition members 
walking out.  They should not be playing political games with an 
issue that is so important to fishermen by walking out of the 
committee when we had two very important witnesses before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me deal with the bill.  It is seriously flawed in its 
approach which would not help Canada's fishing communities deal 
with the realities they face.  In all seriousness it could well 
undermine Canada's conservation efforts and damage the fisheries. 
I know that is not the member's intent.  I am sure he intended 
otherwise, but that is the reality of what could happen with the 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Several issues need to be addressed, in fact too many for me to 
cover in 10 minutes.  However, let us start with the wording of 
the bill which suggests that these communities would be better 
served or somehow protected from hardship if fishermen had 
certain legislated rights: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the right to be involved in the process of fisheries stock 
assessment, fish conservation, setting of fishing quotas, fishing 
licensing and the public right to fish and establish the right of 
fishers to be informed of decisions affecting fishing as a 
livelihood in advance and the right to compensation if other 
rights are abrogated unfairly. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot know exactly what is in his mind but perhaps the hon. 
member thinks fishermen need protection from us or from 
supposedly arbitrary decisions by distant officials in 
governments that affect their lives profoundly but over which 
they feel they have no control. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1730"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can all sympathize with anyone who feels this way, especially 
when they face hardship as a result of certain decisions being 
made by governments and fisheries managers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans has been holding 
very extensive hearings across Canada since last September.  I 
believe in November we held hearings in Newfoundland and eastern 
Canada.  We have held hearings on the west coast.  We have held 
hearings in the eastern Arctic.  We have held hearings in the 
Great Lakes region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the committee will be coming down with very strong 
recommendations related to all those points that the member is 
talking about which concern the rights of fishermen.  I think we 
will find when the committee reports that there will be sound 
recommendations with respect to finding ways to ensure that 
fishermen are consulted, that their rights are protected, that 
fisheries conservation remains a priority, that fishermen are 
involved in the discussions and consultations on fishing quotas 
and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What fishermen need and want is the chance to make a good living 
on the sea, not just for today and tomorrow but for the next 
decade and the one after that.  That is what this government is 
trying to do with its various efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fishermen not only want that for themselves, they want it for 
their children and their grandchildren.  That is what they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Depending at the moment on where they live and what they fish, 
they may face reduced quotas and closed seasons.  We recognize 
that.  Or they may, on the other hand, depending on where they 
live and what they fish, already be seeing the benefits of the 
government's efforts over the last few years to restructure the 
fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last member who spoke mentioned the lobster fishery. 
Although we had to take some strong measures this year to ensure 
that lobsters are there for the future, the lobster fishery is 
indeed quite healthy.  We have to ensure that the egg production 
is there for the future, but it has been the mainstay in terms of 
the fishery in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada, even with the groundfish turndown, which we 
have learned some lessons from, the economic returns as a result 
of the expanding shell fishery and lobster fishery have been 
increasing dramatically and providing good incomes for those 
fishermen and those communities.  We are already seeing some 
benefits from some of the actions the government has taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we like it or not, no legislation is really going to 
change the reality.  The reality is that we cannot exploit the 
sea and its resources as generations before us have done.  It is 
a very complex industry which today's government has to manage 
very carefully, with the best scientific evidence available, for 
the benefit of everyone:  for the fishermen, for the communities, 
for the industries that utilize those fish stocks which are 
caught, and for the industries that provide the equipment and the 
technology to the fishing industry.  These industries are not 
only on the three coasts, they are in central Canada as well, in 
terms of the economic spinoffs from the fishing industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this day and age, with the kind of technology and equipment 
that is available, in many cases decisions must be made quickly. 
This bill, although I know it is not its intent, would in fact 
institute a review process that would be extremely cumbersome and 
time consuming.  The implementation of necessary and quick 
decisions could be delayed until all appeals had been exhausted. 
The most important element concerning fisheries management in the 
future, although it is not the intent of the bill, is that it 
could be brought to a complete standstill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that is not the desire of the member opposite, nor is it 
his intent, but that is the reality of where Bill C-302 could 
lead us.  It could drive fisheries management to a standstill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will tell the House of the five principles that guide the 
government.  First, the fishery must be environmentally 
sustainable.  Second, it must be economically viable.  Third, it 
must balance harvest capacity with the available resource. 
Fourth, participants must have a greater role in the making of 
decisions, and we are really working on that.  Fifth, our fishing 
industry must be internationally competitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is moving forward on those principles. 
Conservation is a key priority.  I am sure that in its hearings 
process the Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans will 
continue to push us on those principles and foster us with even 
greater ideas down the road. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am sorry to say this bill will not help us in 
achieving the principles this government wants to move forward 
on. 
<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it was with no pleasure that I left the fisheries 
committee this afternoon.  The witnesses who appeared before the 
committee this afternoon were there at my request.  When the 
government ganged up on the opposition to ensure that the 
committee could not insist Premier Tobin appear before it on a 
very important matter, we had to express our displeasure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to speak at second reading to Bill C-302.  The bill 
put forward by the member for Charlotte contains three main 
elements.  The three elements are:  protecting the public right 
to fish, involving Canadians who fish for a living in the 
consultative and decision making process, and establishing that 
compensation is due when fishing rights are abrogated by 
decisions not involving the affected parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I strongly support the public right to fish, which has existed 
in common law since the Magna Carta in 1215.  It should be common 
sense that if such a right has existed for so long there 
should be no need to implement legislation to preserve this 
right.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  This government 
would prefer to obliterate this right because it is totally 
compromised by its inability to provide statutory authority to 
its divisive aboriginal fisheries strategy pilot sales program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the government introduced a new fisheries 
act that would have given the minister the ability to grant a 
private right to fish for commercial or sports purposes to any 
group currently in political favour.  It is fortunate that Bill 
C-62 died in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reality does not always reflect common sense.  We like to think 
rights do not need to be spelled out because everybody knows we 
have them.  We think the rights apply to all, but in fact they 
only apply to this Liberal government because it is playing the 
power game.  We can see from our many statutes that the power 
groups only sometimes agree to give rights to other groups.  That 
is why these groups fight for and obtain things like the public 
right of access to fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what happened.  The king assumed he had the right to do 
whatever he wanted with the fishery.  The public got together, 
created the Magna Carta and told the king otherwise.  That is why 
the public right to fish is a written right.  It is a hard won 
right and it must be carefully guarded or this power group will 
take it away when we are not looking.

<A HREF="#LINKT82"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishery is a public resource and the responsibility of the 
minister is for conservation, management and protection. The 
minister does not have the right to decide who gets the fish. 
However, in the management of the fishery there will have to be 
decisions made about who gets licences and when the different 
fisheries should be opened and closed.  In making these 
management decisions fishermen should be consulted and permitted 
to contribute to the decision making process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because resources such as fish are limited, we the public have 
to decide who can access them or who has the right to catch fish. 
That is why we have limited entry licensing and designated core 
fishermen.  But we have delegated the responsibility for making 
licensing and opening decisions to the government.  After all, we 
think that is what government is for.  Unfortunately, the 
government has a political and power based agenda that influences 
its decision making.  We saw this most clearly, as I stated, with 
the racially divisive AFS introduced in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we want to delegate this kind of decision making to one 
person alone, to one person who may be influenced by specific 
interest groups who do not see the big picture?  I do not think 
so.  Bill C-302 tries to prevent this situation from arising.  I 
agree with its broad intent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble presumes that Canadians who fish for a living are 
the most knowledgeable about the fishery.  Although those who 
fish are certainly in this group, there are others such as 
scientists, social policy makers, DFO officials and field workers 
who have a great deal to contribute.  In other words, good advice 
can come from a diverse group but must include those involved who 
fish for their livelihood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In clause 4 of the bill fishers are given the right to be heard 
in the process of government decisions respecting fish stock 
assessment, fish conservation, quotas, licensing or the public 
right to fish.  This right should be established and is not 
exclusive of other parties.  The government would be under no 
obligation to vigorously follow the advice of the fishermen, but 
it would certainly move the agenda along from the current 
situation.  Current governments are notorious for pretending to 
involve people in decision making and then doing what they want 
anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clause 5 proposes items on compensation.  What is needed in all 
government activity is transparency.  If people see what the 
government is doing and there is no secret as to why things are 
done the way they are, I believe that people will not feel their 
rights are being trampled on.  They will rarely feel the need to 
continue to fight the results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the provisions are mandatory and if they are carried out, 
then there should be no losses, as contemplated by clause 5. 
There should be stern consequences for any government that tries 
to abrogate the public right to fish.  But as we know from 
experience, monetary consequences such as compensating people for 
the loss of their rights do not protect the right itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been a vocal supporter of the public right to fish, as 
well as an opponent of ministerial discretion in making up rules 
about who gets to fish and who does not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully support the intent of Bill C-302.  However, there are 
some minor changes that I would like to see.  It is important 
that those making a living from the fishery do not have their 
rights abrogated, leading to a loss, without consultation, if 
they have not been involved in the whole process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important in our ongoing battle to keep the government 
from making further inroads into long established principles for 
the benefit of the short-sighted government of the day.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Bonaventure—Gaspé—Îles-de-la-Madeleine—Pabok, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to add my voice to that of the hon. member 
for Charlotte, who sponsored this bill.  It is refreshing to see 
that some people are concerned about the fishers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to remind the House that the Secretary of State for 
Fisheries and Oceans promised last fall, in response to a 
question from the Conservatives, that a fisheries policy would 
be tabled in February of this year. We have not seen it 
yet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also remind the House that the Auditor General of Canada, 
Mr. Desautels, also recommended that Canada develop such a 
policy. 
In its absence, we are currently faced with administrative chaos 
at the hands of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I too have some reservations about this bill, but at least 
someone has managed to manoeuvre through the system and to 
introduce a highly worthwhile bill.  This is very interesting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Introducing legislation that will give fishers a hand in 
assessing stocks is very intelligent.  Allowing fishers to take 
part in preserving fish stocks is very intelligent.  I do, 
however, have misgivings about the setting of quotas and about 
licensing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the administration of public fishing rights, I too would 
like to see fishers protected. 
We have to agree in committee on whether it is to protect 
currently active fishers from any discretionary power the 
minister of fisheries presently enjoys under the law, which he 
tried to consolidate in the former Bill C-62. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those fishers still active are satisfied, but they are always 
afraid the minister will upset the balance they have achieved. 
I think it vital that their rights be protected, but, if the 
public is going to be allowed to fish, the circumstances under 
which others may enter must be defined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I find interesting in the second part of the bill is the 
discussion of establishing the right of fishers to be informed 
in advance of decisions affecting fishing as a livelihood.  I 
imagine the member is referring to native fishing. 
Personally, I think it makes good sense to be informed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I will link this with the second right the bill 
attempts to establish, namely the right to compensation if other 
rights are abrogated unfairly. Let us look at native fishing.  I 
believe in the rule of law, in that, if native people are 
entitled by treaty to certain things, I am not going to take 
them away.  Except that it is not the fault of the non native 
fishers and it is not up to them today to pay for everything. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Canada ever recognizes the rights by treaty, we must be able 
to compensate the non native fishers currently there.  It has to 
be done systematically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of the unfair abrogation of rights, reference 
must be made to moratoriums. 
When the minister of fisheries establishes a moratorium, 
prohibits certain types of fishing, fishers who have always 
earned their living from this sort of fishing lose their rights 
and have their lives changed.  I think that warrants 
compensation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to the famous income support program, the Atlantic 
groundfish strategy, known as TAGS.  We are two months away from 
its expiry, and fishers are still waiting to find out what will 
happen.

If such rights had been established, it would be automatic.  If 
the bill goes to committee, we could suggest a few things for 
members to add. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in committee saw the nasty tricks the government can play, 
how it tries to weasel out of its responsibility.  If this needs 
to be formalized, we have a suggestion for members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The points I would like to develop further concern the 
establishment of quotas, that is, allowing fishers to take part 
in the establishment of quotas, and the awarding of licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not that I am opposed in any way, but going back to the 
spirit of TAGS and my reading of it, which I shared with the 
fisheries minister, the fisheries minister admitted in the House 
last fall that the reason TAGS had not worked, and was a passive 
rather than an active program, was precisely because Ottawa had 
not involved the provinces in the strategy's development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore important for the provinces as well to be 
allowed to help establish quotas and award licences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, a member of NAFO, claims to be a world leader when it 
comes to oceans management. 
Canada supplies NAFO with biological data and it is through 
participation and the sharing of biological information that it 
is possible to work out a conservation policy as well as decide 
on what should be caught and what should be left in the water to 
ensure the sustainability of the resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk only about eastern Canada and leave the western part 
of the country up to the members who represent it.  In the Gulf 
of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean in zones 2GH and 3KL—for 
fishers in the know—why could Canada not operate along NAFO lines 
and work in concert with the provinces, sharing biological 
information in order to ensure that there is a conservation 
plan? The provinces, once they have established the quotas, 
could then issue licences, that is distribute the resources 
within their territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must always bear in mind this rule of thumb: every fisher  at 
sea creates employment for approximately five people on shore. 
The biggest problem, in terms of what we are looking at today, 
is in the provinces' backyards right now. I think some 
connections should be made between the two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The secretary of state listed earlier the five principles that 
guide the department. He mentioned environmentally sustainable 
fisheries, economically viable fisheries and talked about Bill 
C-27, criticizing the opposition for withdrawing its support. 
What he failed to mention however—and I am glad the hon. member 
of the Reform Party picked this up—is that the opposition 
members on the committee wanted to call in as a witness the 
father of former Bill C-29, Brian Tobin. He is the one who 
drafted the legislation to preserve straddling stocks in the 
last Parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government is making sure this legislation does not have 
any teeth. My concern is that we end up with nothing. 
When, across the way, they brag, giving lip service to using to 
preserve the resource, I think they are taking kid gloves, not 
to say a 100-foot pole, to avoid taking their responsibilities in 
this respect, as they did with TAGS.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather shameful that a private member from the opposition 
has to introduce a bill of this nature.  Even to have to discuss 
this bill is incredible.  He basically wants the rights of 
fishermen and plant workers to be at the table when discussions 
or decisions are made on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder how much consultation the government did with 
Bombardier before giving it the largest defence contracts of all 
time.  I bet it consulted big time on that.  But when it comes to 
fisheries matters, there is no consultation at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary indicated the five principles under 
which the Department of Fisheries and Oceans operates.  I would 
like to give the Government of Canada and those people listening 
today the five principles under which I think the DFO operates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fifth one is do not tell anything to anyone in a timely 
manner.  Number four, pit one region against another.  Number 
three, waste valuable tax dollars.  Number two, put policies in 
place without consultation with those closest to the industry. 
The number one principle under which DFO operates is fatten up 
the bureaucracy in Ottawa and keep the minister in the dark. 
That is exactly what is happening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unknown to many Canadians, but DFO has about 800 people 
working for it in Ottawa and I do not see anybody fishing in the 
Rideau Canal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The territory of Nunavut has two million square kilometres. 
Guess how many enforcement officers are up there.  For two 
million square kilometres, there are two.  There are six parking 
lot policemen for the West Block and Confederation building 
parking lots.  It is unbelievable where this government puts its 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans credit because it is due.  He mentioned that 
the all-party Standing Committee on Fisheries and Oceans will 
come up with some serious and strong recommendations and preamble 
language to assist the government in what it should do for the 
future of the fisheries.  I definitely agree with him on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it.  Today in the papers there is talk about a 
crisis with the Atlantic salmon on the east coast.  There is talk 
about a crisis with the salmon on the west coast.  That is quite 
amazing because they are not supposed to join.  The common thread 
is we have a crisis on the west coast, a crisis on the east coast 
and a crisis within our freshwater fishery in Manitoba and 
Ontario. What is the common theme of all these three?  The DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, do you want to know why since the day I was elected 
I have been calling for a public judicial inquiry into the 
practices and policies of this department? This department is 
completely out of control.  It is absolutely out of control.  It 
has no vision.  It has no future.  A good example of that is the 
so-called post-TAGS review. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1992 the government of the day put a moratorium on the cod 
and came up with the adjustment programs, NCARP, AGAP and TAGS. 
To this point $3.4 billion has been spent and there is more 
capacity to catch the fish today than there was when it started 
the moratorium.  It is absolutely incredible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand why the government will not consult with 
fishermen when it comes to the allocation of quota, when it comes 
to the type of gear, when it comes to everything else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Recently in southwest Newfoundland there was an announcement of 
a quota of 20,000 tonnes of cod.  I would certainly hope that the 
government would work with the fishermen of that region on a 
sustainable harvest of that catch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, Atlantic salmon is in deep trouble.  If big nets, 
big draggers or trawlers are used, it is well known what will 
happen.  A lot of bycatch is going to happen and history shows 
that a lot of this bycatch will be thrown overboard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regarding the issue of TAGS, the fishermen and plant workers of 
the east coast have been asking and begging for answers from this 
government.  The minister of human resources indicated to this 
House that there would be a report in place on post-TAGS. What do 
we get?  We get federal officials gallivanting around Atlantic 
Canada presenting their new vision of the post-TAGS program.  It 
is absolutely unbelievable that he would disregard all members of 
this House when it comes to such a viable issue.  Obviously DFO 
does not listen to the fishermen and plant workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The 1983 Lockeport, Nova Scotia experiment with National Sea

Corporation.  With absolutely no consultation with the fishers of 
the north, it sort of picks and chooses who it wants to talk to 
and its policies are set basically on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not understand why this government has such an incestuous 
relationship with those people, for example, on the west coast in 
the Sport Fishing Institute.  We have a classic example of Ms. 
Velma McCall.  She used to work for the Sport Fishing Institute. 
She lobbied very hard for the Sport Fishing Institute to get an 
exclusion zone of commercial trollers around Langara Island. 
What happens a year later?  This woman is now the ministerial 
assistant for the DFO on the west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tom Bird used to work for DFO.  Guess who he works for now? The 
Sport Fishing Institute.  The personal relationship between the 
hon. Minister of Fisheries and Oceans and Mr. Bob Wright of the 
Oak Bay Marine Group is absolutely scandalous.  They pick and 
choose their policies, give them to their friends and under no 
circumstances do they consult with commercial fishermen of any 
kind or those people of the Coastal Community Network on both 
coasts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes on and on. These are the types of people who will assist 
the government and DFO in new policies.  They are Eric Tamma, 
Coastal Community Network from Ucluelet, Ross Helberg, the mayor 
of Port Hardy, Sam Ellsworth of Nova Scotia, Arthur Bull of the 
Bay of Fundy region, and Mark Butler of the Ecology Action Centre 
of Nova Scotia.  These five people are just a small example of 
the experience and the expertise this government needs to listen 
to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I have to say it is absolutely incredible that it takes a 
private member's bill in order to push this forward. I really 
encourage everyone on the Liberal side to take this bill 
seriously because it really is important and it is mandatory to 
involve the people who are closest to the resource to have their 
say in such a viable industry. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I support the bill. I can prove that allowing fishermen the right 
to be involved with consultations is a great thing.  There is 
really a unique situation on the north shore of Nova Scotia in my 
riding where the fishermen for years lobbied the department of 
fisheries to increase the standards on lobster size and the 
department of fisheries refused for years to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fishermen banded together.  They made an agreement among 
themselves to catch and keep lobsters only above and beyond the 
size the federal government allowed as a minimum.  They actually 
threw back lobsters that were legal in the interests of 
conservation.  This is a really good example of fishermen being 
involved with their own industry and in consultation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to believe the government will not allow fishermen to 
be involved with these decisions when they have proven they will 
do a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is about allowing fishermen to have a say, but today 
in the fisheries committee we were not even allowed to have a 
say.  The opposition members moved to have Brian Tobin, the 
premier of the province of Newfoundland, testify because he is an 
expert in this field.  He is a former minister of fisheries and 
he is very well respected.  He became Captain Canada and yet the 
members of the government on the committee voted to refuse to 
have him.  That is like refusing to hear Albert Einstein when 
talking about the theory of relativity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is the expert and it is awful to muzzle this fountain of 
information and source of wisdom and refuse to allow him to 
testify at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-302 is appropriate for fishermen to give them a fishers 
bill of rights, but we should have a bill of rights too to be 
allowed to hear the people we have to hear from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a really good example of the department of fisheries 
trying to muzzle all the information, all the input, all 
consultation from not only fishermen but from premiers and former 
fisheries ministers.

</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this evening 
I would like to follow up on a question which I put to the 
Minister of the Environment on May 15, when I asked her whether 
she recognized the usefulness of research and development of 
renewable energy of the type that is being conducted at Tokamak 
in Varennes, in the context of climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given that the Minister of the Environment confirmed the 
usefulness of such activities, the federal government can no 
longer claim that it cannot continue to fund the Tokamak project 
in Varennes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, in another adjournment debate on this most promising 
research project, the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of 
Human Resources Development told me that the decision to 
withdraw federal support for the Tokamak project in Varennes was 
made because of financial constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before being given a similar reply this evening, let me tell you 
that this is not the case at all. Not only is the money now 
available since the federal government is accumulating 
surpluses, but it is also an irresponsible decision from a 
budgetary standpoint. Why invest in the development of top 
technical and scientific expertise if scientists must then leave 
the country to put their expertise to good use? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the closure of Tokamak in Varennes, the specialists we have 
trained at taxpayers' expense will be taking their knowledge of 
nuclear fusion to Japan, the U.S. or the European Community. And 
what about Tokamak's state-of-the-art equipment and infrastructure? 
Close to $150 million in public funds have been invested in the 
past 20 years or so, and are now a total loss, because of this 
government's lack of vision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within a few years, Canada will probably be forced to spend an 
absolute fortune to purchase a technology it has helped develop 
for mere millions.  In the end, all this will cost far more than 
its annual investment of $7.2 million in Tokamak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such an edifying demonstration of good management of public 
funds!  Such visionary spirit! I must add that the very exacting 
quality standards at Tokamak, both scientific and technological, 
have allowed its partners to develop leading edge technological 
expertise.  For instance, one company, MPB Technologies, was 
able to land a $64 million contract thanks to technology 
developed in collaboration with the Canadian Centre for Magnetic 
Fusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is believed that the economic spin-offs from the Tokamak in 
Varennes bring far more to the federal government in tax revenue 
than its annual $7.2 million investment in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to prevent the upcoming dismantling of the Varennes 
Tokamak's technological heritage, and since the Minister of 
Natural Resources has shown himself to be open to this 
possibility, I would like to know how this government intends to 
make use of the facilities and knowledge of the Tokamak team in 
the context of related studies as part of its strategy on 
climate change.  Could the government not, for example, continue 
to develop the Varennes Tokamak's expertise, which is 
world-renowned, in the microwave sector? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday, the national forum on climate change was critical of 
how little the federal government was doing to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions.  This is all the more worrisome because, 
according to the Commissioner of the Environment and Sustainable 
Development, greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2000 will have 
increased by approximately 11% over the 1990 reference level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such a statistic makes it even more important that clean and 
safe forms of energy, such as the magnetic fusion the Varennes 
Tokamak is working on, be used in the future.  The energy 
alternative proposed by Tokamak represents a much less serious 
risk to the environment than the Candu reactor technology, which 
still has the unshakeable support of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a long-term undertaking, to which the Varennes Tokamak 
can make a positive contribution, provided the government lets 
it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This government clearly does understand that the reduction in 
greenhouse gases does not stop with our commitment at Kyoto.  The 
issue raised here is put in the context of climate change and 
global warming and innovative solutions around those very 
significant problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of climate change will be with us for a long time to 
come.  However we are acting now to find a solution.  Even as we 
reduce emissions, atmospheric concentrations will continue to 
rise for many decades before stabilization.  This means that we 
will experience a continued increase in the human influence on 
global climate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is of major concern is the possible future rates of climate 
change.  If we are to keep that rate of change within reasonable 
limits, we must begin to reduce emissions by applying new 
technologies within the next few years.  We cannot wait decades 
before taking action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has raised a particular point on a particular

make choices and this sometimes has to be at the expense of very

Canadians living in my riding of Waterloo—Wellington and indeed

environment.  They want to know that all levels of government and 
all partners are doing their utmost to secure a safe and clean 
environment for the generations to follow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want and demand action on issues concerning the 
environment.  As a government we need to provide vision and 
leadership in tackling the environmental challenges it faces.  We 
need to provide that vision and leadership in the context of 
sustainable development strategies which are beneficial for the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key environmental challenge facing Canadians is climate 
change.  Climate change could bring about such possible long term 
effects as drier summers in the prairies, increases in forest 
fires and insect infestations, coastal flooding and more frequent 
extreme weather events. All of this could be very devastating for 
Canada and all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear we need to act now. I am heartened to know that the

and that the consequences are potentially very devastating. I am 
heartened to know that Canada is considered to be a leader in 
international negotiations on climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has the responsibility to lead the nation 
in responding to climate change.  It needs to ensure that 
partnerships are well defined.  It needs to have targets to 
measure progress and it needs to have contingency plans for 
corrective actions if required. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>]

to secure our environment for future generations?

obligation will be a difficult challenge involving changing the 
way we produce and use energy and transport people and goods.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot stress enough the government's conviction and 
commitment to engage with as many players as possible in 
developing and implementing actions to reduce greenhouse gases. 
In fact it is the only way to proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By harnessing the impressive creative and innovative talents we 
have in Canada, I am sure that we can not only meet our emission 
reduction targets but also have economic growth and improve the 
quality of our lives.  If we can offer Canadians concrete ways in 
which to reduce emissions or be more energy efficient, they will 
do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our recent budget will help us do this.  The budget will provide 
$150 million over the next three years to help achieve the 
following:  first, to develop Canada's national implementation 
strategy to meet the reduction targets of the Kyoto protocol; 
second, to improve public education on climate change and to 
engage Canadians in ways to reduce emissions; third—

</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the minister that his predecessor, Doug Young, made a 
commitment to replace the POWA with something allegedly better 
when he axed it on April 1, 1997.  The Minister of Human 
Resources Development has done absolutely nothing.  What will he 
do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I put the question again:  What is he going to do with the $2 
million, the $2.5 million left unused in his program?  He has no 
respect for the working class.  He has no courage.  He refused 
to meet André Laliberté and Charles Lacroix.  What can he offer 
Clermont Bégin, 63 years of age, whom he wanted to cut off 
employment insurance claiming that he was not looking hard 
enough for work in a region where unemployment runs at over 11%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can he offer the 58 year old miner, who has a number of 
skills, but none recognized by other employers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about the miner, aged 48, with 28 years of experience and a 
sixth grade education?

</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is so timid he did not even appear this evening to 
answer the men from BC.  He sent his parliamentary secretary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What can he say to Noël Loubier, 50 years of age, with 31 years' 
seniority at the BC mine?  And to Richard Rousseau, aged 49, a 
labourer employed at the BC mine for 25 years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could provide him with a whole series of sad and unfortunate 
cases, but this minister is still not in touch with reality.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Natural Resources I am pleased to 
respond to this question.  It is one of several that have been 
raised by the hon. member opposite on this issue which is of 
direct effect and consequence to his riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has so often raised this question and we have 
responded in kind appropriately.  We have said specifically to 
the hon. member that this government honours the efforts of 
workers.  We are very much in tune with the needs of workers. 
That is why the Minister of Human Resources Development has 
pledged a $3 million fund to provide assistance and transitional 
assistance for this particular industry and sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been done on several other occasions I am pleased to 
report to the House that the workers are taking advantage of this 
opportunity.  In addition to the 40 or 50 workers who have sought 
employment opportunities elsewhere, several are taking on active 
employment measures.  They are taking their futures into their 
own hands. We are seeing a return to work for that group of 
workers, not to the extent we would like but it is continuing. We 
expect to see future mining activity in the area which this group 
of workers will take advantage of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We emphasize that while the hon. member opposite postures by 
suggesting the minister is the most appropriate one at this forum 
to answer this question, he once again deludes the people who are 
watching this broadcast.  As the hon. member knows it is the duty 
of the parliamentary secretary.  He has asked questions directly 
to the minister.  The minister has responded directly.  We are 
following parliamentary procedure. The minister cares very deeply 
about these workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The motion to adjourn the House is 
now deemed to have been adopted.  Accordingly, this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 6.22 p.m.)
