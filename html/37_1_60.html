</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to 
address the House at third reading of Bill C-22, the income tax 
amendments act, 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would implement key elements of the government's five 
year tax reduction plan, the largest tax relief package in 
Canada's history, and would legislate the technical amendments in 
Bill C-43 which died on the order paper last fall.  Each measure 
in the bill is based on the principles of fairness and equity in 
the federal tax system to which we have been committed since 
1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important component of the bill delivers measures 
announced in the 2000 budget and last October's economic 
statement to set out a multiyear plan for further tax reductions. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This plan, which provides $100 billion in tax relief by 
2004-05, will reduce by an average of 21% the federal personal 
income tax paid by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Families with children will receive an even larger tax cut of 
about 27% on average. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of January 2001, tax rates on all income levels were reduced 
and the 5% deficit reduction surtax was eliminated.  The low and 
middle income tax rates fell to 16% and 22% respectively.  The 
top 29% rate was reduced to 26% on incomes between $61,000 and 
$100,000, which means the 29% rate applies only to income over 
$100,000.  As all the economists and analysts have noted, the 
timing could not have been more perfect to bring in these tax 
cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increased support for families with children would be provided 
through the Canada child tax benefit.  The maximum Canada child 
tax benefit for the first child would rise to $2,372 in July, 
well on the way to the five year goal of $2,500 by the year 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the second child the maximum Canada child tax benefit would 
increase to $2,308 in July 2004. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These amendments must be in effect by July 1, so that families 
can get this benefit within the set timeframe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other amendments to personal income tax are specifically 
designed to help those who need them most. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill would increase the amount on which the disability tax 
credit is based.  It would expand the list of relatives to whom 
the disability tax credit can be transferred to make it 
consistent with medical expense tax credit rules and it would 
allow speech language pathologists to determine eligibility for 
the disability tax credit with respect to speech impairments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the bill would increase the maximum child care 
expense deduction for children for whom the disability tax credit 
can be claimed and the amounts on which the caregiver and infirm 
dependant credits are based. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would also include certain incremental costs under the 
medical expenses tax credit when a principal residence is built 
for people with mobility impairments. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, an amount of up to $3,000 in scholarships, fellowships 
and bursaries will be tax exempt, provided the student is 
eligible for the education tax credit. Self-employed workers can 
deduct from their income the share of the contributions to the 
Canada pension plan or to the Quebec pension plan paid by the 
employer for their own benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other personal income tax changes clarify the rules under which 
clergy can claim a deduction for their residence, allow Revenue 
Canada to release information about former registered charities 
under certain conditions and exempt municipalities from filing 
T4s for volunteers to whom they paid not more than $1,000.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another element of the tax reduction plan would help make 
Canada's business income tax more internationally competitive. 
Corporate tax rates would drop to 21% from 28% for businesses in 
the highest tax sectors to make them more internationally 
competitive, beginning with a one point tax cut effective January 
1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the year 2005 the combined federal-provincial tax rate would 
drop from the current average of 47% to 35%, five percentage 
points lower than the U.S.  This would put our businesses on a 
more competitive level with other G-7 countries and serve to 
attract investment and create jobs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The plan also provides a tax deferred capital gains rollover for 
investments in shares of certain small and medium size 
businesses, and a 50% reduction of the capital gains inclusion 
rate. Thus, the highest federal-provincial tax rate on capital 
gains will be lower than the same combined rate in the United 
States. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Increasing the employee stock option deduction from one-third to 
one-half means employees in Canada would be taxed more favourably 
on stock option benefits than employees in the United States.  In 
addition, the bill would allow the deferral of tax on certain 
stock option benefits and an additional deduction for certain 
stock option shares donated to charity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-22 would ensure a comparable tax system for Canadian 
banks and foreign bank branches operating here.  It would 
strengthen the thin capitalization rules, phase out the special 
tax regime for non-resident owned investment corporations and 
introduce a temporary 15% investment tax credit for grassroots 
mineral exploration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Technical amendments include extending the additional capital 
tax on life insurance corporations until the end of 2000 and 
clarifying the tax treatment of resource expenditures and the 
rules governing gifts of ecologically sensitive land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are three remaining measures I will touch on briefly 
before closing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first would introduce changes to the taxation of trusts and 
their beneficiaries, in particular property distributed from a 
Canadian trust to a non-resident beneficiary, mutual fund trusts, 
health and welfare trusts and those governed by RRSPs and RRIFs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>New antiavoidance measures will ensure that transfers to trusts 
cannot be used to unfairly reduce taxes. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The next measure would ensure that Canada retains the right to 
tax immigrants on gains that accrue during their stay in Canada. 
It would also clarify the effects of new taxpayer migration rules 
on rights to future income and allow returning former residents 
to unwind the tax effects of their departure regardless of how 
long they were non-resident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid international double taxation, former residents would 
be able to reduce Canadian tax payable on their pre-departure 
gains by certain foreign taxes paid on the same gains. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another measure would make advertising expenses in periodicals 
with at least 80% original editorial content fully deductible and 
those in other periodicals 50% deductible regardless of 
ownership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After July 1996 Canadian pension funds and other entities that 
own Canadian newspapers qualify as Canadian citizens under the 
ownership requirements of the Income Tax Act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before closing, I wish to mention that a number of amendments 
were made to this bill in committee.  On behalf of the 
government, I wish to thank members of the Standing Committee on 
Finance for their detailed examination of this bill. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Improvements have been made to several provisions, including 
those affecting back to back loans, weak currency debts, foreign 
accrual property income, partnerships, mortgage investment 
corporations and segregated fund trusts, just to name a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each of these amendments contributes to fairness in the tax 
system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that fiscal responsibility for government is 
fundamental and tax cuts are essential.  At the same time we are 
committed to maintaining an effective, fair and technically valid 
tax system.  Without a doubt this is the thrust of Bill C-22. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill will implement the key features of the five year tax 
reduction plan, which will lighten the tax burden on all 
taxpayers, strengthen support for families with children, and 
increase the competitiveness of the Canadian corporate tax 
system internationally. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge all my hon. colleagues to keep in mind that Canadian 
children need the Canada child tax benefit increases on July 1, a 
fact that makes speedy passage of the bill essential. 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I seek unanimous consent of the House to split my time 
with the hon. member for North Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I am honoured to stand in the House today to 
speak to Bill C-22, an act to amend the Income Tax Act.  Actually 
it was the Liberal Party election act.  Members will recall that 
the finance minister announced most of the provisions that we are 
dealing with today just days before the election was called. Of 
course he had no idea that the election would be called four days 
later.  After he did his economic update and announced these 
things in the House in October 2000, it came as a total surprise 
to him that lo and behold the Prime Minister announced an 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin by asking a simple rhetorical question. If 
there are policies that are necessary just before an election, 
how come those policies are not necessary between elections? 
Therein lies a very important question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have dealt with it over and over.  We dealt with it not long 
ago when we were dealing with the equalization act.  Suddenly it 
was necessary to lift the cap.  It was done because there was an 
election coming.  Believe it or not, the voters bought into it. A 
whole bunch of them in Atlantic Canada replaced sitting members 
with Liberal members because the Prime Minister said that the cap 
would be lifted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the legislation came in we dealt with it in the House.  We 
did indeed lift the cap but for one year.  We had some questions 
about the whole equalization process.  We thought it should be 
revisited in order to look at it rationally because it was a very 
convoluted system.  The opposition parties suggested that if it 
was good for an election year to lift the cap, it should be good 
policy to lift the cap in the long term.  The government said no 
to that amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the Liberal members stood on command and voted against the 
amendment.  That is a curiosity to me.  If it is good economic 
policy we should be doing it, whether or not there is an 
election.  If it is not good economic policy then we should be 
able to communicate to Canadian taxpayers why it cannot be done, 
and hopefully they would then trust that we would be fiscally 
responsible in managing their money properly.  That is how we 
would gain their support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have Bill C-22, an act to amend the Income Tax Act.  It 
goes on from there, but really it is a bill to enact the 
provisions of the Liberal fall election campaign in 2000.  Our 
party is leaning toward supporting the direction the Liberals are 
going in. 
After many years, being a grassroots party and representing the 
wishes and sometimes the demands of Canadian voters and 
taxpayers, we brought to the House the wishes of Canadians on 
fiscal matters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government loves to tax and spend.  It loves to take 
money out of the pockets of taxpayers and then roll it out during 
an election campaign so that hopefully it can stay in power, 
which is its overarching principle.  Four days before the 
election was called the Liberals said that what the Canadian 
Alliance was saying was right on.  The polls told them that.  If 
they wanted to win the election, they had to do these things 
during the election period so that they could get re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government introduced a number of measures, some of which 
are included in the bill.  We are now debating what the 
government promised, just by coincidence, four days before the 
election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to say a little about those things.  First I want 
to give very low marks to the Liberals but high marks to their 
communication department.  They have spin doctors who work very 
well.  They are able to communicate with straight faces to the 
Canadian people that there is a $100 billion tax cut.  One 
billion dollars is an awful lot of money and $100 billion is 
massive.  It boggles the mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have sometimes used this example when I talk to students and 
we talk about the way in which governments spend money, and the 
way they tax and so on.  Sometimes we also talk about the debt. 
When the Liberals came into power they inherited a debt of around 
$520 billion.  They allowed it to grow to almost $580 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be very fortunate if by the end of the government's 
mandate, say in the year 2004, although the Prime Minister will 
probably call an election in 2003, but certainly by the end of 
2004, we will be back down to the debt level that we were in 1993 
when it took power.  However, the spin doctors are able to 
convince Canadians that the Liberals are excellent stewards of 
the public money.  They are telling Canadians to trust them 
because they will manage our money properly, notwithstanding that 
the debt is much higher than it was when they took over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I said that the magnitude is in the billions of dollars.  I do 
not have the exact numbers before me because I was not planning 
on using this example.  However, when I talk to students about $1 
billion I ask them how long it would take them if they had to 
spend $1 million at a rate of $1 per second?  Some of them guess 
a bit and then I tell them the answer.  As I recall, if they 
started at midnight on January 1 it would take them until January 
11 or 12 before the money would be gone, approximately 11.5 days 
to get rid of $1 million at $1 a second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I ask them how long it would take them to spend $1 billion? 
Again, they guess and then I tell them the answer.  I tell them 
that to spend $1 billion at the rate of $1 per second would take 
until September, 31 years later.  That is how long it would take 
to get rid of $1 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we have a government claiming through its spin doctors a 
tax cut of $100 billion.  That is spin doctoring at its finest. 
The $100 billion includes a lot of money that it just decided not 
to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example.  Let us say I decided to give my 
wife some money to spend on a house, which I know she would love, 
and told her that I was going to give her $20,000 more than I 
planned to give her.  Under my breath I would mutter that I was 
planning on taking $18,000 away from her. 
She could say that $20,000 was great but the fact is it would 
only be $2,000 because it would include the $18,000 that I was 
going to take out of the housing fund.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what the government has done.  It is claiming $100 
billion in tax relief, but included in that is a whole lot of 
money that is represented by money that it could have taken but 
which it has now decided not to take. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a couple of years ago the government announced that 
it was restoring indexation.  There was no mention made of it 
being retroactive, so perpetually taxpayers were still suffering 
the removal of indexation on the tax rates over the last number 
of years because the government flattened the thing out.  We were 
paying a whole lot more taxes because of bracket creep.  When the 
government reintroduced it, it started from the present position 
and did not go back.  Therefore, the errors of the previous years 
continue to be perpetuated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things the government is claiming is that due to 
indexation this is a tax cut.  It is not a tax cut at all. The 
government said that it would take $10,000 from each taxpayer and 
now it is saying that it will only take $8,000.  In that case, 
the government is calling this a $2,000 tax cut but it is still 
taking the $8,000.  To call that a tax cut is inaccurate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we have the child tax benefit.  It is true that in 
the legislation the child tax benefit would be increased but that 
is not a tax cut.  It is an expenditure.  It is a case of the 
government thinking of a way to spend some money on behalf of 
families.  In a way, I have some sympathy for that position but 
it cannot properly or legitimately call it a tax cut.  That is 
spin doctoring and it is not acceptable in terms of the actual 
message that is being put out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line is that the actual tax cut is not $100 billion. 
It is actually closer to $50 billion and that is spread over five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a whole bunch of questions with respect to the bill but 
the government has decided to go ahead with it.  We know its 
members will vote for it and it will happen.  I will concede that 
families with children would get more money from the spending 
program and so for them it is an advantage.  For families without 
children, such as in the case of my wife and I whose children are 
grown up and have left home, there would be no tax cut.  It is a 
spin doctoring myth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also has implications in the area of tax rates.  We 
talk about the single tax rate.  The opposition and some of the 
other parties, and when I talk of opposition I mean the Liberals 
who are in opposition to us, totally misrepresented what a single 
tax rate does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan was to have one rate of tax at 17% and then 
subsequently we revised it so that it would apply only to 
$100,000 of taxable income.  That still included all of the 
present deductions.  None of them were to be taken away. However, 
instead of talking with Canadians and honestly debating its plan 
versus ours, the government has totally distorted what it said 
about our plan and then proceeded to knock it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really an unfair thing.  It is as if we have two car 
dealers and one dealer, trying to promote his product, says that 
the wheels fall off his competitor's cars as soon as they are 
driven 10,000 kilometres.  It is not true but that is what he 
says would happen.  He repeats it over and over again and then 
asks, with great passion, whether the customer wants to buy a car 
with wheels that fall off after being driven 10,000 kilometres. 
The customer says, no, and the car dealer suggests that the 
customer buy his car.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what those Liberals did.  I almost used a bad adjective, 
but thankfully I caught myself.  They took our plan, totally 
distorted what it did, developed animosity against that 
caricature of what we were proposing and asked Canadians to vote 
for them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are still thousands of Canadians who want to trust their 
governments.  They want to trust their politicians.  During an 
election campaign when these things are said Canadians think that 
if their trusted government leaders are saying something it must 
be right so they therefore believe them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take a ten second diversion to say that the same 
distortions happened when the Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration said what she said.  That was a hurtful and total 
distortion for a person like myself whose family members have 
worked all around the world with people of all kinds of different 
backgrounds, helping them.  To be labelled the way the 
immigration minister labelled us and then have Canadians say they 
would not vote for us because we were scary is hurtful and wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want Canadians to trust us we have to start dealing openly 
and honestly with them.  We have to tell them the truth and start 
debating the Liberal proposal versus ours.  That unfortunately 
has not happened.  I resent this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I taught mathematics and computing for 31 years in my life prior 
to becoming a parliamentarian and when people misuse math I get 
just about as upset as I do when they describe me in pejorative 
terms.  The government had Canadians persuaded, and this is one 
thing in the bill, that it would reduce the lower tax rate from 
17% to 16%.  It had the gall to go to Canadians, say it was 
reducing the rate to 16% and claim that was even better than the 
Canadian Alliance proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, it was worse than that.  In every category, including 
that first category at the low rate, our tax plan would have 
given Canadian taxpayers a greater tax break.  The reason was 
simple.  Even though our rate was 17%, it was on less of 
taxpayers' income.  We proposed, for example, that a two parent 
family with two kids would not pay any income tax on the first 
$26,000 of their earnings.  The Liberals ignored that.  They 
ignored the fact that we would increase the exemption.  All they 
did was talk about the fact that they would reduce the lower rate 
to 16% from 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I resent it when people trade on a misrepresentation of 
mathematical facts.  This is what the government has done and 
this is what we would be passing with Bill C-22.  If we pass 
the bill later today we would be approving the reduction of that 
rate to 16%.  Canadians would get a smaller tax break than 
they would have had they voted for us because of the fact that 
the Liberals have a great deal of expertise in messaging, in 
telling people “this is what is” when in fact it is just the 
opposite. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In passing Bill C-22 the Liberals ought to send out a press 
release to say that while they would be reducing the income tax 
rates and going from three levels to four, while they would be 
decreasing the 17% rate to 16%, the 25% rate to 22%, the 29% rate 
to 26%, and retaining the 29% rate for everything over $100,000, 
there is something else.  I would like that press release from 
the Liberal government to also say in bold letters at the bottom 
of the page “Please note that Canadians were hoodwinked into 
voting for a party that proposed this bill and got it pushed 
through the House and that it gives taxpayers a smaller tax break 
than, first, they deserve, and second, what the Canadian Alliance 
would have given them”.  That is what the press release should 
say.  I am expecting the Minister of Finance to put that on the 
bottom of the press release later today or next week when this 
bill is finally passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that will happen.  I see the parliamentary secretary 
over there grinning from ear to ear, which of course shows 
compliance with my present request.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that a $100 billion tax cut is a $50 
billion tax cut or even a little less if we look at how much the 
taxes are actually being cut.  The rest is spin doctoring. The 
fact of the matter is that this would produce a tax cut smaller 
than the tax cut we would have provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some other provisions in the bill with which I happen 
to agree.  There is a disability tax credit.  There is also the 
issue of children.  Families have big expenses when raising 
children.  The government is going in the right direction here by 
making it slightly easier for families, but it does not come 
anywhere near recognizing the actual costs of raising children. 
We would have substantially increased the deduction for children. 
The government has not done that.  The taxpayers would still pay 
taxes on the money and if they qualify they get a tax credit. 
Most people in the middle income bracket with two earners have 
the promise of a child benefit for which they are not eligible. 
Their taxes would stay the same.  The government is not reducing 
the taxes yet is announcing with this bill that taxes would be 
reduced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret that my time is up, Madam Speaker, but thank you for 
giving me the time to express my views on the bill.  I will vote 
against the bill for the reasons I have articulated. 
<P><A NAME="LINK12"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Elk Island for such an 
interesting speech.  I would like to expand slightly on one of 
his points.  It has to do with the size of the debt.  The fact is 
that even after all these years of Liberal government and the 
claims of fiscal responsibility the debt is still larger than 
when the Liberals took office.  Taxpayers are still paying $40 
billion a year in interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague talked about the examples he uses when he speaks at 
high schools.  There is one in the Vancouver area that I use to 
illustrate the size of this $40 billion debt and what it really 
means.  It is fairly well known that right at the moment the 
Lions Gate bridge is under reconstruction.  To build a brand new 
Lions Gate bridge would cost about $200 million.  Canada could 
build 200 brand new Lions Gate bridges every year with $40 
billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  That's the interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted White:</B>  Yes, that is just the interest on the 
debt.  Imagine the amount of infrastructure that could be built 
if we were not paying so much interest on the debt:  200 brand 
new Lions Gate bridges every year.  That is four every week, four 
brand new highway bridges that could be built every week. These 
are huge bridges, not just normal small highway bridges.  This is 
enough money to twin the freeway in Vancouver every month. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are enormous amounts of money we are talking about and the 
bill would do very little to reverse the legacy that really dates 
back to the Trudeau days.  All these problems that the bill would 
take tiny little steps to address go back to the days of Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have an article here written by Michael Campbell, quite a well 
known author in the Vancouver area, about the problems we have 
today and how they relate to those days of Trudeau.  It does 
relate directly to the bill.  I would like to read a little bit 
from the article because it illustrates the size of the problem. 
It was written on October 3, 2000, a little while after all the 
public outpouring of grief after Mr. Trudeau's death.  Michael 
writes:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Trudeau is the godfather of Canada's interventionist government 
policies regarding the economy.  It was Trudeau who spearheaded 
the drive for the “Just Society” through aggressive increases 
in government spending and wealth distribution that led to Canada 
leading the world in the growth of taxation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was the Trudeau government that brought Canada's federal 
deficit from zero in 1968 to $38 billion by the time he left

interest payments.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you remember that, Madam Speaker?  It was a short term 
bailout in 1968.  In the year 2000, after $1.7 billion in 
subsidies had been spent on that project, it was finally shut 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Campbell continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was during the Trudeau era that unemployment insurance 
subsidies became a way of life for some in the Maritimes with the 
results still well in evidence today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Trudeau we got nationalization of companies and 
industries.  Canada curtailed foreign investment and exploded the 
government bureaucracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But his legacy extends beyond specific economic policies into a 
mindset that still dominates the landscape today in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still stuck with the problem that was built up in the 
country during the Trudeau years, as Michael Campbell notes: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was during the Trudeau years that the anti-business, 
anti-success attitude—referred to by Nobel Prize-winner Robert 
Mundell as the chief obstacle to our economic prosperity—took 
hold and flourished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Marketing all government policies as part of the pursuit of the 
Just Society has permanently linked the concepts of government 
intervention and justice in many people's minds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see the results today where opposition to extending 
government programs is regularly regarded as a form of inactivity 
at best and godlessness at worst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As (the) Prime Minister...has told us regularly, only the 
selfish and greedy want to lower taxes.  Only the most 
cold-hearted could oppose a national day-care program or business 
subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What's interesting to note is that before we headed on the path 
toward the Just Society, Canada had the second-highest economic 
output per person in whole world. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This fact is important to note.  Before we headed down the 
Trudeau road we had the second highest economic output per person 
in the whole world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Campbell continues: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest numbers from the OECD put us at 20th out of 29 in the 
developed world.  Our economy grew at an average pace of five per 
cent, excluding inflation, before 1968, which is 40 per cent 
higher than the average since. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whatever economic indicator we look at since the Trudeau just 
society began, we have gone downhill in economic performance 
every way we measure it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Michael Campbell says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our federal debt has grown from 0 to $750 billion, while our 
currency has gone from being at par with the U.S. dollar— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is below 65 cents today.  How can anyone spin doctor it so 
well?  It is absolutely amazing to westerners that somehow there 
is this line at the edge of Manitoba and everyone to the east of 
it cannot see what is going on.  They have bought into this 
terrible scam that was started back in 1968 and has been 
perpetuated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the pursuit of the just society, poverty advocates tell 
us that nothing has changed.  There are more people in poverty 
than there were before, which always leaves us somewhat startled 
considering that so many Canadians continue to call for more of 
the same policies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, as I have mentioned, would really just take tiny baby 
steps to reverse that terrible Trudeau legacy that has led us to 
where we are today.  Also part of the Trudeau legacy is the 
beginning of western alienation.  It was Trudeau who gave us the 
finger from the train in Kamloops many years ago.  It was Trudeau 
who started the national energy program that destroyed the 
economy in Alberta. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Still to this day the west is not getting its fair share from 
this Confederation.  For example, my colleague from Elk Island 
mentioned that there was recently a temporary increase in the 
transfer payments, but he did not mention that more than half of 
that went to Quebec, which somehow still manages to portray 
itself as a have not province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is totally ludicrous that this situation exists.  I know from 
working here on the Hill that practically every product we use, 
every service we obtain, is supplied by Quebec.  The pens and 
pencils, the paper, the water supplies, the computers, the people 
who work here:  just about everything comes from Quebec.  This 
shows that the Quebec economy is extremely well diversified. 
They build automobiles.  They have manufacturing plants for 
aluminum extrusion.  They export electric power.  It is a 
complete mystery to me that it is a have not province.  It is 
certainly a mystery to the people out west who are receiving less 
than their fair share of the transfers.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, spending in B.C. by the federal government is 
comprised of direct goods and services expenditures as well as 
transfers to individuals in the form of EI payments, pensions and 
so on.  However the one area of spending that is 100% under the 
control of the government is the procurement of goods and 
services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the data from 1992 to 1998, and that is the latest 
year for which we have figures available, on average the federal 
government spent about $3 billion on goods and services in B.C. 
in each of those years.  Our share, based on the population, 
should have been between $4 billion and $4.5 billion.  That 
difference amounts to a shortfall for B.C. in goods and services 
alone of $9.5 billion in just six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Worse still, no attempt has been made by the Liberal government 
to correct the problem.  It has kept that figure stagnated 
between $1 billion and $1.5 billion steadily since 1993.  It has 
done nothing, not a thing to increase it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a typical year, taking into account all federal transfers to 
the province of British Columbia, we receive about $1.7 billion 
less than Ottawa collects in revenues from B.C.  For example, in 
1998 the following differences can be found between British 
Columbia's actual share of expenditures and the hypothetical 
share based on population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a goods and services procurement shortfall of $1.178 
billion, almost a $1.2 billion shortfall.  We had a shortfall in 
transfers to persons of $40.4 million and we had a transfer to 
business shortfall of $89.89 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, because B.C. is rated as a have province despite 
our awful NDP government and the terrible deficits that it runs, 
we received approximately $1.1 billion less in direct transfers 
to the provincial government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course it is no secret that B.C., Alberta and Ontario all 
contribute to the so-called equalization transfers to 
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, 
P.E.I. and Newfoundland.  Quebec is the strange one and how it 
still qualifies as a have not province despite its productivity 
is a mystery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed recently that the government of Quebec announced a tax 
holiday for some types of business.  Equalization transfers are 
supposed to be based on the government's inability to raise 
sufficient revenues from its residents, so how can a government 
justify giving tax reductions to some businesses and at the same 
time saying it cannot raise enough taxes so it wants more 
equalization payments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suppose in theory the government of B.C. could reduce all the 
taxes to zero for its constituents and then say that it cannot 
raise any money from its constituents and ask Ottawa to transfer 
all the money back to it.  It is a ludicrous equalization program 
in which we find ourselves entangled.  It does not make sense at 
all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note the fiscal outflow from B.C. caused by 
the weak federal spending on goods and services.  It is not only 
proportionately higher than any other province, but it is higher 
in absolute numbers of dollars.  We receive $295 less per capita 
than any other province.  It is just not fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Prime Minister regularly saying that westerners would 
get a better deal if they voted Liberal, I hate to think of the 
mess we would be in today if that had happened.  When we look at 
that federal debt and the way it was exploding in 1993, I well 
remember the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives calling 
us extremists because we wanted to balance the budget back in 
1993 with our zero in three plan that we promoted in 1993 to get 
the government's fiscal policies under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time every government in the country was running 
deficits.  The federal government was running $40 billion 
deficits a year and we were called extremists for wanting to fix 
that problem.  The government and the Progressive Conservatives 
scared people by saying we were extremists.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We managed to get 54 members into the House.  We made the 
difference because today when we look across the country there is 
not a government, federal or provincial, that does not want to 
balance its budget.  All of the credit, 100% of the credit for 
that goes to the Reform Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance 
for taking it from extremism to being mainstream. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Anybody who tries to claim that it was the Liberal government 
that did it is misinformed or misinforming because it was not the 
Liberal government that did it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The way to correct western alienation is not for more people to 
vote Liberal.  It is for the government over there to stop the 
scare tactics, to stop the distortion of facts and to start 
looking at what is best for the country.  What is best for the 
country is not what is contained in the bill.  It is a sham, a 
complete sham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my hon. colleague said, we will end up at the end of this 
term with more debt to pay and with $40 billion a year in 
interest payments.  If we had followed the Reform Party plan that 
was promoted in 1993, we would already have significantly paid 
down our debt.  We would be in the range of $30 billion a year in 
interest payments, freeing up $10 billion a year to spend on 
infrastructure and other programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is frankly dishonest to present the bill to the House and 
accuse us of holding it up when we are trying to take our 
entitled time to show the people of Canada exactly what is going 
on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not only a sham.  It adds to the complexity of the 
tax act.  Every one of us in this place gets complaints from our 
constituents about the complexity of the tax act.  There is 
hardly anybody who can even do their own tax returns any more; 
they have to hire an accountant or a specialist to do them.  The 
Canadian Alliance promoted, which should be included in Bill 
C-22, a reduction in the complexity rather than an increase in it 
once again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from Elk Island mentioned briefly how the numbers 
actually do not tell the whole truth.  In my finishing minutes I 
would like to go over those numbers quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims a $100.5 billion gross tax reduction, but 
when we take off $3.2 billion over five years for social spending 
because of the child tax benefit, which is really spending and 
not a tax reduction; when we take off the $29.5 billion over five 
years for increased CPP premiums; and when we take off the $20.7 
billion over five years for cancelled tax hikes due to 
indexation, we end up with $41.7 billion in tax relief over five 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is better than nothing.  We are pleased that at least there 
is some.  It certainly is not honest to portray it the way it has 
been on the other side of the House.  The biggest problem we 
still have is the size of the debt and the size of the annual 
interest payments which, as I said at the beginning of my speech, 
could build 200 brand new Lions Gate bridges every year.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I did have a different introduction to make, but after 
listening to my colleague from the Alliance I thought it might be 
important to point out to him and other hon. members of the House 
that the first government in Canada to balance the budget was an 
NDP government in Saskatchewan after some horrendous budgetary 
practices by the prior Progressive Conservative government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were the first ones.  There were terrible practices by the 
prior government.  It was a right of centre government, by the 
way.  We take some pride in having been able to do that and, 
quite frankly, in the history of the administration of the 
finances of that province all the way back to when it was led by 
Premier Tommy Douglas.

and wish to do so from a number of perspectives.  I will start 
with the issue of the environment as that is my responsibility as 
critic for my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this week we had the opportunity to come together as a 
House on an issue proposed by the Progressive Conservatives with 
regard to the protection of water in Canada.  All members of the 
House, with the exception of the Bloc, supported that motion and 
rightfully so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at these budgetary items we cannot help but realize 
the height of hypocrisy when the government side proposes that 
our finances be handled in this way.  At the same time it ignores 
to a very significant degree the responsibilities of the 
government to provide necessary financing for a municipal 
infrastructure program to deal with the crisis facing Canada with 
regard to providing safe water for all citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see figures from the municipalities on what it will cost to 
treat our water and our sewage.  The type of dollars they are 
talking about are no way reflected in the budgetary items before 
us.  The figure proposed by the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities is $16.5 billion.  The allocation from the 
government for all types of municipal infrastructure is only $2.5 
billion over six years, which is simply not enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to present some statistics on the situation leading 
up to the financial statement.  In the decade from 1989 to 1998 
there has been a dramatic shift in wealth and we have seen the 
impact it has had on family incomes.  If we break down by 20 
percentiles all families in Canada, the statistics show that from 
1989 to 1998 the families at the lower end of the scale dropped 
in income quite dramatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The poorest level dropped 17% in earning abilities in that 
period of time.  The lower middle income group dropped 13%.  The 
middle income group dropped 4%.  The upper middle income group 
went up by 1%.  The top end families that earned $114,000 in 1989 
went up to $124,000, or a 9% increase, in 1998.

and I would just like to draw the members' attention to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we go to the airport, the taxis can only carry passengers 
in one direction.  There is somehow a rule somewhere that says 
one company gets the right to haul passengers from the airport 
into Ottawa and the other companies haul passengers from Ottawa 
to the airport.  Therefore, every other cab is empty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This has huge implications to costs.  Some of these taxi drivers 
running empty half the time are making very little money.  They 
are not able to pay as much taxes.  It is definitely tough on the

gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, if the federal government were responsible, it would

assessments which the government has received from outside 
economists and organizations in recent weeks.  These are very 
disturbing to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of Canada's most respected economists, Dale Orr of WEFA, is 
warning today that for the fiscal year just ended federal 
spending will be about $2 billion more than expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government pretend that we are not on track for a

it deny we are not on track for a deficit?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, he is right on one thing.  They have 
grossly exceeded their spending targets.  They are way over. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear, as a former economist and now the member for 
Markham said as far back as last November, that the government 
through its wild spending would be eating into its contingency 
reserve.  That account is there to protect Canadians, should 
there be unexpected downturns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the government justify wild spending plans which cut 
into the very savings account that is supposed to be there to 
protect Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

does the hon. member oppose helping Canadians in these key areas? 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, they are wildly exceeding their 
spending plans.  The Canadian Alliance said as far back as last 
November that there would be a possible deficit within three 
years.  Just this week economists are saying the same. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance minister has said he would only bring out a mini 
update covering the next two years.  In November he promised 
taxpayers everything was fine on a five year projection.  He is 
not talking five years any more, just two.

deficit according to economists?  Will he bring in a five year

Mr. Speaker, while we are quoting economists, perhaps the Deputy

would get pretty tight between 2003 and 2005 and that was why it 
was very important to make sure spending was well restrained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government was more than $2 billion over budget for the last 
fiscal year.  In the month of March, the last month of the fiscal 
year, the government spent 70% more than the average for the

over.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the auditor general has repeatedly criticized the 
government's practice of March madness where ministers and 
departments blow billions out the door in order to spend it 
before the end of the fiscal year when the finance minister claws 
it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the Deputy Prime Minister tell us why his government 
continues to ignore these warnings from the auditor general?  Why 
did it announce $16 billion of spending in the last month, in the 
dying days of the fiscal year just closed?  Why did we spend 70% 
more in March than in any month in the rest of the year?  Why is 
that? 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, why does the hon. member not respond to the quote I just 
gave from the chief economist of the Royal Bank?  He cannot do 
that because the chief economist of the Royal Bank was right when 
he said:

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything this government has done in the past would suggest we 
don't have to worry about a deficit.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the hon. member criticizing our spending to carry out our

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

<P><A NAME="LINK89"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
treasury board guidelines on sole source contracting are very 
simple:  that there is a pressing emergency, that the contract is 
valued at less than $25,000, that it is not in the public 
interest to solicit bids, or that only one person or firm is 
capable of performing the work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, there are only two possible reasons why the 
government gave a $615,000 sole source contract to Groupaction: 
Either it was not in the public interest to solicit bids, because 
the company was a major Liberal donor, or because the work was 
done by Groupaction in the first place it was the only one 
capable of evaluating.  Either way it is questionable.  Which is 
it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK90"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to note that the member is incorrect.  The contract to 
Groupaction was not sole sourced.  Groupaction was a qualified 
advertiser available to the department for utilization on 
specific contracts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work done by Groupaction was not in fact an evaluation of a 
past project.  It was an identification of additional important 
opportunities for Canada to present Canadians with the services 
and programs available to all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK91"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Andy Burton (Skeena, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the parliamentary secretary maintains that this was not 
a sole source contract since the government picked from a source 
list of prequalified firms.  I do not see the difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not stand to reason then that Groupaction would have 
been disqualified from this list since it had done the original 
work in the first place?  If it did not evaluate, what did it do? 
If there is really no problem with this contract why not release 
its findings?  What is the government trying to hide? 
<P><A NAME="LINK92"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, let 
me repeat.  First, Groupaction is a qualified advertising firm. 
Sixteen agencies competed or were granted qualification after a 
competition.  The particular contract involved was amended from 
evaluation and identification to simply identification of 
sponsorship opportunities.  That is exactly what Groupaction did 
on behalf of the Government of Canada in accordance with the 
contract as amended.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Minister of Finance wondered why Quebec's 
referendum legislation of 1995 suggested that, following a vote 
in favour of Quebec's sovereignty, the Canadian dollar would 
remain the currency used in that province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were two reasons for this: first, the dollar belongs to 
Quebecers as much as it belongs to Canadians and, second, this 
legislation provided that the Canadian dollar would be the 
currency having legal tender in Quebec following a yes vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, the world situation has evolved. There was the Euro 
currency and now the FTAA issue. The only one in Canada who has 
not evolved is the Minister of Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like him to tell me why he is so stubborn and 
narrow-minded that he will not even consider having a single 
currency for the three Americas? 
<P><A NAME="LINK95"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Finance, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot who, at the meeting with the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada, said “Mr. Governor, it is not the floating system 
I object to, far from it. I think it is the right way to go”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, Mr. Dodge said that in the context of a common currency, 
Canada would have absolutely no influence on North America's 
monetary policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the sovereignist party want to transfer our monetary 
sovereignty to Washington? 
<P><A NAME="LINK96"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
because the Governor of the Bank of Canada has no power to 
determine the value of the Canadian dollar, or interest rates. 
He is already doing what Washington does. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, why does the government persist in keeping a minor 
currency, which is the victim of speculators, which in turn 
creates instability in business planning, while everywhere else 
in the three Americas, they are talking about a possible single 
currency? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even the Governor of the Bank of Canada agrees. Yesterday, 
Thomas Courchene described those who are not thinking about this 
issue now as dinosaurs.

of the Bloc to attack the dollar.  The dollar is a pillar of 
Canada and a signal of Canadian unity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the member to insult our dollar in the way that he has is an

than many other currencies.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
in giving testimony to the finance committee yesterday, several 
of Canada's leading economists suggested that the current surplus 
position of the government gives it a perfect opportunity to make 
fundamental, needed changes to the tax system.  This would 
promote investment, employment and economic growth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the government use this opportunity to strengthen our 
productivity, economy and investment and thereby improve the 
status of our lowly Canadian dollar? 
<P><A NAME="LINK100"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to clarify some of 
the numbers that have been thrown around in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the year in question, where some have questioned 
whether we would go into deficit, I should point out that this 
government and this finance minister have been very strong in 
building in prudence.  In fact in that year there is $6.5 billion 
of fiscal cushion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the red book commitments, over four years they are 
$5.9 billion.  We do not have a problem with any deficits.  In 
fact many economists were cited here in the House earlier. Tax 
reform is maybe something down the road, but we do not have any 
problem with deficits moving forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK101"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>   Mr. 
Speaker, I guess that shows the flaw of reading the answer to the 
question he thought I would ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Integrating earned income with dividend income for tax purposes 
is a very necessary measure.  This is an ideal time to do this 
since it can be done with tax cuts rather than with tax 
increases.  Will the minister do this? 
<P><A NAME="LINK102"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again we have the other side of 
the House wanting their cake and eating it too.  They want us to 
deal with any looming, alleged deficits and yet want us to cut 
taxes as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian productivity has actually been picking up in the last 
couple of years.  We have set the fiscal climate:  We are cutting 
taxes, we are paying down the debt and the business community is 
responding.  In fact investment in machines and equipment and 
investment in some of the high technology equipment is happening 
at a very strong pace and our productivity will keep that upward 
track. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think those members should have more confidence in the 
Canadian economy than they have in their leader.

not?  Now we have one on urban affairs.  Meanwhile, the 
infrastructure in our cities is crumbling as municipalities try

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>PRIVACY COMMISSIONER 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday I gave notice to the Chair of a question 
of privilege concerning the public letter the Privacy 
Commissioner of Canada, George Radwanski, wrote to Information 
Commissioner John Reid.  The letter was made public by wide 
dissemination through privacy commissioner facilities including 
the Internet and it appears on the website of the privacy 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the letter has received widespread 
distribution and is not a private piece of correspondence.  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sending you a copy of the letter from the 
website and I ask for consent of the House to table a copy at 
some point.  The letter is a direct public attack by one officer 
of parliament on the work of another officer of parliament, as 
referred to by the Deputy Prime Minister today in the House.  It 
seriously calls into question the impartiality of the privacy 
commissioner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be my submission to the Chair that this public attack on 
an officer of parliament erodes public confidence in that 
officer.  The fact that the attack was made by an officer of 
parliament erodes public confidence in this institution and is a 
contempt of the House and its officials.  Both the privacy 
commissioner and the information commissioner are officers of 
parliament.  They report to the House and operate under the 
authority of two statutes, the Privacy Act and the Access to 
Information Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer the Chair to page 155 of Erskine May, 19th edition, 
which states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Houses will treat as breaches of their privileges, not 
only acts directly tending to obstruct their officers in the 
execution of their duty, but also any conduct which may tend to 
deter them from doing their duty in the future. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The duties and powers of the privacy commissioner are set out in 
section 29.  I will not quote them here as you do not have to 
rule on questions of law, Mr. Speaker.  It is sufficient to know 
that the privacy commissioner is empowered to investigate 
complaints from individuals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important feature is that there must be a complaint.  There 
was no indication in the letter that a complaint had been made 
and we are not aware that any such complaint was made.  The 
closest indication as to the motivation of the privacy 
commissioner is his statement found at paragraph five: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>My duty as Privacy Commissioner of Canada is to champion and 
defend the legitimate privacy rights of every Canadian, whether 
it be an unemployed labourer or the Prime Minister of our 
country.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know how many unemployed labourers are the subject of 
this sort of treatment, but I know there is a legitimate case 
before the Supreme Court of Canada for judicial determination. 
The privacy commissioner is attempting to alter its outcome on 
behalf of his friend the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The relationship between Mr. Radwanski and the Prime Minister 
was raised in the House and in the second chamber of parliament 
prior to his appointment.  It has been the subject of media 
comment.  The unilateral and grossly improper attempt to make the 
information commissioner withdraw an action authorized by law 
gives the public the impression that an officer of parliament is 
primarily an agent of the Prime Minister and acting in such a way 
as to interfere with the process of the courts.  The matter will 
be adjudicated in due course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Privacy Act empowers the commissioner to receive and to 
investigate complaints.  He is empowered to make findings and to 
report his findings to government.  He is empowered to examine 
databanks, to make findings and to report those findings.  He is 
required to report to parliament annually.  He is empowered to 
make special reports: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—commenting on any matter within the scope of the powers, duties 
and functions of the Commissioner where, in the opinion of the 
Commissioner, the matter is of such urgency or importance that a 
report thereon should not be deferred until the time provided for 
transmission of the next annual report of the Commissioner. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is not empowered to unilaterally declare himself a champion 
of the Prime Minister's side in a court proceeding and to attack 
an officer of parliament who has lawful authority to seek 
judicial determinations on matters lawfully brought through the 
information commissioner's office.  It is important and critical 
to my argument that the Chair consider that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been an increasing trend on the part of some 
parliamentary officers to involve themselves, mostly through 
public comment, in matters outside their statutory 
responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have refrained from raising questions on the issue until now. 
I find it particularly troublesome when individuals, in this 
instance the privacy commissioner, start telling other 
jurisdictions their views on what the laws should be.  These 
people are appointed to fulfil their duties under the law and 
their appointments do not make them judge and jury on all matters 
relating to those subjects.  They are first and foremost officers 
appointed to do their duty under the law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not tolerate judges taking to the public platform to 
participate in public debate. There needs to be similar restraint 
exercised on officers of parliament.  They do not speak for this 
place.  They are not self-appointed, self-generated champions of 
what the law should be.  Nor should they act in no way as agents 
for the Prime Minister or portray themselves in that fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of the information commissioner's access to the Prime 
Minister's agenda is before the Supreme Court of Canada, the 
highest court in the land, for determination.  The court will do 
its job.  The privacy commissioner seeks to subvert this lawful 
process and in so doing has been intemperate and accusatory.  To 
call the lawful actions of an officer of parliament “tantamount 
to informational rape” is not only demeaning to the office 
holder.  It reflects on the House of which he is an officer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information commissioner is a former parliamentarian 
empowered by the House.  He is not freelancing or acting in some 
sort of nefarious purpose for the sole purpose of partisan 
exploration of the Prime Minister's agenda.  He had a formal 
request to seek such information.  He has a mandate and a 
responsibility to uphold that request and follow the chain of 
information.  However the unprecedented attack by his counterpart 
the privacy commissioner is improper and I would submit 
illogical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The privacy commissioner has concerns about the law.  There is 
nothing in the law to establish the office of champion of the 
Prime Minister.  We are aware of no complaint to the privacy 
commissioner unless it came from the PMO or the Privy Council 
Office.  It appears he has set out to attack an officer of 
parliament for purposes other than his statutory framework.  He 
is attempting to put the fix in for the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the privacy commissioner has concerns about the law he has 
the ability to report those concerns to parliament.  To my 
knowledge he has not done so.  Instead he has, and this is 
important, publicly attacked the lawful activities of the 
information commissioner without the foundation of a complaint 
having been made to him.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This gives the appearance, whether true or not, that the privacy 
commissioner is the Prime Minister's agent, champion and client. 
It undermines public confidence in the independence of the 
privacy commissioner.  He has become the champion of the Prime 
Minister against a fellow officer of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor has cast himself in a similar role, and 
this is the complete opposite of what their offices should 
represent and are intended to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These actions, the unilateral and unauthorized public 
undermining of an officer of parliament in the execution of his 
lawful duties and the carrying out of a media campaign against an 
officer of parliament in the lawful pursuit of his duties, 
constitute prima facie evidence of contempt of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Public confidence in all officers of parliament should be a 
matter of basic concern to every member of the House.  The issue 
is sufficiently serious to merit examination by a committee, and 
I am prepared to move the necessary motion should you find there 
is a prima facie case of contempt before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK155"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not take a long time to 
discuss the issue brought to the floor of the House by the hon. 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, the House leader for 
the Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will know that Mr. Radwanski, in responding to a media 
question, indicated he had not spoken to the Prime Minister about 
this case.  Nor had anyone in the Prime Minister's Office 
encouraged him to speak about the issue.  Let us be clear on 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both officials in question are officers of parliament, not only 
of this House but of both houses.  They are officers of 
parliament as an institution.  Just as the information 
commissioner responds to questions involving access to 
information, the privacy commissioner has a role to comment on 
what he believes to be privacy issues.  His task in that regard 
is of solemn importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for me to say which of the two tasks is more 
important.  The fact that both officials have existed in a 
parallel way presumably means that the House and all of us 
consider both roles equally important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member across the way said, and the blues will verify 
the precise words, that the privacy commissioner commented as to 
what the law should be.  I do not believe the privacy 
commissioner has made remarks as to what the law governing his 
position should be.  I do not think that is the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member, while claiming to defend an officer of 
parliament, made very strong accusations about another officer of 
parliament.  He said the officer in question had exceeded his 
mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member has a right to state his opinion.  I may or may 
not agree with it but that is a different proposition.  However 
the member has said on repeated occasions, and I think there were 
five of them, that the officer in question was a champion of the 
Prime Minister.  The member has no knowledge or information to 
support that and has produced no evidence before the House. 
Repeating a sentence he had said previously in the same discourse 
does not constitute proof. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Comments like that about an officer of parliament are 
inappropriate.  As to whether the privacy commissioner is 
entitled to comment on privacy matters, I am sure that he is. 
Whether he commented in the proper forum is a debate which is 
perhaps of interest to some of us.  If it is, there is nothing 
wrong with discussing the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could call one or both officers before the appropriate 
parliamentary committee under estimates, under Standing Order 
108(2) or otherwise to ask them to define how they see themselves 
doing their jobs in that regard. 
That is fine.  It is the privilege of the House and its 
committees to do so.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not believe that justifies making accusations of 
the kind that were made about an officer of parliament while 
alleging at the same time to defend the other officer of 
parliament.  Both officers were appointed by resolutions of both 
Houses and carried with the vast support of this House.  I do 
believe, Mr. Speaker, that is the issue before you to consider. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, I do not want to belabour the point here.  I believe 
I have addressed the issue.  I do not believe it is my role to 
make a trial of one person while accusing another, nor the 
reverse thereof.  Both of those would be inappropriate action on 
my part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if we have questions about how these two 
officers discharge their functions there is an existing mechanism 
for us to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One should also be prudent when making comments in the House 
about an issue that is presently before the courts.  Prudent 
language on behalf of all of us is extremely important.  The 
comments we make here can and have been used in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The honourable and learned member across the way, who is a 
member of the bar, will know that the comments we make here can 
and have been used in the past to make points before the courts. 
Therefore, we should be twice as prudent.  I invite the House to 
behave in that manner. 
<P><A NAME="LINK156"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have two quick points which might assist the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have listened to the matter raised by the hon. member.  I have 
noted, and I hope all members have as well, that in our statutes 
governing access to information and privacy we have constructed a 
bit of a dynamic and a conflict between the two.  The objectives 
and goals of access to information move in a certain direction 
and the goals and objectives of the privacy legislation operate 
in the opposite direction.  As a result of that, there is a 
natural potential conflict between the goals of privacy and the 
goals of access to information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this particular case, parliament having constructed both of 
those mechanisms, it is natural that the dynamic of conflict 
would always be there.  It is therefore my view that this is more 
a case of legitimate differences between the operation of a 
statute and its mandate than it is a question of privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of whether or not this is a question of privilege, 
I personally do not grasp the difference between the information 
commissioner and the privacy commissioner, and our day to day 
privileges and operations here in the House.  To be sure, it is a 
conflict and a very public issue, but I do not see the connection 
between that conflict and our day to day operations in the House 
as it pertains to our privileges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The Chair will take this matter under 
advisement and come back to the House in due course.  I thank 
hon. members for their interventions on the point.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the 
following questions will be answered today: Nos. 24, 30 and 33. 
.[Text] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 24—<B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the total estimated greenhouse gases emissions from: 
(<I>a</I>) Suncor Energy Inc. project millenium oil sands development 
project; and (<I>b</I>) the Shell Canada Athabasca oil sands project? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ralph Goodale (Minister of Natural Resources and Minister 
responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board, Lib.):</B> (a) Suncor 
Energy Inc. project millenium oil sands development project 
includes a new mine and mining equipment, additional bitumen 
extraction facilities, a new bitumen upgrading complex and a 
combined cycle cogeneration plant. This will increase production 
from 6.1 million m3 oil equivalent in 1999 to 12.6 million m3 of 
crude oil and fuel products in 2002. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suncor does not publish project specific emission targets. The 
company expects to gain energy efficiency improvements throughout 
the operation of project millenium. Green house gas, GHG, 
emissions will be managed as an integral part of the overall 
operations. Suncor contributes reports regularly to the climate 
change voluntary challenge and registry program. The reported 
actual emissions per unit of production was 0.728 tonnes CO2 
equivalent per m3 of production in 1999, 30% below the 1990 
baseline. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suncor estimates that in 2002, when project millenium is 
operational average GHG emissions from oil sands will be .606 
tonnes CO2 equivalent/m3 of production. Based on this, and the 
anticipated production of 6.5 m3 per year from project millenium, 
GHG emissions from the project can be estimated to be 3.9 million 
tonnes CO2 equivalent per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) Shell Canada Athabasca Oil Sands project: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Athabasca oil sands, AOS, project, with a production 
capacity of 24,646 m3/d, 9.9 million m3 per calendar year, was 
officially launched in December 1999 with start-up planned for 
2002. The AOS project in committed to a 50% reduction in GHG 
emissions from those estimated when the project was officially 
launched in 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its current design the project is expected to emit 3.5 
million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. This captures the 
project's own direct emissions and those form cogeneration 
facilities that will supply electricity and heat. This figure is 
projected, based on improvements made to the original 
feasibility study and the company's environmental impact 
assessment, which had estimated 4.8 million tonnes of CO2 
equivalent per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action to reach 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year 
includes addition of cogeneration facilities. The target emission 
level to be attained by 2010 is 1.75 million tonnes of CO2 
equivalent per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Both Suncor and Shell have adopted ISO 14000, the international 
environmental management system standard. The companies are also 
involved in the oil sands task force of the Canadian industry 
program for energy conservation, CIPEC, in their pursuit of 
energy management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 30—<B>Mr. John Duncan:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have been the total costs since 1995 for the project to 
replace the old foghorn at the Cape Mudge light station in 
British Columbia with an electronic foghorn, including: (<I>a</I>) 
the cost of the solar unit, batteries and horns; (<I>b</I>) the cost 
to repair or replace original components or failures; (<I>c</I>) the 
cost of maintenance; and (<I>d</I>) the cost of technician 
transportation and labour? 
</UL>
<P><A NAME="LINK180"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Dhaliwal (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
(a) The following equipment was installed at Cape Mudge light 
station as part of the lightstation service project. 
<p align=left><A HREF="nsmeq30.htm"><IMG SRC="../images/b_stone1.gif" border=0></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This amount includes the total cost of equipment and hardware. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(b) The first electronic foghorn installed on October 21, 1997, 
was an AB560 model with a frequency of 645Hz. The foghorn's two 
emitters were defective at the time of installation and replaced 
under warranty, however the Canadian Coast Guard, CCG, spent 
approximately $900 to replace the emitters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(c) Following the installation of the electric foghorn, 
complaints were received by local residents that the horn was too 
loud. The foghorn was subsequently replaced on April 9, 1998, by 
a smaller AP/FA390 foghorn with a frequency of 390Hz that has a 
lower frequency and less range.  This is the horn that is 
currently operating at Cape Mudge. The AB560 foghorn was returned 
to inventory to be redeployed to another location. The cost to 
replace the foghorn with the AP/FA390 was approximately $1,400. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(d) The light station is serviced by CCG technicians on a six 
month schedule at an annual cost of $2,000 including the cost of 
labour helicopter time and travel costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of additional costs, every attempt has been made to 
correct outages at Cape Mudge by combining with other regular 
maintenance trips. No other significant costs have been incurred 
since 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Question No. 33—<B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B> 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the ethics 
counsellor, Howard Wilson, who was appointed by the Prime 
Minister On June 16, 1994: (<I>a</I>) what is the salary range for the 
position of ethics counsellor; (<I>b</I>) what are the terms and conditions 
of his employment; (<I>c</I>) when is his term of employment up for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> I am informed by the 
Privy Council Office and Industry Canada as follows: 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(a) Effective April 1, 2000, the salary range for the ethics 
counsellor is $145,000 to $170,700.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS ACT, 2000 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK184">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-22, an 
act to amend the Income Tax Act, the Income Tax Application 
Rules, certain Acts related to the Income Tax Act, the Canada 
Pension Plan, the Customs Act, the Excise Tax Act, the 
Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act and another Act 
related to the Excise Tax Act, be read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Madam 
Speaker,  before we broke for question period I was detailing 
some of the difficulties our population was facing because of the 
type of budgetary processes we have had over the last number of 
years while this government has been in power.  I was explaining 
how the financial positions of a number of Canadian families have 
altered to a significantly lower level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to address the question of wealth.  I will cite 
only one statistic.  In 1999 the top 10% of Canadian families had 
a medium net worth of $703,500.  The lowest 10% had a negative 
net worth of approximately minus $2,010.  The top 10% are wealthy 
and the bottom 10% are in a negative position.  That is the type 
of society that has been created by these types of budgetary 
processes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would like to address concerns the capital 
gains break that the government has given mostly to the wealthy. 
The tax rate on capital gains had been set at 75%.  The bill 
would reduce that to 66.7%, which is a substantial reduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that as the bill was working its way 
through the process, there was other work going on as well.  Neil 
Brooks, a tax expert, was making a compelling case against the 
capital gains tax break in the Senate committee.  He pointed out 
the impact this capital gains tax break had on substantial 
wealth.  He made the argument that it violated the fundamental 
tax principle, which is that taxpayers with the same ability to 
pay should pay the same regardless of their income sources.  He 
went on to point out that its impact encouraged speculation not 
just in the stock market but in real estate, commodity futures 
and collectibles.  We have seen some of the negative consequences 
of that type of speculation, especially in the stock market in 
the last six to twelve months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Professor Brooks made another point, which was a bit more subtle 
but still important.  As we encourage the type of investment that 
results in capital gains, it takes away from other areas of the 
market and the economy.  He said that this provided incentives 
for the conversion of dividends and even labour income into 
capital gains as opposed to allowing those to continue, and the 
benefit that it would give to the economy generally.  His final 
point was that it also complicated the tax system and actually 
reduced tax revenue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to appreciate the size of the gain.  In 1996 
taxpayers with incomes of more than $250,000 a year reported 
average capital gains of $74,000.  That was almost 500 times the 
average capital gain of $150 reported by taxpayers earning 
between $20,000 and $40,000. 
That is the kind of system the bill would encourage and continue.

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard from some of the other speakers today that over the 
next five years the bill would reduce taxes by $100 billion.  Of 
course the government takes great credit for this.  I would like 
to go back and look at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the simple basis of fairness, does it make sense to be doing 
this?  Do those tax breaks do anything at all to reduce the 
inequality that I mentioned earlier in my address?  The answer is 
no, it does not.  In fact it perpetuates and increases the 
inequality between that lower 10% or 20% of the families in 
Canada and the upper 10% and 20% of the families in Canada.  It 
will follow an American model that is even worse than what we 
have now, but toward which we are very rapidly going.  This will 
result in the same type of inequalities from which that country 
suffers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I would make about the $100 billion is that it 
just cries out, as I made the point earlier, of the hypocrisy of 
the government supporting the motion we had on safe water earlier 
this week, then not spending it on an infrastructure program that 
was at all meaningful in terms of treating our water and our 
sewage, thereby creating a safe water system for all of Canada. 
This government level is the only one that has the ability, in 
terms of revenue, to deal with the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, it is not as though it can claim any ignorance 
of the need for these funds.  I have already mentioned that the 
Canadian Federation of Municipalities had a figure out there for 
some time of $16.5 billion that would be needed over the next 10 
years.  I mentioned earlier that CMHC, Canada Mortgage and 
Housing Corporation, had a study three years ago that set out the 
need for $4 billion a year in infrastructure over the next 15 
years to deal with the water problem and crisis and to provide 
the country with safe water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow the government missed those two studies, those figures 
and that information.  We had Walkerton and that was before the 
bill was introduced.  We saw the tragedy in that community as a 
result of an unsafe water system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, it is a bill that obviously my party cannot 
support and is one that we will vote against for all the reasons 
that I mentioned today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to address this important legislation, but I want to say 
from the outset that my party will oppose Bill C-22. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why? Because of the lack of concrete measures that would serve 
the public interest, particularly low and middle income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss the tax cuts that were mentioned in the last 
federal budget and that will now become reality with Bill C-22. 
These tax cuts by the Minister of Finance are great for very 
high income earners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at measures such as lower tax rates or the new tax 
rate on capital gains, we realize that those who will benefit 
the most from the Minister of Finance's budget and tax cuts are 
the people who earn at least $250,000. The Minister of Finance 
targeted these people first and foremost. As of this year, this 
group will save about $19,000 in taxes. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1235"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT32"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT32"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1235
<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, we are shocked to see how minimal the tax cuts and 
savings for low and middle income families are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Taking the example of a single parent with one dependent child 
and an income of $30,000, this person will have a tax saving of 
$750 and will continue to pay taxes. 
Is it normal for a single parent family, with a single 
wage-earner and one child to earn $30,000 and still pay some 
$1,545 in income tax, even after a tax cut?  Is this normal for 
a family that has to live on $30,000?  That is the cut-off figure 
for the poverty line, according to Statistics Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it normal for the federal government to continue to 
impoverish this family still further, even with the tax cuts, by 
making it pay an average of $1,500 in federal income tax?  No, 
it is not.  A single parent with one child and an income of 
$30,000 ought not to be paying any federal income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the way it is in Quebec.  For some time now the 
Government of Quebec has been revising its tax categories. 
It has revised the marginal tax rates with the following result: 
a family of two adults and two children with an annual income of 
$47,000 will pay hardly any tax.  How is it that a family with 
one child and one wage earner is still in the situation of 
having to pay more than $1,500 in tax? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can already hear the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Finance replying “That is wrong, it makes no sense”.  I have 
news for him.  It is wrong to say that it makes no sense.  He 
should save his breath.  People have just finished filing their 
income tax and they have it fresh in their memories that, once 
again this year, they have paid federal tax even though they are 
in the low income category. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the tax cuts for low and middle income families, 
we see that the tax savings this year, for example, will be no 
more than $300 or $350.  That is for this year, because these 
tax cuts are being phased in between now and 2004; that is about 
the average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the high income earners get great breaks.  As I mentioned 
earlier, on average, those earning $250,000 and up will save 
$19,000 this year.  There is a double standard here.  The 
government has also forgotten that it is low and middle income 
earners who have brought down the deficit since 1993, who have 
contributed to the huge surpluses, and we will come back to this 
later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Middle income families are the federal government's cash cow. 
They are the source of most of the money collected in income 
taxes. The government should have been a bit more sensitive when 
it came to this category of revenue.  These families should have 
been given a few more credits for having played such a major role 
in helping put the fiscal house in order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It can never be said often enough that all the cuts made by this 
government since 1994, such as in the Canada social transfer for 
funding health, education and social assistance, have taken 
their toll on these families.  These are the people really 
responsible for putting the fiscal house in order and generating 
surpluses.  They are still doing it today.  It must never be 
forgotten that every year the Liberals greedily help themselves 
to the surpluses accumulating in the EI fund because of the 
premiums paid by workers and employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not right that barely 40% of unemployed workers qualify 
for EI benefits.  It is not right.  The system is too 
restrictive.  It excludes too many people who should normally 
have been entitled to EI benefits, since everyone pays into the 
plan now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something wrong when these people are being hung to dry 
by the last budget, actually the last two budgets, and asked to 
help with fiscal consolidation through their contributions. The 
government does not have to worry any more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everything left in the employment insurance fund, once it has 
paid benefits to only 40% of the unemployed, the rest, that is 
60%, goes into the consolidated revenue fund. It is added to 
general revenues, therefore contributing to fiscal consolidation 
and general surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is it that these people could not benefit from true 
employment insurance reform; a real reform, not a “reformette”, 
a true reform of the employment insurance plan using most of the 
accumulated surplus to really help the unemployed instead of 
excluding 60% of them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have instead is tax relief especially for millionaires, 
probably those who contribute the most to the Liberal Party 
coffers. We have unemployed workers who are excluded from the 
employment insurance plan. Low income single parent families 
with one child, making $30,000, are still paying $1,500 in 
federal income tax. It is despicable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there a justice in this country? Are we eventually going to 
do something for these people or are we going to shamelessly 
forge ahead with the same budgetary policy we have being 
following so far? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for social housing, why was there nothing in the past two 
budgets, that is, those of February and October 2000, the 
October mini budget geared to the election, of the Prime Minister 
in waiting.  He has long been in waiting, but he is still 
hoping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it they failed to consider social housing?  It is an 
important issue that probably affects the single parent family, 
with one dependant and an income of $30,000 or less, which I 
cited as an example earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that this family is being put off once again?  Why is 
not one cent provided for social housing?  Is this a matter of 
no importance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And yet, when we look at the statistics, the number of people 
spending over 50% of their income on housing has increased 
alarmingly, especially since the start of the 1990s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the moment, if we look at the statistics, there are 833,000 
households—nearly a million households—that should be offered 
social housing, because they spend over 50% of their income on 
housing.  That means that the other 50% is left for all the 
rest: food, electricity, telephone, clothing the children, child 
care and heating in winter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we think of the scandalous profits of the oil companies, 
which have raised prices significantly in the past two years, we 
could say there is collusion—let us not beat about the bush—in the 
oil industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They get together and raise prices at the same time.  This is 
what the major oil companies do, and the government does nothing 
about it. 
Who is hit by the oil crisis, a crisis created by the big oil 
companies through collusion? Again, it is the poor, it is those 
who, after spending 50% of their income on rent, must spend part 
of the other 50% on heating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given such glaring needs, why did the federal government not 
think for one second of including new money for social housing 
in its budget? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government had continued to spend proportionally the same 
amount on social housing that it did before 1994, if it had 
maintained these expenditures since 1994, there would be 30,000 
additional social housing units in Quebec alone. The government 
should have invested $3.5 billion in social housing since 1994, 
but it did not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot believe that, with surpluses coming out of his 
ears—even with the downturn—the Minister of Finance is not 
ashamed when he gets up in the morning and looks at himself in 
the mirror, because he did not show any consideration for the 
poor, who are not the main beneficiaries of his tax cuts and of 
all the measures implemented by the government since 1993.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I can hardly believe that. 
Why did he not also consider—after talking about it for so 
long—the possibility of transferring $500 million from the 
employment insurance fund to Quebec, to set up a true parental 
leave program? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, they are putting the $6 billion surplus 
in their pockets to increase the surplus and to promote the 
image of the Prime Minister in waiting, that is the current 
Minister of Finance. Why have these people, who claim to be 
civilized, who claim to support social justice, not think of 
transferring, as provided under section 69 of the Employment 
Insurance Act, the $500 million that is required to set up a 
parental leave program in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of this and because of them—and they are not in the least 
ashamed—the introduction of this plan has been put off until 
2003.  How is it that they are making young couples postpone 
having children?  Are children not important to this government? 
Why will it not agree to transfer to Quebec the amount allowed 
under the Employment Insurance Act?  Is it because Quebec is 
asking?  Do they have it in for young families in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sometimes hard to understand, to keep one's cool, in the 
face of such deceit, such an obstinate refusal, such incredible 
closed-mindedness, when by rights we should have had a parental 
leave plan in Quebec in 2001 or 2002, thus helping not just 
young parents working for businesses or the government, but also 
those who are self-employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the federal plan, the Quebec parental leave plan pays 
benefits to self-employed workers and takes the reality of the 
labour market into account.  Not only are we still dealing with 
dinosaurs when it comes to a single currency, but also when it 
comes to parental leave.  They are incapable of adapting to the 
labour market and keeping the public interest in mind. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that not only does federal parental leave not 
cover self-employed workers, but the eligibility criteria for 
this leave are the same as for employment insurance.  This means 
that most people are excluded right off the bat.  That is the 
situation right now.  A little over 40% of unemployed workers 
qualify for EI benefits; if these are the same criteria used for 
the federal parental leave policy, quite a few people besides 
self-employed workers will not qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec no one is excluded, not the self-employed, not the 
parents who wish to take advantage of our parental leave 
program.  It is a far superior program.  Because of the 
obstinate refusal of this government, however, young parents 
cannot take advantage of such a program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can it be that there has been no thought given, with 
billions of dollars in surplus again this year, to indexing the 
social transfers to the provinces, for health and education in 
particular?  How can it be that, seeing what is going on in the 
hospitals, with the lack of funds and increasing demand, no 
thought is being given to putting more into transfer payments 
for health and education? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They say “But we must be prudent.  The surplus is not all that 
big”.  This is false. Contrary to the Minister of Finance's 
forecast in last year's budget, the surplus will not be $4 
billion—insignificant, even taking into account the tax cuts in 
the October mini budget—but rather in excess of $17 billion, or 
four times his predicted figure.  When it comes down to it, the 
Minister of Finance's sole plan was to use figures that have 
nothing in common with reality for petty political gain.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what he has done ever since he has been Minister of 
Finance.  When there was a federal government deficit, he 
inflated the deficit figure, telling people “Look out, we need 
to be careful, because we do not have all the manoeuvrability we 
need, and the battle is far from over”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He even told the members of his own party “We need to be 
careful”.  But there is always a limit to prudence.  We are all 
in favour of being careful, of having a contingency fund, but we 
are not in favour of lying to the population by not giving the 
real figures and by avoiding any debate on how to use the surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When he forecasts a $4 billion surplus and that in reality the 
surplus is $17 billion, the $13 billion that was not forecast is 
used directly to pay down the debt. He avoids any debate and 
puts everything on the debt. There is no democratic debate, no 
transparency. This is hypocrisy, big time, and he wants us to 
swallow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a bet with a reporter. Did he know what the Finance 
Minister will say next week in his economic statement? He will 
say “There is no unanimity among economists; some say that 
things may go well, others that they may go wrong”. One of his 
former assistants, Mr. Drummond, who has been Assistant Deputy 
Minister of Finance and who is now the chief economist at the 
Toronto Dominion Bank, said “We have to be careful. 
We could come back to deficits in three years”, and he knows 
what he is talking about. Having been an assistant to the 
Minister of Finance for several years, Mr. Drummond cannot go 
wrong that easily and talk nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance is setting the stage for next week by 
saying “Surpluses will not be as high next year. The economy is 
slowing down, we could go into a recession, find ourselves in 
the red. We may not necessarily be headed toward a deficit, but 
we still have to be careful. Since there is no unanimity among 
economists, I prefer to draw a line down the middle and say that 
surpluses will not be as high”. In other words, he is still going 
to tell us nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is setting the stage. Some economists are optimistic. 
Yesterday, Thomas Wilson, a well known forecaster, forecast a 
surplus of $14 billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2001. 
He is a bit closer to reality. Our own figure is $17 billion. 
Even with last October's tax cuts and the new spending for Genome 
Canada, we still come up with $17 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Next week, the Minister of Finance will tell us we have to be 
careful. That is a lie. It is hard to believe how much the 
public has been fooled since this man has become the Minister of 
Finance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so much so that the economic statement exercise is losing its 
credibility, according to several analysts, particularly 
Mr. Piché, of <I>La Presse</I>, because the figures we are given are 
false. They are just not the right figures. We cannot rely on 
them to tell whether government management is good or bad. Does 
it follow certain priorities in its management, or does it take 
into account the interest of the population? 
There is no way for us to know, because we do not have the right 
figures. We have to find them for ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last fiscal year ending on March 31, we have a surplus 
of at least $17 billion. For each of the last five years, I have 
tried to lower the figures because of an economic downturn, but 
I cannot see the day when we will have a deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government could have done a lot of things with this money. 
It chose to side with the millionaires and not with the 
population. For all these reasons, we are going to vote against 
the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give two small examples, if I may. For a two-earner family 
of four with a combined income of $60,000, in less than four 
years, taxes will be reduced by 34%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is another example. For a family with two children and a 
single income of $40,000 a year, the reduction will be 59% 
within four years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member also talked about affordable housing.  In our 
election platform the government committed to working with the 
provinces to deliver affordable housing programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday in committee the member talked about his lap top 
computer and its modelling capabilities.  Has he made the same 
errors on his income tax calculations as he did with his economic 
projections? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, as usual the Finance minister's 
assistant is talking through his hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any confusion is coming from his side. It will not be easy to 
fool those who just completed their income tax returns. 
Canadians know very well that a lone parent family with one 
dependant and an income of $30,000 a year is still paying a lot 
of income taxes to the federal government and that the federal 
income tax impoverishes this family already living below the 
poverty line. He will not fool those people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he thinks that Canadians are all stupid, he should think 
again, especially since the income tax period only just ended. 
Canadians just filed their income tax returns. They cannot be 
fooled because they know what they paid in income tax. That is 
the first thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second thing is that, talking about these great tax 
reductions, he said—he was honest enough to say so—“within four 
years”, not right now. The surplus is there. Does anyone know 
how much has accumulated in the federal government's coffers in 
the first 11 months of the last fiscal year? Twenty billion 
dollars, and the Minister of Finance is committed to put 
$15 billion into the debt payment. He is forgetting the other 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fine to pay off the debt, we are all for that. But to put 
all the money in there, while there are huge needs in the health 
sector and in the fight against poverty, I cannot take this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is having discussions with the provinces about social 
housing. Let us look at that. Do people know what the government 
wants to do? It wants to leave the old stock of social housing 
to the provinces, with maintenance costs, but not one cent for 
investing in social housing. It is easy to pass the buck that 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The forecasting errors—I did not want to raise them, but he did. 
Do people know for how long the Bloc Quebecois, with a small 
team of two or three people and a small portable computer, has 
been doing the estimates, the forecasts for the deficit and the 
surplus? Since 1995. Do people know what the margin of error in 
our forecasts has been from year to year? Three per cent, a 
normal forecasting error. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What kind of error margins did the Minister of Finance and the 
Liberal representative who just spoke have in their forecasts? 
Between 130% and 400% recently, a 3% margin of error in our 
forecasts as opposed to between 130% and 400%. Where is the 
confusion? Where is the inability to forecast the surplus, or 
rather, the deliberate way of hiding the truth, the real numbers, 
from the population? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not come from the Bloc Quebecois. It comes from the 
government. 
So, before telling us what to do and saying any odd thing to the 
population, who knows how much taxes it is paying to the federal 
government, I would urge my colleague to reflect further.

utilize to describe that pre-election document of the Liberal 
Party of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments to the Income Tax Act represent a collection of 
baby steps.  Some are in the right direction.  Some simply 
represent a further complication of an already far too 
complicated tax code.  Most represent the triumph of politics 
over public policy.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the general direction of these tax measures, we 
will find there is no general direction.  In fact most of them 
have resulted from a flimsily put together pre-election document. 
The document is referred to as the mini budget and reflects a 
mini vision of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These baby steps and tinkerings do not reflect what Canadians 
truly need in an overall and significant broad based tax reform. 
Tax reform can be used as a vehicle to create greater levels of 
economic growth and opportunity.  Instead of making tax tinkering 
part of a pre-election policy, we should seize the tremendous 
opportunity we have now with the budget surpluses to bring taxes 
down, but use tax reform and tax reduction in lockstep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Typically with tax reform we always create winners and losers. 
However, if we implement tax reform and tax reduction 
simultaneously in lockstep, we can ensure that there are no 
losers created by significant tax reform.  All Canadians then 
would be winners as we create a more competitive and less 
distortionary Canadian economy which is poised and positioned for 
significant growth and opportunity, particularly in new economic 
endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen in recent years our competitiveness with our 
trading partners suffer.  We have seen other countries like 
Ireland leapfrog over Canada and seize opportunities to grow and 
prosper while Canada languishes.  Ireland had a 92% growth in GDP 
per capita over a 10 year period.  During the same 10 year period 
Canada had a 5% growth in its GDP per capita.  This is pretty 
anemic when we consider the extraordinary growth in Ireland, a 
country once referred to as an economic basket case.  Now it is 
referred to as an economic lion.  Ireland did that by utilizing 
significant tax reform, particularly focused on a reduction of 
capital and corporate income taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my hon. colleagues opposite constructively offered her 
views on this.  I appreciate her views, as someone with a 
profound understanding from her family perspective of Ireland, 
and I agree with her.  Ireland's commitment to education over the 
last 20 years to 30 years has strongly helped position Ireland. 
That being the case, Canada has by and large with its provincial 
and federal governments over time made significant commitments to 
education, so I would argue that that part of the equation has 
been done quite well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could improve our commitment to education, as could any 
country.  It could be argued that Ireland could improve its 
commitment.  The greatest difference between the two environments 
at this point is not in their commitment to education, it is 
their commitment to tax reform as a lever to create greater 
levels of economic growth and opportunity.  That is the part we 
have to address, and I am certain she would agree with me on that 
front as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the government's record on economic issues since 
1993 and how international confidence has been demonstrated in 
the government's record since 1993, there is no better gauge by 
which to judge the government than the performance of the 
Canadian dollar.  We have seen under this government a loss in 
the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar of about 11 
cents. The dollar reflects the shareholder value of Canada has 
seen a significant decline under the government.  Under the 
previous government there was a one cent decline over a period of 
nine years.  This government has achieved an 11 cent decline in a 
period of about eight years.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every time our dollar goes down it is effectively a pay cut for 
every Canadian.  We depend on the U.S. to such a significant 
amount as our trading partners.  From a consumer perspective, 
given the degree to which Canadian consumers buy from U.S. 
companies, it significantly reduces over a period of time their 
disposable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also has a very negative impact on productivity.  Canadian 
companies in the short term do not necessarily see the need to 
make productivity enhancement a priority if they can hide under 
this low dollar policy of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The low dollar also damages productivity in the long term. 
Companies that purchase productivity enhancing equipment or 
technological advancement software, et cetera from the U.S. are 
less inclined to do so if the dollar is low.  As a result it 
becomes a self-perpetuating prophecy that in fact the low dollar 
creates in the long term lower levels of productivity by actually 
reducing incentives for companies to do the right thing and build 
their productive capacity in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In general, what is particularly disturbing about the state of 
the Canadian dollar is that the Bank of Canada has in recent 
years pursued a high dollar policy, yet Canadians are suffering 
as under this low dollar result.  The Bank of Canada under its 
policies has targeted inflation rates in Canada of about a point 
lower than those which are considered acceptable by the federal 
reserve in the U.S.  Despite this high dollar policy, we are 
getting this low dollar result.  We have to carefully analyze and 
respond to the fiscal inadequacies of the fiscal framework in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government describes having a balanced approach.  The fact 
is a balanced approach is not the appropriate approach if we have 
significant inherent imbalances in the economic framework, and we 
do have some significant imbalances.  Some are with taxation, not 
only in terms of overall levels of taxation but particular types 
of taxation which in and of themselves have the most negative 
impact on economic growth.  Unfortunately, some of the taxes 
which are most politically palatable to reduce are ones that will 
probably have some of the smaller impacts on economic growth and 
opportunity.  Some of the tax reductions which would spur the 
greatest level of economic growth are those that sometimes are 
less popular politically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the short term, and particularly after an election, the 
government should take some risks and tackle some of the major 
issues and addressing tax reform and the reduction of some of 
Canada's most productivity damaging taxes.  I will speak about a 
couple of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is our dependence on capital taxes in Canada.  Capital taxes 
reduce investments and the incentives for Canadians and people 
outside of Canada to invest in the country.  If we look at any 
study on productivity, there is a strong correlation between 
productivity and investment.  If we tax capital and investment to 
the degree we do in Canada, that will have a significant negative 
impact on productivity enhancement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made some reduction in capital gains taxes. 
The government says that the effective rates of capital gains 
taxes are lower than in the U.S.  That is not the case.  We are 
still higher in Canada than in the U.S.  However, the most 
important thing to recognize is the missed opportunity of the 
government to eliminate personal capital gains taxes.  In this 
one instance we would be ahead of the U.S. in a very critical 
area of the economy, that of taxing capital gains and encouraging 
investment as opposed to discouraging investment innovation.

reasons, the same reasons why the Liberal opposition fought 
vociferously against the GST.  It was a case of politics then and 
it is a case of politics now.  That is why it is not moving more 
aggressively to address capital taxes in Canada, specifically 
capital gains taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am focusing my comments today on tax reform, but we also need 
to see a greater commitment to debt reduction which in time would 
strengthen the Canadian dollar through fiscal policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, we are asking the Bank of Canada with one blunt 
instrument, the interest rate, to try to strengthen the Canadian 
dollar.  We are ignoring in many cases the fiscal policy issues 
that could be addressed by the government, but it refuses to talk 
about the dollar.  It also refuses to talk about some of the 
concrete measures it could take through fiscal policy to address 
the dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could also utilize tax reform in lockstep with equalization 
and other policies as part of our economic development strategy. 
I mentioned earlier the tremendous success that Ireland has 
enjoyed over the last 12 years.  Some would say that comparing 
Ireland to Canada is not the best possible comparison because of 
the degree to which Ireland received EU transfers in order to 
allow it to invest so significantly in tax reduction.  That 
argument is not necessarily a bad one.  However if we want to 
look at the best possible comparison, we could compare Atlantic 
Canada today to Ireland 10 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a hodgepodge of economic development policies and 
agencies such as ACOA for Atlantic Canada.  We also have our 
equalization policy which is the only constitutionally enshrined 
spending program of the government.  I would suggest we should 
develop a tax policy in consideration of some of our economic 
development strategies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Atlantic Canada for example, the total budget for ACOA is a 
little more than the total amount of federal corporate taxes paid 
in Atlantic Canada.  If we were to try to think in a more 
imaginative and visionary way about this, we could see the 
possibility exists with some assistance to eliminate federal 
corporate taxes in that region of the country to spur economic 
growth and opportunity.  Quite possibly this could have a greater 
level of impact on economic growth than would result from the 
activities of ACOA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that ACOA has not had a positive impact in some 
areas.  My personal belief is that in many ways it was probably a 
more appropriate instrument in the old economy than it is in the 
new economy.  In the new economy tax measures have demonstrated 
far greater traction in achieving results in targeted areas than 
have direct investments by agencies such as ACOA. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to invest in infrastructure.  If the Atlantic innovation 
fund focused on infrastructure, universities, technology transfer 
strategies and commercialization, those sort of initiatives could 
be very beneficial.  I have great concerns about government 
agencies making direct investments in individual companies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another potential role for ACOA would be for it to take part, 
through the Atlantic innovation fund, in syndicated investment. 
Effectively the participation of ACOA would not be as an 
individual investor in a company, it would be part of a 
syndication of investors, the majority of which would be private 
sector investors.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That could help by reducing overall risk and encouraging private 
sector investment in particular geographic and sectoral areas, so 
that is a potential role.  However, we need to get far more 
creative about how we encourage tax reform as a vehicle for 
economic growth.  We must also consider other public policy 
priorities, such as economic development, and work more 
creatively in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a technical issue, Bill C-22 would allow tax deferred 
rollover treatment for Canadians who hold shares of foreign 
corporations that have been subsidiaries to the parent 
shareholders.  Some companies do not qualify because the bill 
would require distributing corporations to have their shares 
listed and actively traded on a stock exchange.  That is 
inherently unfair.  It is my understanding from the Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Finance that the issue will be 
addressed in future amendments and legislation.  I would be 
supportive of that and would encourage the anomaly to be 
addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of general tax reform, the government would do well to 
dust off the Mintz report on corporate taxation and implement its 
recommendations without significant amendment.  That would go a 
long way to improving competitiveness and reducing the 
distortionary nature of our tax code. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must move aggressively not just to reduce taxes in totality 
but to reduce those which have the most negative impact on 
economic growth and opportunity.  Jack Mintz, in his report to 
the Minister of Finance, went a long way toward doing that. 
However the report has collected a lot of dust and has not 
garnered the respect it deserves.  The significant changes that 
should have followed the report never occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To compare the way the current Liberal government deals with the 
erudite reports of great Canadians like Jack Mintz to the way the 
Mulroney government dealt with such reports, we need only look at 
the great report of Donald MacDonald on free trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Donald MacDonald had been a Liberal cabinet minister yet the 
Mulroney government recognized the inherent benefits of following 
the recommendations of the MacDonald commission.  The Mulroney 
government pursued a controversial free trade policy, fought an 
election on it and did what was at the time relatively unpopular. 
In the 1988 election over half of Canadians voted against free 
trade yet the Mulroney government had the courage, vision, 
foresight and wisdom to pursue innovative policies and do what 
was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I hope to see from the current government.  I hope 
it has the courage, vision and foresight to pursue an aggressive 
policy of innovative tax reform and thereby create greater 
economic growth and opportunity for all Canadians.

Speaker, I listened with intrigue to the member's speech.  He is 
a fellow member of the finance committee.  When members of the 
finance committee listen to witnesses and debate among themselves 
a lot of interesting ideas come out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During his speech the member made a passing reference to ACOA. 
ACOA has been used by various governments as a means of currying 
political favour come election time.  However its long term 
economic benefit to Atlantic Canada has been much less than 
advertised.  The member said the same thing and indicated that a 
good system of tax breaks would be of much greater benefit.  I 
think along those lines as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the hon. member enlarge a bit on the role of ACOA?  What 
vision might he have for bolstering, or setting free the economy 
of Atlantic Canada? Would he be kind enough to respond? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison:</B>  Madam Speaker, the hon. member for Elk 
Island keeps us all on our toes periodically, in this place as 
well as in the finance committee, and I appreciate his question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>ACOA has often played an important role in Atlantic Canada, even 
into the mid-1990s, by investing where no private sector venture 
capital players were doing so.  Some of the technology companies 
that have since developed and emerged would not be there today 
had it not been for government investment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment has since changed.  I am aware of four active 
venture capital firms that are investing directly in Atlantic 
Canada.  Investment banking activity is taking place.  Some of 
Canada's smartest money is finding opportunities in Canada's 
smartest region and I am pleased to see that development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that private sector money is being invested in Atlantic 
Canada, ACOA can perhaps act as a partner to such investment 
without necessarily making the decisions.  It could play a 
transitional role in reducing overall risk without necessarily 
controlling investment.  It could leave some of that control in 
private sector hands or, as I suggest and with which I believe 
the member concurred, the ACOA budget or part of it could be used 
to reduce corporate taxes in Atlantic Canada and thereby create 
greater economic growth and opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that ACOA played an important and 
positive role for Atlantic Canada before private money began 
finding its way to these early stage companies.  We can now be 
far more creative and innovative in terms of tax reform and 
economic development strategies.

opportunity to speak to the bill because I have a concern.  I 
will not dwell on the logistics of the bill.  I will leave it to 
my colleagues to talk about its other technical aspects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise to speak to the bill because the government claims it has 
helped Canadians by reducing taxes and listening to Canadians.  I 
see the former revenue minister sitting there.  He created the 
big super agency and decided how it would work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will point out a direct example from my constituency of how 
the government and the minister's former agency have been picking 
the pockets of ordinary Canadians.  A gentleman in my riding 
wrote me a letter and gave me permission to talk about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eric is a senior citizen on the Canada pension plan.  He is 
upset because the government is withdrawing money from his 
account without notifying him.  The gentleman lives on CPP and 
the government is taking more than 10% off his pension.  How does 
the government expect him to live if it takes more than 10% off 
his CPP? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eric admits he owes the government money.  However the 
government should have better mechanisms for collecting money 
from seniors and others who cannot afford to have their meagre 
benefits taken away by Revenue Canada.  How does the government 
expect the gentleman to live after that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning I rose in the House on an S. O. 31 to talk about a 
senior citizen who had taken $3,000 out of his retirement savings 
plan to buy a computer.  It triggered penalties and an increase 
in his income tax.  The poor senior citizen ended up losing 
interest.  The gentleman took out $3,000 and ended up paying the 
government $168. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that how we treat senior citizens?  Is that how we treat 
Canadians who work hard and save their money?  When they try to 
reap the fruits of their labour the government, with policies 
that go from left to right and top to bottom, takes money away 
from them.  It takes only a little here and there but 
cumulatively the individual loses.  The gentleman ended up paying 
the government.  Is that justice?  It shows that the left hand of 
the government does not know what the right hand is doing.  All 
Liberal members care about is how to take money from Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have permission from another senior citizen to speak about his 
income tax return.  This gentleman was mad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Dhaliwal:</B>  I hope he did it electronically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Yes, I am sure he did.  Let me tell 
the minister opposite what his government and his former 
department did. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentleman's income was $24,000 a year.  I hope members 
across the way will not tell me that $24,000 is a big sum of 
money.  Because the gentleman took money from his retirement 
savings plan Revenue Canada charged him instalment interest of 
$109.  The department charged him instalment interest on an 
income of $24,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the government expect the gentleman to live?  How is a 
gentleman earning only $24,000 expected to pay tax to Revenue 
Canada on time?  Can Revenue Canada not see that and show some 
compassion instead of charging him $109?  I have examples from 
all my—

<A NAME="LINK193">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed from April 3 consideration of the motion that 
Bill C-222, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (deduction of 
expenses incurred by a mechanic for tools required in 
employment) be read the second time and referred to a committee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to rise today to speak to this private member's 
bill introduced by my very hon. colleague, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. He is a bit of a 
visionary. He showed remarkable intelligence by putting this 
bill forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For too long this category of workers has been neglected. We 
only have to think back to the quiet revolution of the mid-1960s 
and Quebec's development in the 1970s. A similar phenomenon 
occurred in the rest of Canada. A university education was valued 
to such a point that what we used to call trade schools, today's 
training schools for specialized technicians, were neglected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must re-assert the value of specialized technicians as a trade 
in various sectors. There is a shortage of specialized 
technicians these days. In my riding we are experiencing a 
situation I never thought we would see only a few short years 
ago. We can no longer fill specialized technician positions, 
especially in mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is going to be, there already is a shortage of specialized 
technicians. 
The shortage could very well worsen with time. Recently, in June 
1999, if I remember correctly, the Canadian Automotive Repair 
and Service Council said that the biggest challenge facing the 
industry at the end of the 20th century was to attract young 
people. They were talking about mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is possible to improve the situation for automotive 
mechanic technicians, we must do so with the objective of 
attracting new recruits. We must make it easier for young people 
who decide to get training in automotive mechanics to become 
skilled technicians, because we all need them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not attract excellent skilled technicians to 
parliament, we will be prevented from doing our work correctly. 
Who never wished for a skilled automotive mechanic when his or 
her car broke down? Automotive mechanics provide an essential 
service for the smooth operation of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If, a few years down the road, we face a shortage that is worse 
than it is today, we would deeply regret our inaction. This is 
why we must make a particular effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, I congratulate my colleague from 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. It is thanks to 
this kind of initiative that we often manage to change things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not asking for much. We are only asking for fairness for 
automotive mechanics, by allowing them to claim a tax deduction 
for tools of $250 or less in value. 
For tools that cost $250 or more, we are asking that this be 
treated as a capital expenditure, which would allow these 
workers to claim a capital cost allowance on the cost of their 
tools, which are often highly sophisticated and very expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the cost of the basic tool kit for a young person 
starting out as an automobile technician is said to be between 
$3,000 and $4,000. This young technician needs this basic tool 
kit. When he is looking for a job, the first question he is 
asked by the prospective employer is “Where is your tool kit?” 
This young technician who just got out of school must pay $3,000 
to buy his tools, after having paid several thousand dollars for 
his specialized training. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A highly skilled technician, a brake specialist or a radiator 
specialist, for example, may have a basic tool kit that costs 
$3,000 to $4,000 and a special tool kit that may cost anywhere 
from $20,000 to $40,000 depending on the area of specialization. 
This is a lot of money to spend for tools that are required.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to see that, in the last parliament, my colleague 
introduced a similar bill, which was passed by a vast majority 
of members in this House. I think only 11 or 12 out of the 301 
members of the House of Commons opposed that bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is encouraging to see that it is possible to raise awareness 
among all members and to get them to set aside any partisan 
considerations in order to make tax policy decisions that will 
help the cause of a particular category of workers, namely 
automotive technicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It may seem like a minor tax bill, but its impact is just huge. 
I say that, because the only reason my colleague—and those who, 
like me and my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, support him—has 
introduced such a bill is to serve the public interest and improve 
the general well-being of the population. All bills, private 
members bills as well as government bills, should aim at serving 
the public interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such deductions may seem trivial, but they may be the incentive 
needed to bring a young person, who still does not know what to 
do in life but who is very gifted in mechanics, to choose this 
trade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need gifted mechanics. I am not a specialist of mechanics and 
I will never be, this is not my ambition. I hardly know the 
difference between an engine and a carburetor. However, I do not 
want to dwell on my shortcomings. 
My point is that a young person who has such a talent and who 
does not know yet what trade to choose could decide to become a 
mechanic if he has some hope that a tax credit or a special 
capital cost allowance on tools will make things easier for him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those who already work as mechanics and who are given the chance 
to deduct the costs of their tools will also feel relieved. We 
should not forget that automotive technicians provide an 
essential service. Without them, we might not be here this 
morning. Mechanics do not make fortunes. The average salary 
varies from $29,000 to $40,000 a year. Providing relief to 
automotive technicians, who must not only buy their equipment 
but keep it up to date, could contribute to improve their 
quality of life. That is what we are here for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The automobile industry goes through changes and 
incredible technological evolution. My colleague, the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, told me 
that every year there are incredible changes occurring in 
mechanics, namely in terms of hybrid components, that is 
electrical and fuel injection components. We must take into 
consideration the fact that technicians need to renew their 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that all members will support this bill introduced by the 
member for Beauport-Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré-Île-d'Orléans.

am very pleased to rise in the House today to speak in support of 
Bill C-222. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for having brought the bill forward in 
the last parliament and for having gained such strong support 
from all sides of the House.  The New Democratic Party supported 
the earlier bill and we will support the new version of the bill. 
In fact my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst introduced a similar 
motion in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic principle of the bill is about valuing people's work. 
We should be supportive of the work that mechanics do.  They 
should legitimately be allowed to deduct the tools of their trade 
as an expense. 
It is the principle of fairness and of recognizing the importance 
of this one type of work.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not everybody can afford an automobile but most of us do rely on 
automobiles to drive us to different locations.  However, we do 
not really value the work that goes into maintaining those 
automobiles.  Auto mechanics have a thankless task. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We like to complain about auto mechanics and the cost of 
repairs.  Sometimes people do get ripped off but we are talking 
about an area of work that is highly skilled.  Mechanics require 
an enormous amount of training and initiative in terms of keeping 
abreast of technological advances in the automobile industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from the Bloc mentioned that many auto mechanics do 
not make a lot of money.  It is not exactly the most highly paid 
and lucrative job out there.  It is very important that we look 
at this kind of work and recognize that there is a monetary 
expense involved for auto mechanics.  They do not have the 
advantage, as do some other sectors, of being able to claim the 
tools of their trade as an expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is not only about valuing people's work, it is also 
about fair taxation.  Our tax system is a crazy maze.  Most 
people feel very intimidated by a system that has become 
incredibly complex but most people understand instinctively, 
although our system is a progressive tax system, that the less 
money one earns the worst break one gets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have situations where corporate executives can write off all 
kinds of expenses that are considered to be legitimate expenses 
of business or employment.  Buying hockey tickets, fancy dinners 
or other kinds of things for entertainment are considered 
essential costs of a corporate executive of doing business and 
are recognized by our taxation system.  At the other end of the 
spectrum, when looking at the work of an auto mechanic, no such 
recognition is provided. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first elected in 1997 I received a number of letters 
from auto mechanics in east Vancouver.  We have a number of 
successful car dealerships just at the edge of my riding.  I 
received a number of letters from skilled auto mechanics 
regarding the unfairness in the tax system and the fact that they 
could not claim their tools which were to them a fair and 
legitimate expense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is a very good initiative and an good example of what a 
positive contribution private member's bills can make in the 
House.  We may not be able to solve the problems of the whole 
world but we can bring specific concerns forward for debate, seek 
the support of other members of the House and actually get them 
approved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is this a good bill but it is a good example of how we 
can cut across party lines and actually support a small but very 
reasonable initiative.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The New Democratic Party most wholeheartedly supports this 
initiative.  We believe it is important to recognize the work 
that auto mechanics do.  The small break they would get as a 
result of this bill being passed is important to those people. It 
would not change the total scheme of things.  I do not think it 
would upset any balance.  It could be seen as part of a direction 
to support the idea of fair taxation, which is taxation is based 
on ability to pay.  It is based on the idea that a tax system 
should be progressive and certainly there are major issues within 
our tax system that we can hold up as examples of great 
inequities within the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent of mine brought forward the example of a 
pensioner or someone with a very low income who is sent a 
shortened income tax form, even shorter than the regular one.  I 
think it is called a TS1A.  If a pensioner or someone on a low 
income happens to make a political contribution, as many 
pensioners do, the form itself does not actually contain the 
appropriate line for the contribution.  It has to be put 
somewhere else.  As a result anyone making a $100 contribution 
would end up getting a credit of only $17 whereas those using the 
regular tax form would get a full credit of $58. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring this forward because to me it is just another example of 
practices that have gone on within the system.  Maybe they go on 
unnoticed.  No one pays attention to them.  They are actually 
discriminatory.  They do not recognize that in the case of the 
pensioner or low income person making a political contribution, 
the person actually gets ripped off by the tax system relative to 
those of us who fill out the full length form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the motion is along those lines in terms of wanting to 
make a small change that will provide some recognition and value 
regarding the real cost of tools for this work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the member for continuing to press the matter in 
the House of Commons and for not giving up.  It is sometimes 
through these small advances that working people get a better 
break.  I would hope that all auto mechanics in Quebec, in my 
province of British Columbia and in other places in Canada would 
have the benefit of what would come from the approval of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would certainly encourage the government to actually 
translate the bill into the necessary tax system change.  I think 
most people anticipate that the bill would be approved and I 
thank the member for bringing it forward.  All of us in the New 
Democratic caucus support his initiative in the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I first acknowledge the tremendous leadership my Canadian

such as this one and the quality and calibre of representation of 
members like the member for Lakeland that bring credit to this

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the November 22, 2000, election I had the opportunity to 
speak to a number of mechanics who were very aware of this issue. 
In fact I spoke to one mechanic from Petawawa, Ontario who told 
me that he had been working on this issue for 30 years.  It was 
his wish that while it was probably too late for him to see any 
fairness on the issue, hopefully this issue could be resolved for 
his son who is looking to follow in his footsteps now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has been very disappointing in regard to this issue is how 
it so clearly demonstrates the dysfunction of parliament.  This 
is a private member's bill.  All members should be allowed to 
look at the proposal and then decide on behalf of their 
constituents whether this is an issue that they should support. 
All members should let their conscience be their guide and vote 
accordingly.  In the last election Liberal members said they 
supported this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not care about whether or not its members 
have an informed opinion about a particular piece of legislation. 
They are now being whipped into line with the silliest of 
objections.  It is a shame that members of the government party 
are muzzled in the way they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud that I am able to do something that no government 
member is allowed to do, that is, to speak freely and vote freely 
in the House of Commons.  This sad fact was also brought home 
with the decision by the Liberal Party to force its members, 
except for one or two brave souls, to vote against its election 
promise, something it received votes for as part of its election 
platform, to vote against an independent ethics counsellor. What 
a sad day for the democratic process in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that there are some conscientious members on the 
government side.  There were enough of them on the House of 
Commons finance committee before the last election to direct the 
Minister of Finance in their report, in prebudget consultations, 
and tell him to do the right thing and change the tax rules so 
that mechanics would be treated fairly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take a look at some of the government's objections. These 
objections were raised by the government in regard to 
implementing tax fairness for mechanics.  Let us be clear.  We 
are not talking about special treatment.  We are talking about 
fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government's first excuse is that mechanics make too 
much money for this write-off.  Frankly that is such a foolish 
assertion that I am astonished the government even made it.  This 
proposal is not about whether mechanics are charity cases and 
whether the government should throw them a few scraps.  This is 
about being treated fairly under the Income Tax Act and in 
relation to how others are treated as well.  It is a sad 
commentary that the Liberal Party should feel this way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government also says it is true that mechanics need 
to spend anywhere from $20,000 to $70,000 on tools, but that is a 
cost incurred over maybe 40 years.  That may be the way the 
government does equipment procurement for the military, but I 
have news for the government:  tools wear out or get lost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why some employers make it a condition of hiring that 
mechanics buy their own tools.  If mechanics do not own their own 
tools, some owners have found, the tools disappear.  They get 
left on vehicles or misplaced.  It just happens.  I am not 
talking about theft because I do not believe that to be a problem 
whatsoever.  Tools get misplaced around the home as well.  The 
issue is that mechanics must have their own tools as a condition 
of employment.  Others such as shop owners can write off the cost 
of their tools.  The issue here is tax fairness.

an issue of tax fairness.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, it is with 
great pleasure that I rise to speak to the bill presented by my 
colleague from Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans, a 
bill that is being presented for the second time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out his determination—I would even say his 
endurance and pride—in coming back once more before the House 
with a bill that will make things much easier for those who work 
as mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this is a votable bill. As we all know, my colleague 
presented the same bill in the last parliament, and 213 members 
voted in favour of the bill. 
That says a lot, when you think that there are 301 members in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, we hope to have the same kind of support for this bill, 
which is really forward looking in this field, and I want to 
insist on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of the bill is to allow mechanics to deduct the cost 
of providing tools for their employment. In the last 15 years, 
members from almost all parties have introduced private member's 
bills to ensure that mechanics could deduct the cost of their 
tools. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important here to consider that—I am going to speak a 
little about the past—when we began even a few years ago to 
encourage all our young people to go to university, as my 
colleague mentioned earlier in his speech, we neglected the 
vocational sector to some degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was looking earlier at the statistics in my own riding.  I 
have 1,300 mechanics working in the Laurentides riding.  That is 
not insignificant.  A look at the work of mechanics reveals it 
to be fairly hard work, physically difficult and requiring a lot 
of energy and good health.  It is not the sort of job a person 
can continue doing to age 70.  It is the sort of job people 
retire early from, at age 50 or 55, because it requires an 
enormous amount of physical energy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These people will therefore expend their energy differently and 
much more physically than we parliamentarians here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an absolutely vital trade.  We could never do without 
mechanics.  Madam Speaker, if you had a flat on the highway, or 
if I did, I can tell you I would be very happy to see a mechanic 
coming to help.  Even changing a spare is not something all the 
members of the House could do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important trade, for which I have very great 
respect. 
As I was saying, in another decade, everyone went to university. 
Now we are realizing we have a shortage, especially in areas 
such as mechanics. Young people get specialized training in 
schools and colleges. They pay a lot for that, and when they 
enter the labour market, most private places they go to work 
for, either garages or institutions, ask then “Listen, do you 
have your tool chest?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But a tool chest costs a lot of money. It does not cost hundreds 
of thousands of dollars, but it still costs several thousands. 
To work in a garage or a service station, these young people 
need a solid background, and the necessary tools right from the 
start. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sure enough, if we compare with Bombardier, it will supply tools 
to its workers. Bombardier is specialized in this area. But if 
you take an independent worker, who works in a small garage in a 
village or in a local garage, as much as possible he must 
provide his own basic tools. 
It is like a hairdresser; she needs her tools to work and she 
provides them. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1400"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT49"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT49"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1400

<A HREF="#LINKT48"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So he is considered to be a sort of self-employed worker.  These 
young people are barely into their twenties when they enter the 
labour market, and they are penalized, often on top of having to 
pay back their tuition, costs of special training, because they 
must go into debt just as they are hitting adulthood in order to 
pay for tools.  I think that this is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see that the federal government is racking up surpluses 
on the backs of unemployed workers—we are talking about a 
whopping $38 billion—when we see that it has so much money and 
that it is not able to help young people get a start in life, 
that is unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill would correct this situation.  It would be an 
excellent beginning for the government.  It could stop resorting 
to parables and show us once and for all that it truly intends 
to help young people enter the labour market. It could innovate 
even further because, in other trades, such as plumbing or 
electrical, in all these fields, it could eventually do almost 
the same thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 1,300 mechanics in my riding of Laurentides.  We 
should be able to encourage these people from the beginning;  we 
are not asking for the moon and the stars. 
There are 115,000 mechanics in this country who invest an 
average of between $15,000 and $40,000 each for their tools and 
equipment.  Their average pay is not all that much; according to 
some, they earn an average of $29,000 annually.  With $29,000, 
if a mechanic has to buy a set of tools worth between $15,000 and 
$40,000, I can tell the House that it will take a mechanic many years to pay 
for them;  this is a form of mortgage for these people and a 
mortgage takes 20 years to pay off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have the means, the capacity and the cash to help 
them get a start in life.  We keep hearing in committee that 
young people are important, that women are important, that 
everything possible is going to be done to help them, so perhaps 
it is high time the Liberal government made good on its desire 
to do good deeds.  We are still hearing talk in the human 
resources development committee about loans and scholarships, 
but that is not what is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is needed is something tangible.  We need the government to 
take prompt action in matters such as this.  We need a majority 
vote here in this House.  The Minister of Finance has the fiscal 
capacity to accommodate it.  It can be calculated, very rapidly 
even.  We need a gesture of good will from this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that I totally support my colleague for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans and sincerely hope 
we can have as good a vote as we did during the last parliament, 
that our colleagues will be informed on the issue and will also 
speak on it.  They are, of course, welcome to add their comments 
on Bill C-222. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would be very pleased to finally see a tax policy that will 
help trades people, who often have not had the opportunity to 
attend university but who work very hard at what they do, who do 
marvellous work and for whom we have enormous respect.  These 
people absolutely deserve to have help getting off to a good 
start in life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today in the House, the government has an opportunity to provide

policies so that our young people can get off to a real start 
toward a better life.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I am honoured to stand in this place to speak in defence 
of those who perform the mechanical repairs on our vehicles. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue has been ongoing for many years in parliament, 
certainly all the years I have been here.  I am up to the 
challenge today of persuading 172 Liberals to vote in favour of 
the private member's bill.  I hope I can convince at least half 
of them.  As for the others, I do not care if they vote against 
it.  If I can get half the Liberals to support the bill then 
finally the injustice would be stopped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What injustice are we talking about?  I am speaking about the 
fact that a taxation principle is being unfairly applied when it 
comes to the tools used by mechanics.  The general tax principle 
is that people can deduct from income money that is expended in 
earning an income.  For example, if a farmer requires a tool in 
order to do the work of earning an income on the farm, the cost 
of that tool is a deductible expense when it comes to filing 
income tax.  In other words, they can buy a tool that they need 
without having to pay income tax on the money earned to purchase 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other professions where this applies.  When I 
walk down the mall in some of my communities I see a doctor's 
office with a sign that says professional corporation.  That 
designation is so that the doctor can deduct the cost of the 
expense of the equipment which he or she needs to earn income. 
Lawyers deduct the cost of all tools they need to do their jobs. 
Accountants register themselves as professional corporations 
thereby being able to claim all the expenses of earning an income 
and avoiding income tax on that portion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Almost everyone can deduct from income money that is spent to 
earn income, either instantaneously as an expense or through some 
form of depreciation.  While we are talking about a straight 
deductibility for mechanics, the government may also want to look 
at providing a system of capital cost allowances.  Costs could be 
depreciated year by year until the value has been totally written 
off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember a real estate acquaintance of mine who took an old 
used door that he had in his basement and put it on top of two 
milk cartons, set a chair in front of it and called it a desk. He 
was able to deduct from income tax the proportional cost of his 
house as he worked as a real estate agent.  He was able to deduct 
a presumed cost that he had in earning his income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it is an explicit requirement that a mechanic have tools to 
do his or her job to earn income, why is it that the government 
and all governments before have discriminated against mechanics 
by not allowing them to either deduct from income the cost of 
their tools or to depreciate them on an ongoing capital cost 
allowance basis?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is blatant unfairness and it needs to be corrected.  That 
is why I am so passionately pleading with 172 Liberals and other 
members of the opposition to vote in favour of the bill.  The 
bill, in one form or another, has been in front of every 
parliament since I came here and the government has scuttled it 
every time by letting it go on and on until finally there was a 
prorogation of the House and the bill was dropped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know quite a bit about the use of tools.  I used to do all my 
own mechanical work.  The very first car I owned was a 1959 
Meteor, a fantastic gift from my parents.  It was my primary 
vehicle for 25 years and I drove it every day.  I always said 
that I would drive it to the moon, and the mileage on it when it 
finally cratered was just 5,000 miles short of having driven the 
equivalent distance from the earth to the moon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason I did my own mechanical work was that I was not a 
very rich kid.  My dad's friend gave me a grease gun so I did my 
own grease jobs. I bought oil in bulk and did my own oil changes. 
When something needed fixing and I did not have the tool, I went 
to the store and bought it so I would have it the next time. In 
one of my vehicles I had the major task of replacing the bearings 
in the differential.  I borrowed a gauge for the very precise 
measurement of spaces that was required for that job.  I bought 
an expensive Craftsman tool at Sears so I could take it apart.  I 
still have the socket even if I only used it once. I do not claim 
to have the right to deduct it from my income. However, one thing 
I did learn was that accumulating tools was a very costly thing 
and all I had were the basic tools.  I could not afford a winch 
so when I did a motor job on my Honda Civic I took the head off 
it before I took the motor out.  Then I lifted the motor out so I 
would not need a winch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tool costs are extremely high.  When most mechanics are hired by 
garages and service stations a condition to their employment is 
that they have their own tools.  Without their tools they could 
not touch a thing, just as I could not.  If I did not have the 
right tool I had to buy it.  The same thing is true for 
mechanics.  When they do not have the right tool they go out and 
buy it unless they can persuade a fellow worker to lend it to 
them.  Once they have it, it is in their toolbox. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An empty toolbox without any tools that rolls on the floor costs 
between $300 to $400.  Mechanics must invest between $20,000 and 
$50,000 in order to do their job.  It is high time we recognized 
both the importance of the work they do and the unfairness that 
is being perpetrated on them by not allowing them to deduct the 
tool expenses from their taxable income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As has been mentioned, those tools also have to be replaced 
because they wear out and some are lost.  I have on numerous 
occasions picked tools up off the highway because I know the 
value of them.  I also know that if they are left on the road 
they can be kicked up and cause damage to a vehicle, such as 
puncturing a tire or even causing injury to another person.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have picked up a few screwdrivers and other things which I 
have found on the road.  It is pretty well impossible to find out 
from where these things came.  Likely a mechanic left them 
sitting on some part of the motor when he was working on it and 
forgot to remove them.  The person for whom the work was done drove 
away and the screwdrivers fell onto the highway.  This is another source of 
loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Losses have to be replaced.  That is a cost item.  I plead with 
all members to agree that there is no reason in the world why 
these people should not be treated the same as anyone else who 
has a cost of employment to that extent in earning their income.  I 
again emphasize my plea to members to please vote in favour of 
this bill so that finally this inequity will be solved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd (Parliamentary Secretary to President of 
the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased 
to speak on Bill C-222, a very important bill brought forward by 
the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a number of other members have mentioned, a concept of this 
bill has been before the House many times before.  In my previous 
life I was a self-employed chartered accountant.  I had many 
mechanics, both employed and self-employed, as my clients, so I 
am very familiar with their concern regarding this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe a number of interveners have possibly misunderstood 
the concept.  The first issue is self-employment as opposed to 
employment.  In fact the previous speaker gave many examples of 
people who were able to deduct tools, et cetera, by virtue of the 
fact that they were deemed to be self-employed.  He was also 
confused about incorporated and unincorporated businesses. 
Unincorporated self-employed people are allowed to deduct 
expenses laid out to earn income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a significant difference in the income tax system 
between people who are employed as opposed to people who are 
self-employed.  We can have a long debate about that in and of 
itself, but generally speaking it is considered that people who 
are self-employed have likely more substantial risk in earning an 
income than do people who receive a weekly paycheque.  Some 
people dispute that in this day and age when people are getting 
laid off of their jobs and so forth, but that is some of the 
foundation that underlies why this situation has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue of fairness was mentioned.  A number of interveners 
said that it was only being fair to do this.  I understand that 
plight and the costs involved in acquiring and even maintaining a 
tool inventory.  However many people who are employed have 
similar costs related to being employed.  Even we have a dress 
code in the House of Commons.  I incur costs for suits and other 
things related to maintaining my job as a condition of 
employment, but these costs are not tax deductible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have two young sons who are engaged in the high tech sector. 
While it is not a specific condition of their employment, they 
feel it is part of their jobs to have computers in their homes. 
They use those computers as an extension of their work, but they 
are not allowed to deduct those computers for tax purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact of the matter is that if we are going to start talking 
about fairness, we are going to have to talk about a lot of other 
people.  I am sure people in our audience today or sitting at 
home watching this debate who are employed can think of things 
that they incur as well to earn employment income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Uniforms is another issue that has been around for years. 
People may be required to wear uniforms such as a waitress or 
whatever the case may be.  They are required to buy the uniform 
from their employers, but are not allowed to deduct them for tax 
purposes. That is another idiosyncrasy of the income tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure all of us can think of reasons why we should have a 
tax deduction.  The real issue is why should this group of people 
be treated somewhat differently than all other people who are 
employed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go over the bill itself, the bill proposes to change the 
Income Tax Act to help mechanics to pay the costs of providing 
their own tools when this is a condition of their employment.  I 
think that is very important.

<A HREF="#LINKT52"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also ask ourselves a fundamental question.  Why is it 
a condition of employment for mechanics to buy their own tools? 
There are a lot of reasons for that but it has developed 
differently from other industries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Changes would allow mechanics to deduct the cost of buying, 
renting, insuring or maintaining their tools.  Income deductions 
would be available for tools costing less than $250 and this 
could be adjusted in accordance with inflation.  That is what the 
bill says.  For bigger amounts it would be subject to capital 
cost allowance and allowed to be deducted over a period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada understands the difficult issue this 
bill is trying to address.  We appreciate that employed mechanics 
face work related costs that are sometimes significant. This is 
particularly true, and it has been brought out in the debate 
today, of young people who have just become mechanics and have to 
buy that first investment.  It is well known that if people enter 
a career path as a mechanic, they will have to buy their first 
set of tools.  It does not alleviate the fact that it is very 
expensive and could be cost prohibitive to people becoming 
mechanics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is some merit that the bill is trying to achieve.  However 
the bill overlooks some very important administrative issues, 
issues that would need to be considered if the bill went forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the bill talks about the word mechanic.  Many 
people have used the words auto mechanic but it does not say that 
in the bill.  Canada's national occupation code lists many kinds 
of mechanics.  There are automotive mechanics, but there are also 
auto body mechanics, heavy duty mechanics, small engine 
mechanics, aircraft mechanics and many varieties of industrial 
mechanics.  That has not been defined in the bill.  People have 
used the analogy automotive mechanics but the bill says mechanics 
of all kinds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many other people would call themselves mechanics as defined 
under Statistics Canada even though they may not fit 
in any of those particular categories.  In reality the bill has 
brought forward a great deal of confusion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important administrative issue is how the deduction will 
work under the bill.  I am puzzled by the use of the thresholds. 
The bill talks about those amounts in excess of $200, I believe, 
which is different from the current capital cost allowance 
provisions which is $250.  In other words, it would appear that 
the bill anticipates some other form of capital cost allowance 
regime.  This is a mystery to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is even stranger is the bill talks about the 
proportionality of tools in excess of $250.  I have a hard time 
reading and understanding it myself.  I am assuming if a 
particular tool was $1,000, the first $250 would be deducted as a 
regular expense and the $750 would somehow be added to a person's 
capital cost allowance schedule as a depreciation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no system of the Income Tax Act that treats capital 
acquisitions in that manner.  It does not take part of a car and 
write it off while the other part is depreciated over a long 
period of time.  It does not take part of a tractor, write it off 
and depreciate the balance over a long period of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is inconsistent and does not fit in with the current 
income tax regime.  Therefore, it is not a simple bill.  It is a 
very complex bill that deals with a whole different method of 
depreciation and providing for capital cost allowances.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the problems is the matter of control.  We recognize that 
in some areas there are already mechanisms which apply to 
employees who have to pay out of their own pocket for work 
supplies.  The cost of chainsaws is allowed to be written off by 
loggers because it is recognized that they depreciate quicker 
than other forms of equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to sit back from this issue and think about it for a 
minute.  We talk about fairness but there are other employed 
people who are treated similarly to mechanics.  This is not to 
say that mechanics are not deserving of some kind of treatment, 
but if we open up that Pandora's box we will have to open it up 
for a lot of other people, especially some of the people who are 
listening to us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My preference is that at this time the bill not go forward until 
it is studied further.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis-et-Chutes-de-la-Chaudière, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am very pleased to speak to Bill C-222 that was 
introduced by my colleague from 
Beauport—Montmorency—Côte-de-Beaupré—Île-d'Orléans. This is the second 
time that he has introduced this bill. Unfortunately, it died on 
the Order Paper because the election was called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand his situation, because I remind the House, without 
going into this too much, that I myself introduced a bill on 
shipbuilding that also died on the Order Paper when it was on 
the verge of being passed at third reading. The government 
preferred not to pass it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again today, during Oral Question Period, we talked about this. 
The same thing applies to mechanics. At the time, at second 
reading, only 11 members had voted against the bill. Before the 
election, many Liberal members had voted for the bill. I hope 
they will continue to do so. It is simply the election that 
prevented it from being passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened to my two Liberal colleagues who spoke about this 
bill. The parliamentary secretary basically maintained the 
position he took last time. But I am a little surprised to see 
the position taken by the member for Durham, who has often shown 
that he can not only express himself in an independent way, but 
also vote independently from his government when he had the 
opportunity— 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Alex Shepherd:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  I would like it known that I voted against the bill the 
first time round. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Antoine Dubé:</B> Madam Speaker, I was saying that the member 
for Durham had shown, on a few occasions, that he placed the 
interest of his constituents before the position of his party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At any rate, he put forward several arguments which I think 
should be discussed by the finance committee, which would be 
called upon to study this bill and bring the necessary 
amendments, keeping in mind that we must not establish a 
precedent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply remind those who are listening to us that we are still 
looking at the principle of the bill. The member talked about 
tradition. This is something I know about. I have two brothers 
who work in this field. One is an employee who specializes in 
automatic transmissions, and his tools are very expensive. The 
other one owns his own garage and could claim a capital cost 
allowance on his tools. There is a double standard here. One is 
self-employed whereas the other one is an employee. So I know 
what I am talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of my constituents, very often, in the House, I 
talk about the Lévis shipyard. When that shipyard is in full 
operation, it employs 1,000 to 1,500 workers. In my riding, this 
bill also affects 1,200 to 1,500 workers. Therefore it is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. The 
order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the 
order paper. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It being 2.30 p.m. the House stands adjourned until Monday next 
at 11 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
