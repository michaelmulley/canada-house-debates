	He said: Mr. Speaker, as we continue down the trail of haste 
dealing with Bill C-18, the bill to suspend the Electoral 
Boundaries Readjustment Act, we suddenly find ourselves at 
report stage, having gone through a rather hurried committee 
stage just before the Easter break.
<P>
	We had gone through a rather hurried committee stage process 
in dealing with what actually amounts to a very  simple bill that 
tampers with the existing act by suspending it until some 
unknown and undrafted act is put in its place, or 24 months 
expire and we do not come up with a solution or a better process 
for dealing with boundary readjustment. The boundary 
readjustment process is designed to be a non-partisan 
politically neutral exercise. By introducing Bill C-18 the 
government is compromising that neutrality.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Elections Canada goes to great lengths to ensure that we have 
a fair, democratic and unbiased electoral system. We as 
parliamentarians should respect that principle no matter how 
these proposed changes may affect us personally.
<P>
	The process has a built-in appeal structure through which 
interested groups and individuals, including members of 
Parliament, can express their concerns about the changes. There 
has been no great outcry from Canadians to justify Parliament 
prematurely interfering with these readjustments that are under 
way.
<P>
	Those members who are unhappy with the proposed changes 
can make representation at the appeal hearings. I might add that 
I have asked to be heard at the appeal hearing in Saskatchewan. 
Hopefully the process will not be suspended before I have that 
opportunity.
<P>
	This is supposed to be a non-political process. An MP should 
have no more right to effect changes to the electoral boundaries 
than any other Canadian citizen.
<P>
	The redistribution that occurred in the past resulted in similar 
grumblings from MPs but barely a whisper from the electorate. 
The redistribution of 1974 following the 1971 census was 
similarly challenged by MPs. It would seem that the Liberal 
government of the time did not like those proposed changes 
either and after much debate decided to create 18 new 
constituencies and send a new commission out to do the work all 
over again. It sounds familiar, does it not?
<P>
	Taxpayers will not accept the cost of redoing the 
commission's work or the cost of additional MPs. This in itself 
is justification for not supporting the government's proposal for 
interfering with the electoral process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2895"> 2895 </A></B>
<P>
	There is one aspect of electoral boundary changes that is a 
political matter and that is the total number of seats. Canadians 
have made it abundantly clear that they do not see the need for 
more members of Parliament. The country's finances are not in a 
condition to warrant adding the expense of more MPs. Even the 
physical limitations of this Chamber suggest that it is time to 
consider placing an upper limit on the number of members in 
this House. This cap on the House of Commons is the only issue 
where the Parliament has a legitimate place in considering the 
issue.
<P>
	Consideration of the cap on the House is conspicuously absent 
from any government intentions other than that it has talked 
about reviewing the numbers  of seats with no proposal as to how 
we can achieve the ends we desire.
<P>
	We are rather resigned to the fact that we will be blocked by 
the weight of a heavy-handed Liberal government intent on 
imposing its will on Parliament without occasion for 
meaningful debate and honest consideration of amendments.
<P>
	I believe it is abusing a pillar of democracy, namely the 
certainty that Canadians will enjoy a fair electoral process free 
of political gerrymandering and manipulation or even the 
perception of such and that is no small matter.
<P>
	Suspending the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act 
before placing an alternative before Canadians to scrutinize and 
be endorsed by this House is of great concern to me and to many 
other Canadians. This is especially so in light of the fact that 
Elections Canada informed the procedure and House affairs 
committee that the current act is being administered properly 
and with no problems.
<P>
	We have just returned from two weeks in our ridings. I want to 
state that I heard no public outcry over the proposed electoral 
boundaries from residents of Saskatchewan, both in my riding 
and in neighbouring ridings.
<P>
	Rather, Canadians are worried about the deficit and 
government waste. They are worried about the dollar and 
interest rates and an agricultural trade war with the United 
States. They are worried about failing social safety nets and the 
hurt being afflicted on them by a government that cannot 
manage its wallet.
<P>
	They are worried about the Bloc Quebecois, a party 
committed to breaking up the country at any and great cost and 
they are also worried that the government is committed to 
thwarting Quebec separation without regard to fairness and 
without regard to principle.
<P>
	The Liberal government may be looking for a red herring to 
divert as much attention as possible from the economic and 
national unity issues, the lack of equal treatment under the law 
for all Canadians and its pillow-soft approach to criminal 
justice reform.
<P>
	Perhaps the electoral boundary debates are convenient red 
herrings as well as an inconvenience for Liberal MPs who could 
care less about the economy but want to make darn sure the 
boundary of their riding is at Fourth Street rather than Tenth 
Street.
<P>
	The suspension of the act can serve the Liberal government in 
three ways. First, it could allow Liberals to tamper with the 
electoral system for partisan advantages. They have majority 
control in both the House of Commons and the procedure and 
House affairs committee to which they wish to give the 
responsibility of drafting new legislation.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, as a diversionary tactic to keep attention from its 
shortfalls it does not want opposition parties, its own 
backbenchers and the media focusing on the economy and the 
issues that are important to Canadians.
<P>
	Third, it attempts to deny the public input and judgment of the 
public in the current process.
<P>
	There are flaws in Bill C-18 such as the suspension time. One 
amendment that we have put forward is that the time of 
suspension be reduced from 24 months to 12 months.
<P>
	The current boundaries are based on the 1981 census. We may 
end up delaying boundary readjustment until after the next 
election which will happen in 1997 or 1998 if all goes as we 
expect. That means it is possible that not one election may be 
based on the 1991 population statistics if the following election 
were to occur say in the year 2003. It could be based then on the 
2001 decennial census. This in fact may be unconstitutional. In 
any case it certainly breaks the spirit of the law.
<P>
	A second flaw in Bill C-18 is that it will waste $5 million 
because most of the work of the commissioners that is already in 
place will become unsalvageable.
<P>
	Could the Reform Party have supported Bill C-18? Possibly. 
If the Liberal government had categorically stated that it would 
cap the seats in the House of Commons at a number not greater 
than the current 295 seats, perhaps that would have been 
justification for suspending the current process.
<P>
	Does the government really have a plan to reform the 
parliamentary system so sparsely populated regions of Canada 
will receive a fair shake in the electoral process and in decision 
making? We have a blueprint for that plan and we would be 
happy to discuss it at any time in this House.
<P>
	Third, the government has not reassured us that there will be 
no allowances for patronage and gerrymandering in a new 
process to replace the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act 
by agreeing to substantive support from all three recognized 
parties in the House before enacting a replacement act. We 
discussed such issues in good faith but the results were not 
forthcoming.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2896"> 2896 </A></B>
<P>
	There has been no public consultation about the proposed 
boundary changes. Politicians should not arbitrarily decide to 
quash the changes before the public is consulted. Since there has 
been no public concern about the work of the commission, the 
only reason for dismissing the boundary changes at this point 
are very partisan and very political.
<P>
	It is the role of Parliament to ensure that this process is 
conducted as fairly as possible. It is not our role to choose where 
or where not the lines are to be drawn. Therefore I support our 
amendments, first to shorten the suspension period of the 
current readjustment act from 24 months to 12 months; second, 
not to cease the work of the current commissioners but to leave 
them in place so  that $5 million worth of taxpayers' money will 
not be wasted should the procedure and House affairs committee 
not come up with a responsible act to replace the current act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Mr. Speaker, I want to assure you as 
well as all hon. members in this House that, as we are debating 
this bill, the government wants to respect the non-partisan 
nature of the electoral boundaries readjustment process. We 
want it to remain that way and at no time have we made any 
proposal with a view to changing the non-partisan nature of this 
process.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the member from the Reform Party who 
just spoke. He said that we were right to review the readjustment 
process, mentioning the fact that, at the present time, with each 
readjustment, the number of seats automatically increases 
according to a predetermined formula. He said that, under the 
present circumstances, it would desirable for us to consider 
whether or not this number should keep on increasing, which of 
course leads to further government expenditures.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	On the other hand, he also said that we want to limit the debate 
and that we want to proceed with great haste. Of course, we want 
to proceed with haste to stop the ongoing process for the simple 
reason that it costs a lot of money. It is true that a certain amount 
of work has already been done, but should the process be 
allowed to go on, even more money will be spent. This is why we 
tried to come to an agreement with the opposition parties to 
carry on the review of the process as quickly as possible. I was 
also surprised to hear the member mention that the government 
wanted to take advantage of its majority,
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
the heavy-handed way of the government to try to push this 
legislation through.
<P>
	However, there is a contradiction here in that the member says 
that we want to push this through in a heavy-handed fashion. 
The member then turns around and argues that if the government 
were to be heavy-handed in saying that we would limit the 
number of members in this House at the present level, he would 
agree with that. I see a contradiction there. It is definitely not the 
intention of the government to be heavy-handed in that fashion.
<P>
	We do not want to limit the debate. We want to make sure that 
every group, every organization and every person who has 
something to say on the revision of the process has the 
opportunity to make his presentation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We have problems with the proposed amendments. There 
again I am surprised. When we drafted this bill and consulted the 
opposition parties, we proposed an 18  month period but the 
Reform Party, the very sponsor of the amendments we are 
debating today, wanted to make sure that the process would be 
longer; they said that 18 months was not long enough and all of a 
sudden they propose to reduce this period to 12 months.
<P>
	We believe that 12 months is too short. We do not believe that 
this timeframe will cause problems for the committee in charge 
of reviewing the process, but rather that problems will arise 
once the committee's review is over. We will have problems in 
terms of the process which will have to be put in place to 
implement a new legislative framework based on the 
committee's recommendations.
<P>
	We are convinced that the committee of the House in charge of 
studying this process will propose a solution which will meet 
and respect the desires of the people and the members who make 
presentations to the committee; such recommendations will 
imply changes which will have to be legislated. Therefore, we 
believe that a 12 month period will not allow the committee or 
the House to make an in-depth review of the recommendations 
which will be proposed.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	That is it for the first amendment. Motions No. 2 and No. 3 are 
amendments that would maintain the existing commissions. We 
would have, on the one hand, a House committee which would 
study the process and propose changes if needed, and on the 
other hand, the commissions which would continue their studies 
and consultations, not in relation to the process, but in relation 
to the readjustment of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	We believe that this would be a waste of money, and I am 
surprised that the hon. member who proposed these amendments 
would want to waste several million dollars. He said that the 
commissions are already in place, that they have done some 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2897"> 2897 </A></B>
<P>
work, and that their abolition would mean the loss of $3.5 to$4 million worth of work.
<P>
	His amendment would mean an even greater loss, and if we 
decided at some point to abandon what has been done, we would 
have wasted $3 to $4 million.
<P>
	That is why we cannot support the amendments proposed this 
morning.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 is the logical continuation of Motion No. 2 
which would maintain the existing commissions.
<P>
	For these reasons, we cannot support the amendments 
proposed this morning.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. 
Statements were attributed to me that are not correct. Prior to the 
introduction of the bill there was a discussion on whether an 18 
month period was the proper time for suspension of the bill. In 
fact my party and I recommended that it be either 12 months or 
24 months.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With all due respect to the 
hon. member, I believe that is a point of debate rather than a 
point of order.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse):</B> I would like to 
comment on the three motions before us which were grouped by 
the Chair.
<P>
	First of all, I was a bit surprised by the remarks of my 
colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster about the Official 
Opposition's attitude. Once again, we have heard expressions 
that will be used more and more in the House, as the elections 
and referendum grow nearer in Quebec. We have heard terms 
like the breakup of Canada, separatism, that kind of language. I 
do not see what that has to do with Bill C-18 and I do not know 
what the member from Kindersley-Lloydminster is getting at. 
He probably does not know himself.
<P>
	As for Bill C-18 and the amendments proposed today, the 
authors of the three motions did raise some good points. In fact, 
we could speak of two motions, since the third one is just a 
consequence of the second one.
<P>
	The main thing that comes out of these motions and the whole 
debate and what prompts my first comment is that we are 
considering limiting the number of members in the House. It 
may be a worthwhile, even noble objective. As you know, Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec governments, even the least nationalistic ones, 
have always insisted on a clause guaranteeing 25 per cent of the 
seats in the House of Commons to Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Under the present federal system, Quebec is guaranteed this 
representation. Assuming it remains in the federation, 
something which is also hypothetical, then Quebec should retain 
one quarter of the seats in Parliament. Limit the number of seats, 
by all means, but only after giving Quebec assurances that it will 
retain its current level of 25 per cent representation in the House 
of Commons.
<P>
	Mention was also made in earlier debates of the need for a 
thorough review of a number of provisions, notably section 51 
of the Constitution Act, 1867, and of the possibility that some 
areas or regions of the countries, in particular the Magdalen 
Islands and the riding of Labrador, could be considered 
separately. These ridings could be exempted from the process of 
determining electoral boundaries on the basis of the number of 
voters in a province. Thus, other ridings either in the province of 
Newfoundland or in Labrador, as far as the riding of Labrador 
and the population of the Quebec mainland is concerned, would 
not have to make up for the fact that Labrador or the Magdalen 
Islands would be designated as separate ridings. As you know, 
until 1968, the Magdalen Islands constituted a separate riding.
<P>
	With respect to the suspension period which the first motion 
presented by my hon. colleague for Kindersley-Lloydminster 
seeks to shorten to 12 months,  without of course abolishing the 
commissions, I fail to see the logic of this motion. If we truly 
want to do a thorough job and review the entire process which 
has resulted in periodic readjustments to the electoral map, a 
process which has not been thoroughly reviewed and closely 
scrutinized since 1964, then a twelve-month suspension of 
operations seems clearly inadequate. We would be hamstrung by 
this provision. To all intents and purposes, we would be better 
off not passing Bill C-18 instead of limiting ourselves to a 
twelve-month suspension.
<P>
	In order to undertake a thorough review, we need the 24 month 
suspension provided for in the bill. Therefore, I cannot support 
the proposed amendment, any more than I can support 
maintaining the current commissions in operation. What work 
would there be for them to do? Again, we would have a case 
where commissions would be paid to do nothing. We do not need 
this. Enough money is being wasted already.
<P>
	All the same, it is somewhat astonishing to hear a Reform 
Party member say that he wants to continue wasting public 
funds. We do not need this. If we have to suspend the process, 
then let us do it. In two years' time, when the review process is 
undertaken again, other persons can be appointed. We could 
reappoint the same persons. Some may have changed careers or 
even passed away. We will have to adjust accordingly.
<P>
	Why should we artificially maintain the commissions? 
Rather, we should establish new ones at the appropriate time, 
that is, within the 60 day period set out in clause 4 of Bill C-18. 
There is no reason for us to keep the commissions going, unless 
the hon. members of the Reform Party have friends on the 
commissions whom they want to protect. Well if this is the case, 
then they should say so clearly. But if it is not the case, we have 
no need of commissions that do not work.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2898"> 2898 </A></B>
<P>
	It is quite enough that we have another House that does not 
work, Mr. Speaker, without having commissions that sit idle. We 
should minimize the damage. Maybe we could obtain 
unanimous consent right now to bring in a constitutional 
resolution to suspend the current operations and duties of the 
other House until such time as a new House is reconstituted, one 
which better reflects the aspirations of Canadians. As for 
Quebeckers, we will deal in our own way with the problem of the 
second House.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	At any rate, Bill C-18 has been tabled, although somewhat 
late. That is unfortunate, I must say, and the hon. Secretary of 
State for Parliamentary Affairs probably regrets it too, as it 
means that we now have to speed up our discussions a little and 
that a motion for time allocation had to be put forward. Why did 
the government not act with more diligence? Why was the bill 
not tabled two weeks earlier, so this situation could have been 
averted? I do not know why and I will not  speculate on this 
because I would not want to ascribe malicious intent to anyone.
<P>
	We find ourselves in the somewhat uncomfortable situation 
where provincial commissions have decided on their own 
authority to sit since, as the Chief Electoral Officer, Mr. 
Jean-Pierre Kingsley, explained in his testimony before the 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs-please refer to 
page 13 of the Evidence of the March 24, 1994 sitting of the said 
committee and tabled in this House by its chair, the hon. member 
for Kingston and the Islands-the provincial commissions have 
every right to suspend the hearing process, as long as the 
September 16 deadline is met. So, the commissions have 
decided to start sitting.
<P>
	I respect their decision, while I do not agree with it. Clear 
indication had been given by this House through a vote in second 
reading on the principle of Bill C-18 that a brake was being put 
on the process and that it should be brought to a stop.
<P>
	Some people are scheduled to appear in a matter of days 
before provincial commissions, in Quebec in particular, to make 
representations. Unfortunately, that will all be in vain. I think 
that it might have been wise to suspend the process for a few 
days to see what Parliament's decision on Bill C-18 would be, 
especially in light of clear indications that we were going to stop 
the process.
<P>
	That is all I had to say on Bill C-18 for the time being. As I 
said earlier, as a member of the Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, I have no intention of taking a firm stand on what 
I plan to defend in that venue. I have always maintained that I 
would listen to the testimony with a free hand and no blinkers 
on, and hear the representations all the interested parties may 
want to make, by teleconference or in public hearings across the 
country, seeing that the Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs is in control of its own proceedings and, based on the 
notice of motion put on the Notice Paper of this House, the 
committee will have plenty of leeway to carry out this review.
<P>
	For all these reasons, I cannot support any of the motions put 
forward by my colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
have a chance to participate once again in this important debate. 
Unfortunately we are being asked to debate legislation in what I 
think is a highly inappropriate fashion. The government has 
used time allocation before and has suggested that we needed to 
rush this matter through Parliament.
<P>
	I have just spent two weeks in my constituency and I must 
admit that while people are upset about the proposals in our 
particular part of British Columbia, they did not feel the matter 
ought to be a priority of the nation. There was certainly no 
obvious call to rush legislation that would in a sense sabotage 
the process.
<P>
	I speak particularly as a member of Parliament from British 
Columbia. Once again the people of British Columbia will be 
shortchanged. Once again we will be skewered. Because Liberal 
members did not presumably like the boundaries in their areas, 
British Columbia will be underrepresented in Parliament next 
time. It is a dynamic part of Canada. Its population is expanding 
daily as people come from other provinces seeking job 
opportunities.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	Basically the government has decided B.C. will be 
underrepresented in the next Parliament of Canada by deep 
sixing this updating of the boundaries based on the 1991 census. 
This is highly undemocratic.
<P>
	To take up on a point my hon. friend from the Bloc raised, 
these commissions are now going ahead. A number of people in 
Kamloops are asking whether they should make presentations to 
the commission. I respond by saying there is no point. The 
boundaries presumably will be changed again. The process has 
been set on the back burner for now. Who knows what the future 
will bring.
<P>
	We have spent $4 million or $5 million so far on this process. 
Now we will be spending additional money holding hearings 
that are nonsensical, meaningless and illogical. There is no 
point. We are saying there is a public meeting being called on 
these boundaries where the public's input has no value.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2899"> 2899 </A></B>
<P>
	I know periodically we do silly things, or at least things 
people perceive to be silly. However with something which is so 
obviously ridiculous I cannot imagine why these commissioners 
are soldiering on on a mission impossible but I suppose that is a 
decision they can make. I call upon them to acknowledge that 
regardless of where and how these public hearings will be 
conducted it will cost the taxpayers of Canada money.
<P>
	Whether or not one agrees with what the Liberal government 
is doing, it is a reality. As my friend from the Reform Party 
indicated earlier the Liberals have the muscle in Parliament to 
do whatever they want anyway.
<P>
	The Liberal government for whatever reason decided to 
shortchange British Columbia in the next election. It decided to 
intercept this arm's length and what should be a non-political, 
fair process by saying it is going to stop this dead in its tracks. If 
it has to upset the flow of Parliament it will do that. If it has to 
use time allocation or a form of closure to muzzle MPs from 
speaking on this, it will do that too. Unfortunately that is the 
reality. I hang my head in regret when I see my hon. friends 
opposite participating in such a way.
<P>
	In terms of the amendment, the suggestion my hon. friend 
from the Reform Party has put forward that we reduce the time 
of waiting to one year makes some sense. It at least gives some 
hope that this process could be rescued in time for the next 
general election. I do not think it will. From what my hon. friend 
opposite has indicated I do not think it is going to get the support 
of  the government, but it is a laudable amendment. It is one we 
should enthusiastically support.
<P>
	Hopefully as the debate progresses today other members will 
see the value of trying to streamline this process so there will be 
at least some possibility of a more representative and 
democratic electoral system being in place prior to the next 
general election.
<P>
	Knowing the government was bringing in time allocation and 
had rushed this bill through the committee process prior to the 
Easter recess, the premier of British Columbia asked me to 
represent British Columbians' point of view, if I had a chance to 
speak to this piece of legislation.
<P>
	For years and years they have felt shortchanged with lack of 
representation, lack of clout at the cabinet table and wherever. 
Once again very clearly one of the fastest growing parts of 
Canada will be let down in terms of democratic and 
representative representation in the House of Commons after the 
next general election. Particularly, it will have an impact on the 
lower mainland of British Columbia and on some of the rapidly 
growing parts of central British Columbia where there has been 
tremendous population growth in the last decade and likely will 
continue in the next few years by all projections.
<P>
	We support the amendments put forward by our friends in the 
Reform Party at this report stage process, particularly the one 
giving us some hope to streamline the operation.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	It is sad to say with respect but with regret to my friends, to 
take a particular action which will adversely affect British 
Columbia and clearly result in one of the most dynamic and 
fastest growing parts of Canada being improperly represented in 
the House of Commons is something this party cannot support.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank the hon. member for Kamloops. He and I flew west 
on the same plane and the same seat when we were going home 
before the Easter break.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Riis:</B> Different seats.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Grey:</B> Yes, different seats. The same pair of seats then, 
forgive me. Maybe we are saving a lot of money then. I had 
better get on with Bill C-18 as soon as possible.
<P>
	We had an interesting talk on the plane about this whole idea 
and what it is that is happening here. All of us on both sides of 
the House need to look at it. Why is something being rammed 
through as quickly as possible? My antennae go up as soon as I 
see something like that. I suspect the Canadian public feels very 
much the same way. As soon as it sees something going into a 
crisis mode it wants to stop, wait, look and ask why we are being 
thrown into a crisis mode all of a sudden.
<P>
	The issue here is the fact this is being rammed through 
Parliament so quickly. It was most unfortunate for  people on the 
government side that we had to take Easter recess. This was 
something we know they wanted to ram through on the eve of 
Easter recess. It was a pity for the government. It was in a flap 
because it could not get this thing pushed through.
<P>
	Antennae should go up right across the country when we see 
something like that happening. We should be asking questions. 
Why the rush? I do not see the need for the rush, quite frankly, 
except of course we know the timetable is in place for the 
current process to have the public hearings start very soon. That 
then demands there be a crisis for the government because it 
wants to cut that debate. It wants to shut down and put a lid on 
the public having any process or any input into these hearings. 
When people on the government benches go into the crisis mode 
saying to stop this thing cold and shut it down, then one wonders 
why this public process is being thwarted.
<P>
	No, the process was not perfect before. However as soon as we 
see whatever process is in place, warts, flaws and all of the 
problems with it, it is a process that has been put into place and 
the public has not given a great outcry. There has not been a 
crisis from time to time except in Parliament because people are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2900"> 2900 </A></B>
<P>
self-serving and they see that maybe they stand to lose their 
ridings.
<P>
	I have mentioned I am one of those people. Beaver River as 
we know it now and as we love it stands to be eliminated under 
the current process. If we are typical politicians therefore, of all 
people I should probably be self-serving and say that I am going 
to lose my riding and I am going to hang on to it just as hard as I 
can. No.
<P>
	The public is saying: ``Let us go to those public hearings. Let 
us make representation. Let us voice some of our concerns with 
this current process. Let us not just slam the thing shut''. If we 
are looking at how democratic that really is surely to goodness 
that is the farthest thing from true democracy.
<P>
	Before I get into some of the things I heard during my spring 
tour when I was home, some of the concerns that people have 
about this process, let me just say it is so frustrating to watch 
this matter unfold from the inside out. We are looking at 
something which is going to go to the other place and get 
thumped through there as quickly as possible. It does make one 
nervous.
<P>
	I know it makes many government members nervous as well. 
It is sad to say the lid has been put on them too in saying: ``Oh 
no, just let those members talk about it''. Talk about it we will 
because it is something that needs to be talked about. We say if 
there are going to be public hearings let them go ahead. Let the 
public be heard on this.
<P>
	In my constituency over the last couple of weeks I conducted 
my full spring tour of town hall meetings and many other 
meetings. Following are some of the things I heard.
<P>
<B>(1055 ) </B>
<P>
	They are concerned about the process as it is in place now. Let 
us call it the old process. There are frustrations with it. It is not 
perfect. However, they are willing to take their lumps and go 
through the procedures that are set up and put in place. If it is 
public hearings they must go to, then it is public hearings they 
will go to. If that is their chance on providing input according to 
the Constitution and the way this has been carried out for years 
and years regarding redistribution and limits, then they will do it 
because that is the process set in place. They are willing to abide 
by those rules and regulations.
<P>
	Any number of people asked me again and again: ``When are 
the hearings scheduled for this area, Deborah?'' There is 
concern that they will be at one o'clock in the afternoon when 
most good people are busy about their day's work. They do have 
frustrations about that.
<P>
	Let me assure you they have far more reservations and 
frustrations about something which is going to be thrown in 
place. Over and above that, to put the kibosh on this particular 
process and waste the $5 million that has already been spent to 
have politicians come up with something better?
<P>
	I mentioned this in second reading. If you think there are 
fingerprints on the present process let me assure you there are 
bigger and blacker fingerprints on any process that will come up 
as a result of Bill C-18. I can guarantee that because I know 
exactly what it is that people are feeling. Government members 
know this and feel it as well.
<P>
	Many people were pleased that the whole matter will be put on 
ice. I must say the people in the constituency of Beaver River 
appreciate it. They like the name. It is a generic name for an area 
that has any amount of history. I know there is a Beaver River in 
Ontario as well. My friend and I have talked about that.
<P>
	Beaver River is a significant area in northeastern Alberta. The 
voyageurs and the water runners went up the Beaver River and 
portaged a few miles across to the Athabasca River and then 
went up north. Historically it is an incredibly exciting area of 
northeastern Alberta. The best part of its being called Beaver 
River is that it is an area and not a particular place. There is a 
store and a little community of Beaver River, but it is a 
waterway we are looking at and an area with history attached to 
it.
<P>
	The new name of this constituency will be Vegreville-St. 
Paul, if and when the old goes through, if the government for 
some fluke does not manage to push C-18 through. Who knows 
what will happen in the other place and whether Bill C-18 will 
really go through or not.
<P>
	Looking at the old process, the way it is going right now, if 
Beaver River is eliminated the new constituency will be called 
Vegreville-St. Paul. Let me reiterate what I heard from people 
on my spring tour, for example the mayor of Bonnyville which is 
north and east of St. Paul, far north and east of Vegreville, and 
people in the  community of Grand Centre-Cold Lake which is 
far north and east again of Bonnyville. As soon as you pick a 
place, i.e., Vegreville-St. Paul, people in those communities 
say: ``Let us assure you, there is life beyond St. Paul''.
<P>
	People have real concerns about the name. They want to know 
why it is that a particular town or a couple of towns are named. I 
see their point. They make that point well. Let us look at an area 
rather than singling out one or two towns. I appreciate their 
viewpoints. I am committed to doing everything I can, whether 
it is under the old process or the new, to say this is a region, an 
area. We have gifts. We have abilities in this particular area. 
Maybe it is wiser yet to celebrate the fact of an area or a group 
rather than zeroing in on one or two towns. As soon as one town 
is named then somewhere else is omitted. They are worried 
about that.
<P>
	People question why these particular boundaries. Of course 
the government benches would say it was a Tory mapmaker. 
Maybe it was but I have no knowledge of that. I do know they 
were appointments to the commission from the Speaker of the 
House. However what about Liberal mapmakers? Could there be 
such a thing as a Liberal cartographer in this country, heaven 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2901"> 2901 </A></B>
<P>
forbid? If this were going to happen it might amaze us all to 
discover that in fact there are Liberal mapmakers in Canada. 
What process is there in Bill C-18 that would exempt us from 
naming, heaven forbid, a Liberal mapmaker?
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	We can see how flawed the process is when somebody goes 
into crisis mode or when somebody decides we have to do it 
now. It makes me think of a homebuilding ad: why wait for 
spring; do it now.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Do it now.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> An hon. member says: ``Do it now''. He is 
concerned about doing it now. I would like to ask why now is so 
important if we have spent $5 million on it. The reason now is so 
important is that the hearings have started. People are getting to 
view and voice their concerns publicly. I suspect it would seem 
very obvious across the country that the public is asking why the 
hurry. There have been the Charlottetown and Meech Lake 
accords. I could go on and on. Why the hurry? Why the rush?
<P>
	Something is underground that needs to surface, that needs to 
be discussed in the public hearings. Let us not do it now. Let the 
public hearings go on. Let people talk about it and make 
representations to the commissioners.
<P>
	They laugh on the other side of the House. It is most 
unfortunate. There is no need to proceed with this in crisis mode, 
as crisis intervention. This is the process put in place. Let us 
follow that process. Let us see what comes of these public 
hearings. Then let us have the government make some wise and 
reasoned recommendations after the public hearings, certainly 
not before.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak to report stage of Bill C-18, an act to suspend the 
electoral boundaries readjustment process. Specifically I will 
take a few minutes to speak on the amendments presented by my 
colleague from Kindersley-Lloydminster.
<P>
	Those amendments fit into two categories. The first 
amendment would limit the suspension for 12 months. The 
second one would formally keep the commissions that are 
established and in existence pending the suspension so that they 
could restart their work in the event it was required.
<P>
	Both these amendments are not really our preference. Our 
preference is that the bill not proceed. Let me make that 
absolutely clear. We have suggested these particular 
amendments to put the government to the test on a couple of its 
stated reasons for proceeding and some of its concerns.
<P>
	The 12 month period is very clear. We have examined the bill 
and the issue. It seems that if we look at a 24 month suspension 
as proposed in the bill we are looking at a possible constitutional 
problem.
<P>
	Obviously there are different legal opinions on that. The 
government's own lawyers do not see it that way, but the 
argument is really quite straightforward. We would suspend the 
process for 24 months. The process that would then have to go 
into effect under the law would be the existing process which 
would restart from scratch. All the previous money spent would 
have been wasted.
<P>
	Then we would have a process that would clearly not be 
completed until after the next election which means the results 
could not be implemented until the subsequent election. That 
subsequent election would be after the next decennial census.
<P>
	Our Constitution requires that we redistribute seats in the 
Chamber once every 10 years. In effect the purpose of the bill is 
to violate the Constitution. It clearly violates the demand that 
the seats be readjusted every 10 years. If the bill were to go 
through in its current state that would be the legal state. The 
Constitution would not be obeyed as a consequence of the 
particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	The government may argue that in the meantime it will have 
another process, that it will actually start sooner and all the other 
considerations, but that is not the legal state created by this 
piece of legislation.
<P>
	It is a fairly innocuous amendment. Those who really want to 
pass the bill could accept this amendment. It would make no 
difference to their overall agenda here. It is very clear what that 
is, but they could pass this one in good faith.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	Also in good faith they could pass the amendment to allow the 
existing commissions and commissioners to remain in place. 
The opposition to this particular amendment is even more 
bizarre. Some of the arguments we have heard privately and 
publicly are that we might  have to pay these people, as if we 
could not suspend their pay during the period in question. One 
member told me they might die in the next 12 months. They 
might die even if the process continues. I am not sure what 
particular difficulty that would cause.
<P>
	Of course we get into the whole argument that all this would 
save money. With this particular debate we are suspending the 
process, getting rid of the first $5 million we spent so that we 
can save money. In the end we restart the process from scratch. 
We spend all the money we spent before; we spend it over again 
and then we spend some more.
<P>
	This is an interesting way to save money, even if there were 
money to be saved. We could propose on the floor of the House 
that we suspend the next election altogether. After all elections 
cost money. Why do we not just sit here forever? I am a young 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2902"> 2902 </A></B>
<P>
guy. I could use the job. Maybe I do not want the job that long, 
but I could use it for a few more years. Why do we not just forget 
about having elections, save money and suspend the electoral 
process? These are very peculiar reasons.
<P>
	Let us look at the history of this matter. The intent is very 
clear in the way the debate has proceeded. The bill was 
introduced at first reading and had only been on the Order Paper 
for a couple of days when we proceeded to second reading. At 
second reading the government was not prepared to put up many 
speakers. The benches over there emptied. The wind whistled 
through and the tumbleweeds blew through. There was really 
nothing to say on this legislation. We put up some speakers to 
provide debate on the issue, as did the New Democratic Party. 
Immediately, after one day of debate, it was labelled as a 
filibuster. As a consequence closure was brought in for the first 
time in this Parliament.
<P>
	What is happening now is that the government decries-and 
the Bloc Quebecois speaker this morning decried it-that in the 
meantime they are having public hearings, that the commission 
has not listened, that Elections Canada has not listened, that they 
are proceeding with public hearings and that they have to be 
stopped.
<P>
	This illustrates precisely why we have this kind of process. 
Politicians are not supposed to be in charge of it. Elections 
Canada is an independent agency. The law is on the books. All of 
that is fairly transparent.
<P>
	Let me quote no other expert than the hon. member for York 
South-Weston. In the <I>Globe and Mail</I> of March 25 the 
following statement on which I will elaborate at third reading 
appeared: ``It is hard to see what was done here as anything other 
than self-interested politics, said renegade Liberal MP John 
Nunziata of Toronto. It makes no sense other than for 
self-preservations and MPs' convenience''.
<P>
	That is a frank statement. We all know there is no public 
outcry over this matter. There is a public hearing process for 
people who want to discuss it, but there is no  demand out there 
that we stifle the process of redistribution and start it all over 
again.
<P>
	The government is bringing in a related motion saying that we 
should study the process. That is perfectly valid. I said before 
that we were studying just about everything Parliament is 
supposed to be doing; we are studying rather than acting. We 
could study the process of electoral boundary readjustment. 
That would be valid. If we are to do that I would suggest we 
really should be doing it for the next time. Now that this process 
is under way and has already been suspended once before I do 
not think there is any way we could get ourselves involved in it 
without the fairly obvious charges of gerrymandering and the 
other things we are beginning to read about in the newspapers. 
That is how we should be handling the particular issue.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	On the number of seats we repeat once again our offer to the 
government. When processes have been suspended or changed 
in the past it has been because there has been an alteration to the 
amending formula. If there really is concern about costs and the 
number of MPs we would be prepared to support an amendment 
to that effect. It would provide a reason to suspend the process 
the public would support. In the absence of that there is no 
reason given.
<P>
	Let me just conclude by making one last statement. I noted 
very carefully the remarks of my friend from the Bloc 
Quebecois who talked about Quebec's need for one quarter of 
the seats in the House of Commons. I have wondered what was 
behind the Official Opposition being involved in a government 
desire to change the rules of the electoral game. I hope it is not 
another back door Meech Lake or Charlottetown. That particular 
provision is not helpful.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Kamloops indicated the real loser is 
British Columbia. The real opposition to the particular direction 
of setting up a quarter of the seats was by British Columbia. It 
would require a constitutional amendment. I hope there is no 
way we will come up with a back door formula through this 
process that will produce that kind of effect. I look forward to 
saying more at third reading.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when I spoke in the first debate on this bill, we 
accepted the two-year delay. The Reform Party's arguments 
against this delay were not considered valid, but we understood 
that they were fundamentally opposed to it.
<P>
	However, today we are faced with an in-between position 
which I think is the worst of the worst. This amendment would 
have the consultation go on so long that I think it is totally 
inefficient. I think that over the Easter break, when we were in 
our ridings more, the people clearly told us that they had other 
concerns besides redrawing the electoral map. People in Quebec  
and Canada now want someone to really fight unemployment; 
they do not want to be satisfied with crumbs like the 
infrastructure program.
<P>
	As for the deficit, people were so amazed by the decisions of 
this government which, after crying wolf for months, brought 
forth a mouse. When we tell them that we will debate whether 
the reform of the electoral map should proceed right away, in 
two years or be amended after twelve months, they think that we 
are not doing the work we are paid to do. I think that the Reform 
Party is contradicting itself on some other essential aspects of 
its program.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2903"> 2903 </A></B>
<P>
	However, some Reform members took the floor to say that the 
Bloc Quebecois was a party that wanted to break up Canada, that 
wanted to use the back door, as with Meech Lake or 
Charlottetown, to arrive at another kind of reform. I would like 
to tell them that the Charlottetown Accord was rejected not only 
by Quebec but by all of Canada. I think that Canadians were 
right to do so. They thought that they should oppose all the 
elected governments in Canada which were offering them 
something cooked up in secret that did not at all meet their 
needs.
<P>
	As for Meech Lake, Quebec did not prevent it from being 
passed. Its provisions were certainly a bare minimum for 
Quebec, but it was not necessarily us who had it set it aside. But 
it made Quebeckers aware that, in the end, our problem is not a 
matter of plumbing but of architecture.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	In this respect, for Canada to take the time to think about the 
electoral map is not a bad thing because we have basic decisions 
to make on the future structure of Canada as a whole, whether 
there will be two countries. It is a decision Quebeckers will be 
called upon to make in the near future. I think it is much more 
important to start off by settling the basic question of the most 
appropriate structure for the future we want to have.
<P>
	As far as ``breaking up Canada'' is concerned, I would like to 
say that no country in the world lasts forever. Structures change 
and, just as the caterpillar develops into a butterfly, there is a 
way to change and adjust to new realities. Today's economic 
markets are very big; it is no longer necessary to be as big as the 
economic markets we are dealing with. That being the case, I 
think it is important to give ourselves appropriate structures. We 
can give ourselves enough time to think about what form the 
Canadian electoral map we lived with last year should take in the 
future, so that we can make wise decisions and take into account 
other factors besides population distribution.
<P>
	In a region such as eastern Quebec, the proposed reform of the 
electoral map eliminates one riding and creates another where 
there is a distance of 300 kilometres between two cities. I 
reiterate what I said earlier: 300 kilometres in summer and 1,000 
kilometres in winter. Such decisions or recommendations by a  
commission fulfilling its mandate under the current legislation 
were totally inapplicable and unacceptable, and we prepared to 
intervene before the electoral commission to argue for 
maintaining the ridings in eastern Quebec. We were ready to do 
so.
<P>
	This bill was undoubtedly tabled late because it puts us in a 
funny situation where we must prepare in case passage of the bill 
is delayed while fulfilling our mandate as members of 
Parliament because, as members of the Bloc, we made a 
commitment to look after Quebec's interests. We are doing so 
now in the current context, under this government, to ensure 
that, if Quebeckers decide to stay within Canada, they have the 
best tools available. But we think they will make a different 
choice, especially when we see the federal Parliament spend so 
much time on such issues that we are entitled to question 
effectiveness and dual representation in Canada. I think there 
are more fundamental issues to put forward before spending a 
whole day debating whether the suspension period should be 12 
or 24 months.
<P>
	We could ask ourselves whether it is worthwhile to spend so 
much time debating this. I think the Reform Party should 
examine its amendments to this bill when it argues, strangely 
enough, that the Bloc Quebecois wants to break up Canada, 
since the Bloc will vote with the Government of Canada on this 
bill. It is not a matter of basic principles but of effectiveness, 
political realism and respect for the people who should have 
enough time to influence the political system and the electoral 
commissions so that future decisions take into account other 
factors besides the purely demographic aspects provided for in 
the act, as I was saying earlier.
<P>
	In conclusion, I think it is important to take into account, for 
example, the number of municipalities or the area to be covered 
so that when the map is redrawn in 24 months, it will be what 
Quebeckers and Canadians want, unless Quebeckers decide 
before then to give themselves a political structure that is much 
more appropriate for their development.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	I am confident that is what will happen in the coming year. I 
think we should put all our energy into making our political 
structures more adequate and not only into fixing the plumbing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted White (North Vancouver):</B> Mr. Speaker, at a time 
when our dollar is plunging and our interest rates are on the rise, 
the Liberal government should be ashamed of what it is trying to 
do with Bill C-18. It is imposing the will of unhappy Liberal 
MPs on the voters of Canada, members who perhaps are worried 
that they will not be re-elected to collect their gold plated 
pension plans.
<P>
	I do not think they will be re-elected anyway. Therefore, they 
should support the amendments that we have proposed or 
preferably should defeat this Bill C-18 altogether.
<P>
	Without regard to the huge investment of time by the 
Electoral Boundaries Commissions and without regard to the 
millions of dollars which have already been spent on a 
non-partisan process, the government is going to ram through 
an ill-conceived and selfish piece of legislation.
<P>
	Politicians have no business setting their own electoral 
boundaries. Human nature dictates that members could act in 
their own interests to trim areas of opposition from their ridings 
or to add little pieces of support to their ridings. Even if that did 
not happen there could be the suspicion that it was happening.
<P>
	The important thing is that the whole process should be seen 
to be non-partisan. Politicians should have absolutely nothing 
to do with the process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2904"> 2904 </A></B>
<P>
	To illustrate this point I would like to mention something that 
was said by a government member earlier in this debate. That 
member claimed that Reformers were being inconsistent in 
wanting to amend Bill C-18 to alter the period of suspension to 
12 months. Reform originally argued against the proposed 18 
month suspension because it would have given the Liberal 
government an advantage in deciding when the election would 
be and in deciding whether the old boundaries or some new 
boundaries would apply during the next election.
<P>
	In negotiations Reform took the position that either 24 
months or 12 months was better than 18 because at least then it 
would be clear what was going to happen. Of course we prefer 
the 12 month suspension because at least the process could get 
restarted again and we have a chance that the non-partisan 
process would be completed before the next election.
<P>
	All hon. members who value democracy should work to 
defeat Bill C-18 and at the very least should agree to the 
suspension by 12 months rather than the 24.
<P>
	I join many other members who have spoken against Bill 
C-18 in expressing my concern that B.C. is the province that 
will be most hurt by the bill. The increase in population of B.C. 
entitles us to two more seats in the House. Even if we were to 
hold the number of seats constant, at the very least they should 
be redistributed to give a more fair representation for the 
province of B.C.
<P>
	In my riding of North Vancouver the proposed changes would 
take a small section at the eastern end of my riding, isolated 
between the harbour to the east, the harbour to the south, the 
mountains to the north and sort of append it to another riding on 
the other side of the harbour, the riding of Port 
Moody-Coquitlam.
<P>
	The people in that part of my riding can see that is an 
impractical way to re-arrange the riding. It is very clear that the 
member in the Port Moody-Coquitlam area would have to 
move through two other ridings in order to get to this little 
appendage that would suddenly be attached to her riding.
<P>
	However, even though it is clear that isolating this small 
portion of North Vancouver is not in the public  interest, the 
voters in my area have confidence in the process. They have 
confidence that by appeal to the commission that this decision 
would be reversed and a much more sensible decision would be 
made.
<P>
	Everyone can see from looking at the map that this particular 
adjustment was not sensible. Even I, living in that portion and 
will have my home transferred to another riding, agree with the 
process and I am prepared to take my chances with the 
commission and the hearings.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	I vigorously oppose Bill C-18. I am proud that the Reform 
Party members can stand and say that they were against this 
government attempt to ram the bill through in a clandestine 
fashion on a Friday afternoon when nobody is watching style of 
thing.
<P>
	In time Canadians will recognize that Reformers once again 
stood up for democracy while the government stood up for the 
old line Victorian style of politics. Shame on them, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> S.O.S. Save our seats.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (North Vancouver):</B> As the hon. member says, 
S.O.S. Save our seats. That is the whole attitude of the Liberal 
government. I urge them to take the moral high road and to vote 
against this bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, as you rightly 
stated, last October 25, I was elected to represent the riding of 
Shefford. Let me first describe my wonderful riding. As you 
know, the region was settled by a group of Americans who came 
to Canada when the United States seceded from England. Thus, 
it is part of Quebec's Eastern Townships.
<P>
	Over time, the boundaries of the riding changed and now 
include part of Montérégie, and, as I mentioned, part of the 
riding is in the Eastern Townships.
<P>
	Shefford is partly an urban riding. The main city is Granby, a 
well-organized industrial city. The people of Granby are 
hard-working and they are proud of their roots.
<P>
	I have lived virtually all my life in Shefford. At times, I 
moved from one area to another, but I never left the riding.
<P>
	A proposal has been made to change my riding, to reduce its 
size. Other ridings would be extended while mine would be 
reduced to the size of the provincial riding of Shefford, 
including the town of Bromont. As you know, there is much 
discussion these days about Bromont, because of the Hyundai 
plant. Bromont is currently my neighbour. I would like members 
in the House to know that Bromont was previously known as 
West Shefford. This city was then part of the former riding of 
Shefford. Of course, we would welcome its constituents in the 
proposed new riding of Shefford, but, to do so, we would have to 
lose an entire section of the riding. So, the sector which includes  
Saint-Paul-d'Abbotsford, Saint-Césaire and Marieville is to be 
removed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2905"> 2905 </A></B>
<P>
	In fact, my riding is being downsized tremendously, while the 
neighbouring one, Chambly, will become extremely large with a 
population of over 100,000. While my constituency would have 
some 72,000 or 75,000 people, the one next to it would become 
exceedingly large.
<P>
	I believe that the role of a member of Parliament is to 
represent his or her constituents. I think one of the objectives of 
this bill is to make ridings more or less equal in terms of 
population. If this is the case, we are missing the boat because, 
as I was saying, my constituency is going to become much less 
populated, while neighbouring ridings will be much larger.
<P>
	In view of this situation, I decided to consult the 
municipalities. I asked members of my staff to consult 
municipalities and also contact other political parties in the 
riding. Because as you know, Mr. Speaker, we Bloc Quebecois 
members do not aspire to remain part of Canada, part of the 
Government of Canada any longer than necessary. However, one 
thing is certain: we have to think about the interests of those 
whom we represent.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	As my colleague was saying earlier, we do not know what the 
future holds, but if what we want to do here cannot be fully 
achieved, Quebeckers will continue to be represented here in 
Ottawa, which is something we do not wish, as I mentioned 
earlier. It is in the interests of our constituents that we consulted 
a large number of our municipalities, if not all of them, since one 
of them told us that it did not really care. As you know, there are 
municipalities close to the boundaries which change ridings 
every time a readjustment is made. The municipality of 
Saint-Valérien, in Shefford, told us that it would like to become 
part of the beautiful riding of Saint-Hyacinthe.
<P>
	We can certainly understand that, since the residents of 
Saint-Valérien have constantly been moved from one riding to 
the other following these readjustments, but this is somewhat 
unfortunate. These people do not feel as close to the heart of the 
riding which is the city of Granby.
<P>
	On the other hand, the municipalities of Saint-Césaire, 
Saint-Paul-d'Abbotsford and L'Ange-Gardien, all beautiful 
villages which I hope you will come to visit when you have a 
chance, Mr. Speaker, have sent us council resolutions asking 
that they remain in the riding of Shefford because they feel part 
of it. These people have always gone shopping in Granby on 
Thursday or Friday evening. They do their business in that city. I 
believe that it would be somewhat unfortunate for them to 
become part of another riding.
<P>
	The small municipality of Béthanie sent me a fax of its 
council resolution which I want to read because I find it 
interesting:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas if the electoral boundaries readjustment is approved, the electoral 
quota of Shefford would only be 73,351, which is less than the majority of other 
constituencies; Whereas Béthanie is located very close to Granby and several 
services are provided to us by Granby, including ambulances, provincial police, 
hospital and other services, the municipality of Béthanie wishes to remain part 
of the constituency of Shefford, since it participated in the election of its 
member of Parliament, Jean Leroux, and it wishes to keep being represented by 
him. It is also easier to communicate with him, since there is no long distance 
charge and since his office is closer to our area.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This resolution was carried unanimously, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Nice going.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Shefford):</B> Mr. Speaker, Béthanie is a small 
municipality. On election day, there is only one polling station, 
and the majority of people there voted for the Bloc Quebecois. 
Since they live on the periphery of the riding, they have asked to 
remain part of Shefford, and that to me is what is important. The 
people who make up the constituency are the ones who should 
have the last word.
<P>
	And we are going to stand up for these people and defend the 
interests of these small municipalities. I think they have their 
say in this matter.
<P>
	A member is elected to represent all the residents of his or her 
riding. What this bill does is divide my riding in two and make 
the constituents who will have to leave the riding feel like 
temporary residents. To me, that is unacceptable. I think we 
should not let these citizens down, and I certainly have no 
intention of doing so. All of my constituents are entitled to 
equitable services.
<P>
	Members are elected to represent their ridings and that is what 
we are doing here, in this House. Each and every one of us, 
whatever our political affiliation is, has a role to play, which is 
to represent our constituents. We also have the privilege to sit in 
this House and speak when we want to. This is a privilege which 
is not extended to all citizens. The people put their trust in us and 
we are here to represent their views. When we rise to speak in 
this House, we talk on behalf of our constituents. On the matter 
of electoral boundaries readjustment, our task is made very 
easy. We intend to make our position known to the Commission, 
because we think it is fair and equitable. If there are some 
municipalities which have not expressed the desire to stay in 
Shefford, we respect their decision. However, the vast majority 
of municipalities which are affected want to remain part of 
Shefford. As a member of Parliament, I intend to protect the 
interests of these people.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Before resuming debate, I 
want to thank the hon. member for Shefford for his invitation. I 
must say that I have travelled to Granby several times, with my 
wife, my children and other members of my family, to 
participate in hockey tournaments in winter and to visit Granby 
Zoo in 
<P>

<P>
summer. I wish to thank the hon. member again for his 
invitation. We always got a warm welcome.
<P>
	Resuming debate. The hon. member for Fraser Valley East.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, on that 
invitation you would be a busy person because I am sure you will 
be invited to all our ridings.
<P>
	I am always impressed-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would accept all 
invitations. If I accept them all I might have to speak to what 
other members referred to earlier, a new mode of travel possibly. 
I do not know if it was a seat sale that was alluded to or 
otherwise, but I will accept all invitations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, I always take heart, and it happens 
so frequently in the House as the previous hon. member 
mentioned, in talking about privileges of the House. The other 
thing that always impresses me is how passionately every 
member speaks about his or her own riding as they introduce the 
subject of what it is that makes their riding. Often it is called a 
microcosm of the Canadian identity. Often each member in their 
own way does represent that here in the House and it is always 
encouraging to me when I hear members talking with pride 
about their constituencies. Of course I do extend an invitation to 
you, especially since last week it was 24 degrees in Fraser Valley 
East. But I do not want to rub that in.
<P>
	I do want to address the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment 
Suspension Act and also our proposed Reform Party 
amendments to it which I think would make it more palatable to 
Canadians and to those of us who are concerned with certain 
parts of this suspension procedure.
<P>
	There is of course a huge boundary readjustment of my own 
that I am faced with in Fraser Valley East. The boundaries have 
now been extended to include the Merritt-Princeton area of the 
interior of B.C. It would make a logistical nightmare in some 
senses for me to try to service a riding that has three separate 
highways, each with one small town at the end of it. It would be 
very difficult.
<P>
	I think it is important that we deal with the principle involved, 
not my own personal feelings about whether I agree with the 
adjustments in my own riding, in boundary alignments and 
readjustments. That is what I would like to address here this 
morning.
<P>
	There are five particular reasons why I think this bill should 
never become law. First, I believe it thwarts the purpose of 
Parliament in the electoral process. The Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act requires the readjustment of the federal 
electoral boundaries every 10 years. That is a requirement of an 
act of Parliament that has already been passed.
<P>
	The first eight sections of the act deal with the appointment of 
the commissions that will decide these issues for the provinces 
and how those commissions are made up, how they are 
appointed and so on.
<P>
	The important thing is that these commissions have almost a 
judicial impartiality. It is important that they have the freedom 
to make choices based on the impartiality that they supposedly 
have based on the requirements of the act.
<P>
	When the Speaker or the chief justice of each province 
appoints someone to the commission, those are almost judicial 
positions. We have to accept that they are without prejudice. I 
believe we have to go along with their ideas at least as it fits into 
the process or else we thwart the purpose of Parliament.
<P>
	Parliament specifically and importantly prohibits anyone in 
the Senate or anyone who is a member of Parliament from being 
part of that commission. The reason of course is because they do 
not want political interference. They do not want the 
partisanship that could enter into electoral boundary 
redistribution to be a part of it. It has to be impartial and it has to 
be seen to be impartial.
<P>
	The timeliness of these changes is also important to me.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	It states in section 13 of the act that as soon as possible after 
the completion of any decennial census, which is every 10 years, 
the chief statistician gives a report to the chief electoral officer 
and they calculate the seats and so on. The important thing here 
is the timeliness. As soon as possible after a census we need to 
make our redistribution so that we can more accurately reflect 
the needs of the shifting populations and so on in each of the 
provinces. ``Then each commission shall prepare'', it says under 
section 14, ``with all reasonable dispatch a report.''
<P>
	The last census was in 1991, which is already going back three 
years, and so timeliness has already been thwarted once, I 
believe, by the last Parliament because it suspended the act for 
two years. That is not a big thing in some people's minds, but 
again it thwarts an impartial boundary readjustment. I am very 
nervous when parliamentarians interfere with what I believe 
should be an independent body and an independent report.
<P>
	All boundaries were supposed to be redrawn as soon as 
possible after 1991. The last bill, C-67, halted the whole 
process. All 11 government commissions were eliminated. It 
was a total waste of their time and effort and the money 
involved.
<P>
	I wonder why at this time we have to again dive into this 
process and shut the whole thing down again, with another $5 
million being spent. I can only speculate. I know the new 
boundaries may be inconvenient but they are inconvenient for us 
all. Politics never was totally convenient. It could be that MPs 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2907"> 2907 </A></B>
<P>
have to make new political contacts as their boundaries are 
shifted. Be that as it may, that is also part of this impartiality. It 
could even include boundaries in some areas that traditionally 
vote against the member. Some areas vote stronger for  certain 
parties than others. Possibly that has caused some concern on 
the government side.
<P>
	I am not sure what it is but regardless of how you slice it we 
are three years late already in what was supposed to be a very 
timely thing and now we are going to put it off for another two 
years, which means there will be another election and so on.
<P>
	I think it is a mistake to keep putting off what should be an 
independent-I repeat independent-review. Our first 
amendment to this bill is that we should bring in a report. If we 
are going to have this interference, we should at least have it in 
place for the next federal election.
<P>
	I am concerned about B.C. which is the fastest growing 
province and which already should have an extra two or three 
seats. We are going to go into the next century with the same 
number of seats and the same distribution that we had in 1981. 
Since 1981 we have had from within Canada alone over 40,000 
people move to B.C., mainly from Ontario. There is a shift in 
population westward. There are 35,000 additional people who 
came from overseas. We get 20 per cent of all Canada's 
immigrants. B.C.'s population continues to grow at a faster rate 
than the rest of Canada and yet we are going to be stuck with a 
proportional representation that is mired in the 1980s.
<P>
	People in B.C. have mentioned that this is unfair, it is not 
proportional representation, and it is going to skew the power 
base away from the growing population centres and leave it in 
the eastern areas, some of which have been nice enough to send 
us their people to populate B.C.
<P>
	I am not sure if that is the intention of the government in 
bringing this in. I am not sure if it is concerned about 
maintaining a power base where it happens to have most of its 
seats. I am not sure exactly why it has been done.
<P>
	I come back to the idea of impartiality, that Canadians have to 
accept and have to know with regard to boundary readjustments 
and the way this is put together that the people who sit on the 
commission are not political hacks. They are not doing things 
for the favour or the benefit of any one party. They are doing it 
truly for the benefit of the democratic process. I think that is 
thwarted, especially by delaying it for two years, which means 
another election that we would have to go through.
<P>
	I support our first amendment which would bring it forward in 
a more timely fashion and would allow us to get on with 
whatever changes the government deems necessary in time for 
the next election. That could take some of the sting out of this. 
Some of the waste and so on would be easier to accept if we 
knew that a timely settlement of some sort was in the 
government's mind. I wish it would consider that first 
amendment thoughtfully.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	I mentioned earlier the whole idea of cost. All the 
commission's work and the money spent in 1991 and 1992 were 
wasted. On the current process all of us  received in the mail or 
saw in the newspapers a proposal for boundary readjustments. I 
have already asked to make a submission to the commission 
about boundary readjustments. I have some ideas, and all of us 
are free to make presentations to them.
<P>
	Those meetings have been set up. They have been advertised. 
The entire newspaper propaganda idea through which all these 
ideas were sent to every Canadian household has taken place at 
huge expense. That expense is all for nought. It is a waste of the 
commissioners' time and it is a waste of our money.
<P>
	I realize that $5 million is not the end of the world in some 
people's minds, but as a couple of people coming out of 
Parliament once said, a billion here and a billion there soon adds 
up to real money. Possibly government should consider that 
every $5 million is a significant amount of money, not just a 
chunk of change.
<P>
	For all of the reasons that I mentioned earlier and especially 
because this has been done behind closed doors and brought in 
by closure and so on, it leaves a very bad taste in my mouth. I 
hope the government will accept an amendment that will bring it 
in before the next election and restore faith in the impartiality of 
our Electoral Boundaries Commission.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> I am 
pleased to take part in this debate, Mr. Speaker, all the more so 
since I did not have a chance to speak at the time of the first 
debate because the guillotine went down before I could take the 
floor.
<P>
	I want to take advantage of the motion moved by the Reform 
Party to tell you a little about my constituency and explain to 
you why this amendment by the Reform Party is unenforceable 
or illogical.
<P>
	The object of the main motion is to reduce the suspension 
period of the law from 24 to 12 months and to delete sections 3 
and 4 of the said bill. Since it will take more than 24 months to 
redress the illogical readjustments made to several 
constituencies, I am against shortening the suspension period of 
this act.
<P>
	And I will tell you why. My native constituency was in turn 
called Berthier-Maskinongé, 
Berthier-Maskinongé-Lanaudière and, finally, 
Berthier-Montcalm. It was moved geographically from left to 
right without ever finding its true niche and it seems to me that 
following each and every adjustment, the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2908"> 2908 </A></B>
<P>
people most concerned were still making the same complaints 
and the same comments.
<P>
	That is why, even though I sincerely hope that the people of 
Quebec will know where their interests and the best interests of 
Quebec lie in a possible referendum, I decided to hold a major 
consultation with my constituents.
<P>
	Promoting Quebec's sovereignty should not prevent me from 
doing that since the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act is 
still in force. I think it is my duty as  a member of Parliament to 
follow the work of a commission which will ultimately cost 
Canadian taxpayers more that $4 million, of which $1 million 
will be paid by Quebec taxpayers whom I represent here.
<P>
	One should also remember that, following a referendum win 
in Quebec, a referendum or even an election could be called at 
the national level. Somebody had to keep an eye on things, and 
to follow the situation closely.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I came to Ottawa to defend Quebec's interests and I think that 
changes to electoral boundaries are in Quebec's interest. That is 
why I asked some volunteers in my riding to consult the people.
<P>
	I think that if a member of Parliament wants to make 
representations to the commission, he should not base them only 
on his personal assessment of the situation, but on what his 
constituents told him. I based my position on those 
consultations and I will make a few comments in this regard 
later.
<P>
	In addition to those consultations, I have known my riding for 
30 years. As a lawyer, I was called to the court houses of 
Terrebonne, Joliette, Trois-Rivières and Shawinigan. The 
jurisdiction of each one of those courts encompasses a small part 
of my riding, which is very large.
<P>
	Since 1986, I have had the chance to study the communities of 
my riding and get to know them a little. In 1988, my political 
activities gave me the opportunity to learn more about all those 
communities. I think that I know the geography, needs, history 
and characteristics of my riding and its social, economic and 
political organizations very well. But still, I believe that was not 
enough to make a fair presentation to the commission.
<P>
	Despite a member's attachment to the riding that he 
represents, he cannot decide alone on the representations that he 
will make to the electoral boundaries commission for Quebec to 
maintain or to modify the area that he represents.
<P>
	That is why, as I was saying earlier, I undertook a consultation 
process with the help of volunteers, and I should take this 
opportunity to thank people like Ghislaine Guilbault, Raymonde 
Gaudreault, Jean-Marc Ferland and my staff for their good and 
loyal services. They all had to work very hard to contact 83 
municipalities, RCMs and organizations affected by the new 
boundaries proposed by the commission for the riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm.
<P>
	Of all the parties that were contacted, 25 took the time to write 
to me and 12 got in touch with me directly to make comments. I 
think it is important because many of them told me: ``Michel, we 
are taking the time to talk to you because we know, having done 
so in the past, that it is useless to submit a brief or make 
proposals to the commission. We think that if a member makes  
representations on our behalf, he is more likely to be listened 
to.''
<P>
	I have to say that several municipal politicians have also 
complained about the commission's reasoning, which they find 
inconsistent. In trying to solve one problem, the commission is 
creating another. People say among other things that, in Quebec, 
boundaries of the RCMs were generally taken into account in the 
proposed electoral map, but not in the riding of 
Berthier-Montcalm. In this case, they are being split up to 
satisfy some mathematical criterion.
<P>
	It also became evident, through these consultations, that 
many people are frustrated because they were not able to take 
part in the process until the new boundaries were almost 
imposed on Canadians. You will understand that the amendment 
proposed by the Reform Party does not satisfy them, and I am 
certainly in a position to tell you so.
<P>
	Representatives of one municipality even told me that they 
disagreed completely with the proposals that they saw in the 
newspapers, but did not intend to submit a brief or make other 
representations to the commission. The mayor of this 
municipality told me, and I quote: ``The commission must take 
into account various considerations that cannot be reflected in a 
single brief. So preparing a brief becomes too arduous a task. 
My position is based on experience, having submitted briefs to 
two commissions in the past''.
<P>
	Another mayor pointed out to me on April 8 that the new 
boundaries were detrimental to his municipality. He wrote: ``I 
want to draw your attention to the drawbacks resulting from 
such a drastic change for us and our neighbours from 
Sainte-Lucie and Val-des-Lacs, a population already penalized 
by the economic situation and absolutely dependent on a social 
centre with its activities, its schools, its shopping facilities, its 
social services, the LCSC and the Laurentides General 
Hospital.'' He concluded: ``It is obvious that the commission is 
ill-informed about our priorities and our needs''.
<P>
	I contacted this mayor and he told me: ``Mr. Bellehumeur, I 
will not submit a brief because I am sure that I will not be heard, 
that nobody will listen to me''.

	Mr. Speaker, I cannot help but conclude that reviewing the 
electoral boundaries is not just a matter of mathematics. There 
might not be general agreement about this, but I think it is wrong 
to say that since there are six million people in Quebec, you just 
have to divide this number by 75 to get the average number of 
people to be included in each riding. I think there are much more 
appropriate, fair and accurate criteria that seem not to have been 
applied.
<P>
	One of them that comes up often is services provided to the 
public. Another is administrative regions. It is illogical to split 
an RCM that has been part of the riding of Berthier-Montcalm, 
or of Berthier-Maskinongé  -Lanaudière since Confederation 
and to transfer it to the neighbouring riding of Joliette. As I was 
saying a moment ago, there are many such cases. The criteria the 
commission seems to have applied in drawing the new 
boundaries have not been respected in my county. Maybe I am 
unlucky, but that is a fact!
<P>
	Then, as for accessibility, is it right that the boundary of a 
riding run through a neighbouring riding? Is it right to create 
some kind of doughnut hole in the middle of a federal riding? I 
do not think so. Has anyone stopped for five minutes to consider 
whether in terms of geography and accessibility this was viable 
for taxpayers? I think no one considered that kind of concern for 
very long.
<P>
	There are also other criteria that could be examined, but this is 
not the place to do it. In my capacity as member for 
Berthier-Montcalm, I intend to submit a brief if the issue is not 
settled in the House by April 20. Mr. Speaker, any member who 
wants to represent his riding, as is his duty, should listen to his 
constituents. But when you want to get things done, it is much 
better to deal with one member instead of two as the reeve of the 
D'Autray RCM said. That makes perfect sense and everybody in 
this House would agree that this should be a consideration.
<P>
	It is not just a matter of drawing boundaries on a map. The 
whole context should be examined and consultation should take 
place before any proposal is made. People should be involved 
instead of being presented with a fait accompli. We should be 
listening to the wishes of the people and try to reconcile 
contradictory views and ideas that do not quite fit. Most of all, 
we should avoid the traditional practice of forcing new ridings 
on people.
<P>
	During the last election campaign, I realized much to my 
surprise that constituents in the Montcalm area of my riding did 
not know they were part of the riding of Berthier-Montcalm. 
They all thought they were part of the Joliette riding and were 
wondering what I was doing there. Most likely, they did not see 
much of their former member. True, he needed two terms to get 
to know the extent of his own riding, so it is easy to understand 
the confusion the constituents were in.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will have concluded by now that I oppose the 
amendment since much more than 24 months would be 
necessary to correct all those deficiencies. And two years is not 
that long, after all. Canada may then have only 220 ridings to 
readjust so that there will be savings there for everybody.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly):</B> Mr. Speaker, my friend and 
colleague, the member for Shefford, talked about my riding, 
Chambly, a little while ago. Two weeks ago, before the Easter 
recess, I said in this House that I did not understand why a 
number of voters of my colleague's riding were transferred to 
mine, and why the population of my riding increased from 
75,000 to 110,000 while the population of his riding decreased 
from 110,000 to 75,000. I still do not understand.
<P>
	As my friend from the Reform Party said, are we proceeding 
with this readjustment simply because the act says that we have 
to do it every ten years? Are we doing this for the fun of it, 
because the act says we have to do it once every ten years, 
without asking ourselves if it is appropriate, if it is good or not? 
That is not important, just do it.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	The member for Maskinongé-Montcalm just said that his 
new riding will be full of holes. On the South Shore of Montreal, 
and I assume no one did it on purpose, this electoral 
redistribution, by a curious coincidence, will result in the 
Liberal party standing to gain another riding in the next election 
because on the South Shore or in the Eastern Townships the 
riding of Saint-Lambert will have a strong contingent of new 
Canadians. But I assume that is only a coincidence and not a 
calculated Machiavellian act.
<P>
	All of us in this House, like the member for Beauséjour, who 
is always flashing that smile that we all like, or like the members 
of the Reform Party, did not suddenly become members of 
Parliament. Before being elected to this House, you must work a 
long time, get involved in your riding, and meet your 
constituents. You know, it could be that our door-to-door 
campaign for the last election was only the end of a cycle. But I 
am sure that the member for Beauséjour and all the other 
members of this House have spent many years-10 or 15 years 
or more-criss-crossing their ridings and meeting 
disadvantaged groups, social groups, unions, employers in some 
cases, fishermen for people in the maritimes.
<P>
	We did not become members of Parliament by chance. We 
were chosen, elected and sent here by the people. And by 
constantly rubbing shoulders with these people, which 
frequently happens almost instinctively, the members here 
present have embraced or somewhat adopted their constituents' 
philosophy, so they generally come here with a precise idea of 
the philosophy or opinion or direction that they convey in their 
respective 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2910"> 2910 </A></B>
<P>
riding. Making an electoral division just because the Elections 
Act says it has to be done every ten years seems to ignore that 
aspect of the job of a member of Parliament.
<P>
	In my case, for example, I will be called to represent between 
30,000 and 35,000 new constituents, whom I do not know, in 
municipalities-I heard earlier my colleague in front of me 
mention municipalities like Béthanie and so on-where I never 
set foot in my life. And overnight, I will have to represent these 
people. There are group dynamics emerging in our society. 
People get used to living together, they arrive at a consensus and 
convey it to their member of Parliament if he or she has not 
already perceived it naturally.
<P>
	In my case, I am afraid that I do not know what people whom I 
do not know might want. And if we are to simply change 
numbers, I am sure that my colleague from Shefford would be a 
much better representative of  these people than I, because I 
simply do not know these municipalities, these RCMs, these 
potential constituents.
<P>
	Of course, the Bloc Quebecois will make it its duty to 
represent everybody in Quebec. But the fact remains that for 
specific or particular aspects, the member for Shefford, who is 
already there, would certainly do a better job than I, because of 
the group dynamics and the thinking of people in these regions. 
He would be able to pinpoint what should be done in that riding, 
whereas for me, as a new member to these people, by the time I 
go around and get acquainted with everybody's problems, by the 
time I get to know their municipalities and the problems of these 
municipalities and these RCMs, I am afraid these people will 
suffer the consequences. Therefore, I do not agree with the 
argument that democracy requires that the electoral boundaries 
be readjusted every ten years, no matter what comes out of the 
process.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	The county of Chambly which I represent and which has about 
75,000 constituents is relatively dense. Mr. Speaker, you said 
earlier that you travel a lot, especially in the county of Shefford. 
Unfortunately, I never had the pleasure to see you in the county 
of Chambly, but I hope that you went through it. If not, I invite 
you to visit it.
<P>
	The Richelieu River runs right through my county from one 
end to the other. My county is the heartland of the Patriots. 
Therefore, I am not the first independentist mentioned in the 
House of Commons. Incidentally, I was informed recently that 
five independentists from Beloeil had lost their lives during the 
battle of the Patriots, in 1837. These people, some Préfontaines 
and some Lafrances from Beloeil, are from my county. The 
reason I mention the period of 1837 is because these people live 
together and know each other. They were builders. They built 
bridges on the famous Richelieu river. They built churches, they 
built their parish. These people are used to living together. There 
is a spirit of community among the residents of a same region. It 
is an unwritten tradition, but it exists all the same.
<P>
	When you add 35,000 new electors whom he does not know to 
an MP, you distort the group dynamics, to the detriment not of 
the MP or the federal government, but of the constituents 
concerned. Now if you want to talk about more practical things, 
take telephone communications.
<P>
	In my riding, things are not as bad. From one end of my riding 
to the other, people cannot call one another direct and have to 
make a long-distance call. As far as I am concerned, as a 
member of Parliament, if I want to be able to serve my 
constituents and be available, I have my office in the middle of 
the riding where I can call everywhere without high charges to 
my government, meaning the taxpayers. Also, my constituents 
can call me from anywhere in the riding without having to pay 
long-distance bills. For some people, specifically older people, 
long-distance charges are significant and  unforseen expenses, 
particularly when they have to speak to their elected 
representative, which can penalize them.
<P>
	So imagine the surprise when I was told that people in my 
riding would have to constantly use Bell Canada long-distance 
service in order to communicate with their elected 
representative. That could be very expensive for them. You 
could argue that it is only a small technical problem. But when 
we are talking about the representation of members of 
Parliament, there is a risk in doing that, because we could 
become less and less representative through such occurrences. 
This redistribution of the electoral map could prevent members 
of Parliament from doing their job. This is my first concern.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in this House to speak in favour of the 
motions that the Reform Party has placed before all members of 
this House today. I do this because I feel so strongly that we need 
changes in government. We need changes in the way we have 
been operating.
<P>
	These amendments to this motion would limit the delay to 12 
months on this process and would formally keep the 
commissioners who are already in place. I am very strongly in 
favour of those motions. Of course my preference and the 
preference of all members of the Reform Party would be that 
Bill C-18 not proceed at all.
<P>
	I am an ordinary Canadian, an ordinary person. I have serious 
concerns about the things that have been happening in this 
country such as the way our country has been run, the enormous 
deficit and debt that all Canadians face, and unemployment. One 
of the biggest items that every member in this House heard 
people speak about during the election campaign was that 
Canadians wanted more accountability. That is worth repeating. 
The Canadian people demanded more accountability from their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2911"> 2911 </A></B>
<P>
elected representatives during this last election. They demand it 
now and they want to see it.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	This is a sad, sad day for ordinary Canadians, for ordinary 
people. What has happened here is that the government 
members opposite are trying to ram through something that 
takes away a process that the ordinary people in this country can 
get involved in. They can make their presentations and 
recommendations to a body that has been set up for 
redistribution of electoral boundaries. It is a sad day and I urge 
everyone in this House to think about that. People want more 
involvement in government and the government is taking that 
away from them.
<P>
	This bill sends a message loud and clear that the government 
and members opposite and some members on this side do not 
believe that people should be more involved in what happens in 
the process. They do not believe that what happens in this House 
should be a part of what the people of Canada are thinking.
<P>
	I spent some time in the last two weeks in my riding. I heard of 
major concerns throughout the riding about the way the 
redistribution was laid out. We would be losing two 
communities in my riding which have a strong economic tie to 
the rest of the region of Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt 
which I represent. Merritt and Princeton would become 
separated from that riding and would join Coquihalla riding, a 
new riding that would be established in B.C.
<P>
	I had a meeting with the mayor and council of Merritt while I 
was there last week. They want to make their presentation. They 
want to go to the commission. They want to submit a 
presentation on behalf of the people of Merritt. That sounds like 
a good idea. It sounds like a way for all people to get involved if 
they have concerns. It is not up to us in this House to draw the 
boundaries, to draw the lines.
<P>
	The reason this whole process was established was so that 
politicians would not be able to tamper or tinker with the 
drawings of electoral boundaries.
<P>
	I have had the opportunity to speak to many of my friends 
across the way in conversations over coffee and sometimes just 
in the hallways or on the bus from the Confederation Building to 
here. I have heard from them the underlying reason for trying to 
stop the redistribution process. They know it is taking way some 
Liberal stronghold areas. There is no other reason. They are 
tampering in a process that was set up so that the government 
and members of Parliament could not tamper with it.
<P>
	It is unacceptable that this is going on. Possibly, as one other 
member of the Reform Party has already indicated, this is even 
unconstitutional. It is a sad day for Canadians. It is a sad day for 
all of us.
<P>
	There has been a lot of talk about the cost of this process. Let 
us take a look at the costs. It budgeted $8 million for this 
process. So far there has been $4 million to $5 million spent. I 
thought it was $5 million but this morning I heard that maybe it 
was only $4 million. It seems that the government is not quite 
sure how much it actually spent to date on this process. Anyway 
it is in the area of $4 million to $5 million.
<P>
	It wants to scrap the whole process. It wants to put everything 
on hold so that in 24 months it can spend another $8 million to 
$10 million and restart the whole thing. Is that in the interests of 
the Canadian people?
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Do members opposite believe that Canadians will stand by 
when the country is facing a massive deficit and debt and place 
before them another $8 million to $10 million bill when it is not 
necessary? We could simply put the process on hold for a12 month period, have a committee study it if they wish, as our 
amendments suggest, and then Canadians can get value for their 
dollar, something that they are not doing by eliminating this 
redistribution process.
<P>
	Would it not be worth mentioning that we are kind of crowded 
in this House? We are at the maximum probably in seating 
without major adjustments to this place. I received a letter 
yesterday from a constituent who said we should look at capping 
the number of members in the House of Commons. That is a 
good idea and I think we should look at it.
<P>
	People are tired. We have too much government. It is a good 
idea. Absolutely we should do that. He also suggested we should 
reduce the number of seats. I think we should reduce the 
numbers on that side of the House, but maybe strengthen them 
over here.
<P>
	What we should be looking at is Senate reform. The west, the 
northern regions, the Atlantic provinces want accountability 
too. If we limit the number of seats in the House, then we have to 
look at strengthening the other place, the Senate chamber. It is 
something that requires serious consideration.
<P>
	This whole process, as I said earlier, should have Canadians 
wondering what the government is all about. Does it really mean 
that it wants the people involved in government, because it is 
stifling that by stopping this right now? It is stifling the process 
for the people of Canada so they cannot make their 
representations, their concerns and their presentations to these 
commissions. The commissions were set up independently so 
government could not be involved and would be at arm's length 
from the whole process. That is the way it should be.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2912"> 2912 </A></B>
<P>
	I have serious concerns about my riding but I am willing to 
make presentations on behalf of the people of 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt regarding those concerns. I 
will not have that opportunity now and the people of Canada do 
not have the opportunity to do it either.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to urge all members in every corner of 
the House to please consider once again what Canadians have 
asked us to do, to bring accountability back to the House of 
Commons and to let them be more involved in the democracy 
process. I want every member of the House consider that. I ask 
hon. members to support the amendments that are before us 
today.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brenda Chamberlain (Guelph-Wellington):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, to my hon. colleague across the way, first he mentioned 
the fact that it is more costly. There is no issue here. The reality 
is if we proceed-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I might seek 
clarification from the member? Is she on debate? There is no 
questions or comments period in the standing orders we are 
presently under. Is the member on debate?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Yes, I am, Mr. Speaker. Could I ask the 
Chair a question? When you say am I on debate, what exactly is 
it that you would like for me to do?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I do not want to put any 
restrictions on any member, but according to the standing orders 
of this debate at this time, each member  who seeks the floor is 
recognized by the Chair and has 10 minutes to make his or her 
intervention.
<P>
	I wondered if perhaps the member was seeking to ask a 
question of the member who last spoke. There is no questions or 
comments period following the interventions at this particular 
stage of debate. The hon. member for Guelph-Wellington.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Chamberlain:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member across the way 
said that this is a costly process, and this side of the House quite 
agrees with that. People in general and certainly in my riding of 
Guelph-Wellington have expressed deep concern at the cost of 
the process and how much will be gained.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The other issue that the member across the floor has talked 
about is the fact that this would create more government. For us 
to create more government at a time that people feel we should 
not be moving in that direction is not responsible.
<P>
	I do not believe we are taking the position-I certainly am 
not-that we do not think people should be involved. People 
should be involved. People have been involved at the local level 
from riding to riding. Many people have talked to me on this 
issue and expressed concern. They wished that the government 
would take a leadership role in deciding what should happen 
with this issue. We have attempted to do that.
<P>
	I believe my role when I was elected was to be a leader, to 
show leadership and to make decisions supported by concrete 
facts, information building, public information being included 
in that communication process. I am comfortable with the 
direction the government is moving in.
<P>
	The charge by my hon. colleague about Liberal stronghold 
areas being protected is not so. I cannot agree with that. That 
would not be the reason I would look at not supporting this 
amendment. The reality is that many members-I would put 
myself in this category-find themselves living outside the 
actual area that they represent. It seems odd to me that there 
would be decisions and directions moved in this manner.
<P>
	Another colleague of ours finds part of his farm in one riding 
and his house in another. This does not seem reasonable. I hope 
the member across the way knows that some of the boundaries 
that were proposed are not credible. They do not make sense.
<P>
	To have a situation in which we would have public input on 
every single area, 295 ridings or perhaps more-my colleague 
talks about maybe 300 or 304 ridings, I do not know where this 
process would end-is not a good thing at this time. The points 
of view are varied but in general there is wide support for the 
government.
<P>
	I will speak on behalf of Guelph-Wellington and the 
information that I have received from my constituents. It is that 
this process, the way it was first initiated, was quite  a 
hodge-podge. They are comfortable with us as a government 
saying no to this process in the manner that it has been proposed. 
They are concerned about cost and they are concerned about 
more government.
<P>
	My colleague has indicated that is the question. That would be 
the result of the process we are embarked upon at this time. I 
would say this to members. From my point of view and from 
what I have been able to gather from public input, from talking 
to people, they are comfortable with this decision.
<P>
	This is exactly what the Reform Party wants us to do, listen to 
our constituents and find out what they truly want us to do. In 
acting on that I am comfortable on this topic at this time.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
convinced I will not have to invite you to come and visit my 
riding since you must have been there already on skiing 
vacations. The riding of Laurentides has 43 municipalities and 
110,000 voters. It is a huge riding but the new electoral map 
brings appalling cuts to this area. Without any reason, several 
municipalities will be taken from my riding and will become 
part of a neighbouring one.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2913"> 2913 </A></B>
<P>
	You must understand that the riding of Laurentides is located 
along a highway, highway 15 or 117. It is a network, a tourist 
region and it is therefore very important that the area be 
maintained as a whole and remain united. If you take 
municipalities out of a tourist network, it becomes very difficult 
for those municipalities to make a name for themselves in 
another riding which may be, for instance, agricultural or 
something else.
<P>
	I would like to tell you about municipalities that are very 
disturbed by the new electoral map and which approached me 
and explained their problem. You have Mont-Tremblant which 
is booming and must count on the touristic network of my riding 
to be able to advertise and attract tourists. If Mont-Tremblant 
became part of Berthier-Montcalm, which is a totally different 
kind of riding, the people of Berthier-Montcalm would be hard 
pressed when it comes to the economic development of 
Mont-Tremblant. Furthermore, they object to Mont-Tremblant 
being taken out of my riding.
<P>
	The town of Saint-Jovite along highway 117 and all those 
towns to the north, including Labelle, which are part of the 
tourism network, are being removed and added to 
Argenteuil-Papineau, which has an entirely different focus. 
So, of course, the mayors, the councillors and my constituents 
called and said: What can we do? We do not want to leave the 
riding of Laurentides. We feel at home here. We do not want to 
be part of another riding where they may be too busy to look 
after us, because it takes a long time to cover the whole riding. I 
have a very big riding with a lot of constituents, and it takes a lot 
of travelling, but we have a network where  everything connects. 
In fact, we used to have the ``petit train du Nord'', a train that 
went through all the municipalities now in my riding. Where the 
train used to run has now been turned into parkland.
<P>
	If part of this tourism network is removed and added to 
another riding which is different again, it will make the park far 
less attractive because the park needs the Laurentides Tourism 
Association and the services in my riding to develop as it 
should.
<P>
	I am against the amendment, and I think the readjustment 
process was a hasty affair. They took a map and looked at the 
number of constituents in a given riding. They decided there 
should be 75,000 inhabitants per riding, so they take this 
particular part out and add it on somewhere else. Some ridings 
have a lot of small municipalities with very few people, but the 
member may end up with 70 municipalities in the same riding. 
This does not make sense. A member can never do a good job 
under those circumstances. To do a good job, the redistribution 
process must be reasonable. There should also be a good 
infrastructure.
<P>
	I know some people in my riding who told me during the 
election campaign: So I am in Laurentides? I said yes, you 
belong to the riding of Laurentides. They were not aware of this.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	It takes a few years for people to get used to belonging to a 
riding or to identify with the riding. Shifting people from one 
riding to the next every eight years does not create a sense of 
community.
<P>
	I am also against reducing the number of members, because 
we already have 110,000 constituents and if we get more, I am 
going to have trouble looking after everyone. It already takes 
two and a half hours to drive across the riding. It takes me longer 
to drive from one end of the riding to the other than it takes to 
drive to Ottawa. These are huge distances.
<P>
	The tourism network is in good shape, and people want to stay 
in that network. I will keep doing my job in my riding. I think it 
is very important for people to identify with a region. I think it is 
very important for a region's development. I intend to go on 
working with my constituents, and if these electoral boundaries 
have to be changed, the municipalities concerned and I-in fact, 
I would lose a large number of municipalities which have 
already been identified-will take steps to prepare a brief and 
protest against changes that make no sense at all in a region 
where municipalities need each other to survive.
<P>
	You know that when people go to Saint-Sauveur, they will 
also visit another municipality next door. They will see a show 
in Val-David and have dinner in Sainte-Agathe or go boating 
there. In this region, we all have to help each other. Otherwise, if 
you take a few small municipalities and destroy their tourism 
network or move it somewhere else, you lose the dynamics that 
tourism needs, because this is not an easy sector.
<P>
	I will go on doing my job in my beautiful riding of 
Laurentides, and as far as breaking up the riding is concerned, I 
will do my utmost to keep that from happening.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would not want the 
member for Shefford to be jealous, but I have to say I spent even 
more time in the Laurentians.
<P>
	The member for Richelieu.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I almost 
feel I have to begin my speech by inviting you to come and visit 
my riding. Even though it has already been said, it is one of the 
most beautiful in Canada. I think that it comes second after 
yours, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps I will be allowed one more minute 
for having said that.
<P>
	The debate on this bill brings me to make some comments that 
might differ a little bit from the other comments that were made. 
First, in terms of the relevance of the legislation, it is surprising 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2914"> 2914 </A></B>
<P>
to see a government reject a change based on the principle of a 
better redistribution of ridings on the basis of population.
<P>
	The proposed reform, after several years of extensive debate 
and reflection, to allow the representation in the House of 
Commons to be directly related to the population of a riding, 
while also taking into account the sense of belonging to a region, 
while taking into account, for instance, the principle of the 
regional county municipalities in Quebec, the principle also of 
the economic relations that can be established in various 
regions-of course that will and desire of the House and all 
Quebeckers and Canadians was extremely valid. However, 
basically, if we really wanted a reform, would we start with that 
kind of redistribution? We would probably start by asking 
ourselves what our institutions represent and how useful they 
are.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	Based on that, the first reform would be to ask if we have one 
House too many. Do we Quebeckers and Canadians still need 
two Houses? One is commonly called the Senate but in the 
parliamentary language of the House of Commons we call it 
``the other House''. Do we still need that other House? That 
would be the first point to consider.
<P>
	Then we will talk about the distribution and number of 
ridings, how many people should be represented by a member of 
Parliament and so on. Ultimately, many Quebeckers and, I am 
sure, many Canadians want the other House to be abolished.
<P>
	By attacking the other House, I do not want to attack the 
venerable people who sit there; we know that there are some 
very competent individuals. Of course, there are also some 
bagmen for the big parties such as Mr. Rizzuto for the Liberals 
and Mr. Nolin for the Conservative Party. They were appointed 
to their position and they are well-paid party workers who raise 
funds for the old parties.
<P>
	But except for these few cases, let us admit that there are some 
really capable people who should run for election to this House 
to make their contribution instead of going to that big dormitory, 
which sometimes becomes a nursery school, as we saw in some 
debates. But of what use is that big dormitory to which those 
hon. sleepyheads go? That is the real question.
<P>
	If we talked about reform by first dealing with the usefulness 
of the other House, we would realize that the members of that 
body have knowledge and skills which would be much more 
useful to the community in this House here. In fact, that other 
House is a sort of relic of colonialism, meant to protect the 
interests of the wealthy and to cool the ardour of the people's 
representatives. That is why one of the requirements to sit in the 
other House was to have property worth at least $15,000. That 
requirement still exists, although it is meaningless today, but 
back then it was a lot. Therefore it was a House to protect the 
wealthy from some legislation that could have threatened their 
wealth or economic power.
<P>
	Over time, the situation evolved. That other House became 
the defender of the regions. That is why we often heard about the 
importance of the second Chamber in western Canada, for 
example, because that House in a sense embodied the regions. 
Historically, that House had a certain role to play as a defender 
of the regions; that was acceptable too.
<P>
	But now, people band together in associations, unions, 
environmental groups and all kinds of organizations. They have 
means to make their demands heard and associations to 
represent them directly to elected officials and they no longer 
feel a need to have that House to defend them. That House has 
become so useless that the time has come for us to think about 
whether it should even exist. Those associations no longer go 
through the other place. In fact, I wonder how many could 
answer if I were to ask all the hon. members here the name of the 
senator representing them in their regions. In my region of Sorel 
for example, what is the name of our senator? I am involved in 
politics myself, yet I do not know. If I, as a politician, do not 
know who my senator is, you can imagine that he must not be 
getting much mail or too many calls. There are even senators 
who refuse to give out their fax numbers. I found that out when 
some of my constituents said: ``Maybe we could stop that 
unemployment insurance bill from going through in the Senate; 
give us the fax number.'' So, I phoned around and, as it turned 
out, almost half of the senators I phoned refused to give out their 
fax numbers; they did not want to be disturbed. It is incredible, 
but true.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	My point is that the upper house has lost its raison d'être, and 
that may be where reform should start. Let us start by reviewing 
the need for our institutions. Based on that review, we will be 
able to say: ``The other place no longer meets our needs; it must 
be abolished.'' That would mean $40 million, $60 million or $70 
million  less to collect from the taxpayers. Furthermore, the 
senators' expertise could be put to good use elsewhere. They are 
obviously committed to politics if they agreed to sit in the other 
place. So, we are telling them: ``Get elected democratically and 
come and sit with us in the House of Commons. Find a seat. Get 
the people's seal of approval.''
<P>
	This leads to the next question. Are there enough members in 
this House or too many? As far as I am concerned, the answer 
rests in the comparison between Canada and other democratic 
nations, preferably North American democratic nations.
<P>
	Let us take the United States as an example. They have a 
legislative body, the members of which are not called members 
of Parliament, but congressmen. If I recall correctly, there are 
some 450 of them representing 250 million people, while we are 
295 for a population of 25 million. If the United States were to 
have as many congressmen as we have members of Parliament 
in Canada, they would need 2,950 seats in the Congress. Their 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2915"> 2915 </A></B>
<P>
population being 10 times ours, they would have ten times more 
members of Parliament than we do, relatively speaking. 
Obviously, something is wrong.
<P>
	Do you think it is right for a small province like Prince 
Edward Island, a province no bigger than my riding, to have 32 
MLAs, four federal MPs, one representative of the Queen, one 
lieutenant governor and even, at times, one Supreme Court 
judge? Obviously, something is wrong. And that is the true 
reform which should take place.
<P>
	Abolish the other place and reduce the number of MPs. Do not 
increase their number, reduce it. If there were 150 of us here, it 
would be more than enough, because what is the role of MPs 
once they have been elected, especially government members? 
They do nothing but vote according to the whip's instructions. 
They are like sheep. The best example is the one provided by the 
member opposite who is looking at me with a smile. These 
people roared like big cats when they formed the opposition, but 
have now become sheep or paper tigers with no role to play. 
They simply sit and when the bells ring they come and vote like 
sheep. They do not even ask themselves whether they should 
have been consulted. They are not consulted at all.
<P>
	If there were 150 MPs, or half the current number, perhaps the 
debates would be more democratic, with a greater participation. 
This is what reform should be all about. A reform should first 
look at the institutions and their relevancy. Then, there should 
be a second debate on the number of MPs, followed by a third 
one on the role of the member of Parliament. It goes without 
saying that the MP's role is to represent his or her riding, to act 
as ombudsman and protector of the individual who has a 
problem with UI, the company which did not get a subsidy, or 
the person or organization who made representations and did not 
get an answer from a minister or the government. The MP is also 
a legislator,  but that is unfortunately the role which is most 
neglected. In my next speech, I would like to elaborate on this 
extremely important role of legislator which MPs should have 
but do not have right now in our institutions as they currently 
exist.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, first I would like to 
respond to some of the remarks-
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I do not think that we have a quorum.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Quorum.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will ask the clerk to 
count the members present.
<P>
	<I>And the count having been taken:</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We have a quorum. 
Resuming debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I talk on Bill C-18, I 
would like to respond to some of the remarks made by my friend 
from the Bloc who spoke before me. He mentioned the other 
place and suggested that we should do away with it. He said 
there was a growing mood in Canada for abolishing the Senate.
<P>
	I would like to address that and say that the reason the other 
place has no credibility right now is that it is not elected and it is 
not accountable.
<P>
	I suggest it is essential for the future of Canada and for 
regional fairness that we have a strong and vibrant Senate. Our 
vision is that senators should be elected and be accountable and 
there should be regional fairness in their distribution.
<P>
	Going to Bill C-18, I have spoken on this issue before. I have 
to say we are very much opposed to this bill because it smacks of 
political interference.
<P>
	It is very clear from the news reports I read in British 
Columbia while I was there for the recent hiatus that people in 
that province are deeply concerned that what we have here is 
business as usual. We have politicians who when they do not like 
something, instead of going through due process and allowing a 
fair and unbiased process to proceed, want to get involved by 
commandeering that process and steering it in a direction that is 
favourable to them.
<P>
	Furthermore there is a good deal of concern among taxpayers 
that we have $5 million invested in this process right now and 
we are in danger of losing that. As a matter of fact we will lose 
the value of that money if this process is indeed suspended for 
24 months and the commissions are abolished.
<P>
	At the same time the government talks about a commitment to 
capping the number of MPs it attacks us on these benches for not 
wanting to see this happen. We  have asked time and again and 
have moved an amendment to say if you want our support on a 
motion then instead of saying you are going to review the 
number of MPs, cap the number of MPs, make a firm 
commitment to it. There is no commitment in Bill C-18 to do 
this.
<P>
	I find it very difficult to support a motion which we only look 
at reviewing the number of MPs, only look at studying 
something. If we do not think it is right then we should make a 
commitment up front that we are going to come up with a 
formula for capping the number of MPs.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2916"> 2916 </A></B>
<P>
	I think the government would find a good deal of support from 
this side of the House, possibly unanimous support, if it moved 
in that direction but we have not seen that. I was in my riding 
recently, as were most members. I received very little 
expression of concern from my constituents on the matter of 
electoral boundary changes. Believe me, my riding changes 
dramatically, maybe not as dramatically as some of the other 
people in this House but it does change dramatically. It increases 
by about 25 per cent. I already have one of the largest geographic 
ridings in Canada. It is very difficult for a member to service 
now and it is going to become even more difficult under the 
proposed changes to the electoral boundaries commission.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	However, there is a process in place and the people in my 
constituency are prepared to live with that process. They are 
prepared to work within it. I believe that should be the position 
that all of us take as members in this House, that rather than 
trying to hijack the process we work within it.
<P>
	Because the process will be suspended for 24 months if this 
bill passes, British Columbia and Ontario will go into the next 
century, indeed the next millennium, with the same electoral 
boundaries and the same distribution they had based on the 1980 
census. If there is one thing that generates a good deal of 
concern and anger in British Columbia, and I am sure that 
Ontario feels the same way, it is the fact that we are being 
short-changed. We are not receiving a proper representation 
based on our population, which is something our democracy 
ascribes to. I have been hearing a lot from my constituents on 
that.
<P>
	Let me suggest that the government proceeds with this bill at 
its political peril in British Columbia and in other parts of 
Canada as well. If the country goes into another election without 
redistribution having taken place, there will be a price to pay and 
the government should be aware of that. There is a strong feeling 
and strong sentiment in British Columbia that that is the case. 
People are not happy with that.
<P>
	If the government wants to introduce Bill C-18 and wants to 
have an opportunity to examine the process, why not do it in 12 
months? Certainly anything that can be done in 24 months can 
be done in 12 months. We do not see a reason for holding up the 
process any longer  than is necessary. Furthermore we do not see 
a requirement to suspend or to abolish the present commissions 
and come up with new commissions 24 months from now and 
start all over at square one. Why not at least retain some of the 
value of the dollars that have been spent?
<P>
	I support the Reform amendments for those reasons.
<P>
	I feel very strongly that the government should make a 
statement that it is going to cap the number of seats rather than 
just talk about reviewing the number of seats. We have to put a 
firm cap on the number of seats. We have to show Canadians that 
we are indeed concerned about the expenditure of taxpayers' 
dollars. We certainly do not need more representatives in this 
House than we have now to oversee the affairs of the country.
<P>
	We want to retain the current commissions and preserve the 
value of the work that has been done. This can be done and still 
allow the government the opportunity to review the work of the 
electoral boundaries commissions and to review the process that 
is in place. I support very strongly that if we suspend the process 
we only suspend it for 12 months and not 24 months.
<P>
	We must keep the process scrupulously non-partisan and 
non-political. We must do it in a way that Canadians can see that 
we have not engaged in political interference, that it is not 
business as usual, that we have not looked at trying to further or 
protect our own political interests, but looked at the best way to 
achieve redistribution and electoral boundaries changes based 
on what is best for the country.
<P>
<B>(1255 ) </B>
<P>
	We must ensure that representation by population is observed 
in the next election. As I said earlier, the government is going to 
have a very heavy political price to pay if it does not follow that. 
I reiterate again that British Columbians are very unhappy. They 
will be very unhappy if they go into an election in 1996, 1997, 
1998 or whenever it happens with the same boundaries that they 
have had based on the census of 1980.
<P>
	B.C. and Ontario deserve nothing less than a fair shake as do 
all of the provinces when it comes to distribution. We must 
continue to subscribe to representation by population. This bill 
flies in the face of that and will put British Columbia and 
Ontario at a disadvantage in the next election.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I want to take a few minutes to respond to some of the 
things that I have been hearing over recent minutes and hours 
when I see the opposition delaying this bill today.
<P>
	There is some irony here. People are saying in this House: 
``This bill is going to delay the process by 24 months. We are 
against delay'', but they are delaying the bill, ensuring that the 
24 months will happen later had  they not delayed the bill to start 
with. Maybe that needs to be said.
<P>
	What about the fact that the Reform Party wanted this delay to 
be 24 months when the government initially asked for 18 
months? Whose fault is that? Could it be that there is a little 
duplicity going on, that we are not hearing the facts exactly as 
they are?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2917"> 2917 </A></B>
<P>
	We heard in the speech today that the electors of the hon. 
member's province are going to be unhappy if the redistribution 
as presently planned does not take place. Mr. Speaker, I am sure 
with your being a fond reader of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> you will 
know of the story of some weeks ago which outlined perfectly 
well how B.C. and Ontario were being short-changed by the 
redistribution that is going to take place now unless we amend it, 
that true rep by pop does not exist in Canada at the present time, 
that it should be restored, that the whole debate about that needs 
to take place and the process we have now has been there for 30 
or 40 years unamended. What about the 1986 amendment that 
was done by the Conservative government? That amendment 
made it such that no province should lose seats even if it loses 
population.
<P>
	Which provinces are the victims of that? B.C. and Ontario are, 
and that is the process that the member wants us to proceed with. 
Then he says to top it all off that we need to elect our senators. 
This is coming from a bunch of people who voted against the 
Charlottetown accord and who campaigned against it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I must admit that I fail to see the logic in the hon. 
member telling us that the 24 month suspension is unacceptable, 
when in fact he himself, or at least his party, requested it. We 
proposed a period of 18 months, and now he wants to reduce this 
to 12. Well, what is it going to be? Make up your mind. What do 
you want? Twelve, eighteen or twenty-four months? Convene a 
caucus meeting, discuss the dress code?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Discuss suits. Do something. Discuss it privately and then 
come back to the House and make up your mind whether it is 12, 
18 or 24 that members want I say to my colleagues across the 
way. We need to review this whole system of redistribution. At 
second reading the Bloc members across the way voted in favour 
of the bill if I remember correctly.
<P>
	Of course they are filibustering a little bit today, but perhaps 
that will change over the next few minutes or at least we are 
hoping. If we are serious about not wanting any more delay let 
the bill proceed so that we can go ahead with this review. If we 
are serious about not having unnecessary delay, I say to the 
Reform Party that it cannot have it both ways. It cannot ask to 
lengthen the delay and say that it is against the delay after it did 
just that. I say that to the members across the way.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	Members must realize that the redistribution as presently 
planned in the law is most unfair to British Columbia and 
Ontario according to all independent observers. Rep by pop 
exists the least in those two provinces because of the structure 
there now and in particular as a result of the 1976 amendment 
proposed with the previous government that made it such that no 
province lost seats.
<P>
	I call upon my colleagues, if they are serious, forthright and 
honest about wanting no delay, to proceed with the bill. Let us 
get the process started. Let us do things and let us do them 
quickly so that we can have good and proper redistribution to 
give fair representation to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, following up on what my hon. colleague from 
Richelieu just said, I would like to participate in this debate and 
speak about institutions. Not the kind of institution he referred 
to, namely the other House, the Senate, or the House of 
Commons, but existing institutions that ensure the development 
of our local communities. I am referring here to the riding, an 
institution in itself.
<P>
	I would also like to say a few words about RCMs, an 
institution which took root in Quebec in the mid seventies, and 
about economic development institutions which have a 
considerable impact on each of our ridings. Of course, I will tie 
all of this in with the electoral boundaries reform process.
<P>
	In principle, everyone agree that the objective must be greater 
equity in the allocation of the number of voters by riding so as to 
ensure that one riding does not carry more weight than another. 
Obviously, everyone works toward the attainment of this 
objective. When the time comes to undertake the process, 
specific guidelines and criteria must be followed. Above all, 
demographic measurements must not be the sole consideration. 
The criteria must reflect the makeup of our communities and 
respect the will of the people.
<P>
	Over the past 20 or 25 years in Quebec, a sense of attachment 
has emerged as a result of a process which was and still is known 
as joint action. I recall taking part in the early 1970s in the Lac 
Mégantic region in consultations carried out by the regional 
development council of the eastern townships. This was the start 
of the process of pooling the needs of the entire population of the 
eastern townships. This sense of regional attachment which I 
alluded to earlier developed over a period of many years and led 
to tremendous economic and social development over a period 
of some years.
<P>
	The process was further cemented by the establishment of 
regional county municipalities in the mid seventies, as I 
mentioned. The first task undertaken by the RCMs was to put on 
the table a development plan to be voted on by all elected 
officials in a given region or  sub-region. In the development 
plan, the municipalities in each sub-region specified what kind 
of com-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2918"> 2918 </A></B>
<P>
munity facility they needed and where these facilities would be 
located.
<P>
	Subsequently, a complete network of economic institutions 
and industrial commissions was developed. These operated in 
various fields, not just in the industrial sector, but in the 
business and community sectors as well. As a result, our various 
regions, and I refer more specifically to the eastern townships, 
developed their own personality and were at last in a position to 
convince the authorities that economic and social development 
should be adapted to their needs and the needs of people who 
live there. When the time comes to readjust the boundaries of 
electoral districts, these boundaries must take into account a 
process that has evolved during the past twenty or so years.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The proposed changes, as I said earlier, will have a disastrous 
impact on much of my riding, especially on the Granit RCM 
located in the beautiful Lake Mégantic area, which I am sure you 
will visit one of these days, Mr. Speaker, since I understand you 
are a fan of Quebec.
<P>
	The Granit RCM has always been part of the Eastern 
Townships. In fact, as I said earlier, about 25 years ago I was 
involved in the consultation process to set up regional 
development councils. The Lake Mégantic region was part of 
the economic and social development process in the eastern 
townships and established contacts with most of the authorities 
involved, including not only local and regional authorities but 
also authorities at the provincial and federal levels. Mr. Speaker, 
you have been in government for a number of years, as I have, 
and you know it is not easy for the average citizen to find his way 
through the maze of institutions and governments.
<P>
	When people have had a development model for a number of 
years, they are very concerned about the consequences of 
getting rid of this model overnight. And that is exactly what will 
happen as a result of boundary changes in this particular part of 
my riding. The Lake Mégantic region would be added to the 
riding that includes the Thetford mines region, the centre for 
asbestos, and thus included in the economic region of Quebec 
City, which is a very nice area, I will grant you that. Just because 
we want to stay in the Eastern Townships does not mean we have 
anything against people in another riding.
<P>
	I think it should be obvious to anyone who is the least bit 
involved in this process that people should be consulted on any 
changes being planned.
<P>
	I heard the hon. member for the Reform Party say earlier that 
it was necessary for the electoral boundaries readjustment 
process to be politically neutral. I disagree. Since we are elected 
representatives and the people have given us a mandate, it is our 
responsibility and in fact our duty to be involved in any process 
that would affect the future of our constituents. If I am not 
mistaken,  two-thirds of the members of this House-more than 
200 came here for the first time five or six months ago. My point 
is that most members of this House are serving their first term. 
This means that during the past few months they attended many 
meetings and read all kinds of documentation to get to know 
their riding, their region, their constituents and the needs of 
these constituents. They must be involved in these 
consultations. And we cannot do this in a hurry. We need enough 
time.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	In my own riding, I have started consulting the 
municipalities, and I can say that with 67 municipalities-yes, 
67-it takes weeks before we can get a clear picture of what 
people want. We need time to consult our constituents and 
ensure that any changes that are made will reflect the 
institutions in place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Daviault (Ahuntsic):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is the 
second time I rise on electoral reform. First I would like to 
apologize to our friends the interpreters for not bringing them 
my speech, as I usually do. Unfortunately, if the people listening 
to us could see the wilderness in which we are preaching today, 
they would understand that sometimes we must be ready to 
respond quickly.
<P>
	So this is the second time I rise on electoral reform. I did so as 
chairman of the Montreal Island caucus. I questioned my Bloc 
colleagues and tried to gather information on this reform, and 
today we are discussing the amendments proposed after the 
report was tabled. The main amendment-the first one-would 
reduce from 24 to 12 months the suspension period for electoral 
boundary readjustment. The second and third amendments are a 
logical consequence of the first one and would let the 
readjustment proceed while the committee drafts its report so 
that the commission can do its job.
<P>
	When I spoke-I will come back to my first speech on this-it 
was important to me, and many of my regional colleagues spoke 
of the importance of representing the socio-economic, 
socio-political communities in their ridings; in the regions, they 
talk a lot about regional county municipalities, while in the 
Montreal area, they talk about districts. It is important for 
members to represent these communities, to have a political 
representation as integrated as possible at the provincial, 
federal, municipal, or school level.
<P>
	In fact, I think that when we talk about the opportunity for 
politicians to act with the increasingly scarce or limited 
resources at their disposal, such actions must be better 
co-ordinated at every level of government. In this respect, there 
are administrative units that must be represented.
<P>
	In my first speech I spoke about a fuzzy mathematical logic 
because, in my opinion, the proposed reform has nothing to do 
with real life. I told you about problems in the eastern part of 
Montreal, in Mercier, Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, 
Papineau-Saint-Michel, the  riding of the hon. Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, that will disappear, the riding of Saint-Léonard 
that will expand considerably, as well as the riding of 
Saint-Denis and my own riding of Ahuntsic. By the way, 
``Ahuntsic'' is an Indian word that dates back to the beginning of 
the colony. Mr. Ahuntsic was a young ferryman with the first 
settlers and it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2919"> 2919 </A></B>
<P>
the Iroquois who gave him this nickname. So, that name goes 
back to the very beginning of the colony.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	I re-examined the map and discovered another problem with 
the riding of Bourassa-Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies, which 
seems to me quite significant when you consider only the 
figures.
<P>
	The riding of Bourassa encompasses the city of Montreal 
North, a developing area facing hard times and trying to regroup 
its community organizations as well as its political demography. 
The area is pretty well integrated.
<P>
	Given the proposed readjustments, from a mathematical point 
of view only, we will add to this riding, which encompasses a 
whole city, about ten streets taken from the riding of 
Anjou-Rivières-des-Prairies. Now, Rivières-des-Prairies is a 
neighbourhood in the city of Montreal. In other words, we will 
be adding to a politically and economically homogenous entity a 
tiny area, made up of ten streets, only to respect some 
mathematical criteria. I will come back later to the spreads, 
because there are some things which are totally absurd.
<P>
	I thought I would address the issue of ``juggling'' figures, and 
since our friends, the translators, do not have copy of my speech, 
I am looking forward to seeing how they will translate this nice 
Quebec French expression, <I>zigonnage</I>, which says exactly what 
I mean.
<P>
	In my hands, I have a map which I want to show you. I want to 
talk about the population spreads. In Quebec, there are about 
91,500 constituents for every seat and the ridings are drawn 
according to this average ratio.
<P>
	If you look at the previous map, in the area of Montreal made 
up of 23 ridings, 11 ridings were below the average ratio. Now, 
on the new map, we have 17 ridings which are 5 per cent over the 
average ratio. So, we went from a minimum scale which we were 
not following to another scale which we are still not following, 
since the variations are very large.
<P>
	In fact, on the former map, the spread was of 20 per cent in 
three ridings and 10 per cent in four other ridings. With the new 
map, the spread in 17 ridings on the island of Montreal is over 5 
per cent. We even have some pretty obscure spreads, some 
incredible turnabouts. In Laurier-Sainte-Marie, the spread 
went from minus 13 to plus 4, for a difference of 17. In 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, we went from minus 14 to plus 10, a 
difference of 24 between the two maps. In Rosemont, it varied 
from minus 5 to plus 12, a difference of 17. The two champions 
in this respect are  Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, which changes 
from +20 to -0.54, a spread of 21, and the riding of Vaudreuil, 
which will go from +20 to -8, a spread of 28.
<P>
	Why do we have these wide swings? I do not know where the 
riding of Vaudreuil will be on the next maps, because it will no 
longer be part of Montreal Island.
<P>
	In my first presentation, I assumed that the riding of NDG no 
longer existed, which is not the case. NDG is now 
Lachine-NDG. The riding of Lachine-Lac-Saint-Louis is 
now Pointe-Claire-Dollard; Pierrefonds-Dollard will be 
Pierrefonds- Beaconsfield and Saint-Henri-Westmount will 
be Westmount-Ville-Marie. Ridings that ran east-west will 
now run north-south, which creates a juxtaposition of small 
towns on the West Island, which consists of medium-sized 
towns. It takes two to make a federal riding, but instead of the 
usual east-west twinning, they now run north-south.
<P>
	It is rather messy, and I think we are just perpetuating a 
system that did not make sense to start with. We have had the 
same system for the past 30 years, and it led to an incongruous 
situation that to us in Montreal was really incredible, and I am 
referring to the riding of Laval-des-Rapides which straddled 
the Rivière-des-Prairies, being half on the Island of Laval and 
half on Montreal Island. When you realize, as I do, that the 
people of Ahuntsic often wish the metro would be extended to 
Laval, so that the people of Laval could leave their cars at home 
instead of polluting our neighbourhoods, I find it hard to 
understand why we should group two communities that so often 
disagree on major political issues.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	So far, four ridings in the region have not been affected: the 
three ridings of Laval, where Laval Centre is at +11.52, Laval 
East at +12 and Laval West at +18. A subsequent readjustment 
would normally create a fourth riding on the Island of Laval. 
However, considering existing figures and population growth, 
we can assume that for the next census, a fourth riding would 
have to include more than just the north shore, on Île Jésus.
<P>
	Are we to assume, after seeing what it means to have a riding 
straddling two islands, that according to the same system, we 
will get another incongruous situation when the next 
readjustment creates another riding straddling the shores of two 
islands?
<P>
	That sounds rather far-fetched, but in any case, I would like to 
point out that the riding of Saint-Laurent-Cartierville will not 
change. This is the only riding out of 23 on the Island that will 
not be affected in any way. Therefore, if we can presume the 
member is thinking in electoral terms when she talks about the 
map, we can certainly presume that our hon. colleague, the 
Acting Speaker, will have no partisan motivation whatsoever 
when she votes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2920"> 2920 </A></B>
<P>
	This brings us to the amendments. I see myself having to 
defend this in front of the commission simply because  we could 
not meet the deadline, because here in the House we follow a 
very peculiar kind of procedure to say the least. To the 
commission I will say: According to the present rules, you 
should do this for my riding and according to other rules, you 
should do that.
<P>
	It is somewhat incongruous when you think that, whatever 
happens, this whole process will and must disappear because it 
is not logical for me to defend bits of Montreal districts that will 
be taken away to be added to another riding for 
socio-demographic reasons. One thing is sure: if I win, my 
neighbour will lose; according to demographic and 
mathematical criteria, someone somewhere has to lose.
<P>
	On that point, I agree with the bill and I disagree with the 
amendments because 12 months will not be enough. I agree with 
the member for Beauséjour that we need 24 months and that, 
after the committee has tabled its report, we will need time to 
come back to the question and analyze it thoroughly and not in a 
rush as I have to do it today; we will need to take the time to 
study the issue properly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am a bit surprised. First of all, I would like to invite 
you to visit the beautiful riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve 
with your wife and children. You know that the Olympic 
Stadium is in that riding, along with other tourist attractions 
which you will certainly enjoy.
<P>
	On a more relevant point, I am quite surprised by the 
amendment proposed by our friends in the Reform Party. 
Surprised, because this does not seem consistent with what they 
were advocating in the past.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	You cannot say that what is good for the goose in not good for 
the gander. If one has proposals, a strategy regarding public 
finances, as they claim to have, I say with due respect that one 
has to be consistent.
<P>
	I would like to make two points. The first one is that they are 
trying, clumsily, to make us believe that there is a crisis, an 
imminent democratic peril. This rather unsavoury hotchpotch is 
unfocused. It is presented as if the fact that electoral boundaries 
will not be revised in the near future is going to deprive 
Canadians of their right to vote and vitiate the democratic 
process.
<P>
	A short while ago, I found rather humorous the reference to 
fair representation. There was one occasion in the history of this 
country when fair representation was really threatened, and that 
was in 1840, at the time of the union of Upper and Lower 
Canada. One cannot say that by not supporting the amendment 
proposed by the Reform Party we put democracy in peril.
<P>
	This is my first point and I find questionable, to say the least, 
this attempt to take us into a process which may involve the 
spending of public money. I admit that 40 or 50 years ago, when 
Canadian and Quebec society was evolving rapidly, 
readjustment of electoral boundaries  had to be done without 
undue delay. Universal suffrage had to be fully established, 
since entire sectors of society were still disfranchised. It was 
also a time when rural life was making way for urban life.
<P>
	I do not think that, at the present time, we are in a position to 
use this kind of argument. I think that we can live with a 
moratorium, provided that it is not forever-nobody wants the 
status quo to last forever-but we think that in view of our 
present financial situation and given the current political 
agenda, there are other priorities and urgent problems the 
Canadian government should deal with, before we undertake 
such an exercise.
<P>
	I could mention some of these problems, as we have done 
previously. There is of course, among others, the question of 
unemployment. In terms of a democratic emergency, I am much 
more concerned about the 50,000 unemployed workers who 
might be excluded from UI in certain areas of Quebec because of 
the proposed reform. When it comes to democracy, I am much 
more concerned by this kind of legislation than by the redrawing 
of the electoral map.
<P>
	Speaking of democratic emergency, and I discussed it with 
colleagues from the Reform Party, I think that the real 
emergency is to initiate an in-depth review of the subject matter 
of the Canadian Human Rights Act, which we on this side, 
together with other Canadian and Quebec groups, have been 
calling for. That is a real emergency.
<P>
	If we as parliamentarians and opposition parties are truly 
concerned about democratic rights, I believe that it is legislation 
of this kind that we must bring to the attention of the Parliament 
as a priority.
<P>
	On the other hand, as the member for Ahuntsic said-you 
could say he is my neighbour since, in Montreal, we are all more 
or less neighbours-we have every right to be concerned about 
the kind of boundaries the commission is proposing. Let us take, 
for example, the riding of Hochelaga-Maisonneuve which, if 
we went ahead with the present proposals, would be merged just 
like that with the town of Saint-Léonard, which is poles apart in 
social and economic terms.
<P>
	I do not want to say anything bad about Saint-Léonard 
because I know that it is a town with many attractive features, a 
town where things worth mentioning happen. Nevertheless if, as 
lawmakers, we want to promote coherent environments, I 
believe that it would be somewhat incongruous to propose the 
merging of Saint-Léonard with the federal riding of 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve which, as everybody knows, is a 
working-class area proud of its roots, and where 92 per cent of 
the population is French speaking. They are, as we know, two 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2921"> 2921 </A></B>
<P>
different entities with their own social and economic make-up, 
and you do not need a Ph.D. in sociology to understand that you 
cannot ask two dissimilar entities to live in harmony.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	If you are a member of Parliament and want to speak in public 
and represent people, you should at least do so with some 
consistency. That is real democracy. Real democracy means 
ensuring that the conditions of representation are such that the 
member can reflect the social and political interests of his 
constituents, not to engage in a process that would soon lead to 
some strange situations which my colleagues have not failed to 
point out. That is why I cannot understand the amendment 
proposed by the Reform Party.
<P>
	We also find in other ridings some anomalies like those we 
could come up with if the revision process were rushed. Not only 
did they want to combine the city of Saint-Léonard with 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, but they wanted to take from us, to 
amputate, dare I say castrate, the Angus Shops, a recent 
residential development which is the middle class of 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and helps us achieve some social 
balance. The people of the Angus Shops always felt that they 
belonged to Hochelaga-Maisonneuve and always co-operated 
in the social and community life of the riding. Redrawing the 
electoral map could cut them off from the riding of 
Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
	So I think that we must be careful when dealing with questions 
like that and certainly not create emergencies where they do not 
exist. I fully realize that it is useful to revise riding boundaries 
periodically. Yes, things evolve and people move, but I do not 
think that we should do so now, under the conditions presented 
to us.
<P>
	We should ask whether we do not have better things to do as 
legislators. Could we not find something better to do with our 
time than to engage in a debate like that? You know how the Bloc 
Quebecois was able to identify, on the basis of Quebec's 
interests-I see some government members nodding; they agree 
with the excellent work of the Official Opposition and it is a 
pleasure to know that we could co-operate with them on things 
like that-the Bloc Quebecois was quick to identify some areas 
where we think the government must act and make proposals to 
us, areas which involve the vital democratic interests of 
Quebe-ckers and Canadians.
<P>
	I was just talking about the eagerly awaited reform. Many 
groups in our society long for a reform, which is what 
Parliament is all about, since it involves the Canadian Human 
Rights Act. This law was passed in 1977 and has basically never 
been amended. It is urgent to do so for the sake of democracy. 
How is that urgency expressed? Just think of the whole issue of 
employment equity. We know that in his latest report, 
Commissioner Yalden, who is respected by Canadians as he has 
been a public servant since 1956, told us that we are far from the 
goals for employment equity set in the early 1980s. The same 
goes for recognition of same-sex couples.
<P>
	All that is to say that we should keep things straight. We think 
that it is unhealthy to rush this process because we see no 
urgency for democracy, unlike our friends in  the Reform Party. 
We think that when it comes to redrawing the electoral map, we 
should take the time to do things right because democracy and 
issues of representation are at stake. For these reasons, I cannot 
support the amendment.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Mr. Speaker, you have 
been telling us that you travelled extensively in the province of 
Quebec, as I am sure you have done right across Canada. But if 
you have not visited the great region of Charlevoix yet, I invite 
you to do so because, as you know, this is the region that used to 
be represented by the former Prime Minister, and he certainly 
promoted the region, the city of Baie Comeau in particular.
<P>
	Charlevoix is both a tourist and industrial region on the north 
shore of the St. Lawrence River, a very desirable tourist region 
that several members from Quebec and Canada would love to 
represent. Electoral boundaries readjustment could be used to 
divide to conquer.
<P>
	As several members indicated, a sense of belonging already 
exists within regions, ridings, RCMs, municipalities and even 
school boards. As I understand it, this government's priority is 
to create jobs, reduce unemployment, keep students from 
dropping out and provide increased security to low income 
families as well as seniors.
<P>
	The time the government will spend redrawing the electoral 
map, dividing certain regions in Quebec and other Canadian 
provinces in the process, will undermine the efforts of the men, 
women and corporations that have been working together. As 
you know, at one time, if one municipality-and it is the same 
with regions-if one got a CEGEP, the neighbouring 
municipality or region wanted one of its own. You ended up with 
a lot of duplication between regions. White elephants were built 
in various cities and regions, which the people now have to pay 
for with their school taxes and their municipal taxes.
<P>
	I think that more and more, since the last electoral boundaries 
readjustment, people had thought-and they still do-that the 
electoral map would remain the same for the next 20 or 25 years. 
More and more, in socio-economic summits and sectoral round 
tables, people have been taking charge of prioritizing viable 
economic initiatives to create employment and this has 
prompted mayors and councillors in some municipalities to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2922"> 2922 </A></B>
<P>
assume responsibility for themselves and even make 
compromises so that each region could get its fair share of 
benefits.
<P>
	With respect to the infrastructure program developed by the 
current Liberal government, several municipalities and RCMs 
have met with the Union des municipalités du Québec or the 
Federation of Canadian Municipalities, as far as smaller 
municipalities are concerned, to try to make the program as 
effective as possible. Also, many  small municipalities cannot 
afford to pay for their share of this tripartite cost-sharing 
program.
<P>
	So, many have decided to get together to invest in joint 
projects within a given RCM and buy sanitary landfill 
equipment or some other piece of equipment, just to take 
advantage of the program, create jobs and make the system 
useful and profitable for the region without getting into debt, 
especially the small municipalities, as in some cases the per 
capita subsidy could be $15,000. They got together and 
conceived a major project that would benefit small 
municipalities. In addition, Mr. Speaker, we hear more and more 
about high school drop-outs at the Grade 9, 10, 11, and even 12 
level. In my riding where there are four school boards, they 
co-operate to design programs to make primary and secondary 
schools more cost-effective and interesting and to prevent kids 
from dropping out of school in every community. I am sure that 
this is done in Charlevoix and it must be done in every other 
region.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	The Charlevoix region took control of its own destiny in this 
regard and will do so again in the future to ensure its industrial 
development. To ensure such development, we must deal with 
small and medium-sized businesses and other economic issues. 
For this, we need dialogue and co-operation between 
municipalities, and that is when some municipalities will give 
priority to certain issues rather than others.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, the riding of Charlevoix includes 42 
municipalities on the North Shore of the St. Lawrence forming 
four regional county municipalities, four chambers of 
commerce and four school boards.
<P>
	I think that this government has a lot of work to do to create 
jobs and improve social security, and that it would be a good 
thing to defer this bill for at least two years to let the economy 
recover and allow us to dot the <I>i</I>'s and cross the <I>t</I>'s. I also think, 
as the member for Charlevoix, that there is a lot to do at home, in 
every region of Quebec, and mainly in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
my colleagues, I too wish to speak on Bill C-18 and express my 
opinions, which are heavily slanted in favour of the riding of 
Richmond-Wolfe which I have the pleasure of representing in 
this House.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to review some of the events leading 
up to this debate on Bill C-18. As you know, every time the 
census rolls around, Canada's chief statistician asks the Chief 
Electoral Officer to establish electoral boundaries commissions 
with a view to redrawing the electoral map to keep pace with 
demographic growth and to ensure more balanced 
representation in the House.
<P>
	As a fundamentally democratic party, the Bloc Quebecois is 
fully aware of the importance of such a process. One of our 
party's fundamental objectives, in particular with an eye to 
Quebec independence, is the exercise of democracy in its 
broadest sense. Mindful of  the inherent democratic rights of the 
citizens of Quebec and Canada, the Bloc Quebecois wishes to 
support any measure which will bring about a thorough review 
of legislation which dates back thirty years, namely the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act.
<P>
	Therefore, in this regard, and with certain reservations, the 
Bloc Quebecois supports Bill C-18 which calls for the 
suspension of the operation of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act for a period of two years and the abolition of 
the eleven existing electoral boundaries commissions.
<P>
	The Reform Party has moved three amendments to Bill C-18. 
The first would shorten the suspension period from 24 months to 
12 months, the second would delete the clause providing for the 
abolition of the commissions and the third would amend the 
clause which grants the government the authority to abolish the 
commissions. The Bloc Quebecois does not see the relevance of 
such amendments and will certainly not support them. The 
democratic objective pursued by our party leads our members to 
support an in-depth review of the Electoral Boundaries 
Readjustment Act. However, as I mentioned earlier, the Bloc 
Quebecois supports Bill C-18 with certain reservations.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	First, we believe it is essential to point out the arbitrariness 
and inconsistency of some boundaries established in the past 
and, to that effect, we must emphasize the importance of 
administrative divisions in Quebec.
<P>
	As some of my colleagues have done, I will illustrate that 
point by referring to the division of regional development 
councils. These administrative zones not only have a strategic 
importance for Quebec: they are also based on fundamental 
geographic, economic, industrial, and cultural considerations. 
Consequently, as long as the province remains part of the 
Canadian Confederation, the federal commissions readjusting 
electoral boundaries will have to take into consideration 
regional county municipalities, as well as administrative 
regions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2923"> 2923 </A></B>
<P>
	We also feel that the decentralization of decision-making 
authority is an essential component of the regional policy of the 
year 2000, something which is definitely not a component of the 
current central government's policy. Indeed, we are well aware 
of how uncomfortable the federal government is when it comes 
to delegating powers to regions and to provinces in particular.
<P>
	Our second reservation regarding Bill C-18 has to do with the 
total lack of consideration of regional autonomy in the 
provincial and federal policies of English Canada as a whole. 
Regarding this aspect, I would like to quote some reactions 
following the announcement of the proposals made by the 
Electoral Boundaries Commission.
<P>
	As soon as the proposals made by the Electoral Boundaries 
Commission for Quebec were announced, on  February 9 of this 
year, they were criticized by a good number of people 
representing the political, social and economic sectors in the 
Eastern Townships. Let us take the example of a municipality 
which plays an extremely important role in the economy of the 
riding of Richmond-Wolfe. I am referring to the city of 
Valcourt, which benefits from the presence of Bombardier, a 
company playing an extremely strong and powerful role in the 
development and the economy of the area. The mayor of 
Valcourt, Mr. Denis Allaire, finds it hard to understand why, 
under the new boundaries, his municipality would become part 
of the riding of Drummond, and he intends to voice his 
opposition to such a change.
<P>
	It must be understood that the electoral boundaries 
readjustment is not an opportunity for a mayor or for corporate 
or ordinary citizens to say that they do not want to become part 
of a riding: these people are merely reaffirming their sense of 
belonging to a riding and to an economic and socio-cultural 
region. It is interesting to note that Mayor André Leclerc of 
Warwick worried about the opposite situation, which would see 
his municipality become part of the riding of 
Richmond-Wolfe. The mayor feels that Warwick would be 
removed from its natural ties, operations and activities with the 
region of Victoriaville, in the riding of Lotbinière.
<P>
	He also felt that this readjustment would disrupt the economic 
regions.
<P>
	I would also like to refer to a comment made in <I>La Tribune </I>by 
the hon. member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, who 
said: ``The member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead is not 
pleased at all to see that part of his constituency will become 
part of the Thetford Mines region''-this will help illustrate the 
mistakes which can be made to the detriment of a region's 
natural development-``and he intends to express his discontent 
loud and clear to the commissioners when they hold their 
hearings in Sherbrooke.'' It is not that he holds a grudge against 
the citizens of the asbestos region, but Mr. Bernier maintains 
that there is no affinity between the two poles. He said he knows 
the riding very well and he is convinced that people of Mégantic 
relate first to the Sherbrooke region and only secondly to 
Saint-Georges-de-Beauce. Therefore, the Mégantic region has 
no connection whatsoever with the asbestos region. Except for 
family ties, the people of Mégantic and those of the Thetford 
Mines region have pratically nothing in common.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	I would even add that in the Richmond-Wolfe riding, the 
integration process which affected the municipalities of Rock 
Forest, Saint-Élie, Deauville, Valcourt, Racine and Richmond, 
made it so that the majority of the population, involved in the 
development of a strategic plan for the RCM of Le Val 
Saint-François associated with another extremely important 
RCM, Sherbrooke,  would see the best part of its discussions, 
efforts and co-operation go up in smoke, just as the outcome of 
the plan for joint action on economic, social and cultural 
development in that region.
<P>
	Evidently, the people in these communities have developed a 
sense of responsibility over the years; they were asked to do 
so- They were always told they should take their future into 
their own hands and accept responsibility for their own 
economic, social and cultural development. They were told it 
was important for them to bring the decision centres closer to 
their region. In this respect, the readjustment of electoral 
boundaries goes against all the work that has been done over the 
years in Quebec in the area of joint action and the establishment 
of decision centres closer to the people involved and more 
attuned to their analysis of local problems.
<P>
	In Quebec, in recent years and more precisely since 1985, 
regional conferences have given priority to joint action and 
development projects focusing on municipalities and 
surrounding regions. Over the years, this process has led to 
thinking and developing a strategic plan involving the creation 
of regional county municipalities-or MRCs as they are called 
in Quebec-which co-ordinate their own plans at a higher level, 
that of economic development councils or regional development 
councils. As a result, each region in Quebec signs a general 
development agreement with the government and the 
Department of Regional Development.
<P>
	The exercise of electoral boundaries readjustment 
demonstrates that Ottawa is not sensitive to that. It does not take 
regional development into consideration, does not understand it, 
and sets limits which have nothing in common with natural 
economic development and, in particular, nothing to do with the 
fact that local governments are trying to make their own 
decisions, to do their own analysis of problems, and to 
implement their own solutions to development problems.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2924"> 2924 </A></B>
<P>
	Clearly, we support this review and, if Quebec remains within 
Confederation, we would like people in charge of preparing new 
legislation to take notice of these fundamental structures in 
Quebec. Regionalization and taking charge of one's destiny is 
something for the 21st century, and the Liberal government, the 
government in power, will have to understand that some day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Guimond 
(Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
start by denouncing the attitude of Reform Party members to 
their own amendment. It is curious, not to say strange, that 
members elected on a platform to reform Parliament let the 
other opposition party monopolize debate on their own 
amendment. This is curious.
<P>
	In my native region of Saguenay, we call that: ``Do as I say, 
not as I do''. Like my colleague who just spoke, I am totally 
against the amendment proposed which would  reduce from 24 
months to 12 the period allowed to study a new electoral map.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, I think that we clearly indicated that we would agree 
with the government position to defer this whole issue by 24 
months. Why do we need more time ? First, we think that criteria 
other than demographics must be considered. It is true that we 
must have balanced electoral districts with about 70,000 people, 
but we should also consider other criteria such as the size of the 
territory.
<P>
	We know that my riding of 
Beauport-Montmorency-Orléans entirely encompasses the 
provincial riding of Montmorency, a part of the provincial 
riding of Charlevoix and a part of the provincial riding of 
Beauport-Limoilou. So, a single federal district includes all or 
part of three provincial ridings. I am sure that it is exactly the 
same in the other Canadian provinces.
<P>
	Second, of course, if we have large federal electoral districts, 
chances are that we will have a very large number of 
municipalities in that territory, each municipality having 
different characteristics and different needs.
<P>
	The third reason or third criterion that leads us to prefer a 
24-month deferral is the number of regional county 
municipalities, entities that are specific to Quebec and that 
essentially constitute regional self-governments. When we 
have a large federal riding, it sometimes overlaps more than one 
RCM, once again with different characteristics, needs and 
concerns.
<P>
	Finally, the fourth point that leads me to prefer this deferral is 
the social and economic components of each of these 
municipalities.
<P>
	Since we have an opposition role to play and are not here to 
praise the government in office, despite what the member for 
Saint-Boniface is saying, we can blame the Liberals for 
delaying the bill with the consultations that are getting under 
way. In this issue, it is as if the arms did not know what the brain 
is asking for. I leave it up to you to determine who constitutes 
the arms and who constitutes the brain, but we realize, because 
of the delay in tabling this bill, that the consultations should 
never have started.
<P>
	In our opinion, the reform should have a greater scope. 
Without calling it by its name, I would be remiss if I forgot that 
the Bloc Quebecois, and the majority of Quebeckers in general, 
are asking for the abolition of the other House, knowing how 
efficient members of that House are and how efficient that 
institution as such is. We know that in 1993, the other House sat 
for 41 days, at a cost $43 million to the Canadian treasury. 
Reform could also encompass out right abolition of the other 
House.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to tell you that, nevertheless, in 
Quebec, we are convinced that the  reform will have a greater 
scope because, very soon, Quebeckers will have to decide their 
future in a referendum that will be coming in the new year.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know that the hon. member has a little time 
left to speak. If he is not done, he may continue after three 
o'clock.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to statements by members, pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, this morning, 
the Commissioner of Official Languages tabled his 1993 annual

<P>
	Many instances of discrimination against francophones were 
reported again in federal institutions as well as in several 
provinces. In fact, the commissioner stressed, and I quote: ``that 
the system of providing federal services in both official

<P>
	This year again, access to French language education is 
difficult, if not impossible in certain regions. Also, the issue of 
school governance by francophones has not yet been settled in 
several provinces.

	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
public concern regarding the future of VIA Rail service in the 
Sarnia-Toronto corridor continues to rise. A number of mayors 
and municipal councils have expressed concern following the 
release of certain internal documents attributed to VIA 
management.
<P>
	The transport department has done nothing to deny or disavow 
such information. It is indeed ironic that in this time of 
heightened emphasis on infrastructure our most elementary 
public service, that is intercity rail service, is overtly and 
benignly discouraged by government.
<P>
	If Canadian National can charge its other customers using rail 
service at the same rate that VIA pays, CN would have an 
income of $30 billion per year and not the $3 billion per year it 
had last year.
<P>
	I call on the transport department to order Canadian National 
to charge VIA a rail usage charge based on reality. Indeed VIA 
receives federal subsidies which flow through to CN because of 
this unilateral usage charge.
<P>
	Let us make some sense of VIA by rolling back track rental 
rates to a realistic number based on real market value numbers.
<P>
	I call upon the department to make economic and 
environmental sense and to guarantee passenger rail service to 
both urban and rural Ontario.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Today, 
<I>La Presse</I> published sections of a document prepared by the 
Department of Human Resources Development for the next 
federal-provincial conference to be held next week, on income 
security.
<P>
	According to the document, the government has excluded any 
possibility of transfers to Quebec of authority, budgets or 
officials. This position is a direct contradiction of Quebec's 
demands as reiterated last  Friday by Premier Johnson, who is 
supported by a strong consensus in Quebec on this issue among 
the parties involved.
<P>
	Are we to understand that this document represents the 
government's official policy on manpower training, and that 
having rejected all transfers requested by Quebec, the Prime 
Minister will only allow joint use of the same building, where 
the wasteful practices we have witnessed for a number of years, 
which have prevented the unemployed from getting the training 
they need, would be perpetuated, but now under the same roof?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the working paper from which sections were produced 
in this morning's media is a paper being used as a basis for 
discussion at the deputy minister level.
<P>
	It is quite possible that the ministers will continue to 
negotiate on the basis of a document that may be amended. So 
far, we have had a number of friendly and useful negotiations 
with Quebec. We believe that we can continue those 
negotiations on the same basis.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this document which appears today on the first page of 
Montreal's biggest newspaper was prepared by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development and reflects the minister's 
position.
<P>
	The document, and therefore the minister's position, 
indicates that bilateral agreements on joint use of buildings will 
be signed immediately with the provinces. However, yesterday 
the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs informed the House 
that there would be no administrative agreements with the 
provinces on manpower training for the next two years.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister who is right in this case?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once again, this document was used as a basis for 
discussion at the last meeting. Documents that are used as a 
basis for discussion basically contain matters that have yet to be 
negotiated.
<P>
	Furthermore, yesterday I did not say there would be no single 
window, certainly not. I said that we suggested to the Province 
of Quebec, as we did to the other provinces, that we could have a 
single window for providing manpower training programs, and 
that is our position. Consequently, the position the Minister of 
Human Resources Development is exactly the same as mine.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think it is easy to interpret the minister's remarks. In 
any case, the document is correct in that  there will be no transfer 
of officials, authority or resources.
<P>
	Finally, the bottom line for both ministers is that the same 25 
provincial and 27 federal programs will now be administered in 
the same building, so the client does not have far to go to be 
utterly confused.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister, who must be aware of the 
contradictions here, whether he realizes that by refusing to 
transfer federal responsibility for manpower training to Quebec, 
he is perpetuating an annual waste of $300 million, at the 
expense of Quebec's unemployed, of whom 20,000 are still

waiting to register for training courses that could help them 
improve their chances of getting back to work?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I repeat that my position is that we are pursuing 
negotiations with the Province of Quebec and that we have an 
agreement with the Province of Quebec on eliminating existing

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	During the campaign, the Liberal Party, in its red book, 
promised to assist military industries in their conversion to 
civilian production. Once in power, the government started by 
cancelling the helicopter contract and then reduced the Defence 
budget without introducing a defence conversion program. As 
we can witness today, this government's decisions have had a 
disastrous impact on companies such as Paramax and Oerlikon.
<P>
	Is the Prime Minister ready to recognize how important it is to 
implement, as soon as possible, a defence conversion strategy, 
as he promised, in order to alleviate the impact of military 
budget cuts on employment?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, we 
are quite aware of the situation at Oerlikon, but as the member 
knows perfectly well, it will be several years before this 
company closes its doors. We already have assistance programs 
in place and military industries in Quebec such as Pratt &amp; 
Whitney and Canadair are already receiving a lot of support 
from the federal  government. I would suggest that the member 
take the time to review the situation at Oerlikon.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, is the minister aware that because of his pussyfooting 
and in the absence of a short-term strategy, high-tech industries 
such as Paramax and Oerlikon will soon have to resort to 
massive lay-offs? We do not feel like waiting. Action is needed 
right now. Why abandon all thought of putting in place civilian 
research and development programs to help the defence 
industries?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
member seems to be quite mistaken about what programs 
actually do exist.
<P>
	The government's program is set out not just in the red book 
which he referred to but also in the speech from the throne, the 
budget, and in many discussions we have had in which the 
member has participated. We have reinforced the importance of 
the conversion to a knowledge based, scientific innovation 
economy. That is the plan of the government. That is the 
direction we are going.
<P>
	I hope he will get on board and help us to go in that direction.

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday the Minister of Finance told investment dealers that 
further deep spending reductions are coming. He said: ``There 
are no sacred cows. There are a whole series of government 
programs that we simply did not have time to get at in the 
government's first budget''.
<P>
	In March, however, the Prime Minister told an Edmonton 
audience that all spending reductions for the next three years 
were on the table.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister end this stream of mixed signals 
coming from the government and tell the House whether the 
government will be announcing additional spending reductions 
in the months ahead?
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
said that the cuts that we had provided for in the budget were 
needed to achieve our goal of 3 per cent of GNP for the deficit. 
But we said that there was other work being done.
<P>
	We are looking at this time at other opportunities for cuts. The 
minister of federal-provincial relations, who is responsible for 
renewal of the government, is looking at all the boards and 
commissions that are reporting to Parliament or to the Prime 
Minister or to ministers in order to cut more. More cuts are 
coming and we are working on them.
<P>
	I repeat that the program we put forward in the budget is the 
program that will lead us to the goal that we stated  clearly in the 
campaign and in the budget. We will do everything necessary to 
reduce the deficit in relation to GNP at 3 per cent.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
just so that we have this absolutely clear, we all know that the 
finance minister is talking about further spending reductions to 
try to boost investor confidence in the Canadian economy. 
However, investors realize that the Minister of Finance will not 
prevail unless he is fully supported by the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister assure us that he supports the finance

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	The daily newspaper <I>Le Soleil</I> reported that a ministerial 
briefing note addressed to a federal Cabinet minister expressed 
concern about the demise of Oerlikon Aerospace's operations in 
Saint-Jean. The note warned the government that the firm had 
very few orders on the books and that without a true 
diversification and conversion program, it was in danger of 
folding.
<P>
	Now that the minister knows about Oerlikon's very uncertain 
future, does he intend to move quickly to support the 
diversification of the company's operations and thus ensure the 
survival of this high-tech firm which has seen its workforce 
shrink from 750 to 300?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
understand full well that the hon. member, like the member who 
earlier raised questions on the same subject, is very concerned 
about this company's problems. Oerlikon is working on a 
number of contracts. In fact, it recently received a contract 
worth $15 million.
<P>
	Our goal is to find ways to help companies grow, not just in 
the field of military equipment, but in others areas of research 
and development, in keeping with the new economic climate.
<P>
	We are prepared to work with Oerlikon, just as we are 
prepared to work with other firms.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a

	Will the minister not recognize the need to take urgent action 
instead of waiting for the company to shut its doors, as we saw 
happen with Hyundai?
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that Oerlikon shareholders also want to take action rather 
quickly. First, the company needs to address this issue. 
Secondly, governments may also help Oerlikon, but not 
necessarily by granting subsidies. Oerlikon needs to have a 
commercially-sound business plan. This will be the key to its 
success and to the success of other firms.

my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	Ministers of this government continue to send out mixed 
signals on important economic issues. Yesterday the Prime 
Minister suggested that the drop in last month's official 
unemployment rate was the result of successful Liberal 
economic policies. On the same issue the Minister of Finance 
admitted that much of the drop was due to 28,000 young 
Canadians giving up their job search.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Human Resources Development regard 
driving young Canadians out of the job market as successful 
economic policy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the figures released last Friday 
show that over the past two months 115,000 new jobs were 
created in Canada. Most important and what we can take some 
confidence in is that 75 per cent of those jobs were full-time 
jobs.
<P>
	I share the hon. member's concern about the real problem this 
country's young people face. One of the reasons we have started 
a major recasting of many of the programs is so that we can 
specifically target the needs of young people.
<P>
	In this case the Prime Minister was certainly correct when he 
said that generally the economy is improving as a result of the 
new sense of confidence Canadians have as a consequence of 
this government's actions.
<P>
	At the same time we are also aware of the need to begin to deal 
adequately with youth unemployment. If the hon. member can 
show some patience for a day or two I think he will see the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2931"> 2931 </A></B>
<P>
beginning of a very serious attack on that problem by this 
government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton-Melville):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplemental is also for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The Prime Minister suggested yesterday that the 
infrastructure program should receive some credit for the drop 
in unemployment in March. The fact is that not one dollar of 
infrastructure spending has yet been spent. It should be no 
surprise that financial markets are confused by the contradictory 
statements made by the ministers of this government.
<P>
	At this time when credit rating agencies are reconsidering 
Canadian issues and no level of government has any spare cash, 
will the minister cancel the infrastructure program and save$6 billion in borrowed money for Canadians?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the only confusion is that of the 
hon. member.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said very clearly what we have all said. 
The investments under the infrastructure program are an added 
bonus that will create further confidence and activity and will 
help get the engine of this economy going.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. member that last week, in the company of 
the President of the Treasury Board in my own province of 
Manitoba, a neighbouring province to his, we announced133 projects for over $130 million creating close to 3,000 jobs in 
that one province alone. Manitobans are very happy about that.

two specific issues. However, the government is still deferring 
its decision on the proposal to build a ferry for the Magdalen 
Islands and refuses to disclose its intentions regarding the 
multi-functional ``smart ship'' project.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Industry. If the government 
still believes in employment, why is it putting off its decision on 
these two projects, when they are part of a real defence industry 
conversion strategy and would ensure the future of this 
shipyard?

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is

Goldbloom states: ``Given the present economic circumstances, 
we are more convinced than ever that the bilingualism bonus

as opposed to the government's stated intent of deficit reduction 
sends out a mixed signal.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the Prime Minister might explain if any decision to act

to the RCMP?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there are always some administrative problems with any 
program. We are looking into it.
<P>
	This program has been a very good incentive in Canada in 
helping a lot of people to learn the other official language. It is a 
great asset when people can do that.
<P>
	In fact, the report indicates that the number of young 
Canadians who have become bilingual since the program was 
instituted has gone from 3 per cent to 11 per cent. That means the 
number of young anglophones who have learned French and 
francophones who have learned English has quadrupled since 
this program was instituted. It is a great thing for Canada.

	In February of this year Canadian fishermen were absolutely 
elated that the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans was able to

that celebration was quickly muted by the fact that the European

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I spoke yesterday in 
response to a question in this House expressing my own horror at 
the recent savage and senseless crimes. I expressed my view as 
well that we must not let our anger and our concern regarding 
those recent events have us jump to conclusions about simple 
solutions to these problems.
<P>
	Yes, it is time for action. As I said yesterday, this government 
is at present putting together proposals which will come soon to 
this House to make the criminal laws of this country more 
effective and also deal with the need to respect the importance of 
crime prevention in these initiatives.
<P>
	Before long the hon. member and this House will see concrete 
action from this government.

	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, this question is for the Minister of Transport or his 
designate, the secretary.
<P>
	Recently the newspapers have been full of rumours about VIA 
Rail cuts to passenger rail service for Canadians, more 
specifically, the route from Sarnia, London, Stratford, 
Kitchener, Waterloo, Guelph, Brampton to Toronto. This route 
is presently one of the most patronized routes in all of Canada.
<P>
	Could the minister or his designate provide the assurance that 
this rail route will not be abandoned?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joe Fontana (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from the 
member for Perth-Wellington-Waterloo.
<P>
	I should point out that these rumours are simply that, 
rumours, and are based on unfounded speculation. This 
government has not made any decisions on service levels to VIA 
but members in this House should understand that the levels of 
budget for VIA have been established by way of the budget that 
was tabled in February.
<P>
	VIA is presently undertaking negotiations with its labour 
unions. We are hopeful that it in fact can gain the efficiencies 
that it needs, that labour will co-operate in those deliberations 
and that in fact the public will also participate because the 
solution to a viable passenger rail system in this country is that 
all stakeholders can in fact make it possible.
<P>
	No decisions have been made by this government, nor will 
they until such time as those negotiations have been completed.

<P>
	After he promised on International Women's Day to consider 
the possibility of criminalizing excision, the Minister of Justice 
told us yesterday that he does not intend to amend the Criminal 
Code or to introduce specific provisions to deal with this form of 
sexual violence.
<P>
	The minister considers the present provisions on assault to be 
sufficient. However, many countries, including France and 
Great Britain, have felt the need to legislate specifically on 
excision.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2935"> 2935 </A></B>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday I tabled a 
document with the House following question period in which I 
furnished written information with respect to the conclusions to 
which I had come on the subject of female genital mutilation, 
making it clear that I concluded after investigating the matter 
during the past month that the response lies not in further change 
to the Criminal Code but rather more effective education and 
enforcement of the present laws.
<P>
	The document I tabled made it clear that during the past 30 
days I conferred with among others the attorney general of 
Ontario. I have spoken to members of a task force which she put 
in place. I met in my office with the chair and members of the 
National Women's Committee that produced the report that gave 
rise to the original question. I examined the factual situation in 
Ontario,  Quebec and British Columbia, the provinces in which 
this problem is most pronounced. The consensus of opinion was 
that the focus of the federal government at this time should be on 
education in partnership with the provinces and community 
groups. That is where we are going to solve this problem and 
lessen its incidence, not in further amendments to the Criminal 
Code. That is the conclusion to which I came.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, would 
the minister have us believe that these opinions and studies and 
those of his advisers will be more effective than formal 
legislation making excision illegal?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, female genital mutilation is 
already a criminal misdeed in this country. It is plainly contrary 
to at least three sections of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Yesterday I furnished the hon. member with a copy of the 
document that I tabled with the House setting forth the analysis 
upon which I rely for those conclusions.
<P>
	In my respectful view, it is not going to help dealing with this 
difficult and tragic problem for us to refine further a code that 
already prohibits the misconduct. Our focus must be on ensuring 
that the people who arrive as immigrants and the people who are 
in Canada already are aware that it is against the law and that the 
provincial authorities work with us in enforcing those laws 
sternly and efficiently. I believe that is the way to come to grips 
with this problem and that is the conclusion which I expressed in 
the document that I tabled.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="VIOLENTCRIME">VIOLENT CRIME</A></H3>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is also for the justice minister. Perhaps that is reflective 
of the growing fears of Canadians of the incidence of home 
invasions, drive-by shootings and other random acts of violence 
in this country.
<P>
	I would ask the minister what specifically he intends to do to 
curb this urban terrorism and protect the safety of law-abiding 
citizens.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, may I first take this 
opportunity to say that I do not share the alarmist sense that the 
hon. member communicates in her question.
<P>
	Of course I am appalled, as all Canadians are, with the 
savagery and the senselessness of the crimes to which she has 
referred. Clearly we cannot tolerate such violent crime in this 
country.
<P>
	At the same time I urge the hon. member and Canadians to 
keep this issue in context. This country has a justice system 
which works. The statistics demonstrate  that in terms of violent 
crime and crime in general in Canada we are still a civilized 
society.
<P>
	I will conclude by saying that we should not be stampeded by 
these single events by jumping into what seem to be simple 
solutions. At the same time, we have to take them for what they 
are, symptoms that further actions require. By changes to the 
Criminal Code, the Young Offenders Act and by focusing on 
crime-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Calgary North.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
sincerely respect this minister, but I would say that voicing the 
concerns of my constituents and other Canadians should not be 
labelled by the minister as alarmist.
<P>
	In fact, I would suggest to the minister that his continued 
answers to the effect that, yes, there is a clear problem that we 
are deeply concerned about but let us stay cool is not an answer 
at all to Canadians.
<P>
	I would ask when the minister is going to table the changes to 
the Criminal Code and the Young Offenders Act that Canadians 
have been demanding and expecting. They want to know a 
timeframe.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> I will be brief, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	When I said that I did not want the hon. member to be an 
alarmist, I respect the concern. I am just saying that we should 
keep it in context and that basically we have a safe and civilized 
society.
<P>
	In terms of timeframe, I have already said that I propose to 
bring to this House before the end of June specific proposals to 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2936"> 2936 </A></B>

over to the parliamentary committee for its detailed review.
<P>
	I have said as well that we are going to have legislation before 
the House before the end of June on other changes to the 
Criminal Code, including with respect to sentencing. We 
propose to fulfil that undertaking.

	<B>Mr. Joe Comuzzi (Thunder Bay-Nipigon):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	In March 1995 Thunder Bay will host the World Nordic 
Games. Our community, through the great work of all the 
volunteers, has worked very hard for the last four years to make 
sure that this event is an international success. The city and the 
province have also committed over $8 million, but 
unfortunately the federal government has failed to even come 
close to this amount, in fact less than a quarter.
<P>
	Since the games are less than a year away, I ask the minister 
how much he is going to commit financially today to the Nordic 
Games, when will he make that  commitment, and when will he 
announce what services will be provided so that the people who 
are involved in this process can get on with their job of making it 
a success?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his short question.
<P>
	I share his concern that the Nordic Games be a great success 
because I think it will bring a lot of tourism and business to 
North Bay.
<P>
	The federal government has committed $2 million and is 
honouring its commitment. It is looking into the possibility of 
providing services to make sure that the games are a success. We 
are in close consultation with the minister concerned in Ontario 
and with the mayor of Thunder Bay. I am confident that putting 
our efforts together will ensure great games at Thunder Bay.

referred to the francophone and anglophone population. What I 
should have said was that in 1971, 3 per cent outside of Quebec

our policy of bilingualism in Canada it has almost quadrupled at 
11 per cent.

	The House resumed consideration of report stage of Bill 
C-18.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also 
have the pleasure-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2937"> 2937 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I wonder if 
members would come to order so that we might be able to 
resume debate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron: </B>Mr. Speaker, it seems that the question period 
was very lively. The debate is still heated.
<P>
	So, I also have the pleasure to speak to Bill C-18, the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Suspension Act, 1994.
<P>
	Of course, as you were able to see from the various statements 
made since this morning, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the 
bill. Since the beginning of the electoral boundaries 
readjustment process, the Bloc Quebecois members, in keeping 
with the Elections Act, have decided to get involved in that 
process so as to defend the interests of their constituents, of their 
fellow citizens.
<P>
	This morning, you heard our colleague, the member for 
Shefford, say that he has always resided in the riding of Shefford 
and that with the new provisions or new proposals introduced by 
the Chief Electoral Officer, he would become a resident of the 
riding of Chambly. So, it would be somewhat unusual for an 
individual who has always resided in one particular riding to 
represent a riding in which he has never resided, simply because 
of changes made to electoral boundaries.
<P>
	That is why we support the principle of this bill, which is to 
temporarily suspend the electoral boundaries readjustment 
process. Of course, we also support the principle of an equal 
vote for all citizens. But that principle, when applied too 
restrictively and too mechanically, can produce unfortunate 
distortions, and I will have the opportunity to get back to that 
later.
<P>
	The readjustment of electoral boundaries at fixed intervals  
prevents the development, the building of a  sense of belonging 
to one's riding. The example that I mentioned earlier concerning 
my colleague from Shefford is certainly one of the best we can 
give. He explained it to you very well a while ago. He has been a 
resident of the riding of Shefford for many years. He now 
represents this riding in the House of Commons and by virtue of 
the amendments proposed by the Chief Electoral Officer, he 
would become a resident of the riding of Chambly but would 
remain the member for Shefford. Therefore, I believe there are 
anomalies that must be avoided.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	This case of my colleague from Shefford shows that people 
who live in the fringe areas of their electoral district and then 
switch periodically from one district to another on account of 
readjustments of the electoral map find it very difficult to 
develop a sense of belonging and to identify with their riding 
because of all this moving around.
<P>
	As far as demographic criteria are concerned-as I said 
earlier-we fully support the principle of a equal vote for each 
citizen of Canada and of Quebec. We do support the principle 
that each citizen must be represented by a member of Parliament 
and that this representation is as important as that of any other 
citizen throughout this country. However, the demographic 
criterion used for the readjustment of the electoral boundaries 
too often masks other criteria which should be as important, 
such as social, economic cultural factors which, I think, should 
also be taken into consideration in the readjustment of the 
boundaries of this constituency.
<P>
	As I emphasized earlier, this sense of belonging, the 
possibility of identifying with our riding, with the people of our 
riding are surely as valid as the strictly mathematical 
calculations mainly used for the readjustment of the electoral 
boundaries. These calculations inhibit the creation of a type of 
interaction specific to a riding, to a community. It is a fact that 
has been recognized, not so long ago, only a few months ago, by 
the National Assembly which amended its elections act to 
prevent further readjustment of the electoral boundaries for the 
next ten years.
<P>
	It is thus assumed that there will not be any readjustment of 
the electoral boundaries in Quebec for ten years, which means 
that for ten years, the residents of a district will be able to feel 
part of their community and to identify with their MNA. 
Electoral boundaries are not readjusted at each election as was 
the case before under the Quebec elections act.
<P>
	I think that we are now considering the spirit behind Bill 
C-18. We support the bill, for the reasons I have just stated. In 
fact, we are not afraid to say that. I will come back to that a bit 
later. If we have to consider amendments, we will perhaps have 
to think of redrawing the electoral boundaries on the 
demographic basis that I talked about earlier. However, as my 
colleague for Richelieu mentioned earlier this morning, we have 
to  contemplate a more thorough reform of the parliamentary 
institutions and, in doing so-we know we cannot use certain 
terms-reassess the role of the other Chamber, the Upper House.
<P>
	My colleague from Richmond-Wolfe, who is with us this 
afternoon, and my colleague from Richelieu talked about that 
issue regularly, and I think that it is quite justified. My colleague 
from Richelieu said that there are in fact, in the Upper House, a 
number of people with quite valuable and useful expertise, but 
those people often end up in that Chamber for reasons that are 
not too valid. People often get appointed to the Senate strictly on 
a partisan basis.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2938"> 2938 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, their legitimacy is very questionable. The 
suggestion of my colleague from Richelieu was that those 
people who are qualified, who have plenty of skills should be 
able to use their skills in this House where people are 
democratically elected and where their legitimacy cannot be 
questioned. It was suggested that we should eventually revise 
and reform our parliamentary institutions and abolish that 
timeworn and rusty institution that supports friends of the party, 
friends of the government who periodically, depending on which 
party sits on the other side of this House, cause changes in the 
majorities in the other place. Then we could eventually consider 
such a reform.
<P>
	Speaking of reform, I am wondering about the participation of 
our colleagues in the Reform Party in this debate. We are 
presently discussing a motion brought by them, but for some 
time now I have seen only members of the Bloc Quebecois 
taking the floor. I believe therefore we should question the 
seriousness of our colleagues who bring in a motion and leave it 
to members of the Bloc Quebecois to speak on that motion.
<P>
	I therefore invite my colleagues in the Reform Party to be 
consistent and to rise on their own motion. We should not be 
surprised by the silence of our Liberal friends, although it is 
absolutely deplorable for the electors of the various ridings 
represented by Liberal members to see those members being so 
absent and silent during a debate of such significance for the 
future of their constituents. The interests of the constituents of 
those ridings represented by those Liberal members are at stake.
<P>
	That being said, I will now leave the floor, at least I hope, to a 
member of the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
all my colleagues have already invited you to visit their riding. I 
do not have to do the same, since you probably have been to 
Mirabel Airport a few times to catch a plane. You were then in 
the riding of Argenteuil-Papineau.
<P>
	With the last electoral reform, the population of 
Argenteuil-Papineau would rise from 72,000 to 98,000. 
Should I rejoice in this increase, or deplore the changes in the 
electoral map?
<P>
	Before making my case, I would like to talk about some of the 
anomalies or aberrations created by the reorganization of 
electoral maps or any other boundary change requiring 
expropriations. I would like to relate a rather bizarre event 
which took place when part of Sainte-Scholastique was 
expropriated to make room for Mirabel Airport.
<P>
	I do not know who determined what lands were to be 
expropriated, but an astounding event occurred in the village 
where I live, Saint-Canut. A line was drawn through the middle 
of a house, through the middle of a property. Really, it did 
happen. The house was later demolished but, at the time, people 
wondered why certains parts of the village were being 
expropriated and others not.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
	This reminds me of different electoral map anomalies. My 
colleague from Laurentides represents the neighbouring riding, 
where two municipalities are included in totally inappropriate 
territories. For example, the village of Sainte-Sophie is 
adjacent to the riding of Laurentides. Children go to school in 
Saint-Jérôme which is in the riding of Laurentides. 
Sainte-Sophie is socially part of the riding of Laurentides, but 
on the electoral map, it is part of the riding of my colleague from 
Joliette.
<P>
	Moreover, that same riding of Laurentides includes the 
municipality of Chertsey, which is much closer to the riding of 
Joliette. In view of this fact, how, I wonder, do senior officials, 
cartographers, geographers, all those people who draw 
boundaries, manage to get such results?
<P>
	Personally, I cannot complain about the electoral reform since 
the areas which would be added to my riding, namely the city of 
Saint-Jovite, the village of Lac-Carré, as well as La Minerve, 
La Conception, Labelle, Lac-Supérieur and Mont-Tremblant, 
are all part of a strong sovereignist riding which, for decades 
now, has been represented by the Parti Quebecois in Quebec's 
national assembly. So, as a sovereignist and partisan of a 
sovereign Quebec, I should be pleased with an addition to my 
riding which I am likely to benefit from.
<P>
	However, Mr. Speaker, I must tell you that in the best case 
scenario, I will not be campaigning in the next federal election, 
for the simple reason that important events will have taken place 
in Quebec. Indeed, the Parti Quebecois will surely be elected in 
the coming year. A referendum will be held the following year 
and, at that time, Quebec will become a country and a sovereign 
nation. Consequently, my colleagues from the Bloc Quebecois 
and I will no longer be in the picture during the next federal 
election. However, the fact remains that, as members currently 
representing Quebec, we have to play the role which we assumed 
and we must defend Quebeckers' interests, and this is precisely 
what we are doing today.
<P>
	Two municipalities would be added; I just mentioned 
Saint-Jovite. Earlier, my colleague from Laurentides  deplored 
the fact that Saint-Jovite and the surrounding municipalities 
which I just named would become part of the riding of 
Argenteuil-Papineau. I have no complaint about that, but I 
think that these municipalities have nothing in common with 
Argenteuil-Papineau, since they are located in the south-north 
axis from Saint-Jérôme to Mont-Laurier. Moreover, these 
communities all have an identical profile, they belong to similar 
regions 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2939"> 2939 </A></B>
<P>
which they must continue to be part of, and I believe that 
Saint-Jovite should remain part of the riding of Laurentides.
<P>
	Thurso is also being added to my riding. This municipality is 
of course located on the way to Ottawa, and its mayor, 
councillors and citizens have openly voiced their opposition to 
their community becoming part of Argenteuil-Papineau. I can 
understand that, since this municipality is much closer to the 
Outaouais region than to the regions of Lachute, Mirabel or even 
Oka, which are also part of Argenteuil-Papineau.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, I have little choice but to oppose the 
amendment proposed by the Reform Party.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened very carefully to the excellent speeches made by my 
colleagues and I will not repeat what they just said. I simply 
want to know how some decisions that make absolutely no sense 
are arrived at.
<P>
	What are the reasons for making a riding in eastern Quebec 
disappear? And I am talking about my riding, 
Matapédia-Matane. Geographically, it is one of the most 
beautiful ridings, and the people who live there and whom I have 
the pleasure of serving are truly attached to their RCM and to 
their parish. I have travelled throughout the riding and people 
are very disappointed. Is this decision based simply on a 
demographic ratio? Are numbers the only important factor? 
Apparently, yes, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	For a region like mine, a rural MP is terribly important. I do 
not mean to say that MPs from urban areas are not important, but 
I would say that maybe rural MPs are particularly important 
because of the distances involved. The various parishes are 
approximately ten miles apart. It takes hours, if not days, just to 
go around my riding.
<P>
	In our part of the country, the MP plays an essential role. Just 
spend one day in my office in Matane, Amqui or Mont-Joli and 
you will know what is asked of an MP there. It is incredible. 
After going everywhere else, people end up inevitably in their 
MP's office because they trust him. He has a say in the important 
decisions on regional development.
<P>
	Regions experiencing growth face different problems than 
regions which are in decline. Unfortunately, our region is in 
decline. Is the importance of rural people being neglected in the 
distribution of electoral districts? I think so. Rural people are 
not considered important and I would even say that they are 
treated as second-class  citizens. I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, but 
there is no such thing as a second-class citizen. Every person 
has the right to live where he or she wants to, to feel a sense of 
belonging to the place where he or she lives, and that sense of 
belonging must be respected. Unfortunately, this was not to be 
the case in my riding.
<P>
	In our view, the commission's proposal will only further 
impede recovery in an area that is already considered to be 
among the poorest. It will mean the loss of a much-needed voice 
in Parliament for eastern Quebec. It would make it harder for a 
member of Parliament to defend the interests of an ever-larger 
riding.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	This proposal would not allow cultural, political and 
socio-economic forces to do all they could to bring about the 
economic recovery everyone wants, especially in our 
underdeveloped regions. This goes beyond simple statistical 
calculations and the straightforward application of a 
demographic formula.
<P>
	I am very happy that the subject has been raised in the House 
because when I toured my riding, I noticed that there was 
widespread dissatisfaction. People were asking: Will we feel 
like voting in a federal election if the federal government shows 
no respect for our community, our living environment?
<P>
	In Quebec, regional county municipalities are becoming more 
and more important and I think that it is a good thing. The 
boundaries of a federal riding are also very important. People 
are wondering whether they will go to vote if they change 
ridings.
<P>
	As I said earlier, there are now five ridings in eastern Quebec: 
Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Gaspé, 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, Matapédia-Matane and 
Rimouski-Témiscouata. The ridings of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup and Rimouski-Témiscouata 
have a population of about 73,000. The riding of Gaspé is the 
largest with an area of 12,268 square kilometres. My riding, 
Matapédia-Matane, is close behind with an area of 10,959 
square kilometres, and the riding of 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, is the smallest with 5,476 
square kilometres. As for Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine, 
it is the least populated, with 52,000 inhabitants. Is the number 
of inhabitants the only criterion? I say no. There are other 
criteria.
<P>
	As for the number of municipalities in each riding, 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup has the most, 49. In 
Matapédia-Matane, there are 46. The riding of Gaspé has the 
fewest, 30.
<P>
	In the proposals made by the commission, the number of 
ridings in the East would decrease from five to four. The riding 
of Matapédia-Matane would no longer exist. The riding of 
Gaspé would see its population increase from 62,000 to 80,000 
with the reform. The riding of Gaspé-Matane would cover a 
gigantic area of 17,783 square kilometers.
<P>
	If you tried to cover that distance in Toronto or Montreal, you 
would soon be all over the city.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2940"> 2940 </A></B>
<P>
	The riding of Bonaventure-Îles-de-la-Madeleine will also 
be significantly enlarged to 11,375 square kilometers from 
8,155 square kilometers.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois cannot accept eliminating a riding in the 
East. If we lose a riding, we will lose political influence in the 
House of Commons, and so will our region. However, I share my 
colleague's view that hopefully in four years we will not have to 
ask ourselves these questions.
<P>
	As a rural region, eastern Quebec would once more be 
marginalized by this redrawing of the electoral map. The rural 
community is in crisis. It is particularly the people from those 
small parishes who come to see their member of Parliament 
more often.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	At a time when many organizations and stakeholders want to 
decentralize government services and bring elected 
representatives closer to the people, reducing the number of 
ridings would go against the wishes of the people.
<P>
	We deplore that, again, taxpayers will have to bear the cost of 
this reform.
<P>
	The riding of Gaspé-Matane would include communities 
like Amqui, Cap-Chat, Gaspé and Matane. So try to imagine the 
distance the member will have to travel to meet his constituents, 
and vice versa.
<P>
	Earlier, a member said that VIA Rail did not exist anymore in 
our region. Buses are a rare sight. Our roads are in bad shape. 
What is left for these people to travel? They have nothing, and 
the government now wants to increase the size of their riding. 
That is absolutely senseless, and that is why I share my 
colleagues' view.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a comment for the hon. member for 
Matapédia-Matane. I grew up in rural New Brunswick-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order, please. I do not 
mean to interrupt the member, but I just want to be sure we all 
understand that there is no comment or question period as such. 
However the member can certainly use up to 10 minutes to make 
an intervention on this particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Brushett:</B> Mr. Speaker, the intervention is to share the 
sentiments of the hon. member for Matapédia-Matane and his 
values for the rural communities of Gaspé. Rural New 
Brunswick and rural Nova Scotia have the same values, needs 
and long distances between small communities. We too know 
that representation must come from each geographic region and 
not necessarily from statistics.
<P>
	It is important to bring forward ideas. Somehow the hon. 
member is presenting ideals that we all share and want, yet at the 
same time he feels they will not be here  for the next election. 
That is entirely contradictory in spirit and thought.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
express my support for Bill C-18 which suspends the process of 
redrawing federal electoral boundaries.
<P>
	My riding of Bourassa takes in the entire city of Montreal 
North. Currently, I represent the 85,516 residents of this 
municipality. Under the proposed readjustment, the riding's 
population would increase to 94,214, whereas the average 
population of federal ridings is 91,500.
<P>
	If the proposed reforms are carried out, my riding will extend 
beyond the limits of Montreal North. This municipality is 
steeped in history. It has its own well-established traditions and 
a very strong identity. For over 75 years, it has been home to a 
vibrant community, organized with people, not just 
administration, in mind.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	In our opinion, the new administrative distribution is totally 
arbitrary. Montreal North has its own community, economic, 
social and cultural agencies. There are many community 
agencies in Montreal North that are doing an amazing job. 
Montreal North has over 3,000 volunteers. My riding, like the 
rest of the province, was hard hit by the economic crisis from 
which we are just now emerging. Fortunately, we can count on 
community agencies that are doing incredible work.
<P>
	One local community social service centre in Montreal North 
recently celebrated its 20th anniversary. A few days ago, a 
benefit dinner and gala were organized by the CLSC foundation 
of Montréal-Nord. All local officials were in attendance, 
including yours truly in his capacity of federal MP. I want to take 
this opportunity to praise the remarkable work of the director 
general of the centre who has been there since day one. I also 
want to assure the centre that it can count on my complete 
co-operation.
<P>
	The residents of Montreal North also have close ties to the 
mayor of their city who has held this post for over thirty years. 
He recently celebrated three decades in office and I was on hand 
for the festivities. He enjoys the public's support. Unlike me, he 
is not a sovereigntist or a member of the Bloc Quebecois. 
However, I would add that-
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Just give him time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nunez:</B> That will come. I wish to point out his 
contribution to the economic, social and cultural life of 
Montreal North. Montreal North also has a recently formed 
economic and community development corporation that is 
doing a great job for the people of Montreal North, especially 
with boards on economic issues that bring together 
representatives of the people.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2941"> 2941 </A></B>
<P>
	The citizens of Montreal North want a federal riding that they 
can really identify with. In fact, I have consulted the residents of 
Montreal North about changing the name of my riding.
<P>
	My riding is named Bourassa, after an outstanding man, a 
former director of <I>Le Devoir</I>, a great intellectual. But we have a 
problem because there is a provincial riding with the same 
name, Bourassa, and there is always confusion. My constituents 
want the riding to be called Montreal North, so it is more closely 
identified with our city, just as ridings in other Canadian cities 
are called Calgary West, Calgary East, Edmonton North, 
Edmonton South and Québec-Est; they take their name from the 
city where the riding is located. That is not the case in Montreal 
North and I am often asked where Bourassa is. Sometimes it is 
also confused with the former Premier of Quebec, Robert 
Bourassa.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	We want to keep our riding as it is now. For all these reasons, I 
oppose the amendments moved by the Reform Party and I 
support the bill. Rather than proceed with arbitrary 
administrative revisions, I think that we should instead look at 
the basic criteria for forming federal constituencies. Once 
again, Mr. Speaker, I would vote for this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
pleasure that I rise today to speak on Bill C-18, concerning the 
revision of the electoral map. I must tell you that, when I heard 
that the Liberal Party had decided to introduce this bill, there 
was no doubt in my mind that they could count on my support.
<P>
	The first thing I wondered about was those people who had 
decided to draw lines any old way, in their offices, without 
knowing what they were doing. When they got to my riding of 
Lotbinière, a beautiful riding along the St. Lawrence River up to 
the Pierre Laporte Bridge, in Quebec City, or just about, let me 
tell you that what they had in mind, what they wanted to do to my 
riding was complete nonsense. It made no sense in practical, 
professional, political, social or cultural terms.
<P>
	I can tell you this: many of my constituents called to ask me: 
``Mr. Landry, what is going to happen to Lotbinière? Will you, 
as a Bloc Quebecois member from Quebec, come to our defence 
or settle for come what may?'' At that time, to reassure my 
constituents, I told them in a conference and the newspapers: 
``Look, I am a Quebecer. I am in Ottawa and I intend to stand up 
for the riding of Lotbinière at the federal level, as well as the 
interests of Quebec and Canada. That is my duty, and as long as I 
will be sitting in the federal Parliament, this will remain my 
vision of the riding of Lotbinière at the federal level.''
<P>
	But there is more to it. From then on, I looked at the basic 
criteria used by the commission. I was told: ``Look, we have to 
standardize all this as much as possible to make ridings match 
the RCMs.'' I was told that the population pool also had to be 
taken into consideration. I must say that, in my riding of 
Lotbinière, we met all the requirements. We had the required 
population and regional county municipalities. What the revisal 
office was planning to do was basically to tear  apart this most 
beautiful riding of mine because there is only one major town in 
my riding, namely Victoriaville-Arthabaska.
<P>
	Let me tell you what was going to happen to 
Victoriaville-Arthabaska. In their office here in Ottawa, 
officials decided to draw a line right across here and chop off 
Victoriaville-Arthabaska, the biggest town of the riding, and 
tack it onto the riding of Richmond-Wolfe. Which meant I 
would find myself with no large town in the riding of Lotbinière. 
That is nonsense. I must also tell you this because it is very 
important. Not only were they taking away a town, but there 
were ties involved, the ties between the people of that town and 
the rest of the population of the riding. 
Victoriaville-Arthabaska is the queen city of the area which 
includes Princeville, Daveluyville and Warwick, and it was 
shunted off towards Sherbrooke, to be attached to 
Richmond-Wolfe.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	Such a drawing of electoral boundaries leaves me speechless. 
To me, and to the whole riding of Lotbinière, it did not make 
sense.
<P>
	If such electoral boundaries had been implemented, the riding 
of Lotbinière would have been wiped off the federal electoral 
map in a few years.
<P>
	If that was the intent, it was a mistake. I am glad to see that our 
colleagues from the other side adopted the same position as we 
did because it is sad to see so much money being wasted. Some 
would say that money is not the only thing, but we are going 
through difficult times and we need money.
<P>
	Instead of going ahead with the new boundaries suggested, I 
would rather see the money used to create jobs and train 
workers. Then, I would find that we put the money to good use. 
We must not forget that we are talking about not a few hundred 
thousand dollars, but millions. And you know that millions can 
go a long way.
<P>
	Of course I do not accept the Reform Party's amendment at 
all. I am glad that we took a position that will soon be adopted, 
confirming the present boundaries of the riding of Lotbinière. In 
four years from now, if the Bloc Quebecois is not here any more, 
I will at least be able to say with pride that as the member for the 
federal riding of Lotbinière, I took a stand when I had to. That is 
what is the most important for me and my constituents. In four 
years from now, we will see whether we have to change our 
position.
<P>
	In my riding, social and cultural life is centred on 
Victoriaville and Arthabaska. It is all there.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2942"> 2942 </A></B>
<P>
	I am glad that there has been a change in direction because I 
felt we were heading the wrong way. My constituents are quite 
pleased also because I told them last week that we would 
probably not have to appear before the commission. I certainly 
hope this bill will be passed soon and that all consultations will 
be called off.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, when my colleagues across the way or my 
colleagues on this side come up with good ideas on  electoral 
boundaries readjustment, I can look at them with an open mind. I 
like to be able to stand back to get a better understanding before 
I make a decision with this team.
<P>
	I like this House and, for the time being, I am here to defend 
the interests of both Quebec and Canada. At this very moment, I 
do not talk as a separatist as such. I am here to look out for the 
interests of Quebec and Canada, and my position on the electoral 
boundaries readjustment is quite clear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. 
member for Verdun-Saint-Paul for his applause at the start of 
my remarks, but it might be wiser to wait and see what I have to 
say.
<P>
	I think what my colleague meant is that, for the time being, he 
takes to heart the interests of both Canada and Quebec. That is 
my interpretation.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to take part in this debate on Bill 
C-18 and more particularly on the amendment moved by the 
Reform Party. I have to say I do not agree with the amendment, 
because it does not give us enough time to examine fully the 
impact of those boundary readjustments.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I remember that in 1985-86 we went through the same 
exercise. We had to redefine a riding on Montreal's south shore, 
a process which took quite a bit of time because it was suggested 
then to cut out from Longueuil the area which was expanding. 
Indeed, a proposal had been made to remove from my riding the 
whole industrial zone where lots were available for 
development purposes. I was going to find myself trying to 
promote the economy of my region with almost no opportunities 
left to do so. Primarily for that reason, I asked the mayor of 
Longueuil for his opinion on this issue, and I also consulted with 
representatives of the Liberal Party, who were opponents but 
also colleagues, and we agreed that it would not be a good idea to 
divide Longueuil in that fashion.
<P>
	Consequently, we had to redefine five or six ridings. The 
decision not to reduce the number of constituents in the eastern 
part of the riding but rather to the south meant that we had to 
redraw the ridings of Saint-Hubert, La Prairie, Saint-Jean, 
Chambly and Verchères. You can imagine how long this exercise 
took. This is why I support the bill proposed by the Chief 
Electoral Officer in the document on new electoral boundaries.
<P>
	There is another reason why I believe more time is needed, 
particularly in the case of Longueuil and the vast region on 
Montreal's south shore. The Montérégie is the region which has 
been experiencing the strongest growth in Quebec over the last 
fifteen years. It is in that region that the largest number of jobs 
were created. I believe it is also where the population has 
increased the most. In fact, it is for these reasons that a new 
riding is proposed on Montreal's south shore, as well as on the 
north shore, in Laval.
<P>
	I should point out too that many studies are currently 
underway, including the Pichette report, commissioned by the 
Quebec government, which also proposes the creation of new 
regions on the south shore. The south shore would no longer be 
managed by the Société montérégienne de développement or 
SMD, but would be divided into two sub-regions which would 
be managed by the greater Montreal area. We would have 
Montreal, two regions on the south shore, Laval, the West 
Island, as well as the east end of Montreal which could form a 
large community for the purposes of economic development. 
Obviously, this will result in major changes on Montreal's south 
shore.
<P>
	As I just mentioned, the south shore is currently managed by 
the Montérégie. I personally sit on the Partners for Employment 
committee-along with members of Quebec's national 
assembly, mayors, reeves, representatives from regional county 
municipalities, as well as senior federal civil servants-and I 
realize that the Montérégie region is not necessarily easy to 
manage. There are many interests which are not common.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	The people in Granby, Bromont and Saint-Jean do not have a 
lot in common with the residents of Longueuil, Boucherville and 
Saint-Lambert. That is why we have undertaken an in-depth 
review of how to better manage the Greater South Shore of 
Montreal in order to be more efficient at all levels, whether it be 
economic development, social affairs, cultural affairs, or 
tourism. So, we are currently conducting this in-depth review to 
make sure our region can prosper in the areas I just mentioned.
<P>
	So, the fact that we have two years and commissions to help us 
examine in detail how we can divide the ridings on the South 
Shore is very useful, and I think we really need all of these 
things.
<P>
	Of course, for the last fifteen years, I have been very involved 
on the South Shore of Montreal. I do not need to be reminded, 
but I feel I must point out that, in 1983-84, during my term as 
chairman of the Chamber of Commerce of the Greater South 
Shore of Montreal, we addressed this issue. As you can see, it is 
a lengthy process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2943"> 2943 </A></B>
<P>
	In those days, we talked a lot about decentralization and 
accountability. If we want to get to know each other better, we 
need to feel a sense of belonging to be able to take charge of our 
lives and meet our responsibilities.
<P>
	I for one have always believed that decentralization and 
accountability will help us pull through and take charge.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Liberal government tends to centralize 
everything and to manage from the top, which I think hinders 
progress, and I cannot agree with them on this. We absolutely 
need to ensure that the people at the grass root level, those who 
know their needs, who know what they have, who know their 
resources and their market, can take charge.
<P>
	How can we go about it? By giving this responsibility to 
smaller areas. And it is in this spirit that I have been working 
with the Partners for Employment committee on the South Shore 
for a long time now.
<P>
	Here is another suggestion. If we want to make people aware 
of their responsibilities, we will also have to ensure that 
municipalities have the resources they need to prosper and to 
help businesses to prosper.
<P>
	Again, who is closer to small and medium-sized businesses 
and thus better able to help them create jobs? People who know 
well the needs of these small and medium-sized businesses 
must be the ones to give them the support they need to prosper 
and create jobs.
<P>
	That does not seem to be important to the Reform Party. On 
the contrary, it appears to me that a sense of belonging to a 
region must absolutely be achieved if we want to create more 
jobs and work together to improve everybody's lot. It is in that 
spirit that we, in Quebec, have been working for a long time to 
delimit regions that are so homogeneous that people living in 
them can recognize and understand each other, grow and prosper 
together.
<P>
	Thus, Mr. Speaker, I will vote against this amendment by the 
Reform Party and I hope that it will be defeated-and I think it 
will, since the government is against it-so that we can all 
prosper, create jobs and do better.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in the House today to participate in this debate 
for several reasons. I will start by pointing out how 
recommendations were made regarding the readjustment of 
electoral boundaries. The act is rather obsolete as it goes back to 
1964. It is obvious that conditions have changed in 30 years. But 
what irritated me the most in all this is how the Ontario electoral 
commission proceeded to propose new boundaries.
<P>
	This commission proposed that each riding should have at 
least 80,000 residents without taking into account regional 
affinities or distances to be covered so that every member can 
serve his constituents properly. I could give you a few examples 
of regional affinities.
<P>
	First of all, my immediate region, that is the eastern part of 
the riding, was divided in two. A region that, since its 
foundation, has always shared the same economy, the same 
culture, the same social programs. It is more than a habit, it has 
become a tradition for this region to stay together. But it has 
been divided in two. The western part of the region was twinned 
with Algoma, which extends as far south as Lake Ontario. The 
name James Bay was added to Algoma, as the riding would now 
be shaped like a snake going around the region of Timmins to go 
east and then north to the western shore of James Bay. It makes 
absolutely no sense.
<P>
	The second part was twinned with the city of Timmins, which 
would become Timmins-Cochrane. After consulting with 
people and with business, municipal and other leaders, it 
became obvious that it would be totally inappropriate to twin a 
small, rural part of a riding with a large city for the simple 
reason that the constituents, the voters of the large city would 
prevail over those of the small, rural region because of their 
numbers. And God knows that numbers in this country speak 
loud and clear. So much for the eastern part of my riding.
<P>
	In the western part of my riding, the situation is somewhat 
similar. The western part of my riding was twinned with the 
existing riding of Thunder Bay-Nipigon. Again, municipal 
leaders and chamber of commerce directors told me they wanted 
to stay rural so that their identity would not be diluted, would 
not be lost within the big city of Thunder Bay that boasts some 
100,000 residents.
<P>
	What I am telling you, Mr. Speaker, is that the electoral 
commission's proposal was, in my opinion, outright 
provocation. A provocation that ignored regional affinities and 
distances to be covered in the vast region of northern Ontario. It 
is an immense region! There is a limit to taxing the energy of a 
member. I know what I am talking about because my riding is 
the fifth largest in Canada and, naturally, the largest in Ontario.
<P>
	This bill was born as a result of the representations made by 
all parties in this House.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	The proposed legislation will be used to correct the glaring 
errors and outdated provisions and will give birth, if you want, 
to a new act which will define the terms of reference of electoral 
commissions throughout Canada.
<P>
	I personally look forward to this new legislation, not really 
because my riding was going to disappear, but because two 
ridings in northern Ontario were supposed to disappear. Of 
course, once again, southern Ontario stands to inherit, or shall I 
say gain these ridings. With the four ridings already proposed by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2944"> 2944 </A></B>
<P>
the commission, that would have meant six more ridings for 
southern Ontario.
<P>
	Again, Mr. Speaker, I am telling you that we would have 
fought like crazy to at least keep the 12 ridings we currently 
have in northern Ontario, and I would like to make a digression, 
if I may. Native people are slowly but surely heading towards 
self-government. And 13,000 Native people live in my riding 
and 30,000 more live in the neighbouring riding of 
Kenora-Rainy River, represented here by my colleague, 
Robert Nault. I have always believed, and my colleague will 
agree, that it is about time we create a new riding which would 
be 98 per cent native and where the main goal would be to elect 
an Indian or a native member to represent these constituents in 
the House of Commons.
<P>
	If you link all of this to the fact that we were about to lose two 
ridings, you will understand that it was out of the question. If we 
were to think positive, we would in fact consider adding a 
thirteenth riding.
<P>
	One final word, Mr. Speaker. It is obvious that our party will 
vote overwhelmingly in favour of Bill C-18 and we hope, as I 
mentioned earlier, that the next bill which will define the terms 
of reference of the commissions will be a little more reasonable 
and sensible than the current legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad that the bill before the House gives me an 
opportunity to introduce my constituency to the House at last.
<P>
	Most people know where my constituency, that is 
Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, is located. It extends from the 
Mille-Îles River, in the south, up to but excluding Mirabel, in 
the north, and many of us have gone through it to reach Mirabel 
Airport or to spend a relaxing weekend in the Laurentians.
<P>
	People who travel through the riding would be well advised to 
stop once in a while to enjoy its special attractions.
<P>
	As for electoral redistribution, the problem in my 
constituency does not come from big distances as it does in the 
constituency of my colleague who spoke before me and who told 
us about its huge territory. On the contrary, mine is mainly a 
very densely populated urban constituency, and I can easily get 
around the riding by bike, as I often do. Small distances have 
their advantages.
<P>
	Our problem does not stem from big distances but from the 
rapid population increase, so much so that an electoral 
redistribution based on the current population would probably 
be outdated at the time of the next election.
<P>
	This rapid population growth in my constituency is due to 
several factors which I will now enumerate.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	First of all, there is residential development which is growing 
extremely fast. Many people from Montreal and Laval choose to 
come and live with us because of the advantages of this 
semi-rural and urban riding, where we are both close to leisure 
activities and occupations in Montreal and leisure activities in 
the Laurentians. Because of these advantages, the population is 
growing very rapidly. Cities such as Lorraine and Rosemère 
have mostly very high-standard houses. Other cities in the 
riding have a wide variety of dwellings that attract people. Thus, 
a city such as the one that I know best since I was its mayor for a 
long period of time needs a new primary school every year to 
deal with this population growth. So, we do not know what the 
distribution figures for the new population will be in three or 
four years. The fact is that a division that would be decided 
today would be outdated by that time.
<P>
	Apart from that very rapid residential development 
advantage, there is also the fact that our riding is the location of 
several industries, from a giant company such as GM, in 
Boisbriand, to many small and medium-sized businesses 
created by the strong dynamism of the people, and 
medium-sized industries such as Stablex, Novabus or 
Hyprescon.
<P>
	Nevertheless, we must not forget that part of the riding is 
covered by provincial Bill 90 which protects agricultural land 
and that agriculture in the riding is on a very high level, 
especially market gardening, since we are close to Montreal, 
which means that the riding's economy is expanding despite the 
recession and will continue to expand, which in turn makes it 
attractive to investors.
<P>
	In the riding, we have autoroute 13 and autoroute 15 running 
north-south and autoroute 640 running east-west. The riding is 
very conveniently located in terms of its distance from Dorval 
Airport and Mirabel Airport. It is also 20 kilometres from the 
Port of Montreal, which means it has an ideal infrastructure. It 
has a number of very modern, well-situated industrial parks set 
up very recently, especially Boisbriand and Blainville which are 
along one of the major highways, and we are very proud of our 
labour force whose skills are very attractive to investors.
<P>
	We have a number of educational institutions of very high 
calibre, including the Institut d'ordinique which is 
well-positioned to help develop high-tech industries, and also 
Lionel Groulx CEGEP and other institutions, so that we are able 
to provide a quality labour force.
<P>
	Another aspect which may be interesting for people who go to 
the Laurentians for recreational purposes is that we have a 
number of recreational resources but are much closer to 
Montreal. Of course, we still have a lot of green space. There is 
still a lot of countryside in the riding. For instance, we have the 
``Domaine vert'', a protected area where no construction is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2945"> 2945 </A></B>
<P>
allowed, a huge expanse that has equestrian trails, bicycle paths, 
hiking trails, and so forth.
<P>
	We also have a large number of golf courses. Then, there is the 
Blainville Equestrian Park where every year two international 
events are held, as well as a very impressive fireworks display.
<P>
	We also have an historic event which has become a tourist 
attraction. There is a church in Saint-Eustache that still bears 
the marks of shots fired at Quebec's patriots by the British. 
Fortunately, those shots hit the stones of the church and we have 
carefully preserved those stones to remember this extremely 
important event.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	This being said, I will now conclude by saying that, since our 
riding offers some advantages that stimulate its demographic 
growth and since the makeup of its population changes 
constantly, any decision made today regarding the distribution 
of electoral districts would likely become obsolete tomorrow. In 
a nutshell, this  distribution would divide our riding into two 
ridings that would include three cities that are not part of the 
existing riding. On one side, we would have Sainte-Thérèse, 
Boisbriand, Saint-Eustache, Deux-Montagnes and 
Sainte-Marthe, for a total of 130,000 people, and on the other 
side we would have Blainville, Rosemère and Lorraine, which 
already belong to our riding, plus Bois-des-Filion, 
Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines and Terrebonne, which would be 
added to our riding to the detriment of neighbouring ridings.
<P>
	In closing, Mr. Speaker, I support this bill to postpone the 
decision regarding the distribution of electoral districts.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, an electoral 
map is much more than a matter of paper and lines. An electoral 
map is not a sheet of paper where we find what we call ridings at 
the federal level, or, more colloquially in Quebec, counties. An 
electoral map is above all people that have some common 
cultural traits, economic resources and infrastructure links.
<P>
	When technocrats, in an office tower, pore over the map and 
try to redistribute the population in fairly equal numbers among 
the electoral districts, lines start to move. We are sometimes left 
with the impression that the movement of these lines is based 
exclusively on a mathematical formula aimed at roughly 
balancing out the 295 electoral districts in Canada.
<P>
	If this were really the way of doing it, a computer could no 
doubt do it better and faster. Let us take, for example, the 
existing electoral map for my riding of Portneuf. There we find, 
in the eastern most part of the riding of Portneuf, a small portion 
of Quebec City. Yes, Mr. Speaker, in the riding of Portneuf there 
are about 600 constituents who live in Quebec City. They live on 
the other side of CFB Valcartier, which puts about two 
kilometres between them and the rest of the riding. They are to 
be found on both sides of Valcartier Boulevard, along a stretch 
of about a kilometre and a half.
<P>
	No matter how hard I try, Mr. Speaker, you will understand 
that I have great difficulty, as a member of Parliament, 
identifying with these constituents, since their problems are not 
really related to those experienced by the rest of the riding of 
Portneuf. So, no matter how hard I try, I must face the fact that 
those people would be better served if they belonged to the 
neighbouring riding, strictly on the basis of geography, of 
belonging to one municipality rather than to another, of 
commuting to one's work place, etc.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Because of the proposal before us regarding the electoral 
map, in the next election, if any, these people will now be part of 
the neighbouring riding further east. But that is not the only 
sacrilege, if I may use that term, that we can see in the electoral 
map of the riding of Portneuf. At the other end, on the west side, 
I have two municipalities that belong to the RCM of Mékinac. 
These  are people who deal particularly with municipalities in 
the neighbouring riding of Champlain.
<P>
	Here again, we see the problems with relations and services. 
For instance, if these people have to deal with the Canada 
Employment Centre, they will not go to the office in Portneuf, 
but to the one from the neighbouring riding. And, of course, it is 
still possible to communicate with that employment centre, but 
that increases the paperwork. In fact, yours truly has to interact 
with four employment centres. That is a lot a employment 
centres, a lot of people to get to know, a lot of contacts to make 
and to maintain. Ultimately, that creates a waste of time, a waste 
of effectiveness, and citizens are not being served as well as they 
could be otherwise.
<P>
	In fact, just recently, at the beginning of the break preceding 
Easter, I had the opportunity, with my colleague from the riding 
of Champlain, to meet the council of the municipality of 
Lac-aux-Sables. One night, two members of Parliament and a 
municipal council met at Lac-aux-Sables to consider the 
possibility of letting my colleague assume my responsibilities at 
the employment centre and in other organizations in his riding 
since, for reasons of distance, it would be easier for him than it 
would be for me to assume those responsibilities for residents of 
Lac-aux-Sables. My intention was not to give up on those 
responsibilities but simply to rely on a colleague that I fully 
trusted and who would be in a better position than I to carry out 
those responsibilities from day to day.
<P>
	We discussed the issue. I must stress that the meeting was held 
at the request of the municipal council. After a long and useful 
discussion, we came to the conclusion that it would actually be 
much simpler for the constituents of my riding to be served by 
the member of the neighbouring county because their belonging, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2946"> 2946 </A></B>
<P>
their spirit, their culture, their ways, their communications were 
closer to the neighbouring riding.
<P>
	However, the new proposal regarding the electoral map that 
we are discussing does not mention anything about that 
municipality and perhaps the neighbouring municipality 
becoming part of the neighbouring riding. I want to say, and I 
might conclude on that, that when a review of the electoral map 
takes place, it might not be a bad idea for those who are working 
in office buildings to come and visit the various ridings, to go 
into the field and see where the real borders are between people.
<P>
	Again, an electoral map is not a piece of paper with straight 
borders running across. A riding is made up of people. Those 
people have needs and I am sure that it would be very easy to 
communicate with the member from each riding and the 
members from neighbouring ridings to see how people could be 
better served.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	The decision on where to draw the line has nothing to do with 
the number of constituents. The basis representation is not only 
a matter of numbers, but also, and more importantly, of culture 
and cohesion among  people. I think I have spent the 10 minutes 
I had. I would like to thank the House for listening and I hope 
that it will listen as carefully to the following speakers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
anxious to rise and speak on Bill C-18, a bill that proposes a 
review of electoral boundaries. I must say that the current 
proposals for readjustment are very favourable to my riding of 
Québec-Est, since it would add to it the beautiful town of 
Loretteville. Québec-Est is a rather large riding with about 
80,000 voters, which also includes the two small municipalities 
of Vanier and Ancienne-Lorette. They are within the territory of 
Quebec City, the capital of the future country of Quebec. It is 
entirely logical to add Loretteville to the riding of Québec-Est.
<P>
	One of my problems is with the name Québec-Est, because 
the riding is not on the east side of Quebec City, but rather to the 
northwest. The name has been kept for the sake of tradition, 
because the riding has a long history. Several Prime Ministers 
were born in that riding and at least one has represented it. This 
is a riding I love, a riding I am proud to represent.
<P>
	I have no objection to taking Loretteville, that would be an 
asset for the riding. Québec-Est does not have the ski runs of the 
Laurentians, we do not have the Rockies, we do not have any 
geographical feature which would set us apart, but we have a 
quality of people second to none in Quebec or Canada. It is 
important to talk of the quality of the people, because a riding 
links groups together, and in this case it links three 
municipalities which work well together, and have a special 
drive because of the quality of the people.
<P>
	In the town of Ancienne-Lorette-a town I like, and where I 
live-there is a group called <I>Solidarité Emplois</I>. It was set up by 
two retired persons, Mr. Dubé and Mr. Déry who said: ``We are 
fed up with unemployment. We are not going to wait for the 
Liberal Party to do something, because when the time comes to 
create employment you don't wait for the government. We are 
going to act now''.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	These people have put in place a program called 
``Solidarité-Emploi''. They have brought together a number of 
volunteers and have made representations to find unemployed 
people in the city of L'Ancienne-Lorette. With the assistance of 
volunteers, they have found some employers and served as 
contacts between the employers and the unemployed. This is 
what a number of people in L'Ancienne-Lorette, in my riding of 
Québec-Est, have achieved.
<P>
	This is an example of the quality of the people who live in 
Québec-Est. Surely we could add the city of Loretteville 
because I have no objection to this revision of the electoral map.
<P>
	The other example comes from the town of Vanier. The town 
of Vanier is completely surrounded by Quebec City. This is a 
small municipality which is pretty dynamic.  Vanier also has its 
own problems of unemployment, among others. Perhaps it is 
one of the municipalities which has to struggle the most against 
unemployment and yet, it surprisingly shows lots of dynamism.
<P>
	There is a particular organization called ``l'ADEC-V''. We 
still have volunteers, some good citizens of Vanier, who 
campaign every year to raise funds to help people on welfare and 
give Christmas gifts and food baskets to the needy.
<P>
	In this group called l'ADEC-V run by a certain Mr. Lemoyne, 
there are 65 volunteers who carry on a whole series of activities 
all year round.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize for interrupting a 
Franco-Ontarian colleague in such a flight of oratory. However, 
I invoke the rule of relevance, citation 459 in Beauchesne, which 
says that members persistent repetition or raise issues which 
clearly have nothing to do with the bill being considered.
<P>
	It is very interesting to hear him talk about volunteers from 
his riding, but we must admit that it is just a little too much. This 
is stretching things out.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am sure that other 
members were wondering if this was relevant. I am also sure that 
the member from Québec-Est is soon going to show the 
connection and come back to the issue under consideration.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. You are quite right 
and I applaud your great wisdom! I was coming to that. I was 
going to make the connection between these eminent individuals 
who live in the riding of Québec-Est and stress with great 
emphasis how important it is not to change the electoral map 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2947"> 2947 </A></B>
<P>
without thinking about it for a while. As we well know, it could 
have disastrous effects.
<P>
	In the past, it had disastrous effects and because of changes in 
the electoral map, people had to get used to a new riding. As we 
know, it takes years to build a riding such as Québec-Est.
<P>
	I do not disagree with the planned electoral boundaries 
readjustment since in my case, Loretteville would be added to 
my riding, and I welcome this change.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	It is obvious that reviewing electoral boundaries takes much 
longer than 12 months; it takes at least two years. And it requires 
a lot of serious thinking. We know that the only reason why the 
Reform Party is putting forward this motion to conduct this 
review in 12 months is because it wants to take advantage of 
these changes as soon as possible. Twelve months. In the next 
election, they could even-As we know, they hope to win more 
seats.
<P>
	At any rate, I submit that it takes a minimum of two years to 
review any changes in the electoral boundaries and that it would 
give the Reform Party a bit more time to refine its parliamentary 
strategies so that in two years, when those changes are made, it 
might actually win more  seats. As it stands today, should an 
election be called, it could lose some of its most important 
members.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that this bill is very important and 
that we need at least 24 months to make sure that the 
readjustment process is fair and equitable. I thank you for your 
attention.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, electoral boundaries readjustment, be it in Canada or in 
Quebec, even though always the result of logical decisions that 
could be based on questions of demographic or geographic 
balance, is nonetheless never sheltered from what can be called 
the ``political touch''. Indeed, only the magic touch would 
explain some of these readjustments, but I am not one to get 
shocked at such things.
<P>
	As you know, Mr. Speaker, I have represented Laval-Centre 
here since October 25, 1993. Laval, the second biggest city in 
Quebec, now encompasses three federal ridings, named very 
logically. In the east, there is Laval-East; in the centre, 
Laval-Centre, and in the west-yes, you guessed it, Mr. 
Speaker-Laval-West. This electoral boundaries distribution 
within Laval redressed a previous rather absurd situation in 
which the Laval-des-Rapides constituency was partly in Laval 
and partly in Montreal. This great riding was separated-what 
an ugly word-by the Back River, or Rivière-des Prairies, that 
no one could swim across. The river was not an example of 
pollution clean-up in those days nor is it today.
<P>
	To see our member of Parliament, we had two options: cross 
the bridge or watch TV. Mind you, the then member for 
Laval-des-Rapides, who also sat in your chair all those years, 
did a remarkable job. Like you, Mr. Speaker, she was a TV star. 
However, when I look at the distribution within Laval proposed 
by the reform which Bill C-18 would suspend, I am surprised 
that some strange particularities are maintained. I will come 
back to that at the end of my speech.
<P>
	This debate is not about the need to review the distribution of 
electoral boundaries but about the need to rush into some minor 
and some major adjustments.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	According to Mr. Bernard, distinguished professor of 
political science at the Université du Québec in Montreal, it is 
impossible to create several identical ridings; some will have 
more affluent constituents, some will be more rural. An 
unbalanced distribution of constituents among the ridings will 
be advantageous for some parties at the expense of others.
<P>
	Laval is a region with a total area of little more than 250 
square kilometres, but 315,000 people live on that small 
territory. A third of the labour force works off the island.
<P>
	Are the three ridings in Laval similar? No, Mr. Speaker. Of the 
three, Laval Centre is undoubtedly the most urbanized, but the 
poorest.
<P>
	The majority of households in Laval Centre rent their 
housing; over there, they celebrate Canada Day by moving. Just 
think, between 1988 and 1991, 50 per cent of the population in 
Laval Centre changed address. I am sure that in the 
neighbouring riding of Laval West, represented by the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage, they must celebrate Canada Day 
differently.
<P>
	Social and economic conditions in Laval Centre are the worst 
in the region. The education level is slightly lower and, with the 
large number of single individuals and one-parent families, 20 
per cent of the population of Laval Centre lived below the 
poverty line in 1990.
<P>
	To believe one can form equal ridings in Laval is wishful 
thinking.
<P>
	I have no problem in saying, as Professor Bernard did, that the 
desire to reduce inequalities among ridings while preserving the 
benefits their party could derive from it has created and is still 
creating important problems for lawmakers.
<P>
	For political reasons the riding of Laval-des-Rapides has 
straddled a river for a long time. The same political 
considerations probably explain why the border between Laval 
East and Laval Centre, a border everybody knows in Laval, is 
the Boulevard des Laurentides, but this border stops abruptly, 
right between two Hydro-Québec power lines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2948"> 2948 </A></B>
<P>
	Would you believe that this enclave is located west of the 
Boulevard des Laurentides. It is part of Laval East. Does this 
make sense? I bet you could not find one voter in that area who 
could make sense of it.
<P>
	Democracy requires that citizens fully participate in the 
making of decisions which affect their community. Whether it is 
through their representatives in Parliament, such as all of us, or 
through public consultations, Canadians and Quebeckers have 
the right to be heard and I have no doubt that this Parliament will 
be listening to them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, Federal Deficit; 
the hon. member for Brome-Missisquoi, Old Age Security; the 
hon. member for Richelieu, Rights of Francophones; the hon. 
member for Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, Unemployment; 
the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, Human Rights.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today's debate on electoral boundaries readjustments brings out 
two basic elements of the  mini-reform the governments wants 
us to swallow. There are two things that really bother me in all of 
this. Although I really wonder about the very relevance of 
today's debate, I must say that I am more than puzzled by the 
provisions and directions stipulated in Bill C-18. I have a 
feeling that not only is the Liberal government not doing much, 
but it has the bad habit of going backwards.
<P>
	First, let us talk about the relevance for us, members of 
Parliament, to go over the readjustment of Canadian electoral 
boundaries. I really wonder if this issue is very high on the list of 
priorities of most Canadians. The government brags about 
listening to the people. The Liberals hold public briefings and 
national consultations in order to establish their priorities and 
we end up today, in this House, discussing the number of ridings 
we should have in Canada. What a crucial debate that is for the 
political, economic and social future of our country.
<P>
	Has the minister taken part in these public consultations? If 
not, there must be some way to provide him with a report on 
these hearings. If so, then it is very disturbing. Either the 
consultations took place on another planet or the minister does 
not give a damn about what Canadians think. If the minister 
asked the people of Brome-Missisquoi what the federal 
government's priorities should be, I do not think that many 
would say the readjustment of electoral boundaries. I want to 
tell the minister that the people want the government to take 
action, and what the real priorities they would like to see on the 
agenda of the House are.
<P>
	I will conclude by appealing to the reason of a government 
which seems to have no more compassion. The issues that 
should be discussed in this House are job creation, control of 
expenditures and preservation of social programs. The slow 
economic recovery, the astronomical unemployment rate and 
the disastrous state of public finances should convince the 
government of the need to act quickly. And if, despite 
everything, the government sticks to its idea of electoral 
boundaries readjustment, let us at least hope that it will do it 
intelligently and reduce, not increase, the number of members of 
Parliament. Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi):</B> Mr. Speaker, like many of 
my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois, I also consulted the people 
I represent in the riding of Chicoutimi on the proposal made by 
the electoral boundaries commission for Quebec. So that you 
know exactly what I am talking about, Mr. Speaker, and I will be 
brief because I know that time is nearly up, the riding of 
Chicoutimi is made up of seven municipalities.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	They are, of course, the cities of Chicoutimi and La Baie, and 
the five rural municipalities of Ferland-Boileau, 
Saint-Félix-d'Otis, Rivière-Éternité, Anse-Saint-Jean and 
Petit-Saguenay.
<P>
	Under the commission's proposal, these five rural 
municipalities that make up the area called Lower Saguenay 
would be taken away from the riding of Chicoutimi and added to 
the riding of Jonquière.
<P>
	Each one of these municipalities refuses categorically to 
become part of another riding. There are many reasons for that. 
The riding of Chicoutimi has two major economic centres, 
namely the cities of Chicoutimi and La Baie. The municipalities 
of Lower Saguenay have always been economically associated 
with the city of La Baie. Several services located in La Baie are 
provided to residents of Lower Saguenay. I will list only a few 
examples: the Canada Employment Centre, the Small Business 
Development Centre, La Baie Hospital.
<P>
	Moreover, the Lower Saguenay municipalities had set up 
services in which they had invested time and money, like the 
Chamber of Commerce, the Société touristique du Fjord and the 
Société de développement de La Baie. Excluding these 
municipalities from these organizations because they do not 
belong any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2949"> 2949 </A></B>
<P>
more to the riding of Chicoutimi would jeopardize their entire 
economic and tourist development.
<P>
	People in the riding of Chicoutimi have been working for 
years to reduce the very high unemployment we have in our area. 
So, for them, electoral boundaries readjustment is not a 
problem. They want those millions of dollars to be used to find 
ways of reducing unemployment.
<P>
	These five municipalities have been working together for a 
long time on these matters which are essential to their 
development. unemployment now stands at 16 per cent, and that 
is what the people of Chicoutimi want us to talk about. They 
want solutions. That is the reality, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	For decades, they trusted the Liberals and the Conservatives. 
Today, they have had enough. They want to work. They are tired. 
They are fed up with being overtaxed. So, it is time to stop the 
futile debates in this House and to tackle these problems first of 
all.
<P>
	My constituents in the riding of Chicoutimi are fed up with 
seeing their purchasing power diminish, which causes more 
unemployment. They have enough of all the obstacles those two 
political parties and the former governments invented in the last 
30 years to put a damper on job creation in small and 
medium-sized businesses.
<P>
	In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region, those governments 
have caused an exodus of young people by stripping them of all 
hope of survival in their region, because we do not get our fair 
share of R and D. Both governments have neglected regions like 
mine. Those are the problems, Mr. Speaker, which my 
constituents and taxpayers in Chicoutimi want us to talk about.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I declare Motion No. 1 lost.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gagliano:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think you will find unanimous 
consent to apply the vote we just took to the remaining motions 
in amendment plus the report stage.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé: </B>I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I was not 
here for the first vote, but I would like to participate in the 
second one if I may.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Hon. members have heard the proposal. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, just to make it clear, we are 
supporting the second vote on the motions; only the vote on the 
report stage would be reversed. I think we better make that clear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is absolutely clear.

	<B>Mr. Rey D. Pagtakhan (Winnipeg North)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should seek to ensure that 
all manufacturers of foods and beverages be required to print ``best before'' and 
expiration dates clearly and legibly on the outside of the product packaging in a 
non-encoded format.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage each member 
to support Motion No. 217.
<P>
	Simply put, this motion is about the integrity of Canadian 
food in terms of freshness information, quality and health 
safety, as well as the interests of food manufacturers.
<P>
	Where safety is the primary concern, an expiration date is 
critical. Products which pass their expiration date must be 
removed from the shelves. This applies primarily to vitamin 
products and single source foods which supply basic nutrition 
such as infant formula. The problem in the latter case may be 
one of loss of vital nutritional quality which could seriously 
affect the health of infants.
<P>
	I would like to focus, however, the remainder of my debate on 
the issue of best-before dates. But whether we speak of 
best-before or expiration dates, it is in the best interests of all 
that they meet the standards of quality and legibility. It is also 
important that these dates not appear in a coded format. They 
must be easy for consumers to interpret.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2954"> 2954 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	The motion represents in this sense a win-win situation for all 
parties concerned. It is an opportunity for the House to assume a 
leadership role on behalf of both the welfare of Canadian 
consumers and the competitive interests of Canadian industry.
<P>
	At stake here is nothing less than the consumer confidence of 
a solid majority of Canadians. They would like to be assured that 
the foods and beverages they consume are safe, nutritious and 
wholesome. They would like to be assured that subtle and 
unseen defects in food quality are made known to them before 
more obvious,  visible changes occur. They would like to be 
reassured that securing the integrity of Canadian food is given 
top priority by government.
<P>
	The printing of best-before and expiry dates clearly and 
legibly on all products in a format easily understood by all is 
something Canadians should be able to claim as a right.
<P>
	Currently food and beverage manufacturers are required to 
place best-before dates only on products with a shelf life or 
so-called durable life of 90 days or less, that is on most 
perishable goods. Yet as far back as 1987 consumers had 
expressed their wish to see date marking extended to canned and 
frozen foods which currently are often exempt from such 
requirements.
<P>
	This consumer interest has not abated. A survey conducted in 
1993 by the Grocery Products Manufacturers' Association of 
Canada showed that 97 per cent of consumers looked at 
best-before dates when buying a food product for the first time. 
Recent statistics therefore make the case for the motion before 
us more compelling and timely.
<P>
	Many consumers groups including the Consumers' 
Association of Canada actively support the extension of date 
marking to all foods. The association has even gone one step 
further, supporting the view that prepackaged foods with a shelf 
life of less than 90 days should also bear a packaging date 
indicating when the product was first placed in its container and 
offered for sale.
<P>
	Given the clear desire expressed by the consumers group for 
better, more comprehensive freshness information, and given 
that business thrives best when consumers wishes are met, one 
would expect the food industry's response to be one of voluntary 
compliance. This regrettably has not happened yet.
<P>
	The Canadian industry's stance has to be revisited, 
particularly in light of the globalization of markets. It is known 
that European industries offer precisely what consumers want 
and expect where date marking is concerned.
<P>
	The government, in the nation's interest should ask how 
would Canadian food products without the desired changes in 
date markings as alluded to earlier eventually compete with 
imported products? Industry representatives have cited cost, 
wastage of products and the need for consumer education as 
reasons for their opposition to a new date marking system.
<P>
	These are valid arguments, but I would ask these business 
people to consider the possibility that if consumers are able to 
access imported foods bearing more detailed dating information 
they may simply purchase these imported items rather than 
those made in Canada.
<P>
	In other words, these food industry representatives may 
ultimately do themselves a disservice by allowing cost 
associated with implementing a new dating system to prevent 
them from honouring consumers' wishes. A new  date marking 
system would best ensure competitiveness that in the end would 
allow for recovery of attendant costs.
<P>
	I am encouraged that industry officials who participated in a 
recent Food and Drugs Act regulatory review stated their 
commitment to respond to consumers' preferences. This is a 
positive sign. At the same time I am discouraged that 
manufacturers are not yet providing on a voluntary basis the 
information consumers want.
<P>
<B>(1810 ) </B>
<P>
	Since current Food and Drugs Act regulations are not meeting 
consumer demands this House should indicate its support for 
regulatory change. That quite simply is the purpose of this 
motion.
<P>
	I would like to call to the attention of the House the three 
recent documents relevant to this motion that have been 
produced. This is a three volume document titled A Strategic 
Direction for Change-A Review of the Regulations under the 
Food and Drugs Act. I have here two of the volumes. These were 
recently completed by the health protection branch of Health 
and Welfare Canada in consultation with the former Department 
of Consumer and Corporate Affairs whose food labelling 
function has since been transferred to the Department of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
<P>
	The first two volumes of this thorough one-year review of the 
regulations under the Food and Drugs Act were released last 
November and December respectively. The proposed 
implementation plan, volume three, was released just last 
month. I am encouraged that the proposed implementation plan 
addresses some of the desired ends of the motion. However, I 
believe more can be done and soon.
<P>
	The implementation plan is disappointing on several counts. 
It states that the government will only ``support the use of 
best-before dating on other products with a durable life of more 
than 90 days on a voluntary basis''.
<P>
	The revocation of durable life date exemptions for 
commissary foods and prepackaged doughnuts are the only 
concrete 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2955"> 2955 </A></B>
<P>
steps taken to extend the best-before requirements. This is not 
enough. These requirements must be extended to all products.
<P>
	In fact other parts of the plan state that in the course of 
drafting new regulations, the health protection branch will 
merely review current practices and consider requiring, dates on 
low acid or previously frozen foods. The words supporting, 
reviewing and considering, though well-intentioned, do not 
spell action to the consumer. Consumers want action, and now. 
To wait until October 1995 for prepublication of the new Food 
and Drugs Act regulations, as the proposed implementation plan 
calls for, will not give timely justice to the issue.
<P>
	Admittedly there are some who would argue that they would 
not like to see yet another regulatory burden placed on Canadian 
businesses. This motion makes the case that this so-called 
regulatory burden would in fact be  a regulatory blessing not 
only to consumers but to businesses as well. We have a 
responsibility as a nation to champion the causes of both private 
and corporate citizens.
<P>
	Fellow members, recognize that limiting manufacturers' 
obligations to print best-before expiry dates shifts the burden of 
making informed purchases to the consumers. Recognize that 
Canada has an obligation to ensure its consumers are able to 
access superior products, preferably those manufactured in 
Canada, in their markets. Recognize as well that we, elected 
representatives, have an obligation to institute regulations 
which protect private and corporate interests. Recognize further 
that we have a duty to regulate in the national interest.
<P>
	Permit me therefore to cite a specific example of an instance 
in which a better date marking system could benefit Canadian 
consumers. A man goes to a grocery store and purchases a jar of 
tomato sauce. The jar does not display a best-before date as it 
has a shelf life longer than 90 days if unopened.
<P>
	One night the man opens the jar, pours out half of its contents 
and returns the remainder to his refrigerator. Several days later 
he re-opens the jar and notices that its contents have a foul 
odour. He examines the jar thoroughly to see whether its label 
contains any shelf life information. He finds none. What he does 
find is a cryptic string of numbers and letters on a remote corner 
of the label. The code reads: STD 10 305 N3 E500.
<P>
	He calls a phone number on the label to determine what it 
means and is told by the operator that the code indicates the jar 
was processed on the 305th day of 1993. Who would know that, 
Mr. Speaker? I did not. Its contents if unopen are good from one 
to one and a half years. However, once opened the sauce has a 
durable life of just five to seven days but only if the product is 
kept refrigerated.
<P>
<B>(1815) </B>
<P>
	The man is angry that he has wasted half a jar of the product. 
He is angry that he had no way of knowing how long it would 
retain its freshness without making a phone call. He wonders if 
other products in his cabinet may be subject to similar spoilage. 
In essence, he wants to know why manufacturers do not provide 
more detailed date information about their products in a format 
consumers can both recognize easily and understand fully. This 
example is a true to life story as brought to my attention by one 
of my constituents in Winnipeg North.
<P>
	It is important to note that there are many other products such 
as carbonated soft drinks whose durable life is deemed to be 
longer than 90 days but is shorter than many consumers suspect, 
just a few months in many cases. As if to acknowledge that fact, 
Pepsi corporation recently instituted a voluntary date marking 
system for its diet canned and bottled soft drinks in the United 
States.
<P>
	In the absence of such markings, what is to prevent consumers 
from stocking up on these products only to find they have 
spoiled in just a few weeks? It is common practice after all for 
supermarkets to sell particular items at a discount when their 
stock on those items begins to gather dust.
<P>
	Again, this underscores the need to extend the practice of best 
before dating to all foods and beverages regardless of their shelf 
lives. What I and many consumers would like to see is a 
standardized label. Consumer groups informed the health 
protection branch that labels should be consumer friendly, that 
is clear, understandable and difficult to overlook.
<P>
	At this time manufacturers of foods with durable lives of less 
than 90 days are only required to express best before dates as a 
stream of letters and numbers. The code begins with the last two 
digits of the year followed by the month expressed as an 
abbreviation and then the date. The words ``best before'' must 
precede the information given.
<P>
	Presently a container of milk with a best before date of April 
12, 1994 would bear the legend ``best before 94Al12''. The fact 
is this code may not be comprehensible to other Canadians. 
What does Al mean? Does 12 mean the twelfth day of the month 
or the twelfth day of the year? A standard letter, one of a 
particular colour, shape and size which consumers could 
immediately locate on all foods and read rather than decipher 
would provide an anchor for the eyes.
<P>
	In my own experience I have found containers of milk or juice 
whose best before dates are smeared, printed in faint or small 
type or hidden away on a remote part of the product packaging.
<P>
	It is laudable when government departments undertake an 
extensive process of consultation with an eye toward improving 
the regulatory framework of a particular piece of legislation, but 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2956"> 2956 </A></B>
<P>
the proposed implementation plan for regulatory reform under 
the Food and Drugs Act in my opinion could go even further 
with date marking requirements.
<P>
	Knowledge, it is often said, is power. We should move to 
make certain that food manufacturers give consumers the power 
to make good choices, informed decisions about the foods they 
buy, bring home and serve to their families.
<P>
	I urge all members of this House to register their support for 
motion M-217. Let us demonstrate to the food industry and in 
effect to all Canadian industries that we in government expect 
our businesses to remain accountable to the public at large, 
particularly when discharge of accountability means a return on 
investments many times over.
<P>
	At stake here is consumer confidence in the integrity of 
Canadian food products and the competitiveness of Canadian 
food producers. We need to make it clear that meeting consumer 
demands is good business for Canadian business.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of 
all, I wish to commend my colleague from Winnipeg North for 
this motion which, in my opinion, will greatly benefit 
consumers in Quebec and Canada without forcing 
manufacturers to spend outrageous amounts to apply the new 
practices.
<P>
	The introduction of this kind of motion is a clear indication of 
the member's interest, which I share, in the health of consumers 
and of the regard he has for them.
<P>
	One must recognize that it is often difficult in this day and age 
to see and to interpret the labelling on products for sale. So, the 
House must absolutely ensure that manufacturers of food and 
beverages be required to print ``best before'' and expiration 
dates clearly and legibly in a non-encoded format. The Bloc 
Quebecois will support the motion. We will do so, Mr. Speaker, 
for various reasons which I will outline.
<P>
	All of us in the House are consumers who, when shopping, do 
not always look for the expiration date, so we can sometimes 
buy products which are past their prime. This motion will ensure 
that the expiration date is clearly marked, so consumers will 
avoid mistakes. Thanks to the improved labelling of food 
products, from now on consumers will be able to buy only fresh 
products. Clearly printing a product's expiration date will show 
consumers that the manufacturer respects his customers and 
cares about their welfare.
<P>
	Such a measure would be in line with the management 
philosophy related to the implementation of ``total quality'' in 
our businesses, a philosophy focused on identifying and 
adequately meeting customers' needs.
<P>
	Another aspect of the proposed measure is the health of 
Canadians and Quebeckers. Using products after their 
expiration dates may be hazardous to one's health and it is our 
duty to protect the health and welfare of our people. Our 
children must be able to rely on healthy products that will allow 
them to develop normally.
<P>
	A society as advanced as ours must have the means to 
recognize the freshness of its food products: it is a sign of an 
advanced society.
<P>
	But this debate seems paradoxical to me in some respects, 
given the unacceptable situation faced by hundreds of thousands 
of Canadians and Quebeckers who live at or below the poverty 
line, as one would expect in an underdeveloped society. Mr. 
Speaker, consumers need money to buy-that is of paramount 
importance.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you will recall that the Liberal Party of Canada 
made a list of election promises in the famous red book. Indeed, 
the Liberal government promised Canadians in the election last 
October to create jobs, real jobs. Where are these real jobs? In 
the infrastructure program that creates only temporary jobs? 
What has the government really done? It wants to close the 
military college in St-Jean, which will cost at least 1,000 jobs. 
In  manpower training, the government refuses to transfer any 
jurisdiction, funds or staff to the provinces. In income security 
reform, it will cut $7.5 billion over the next two years from the 
income of the poorest people in our society and thus cause 
poverty to increase, while tax shelters that benefit the wealthy 
are maintained.
<P>
	The government must keep its promises to the people. It must 
now take concrete action instead of making pious wishes! Such 
action would involve not only the clear legible labeling of the 
freshness of products by manufacturers but also job creation, 
industrial restructuring, the conversion of military to civilian 
industry, help for small and medium-sized businesses and the 
creation of real jobs that will give Quebeckers and Canadians 
the money they need to buy fresh, clearly labeled products.
<P>
	We talk about products available on the market, but if people 
have no money, how can they buy them? The mother who goes 
shopping for her family every week knows that well. How many 
mothers must choose what food to buy because they lack 
money? Parents no longer choose between shoes for the children 
and a summer vacation, but which child will have a new pair of 
shoes this year.
<P>
	In the same vein, what can we say about the dozens of food 
banks all over Canada that are needed more and more so that 
thousands of Canadians and Quebeckers can eat regularly? Even 
worse, the almost permanent nature of these food banks is 
striking proof of the deep malaise affecting the Canadian 
economy.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2957"> 2957 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1825) </B>
<P>
	As recently as yesterday, I met the managers of 
Moisson-Mauricie, a food bank located in my riding of 
Trois-Rivières. I would like to take this opportunity to 
congratulate them and congratulate all of the volunteers who 
work there and thank them, on behalf of the people, for the 
remarkable job they are doing.
<P>
	Moisson-Mauricie provides food products to about ten 
organizations which then redistribute the food to the needy. I 
was told yesterday that sometimes the food bank did not have 
any food to hand out. To me, it is sheer nonsense, it is an 
alarming and unacceptable situation which shows how serious 
this issue is.
<P>
	Given these concerns, on behalf of the Official Opposition, I 
reiterate our support of Motion No. 217.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Beth Phinney (Hamilton Mountain):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to support the motion presented to the House by the member of 
Parliament for Winnipeg North.
<P>
	My hon. seat mate has asked us to support Motion M-217. It is 
worth conserving the words of this very thoughtful motion: 
``The government should seek to ensure that manufacturers of 
food and beverages be required to print best before and 
expiration dates clearly and legibly on the outside of product 
packaging in a non-encoded format''.
<P>
	What my hon. friend is saying here is that when we go 
shopping for food products we should easily be able to 
understand what we are buying and how long that product will 
be good.
<P>
	What he is saying is that easy to understand packaging labels 
should be a right. Canadians are proud that we produce the 
highest quality food products in the world. We should have 
labelling standards of an equally high standard.
<P>
	Today food and beverage manufacturers are only required to 
place best before dates on products with a shelf life of up to90 days. In fact, no shelf life standards exist and it is the 
manufacturer's decision to determine the appropriate shelf life 
period for its products and label them accordingly. That is just 
not good enough.
<P>
	It shifts an unreasonable burden on to consumers to make the 
purchasing decisions with no fair basis for making these 
decisions.
<P>
	It puts manufacturers with rigorous standards at a 
disadvantage. It does not meet the highest possible standards 
that Canadians expect of our food products.
<P>
	It is really quite extraordinary that we require all kinds of 
nutritional information to be printed on food packages but we 
fail to say when the food was produced and how long it retains 
its quality.
<P>
	According to the Grocer Products Manufacturers of Canada's 
own survey 97 per cent of Canadians are interested in knowing 
the shelf life of products. The current lack of standards is not 
meeting consumer demands and quite frankly I think most 
Canadians would be astounded to learn how lax our formal 
standards really are.
<P>
	The Consumer Association of Canada supports the extension 
of date marking to all food.
<P>
	What we need, as my hon. colleague pointed out, is basic 
information presented in a straightforward manner. We need 
easy to read, easy to locate labels on all foods to give consumers 
the facts they need to make informed decisions.
<P>
	There are complicated encoded messages on products so that 
manufacturers can determine their sales figures and inventory 
information. Why should information not be provided to 
consumers so they can know vital information about the same 
food products? If it is good enough for manufacturers to know 
the information why is it not good enough for consumers?
<P>
	As we move to produce environmentally friendly products 
surely we can move to produce consumer friendly labelling on 
the most essential of all our products, our food.
<P>
	Knowledge is power and consumers do not have all the 
knowledge they need. We all know that more and more people 
are stocking up on many foodstuffs through bulk purchases. 
Indeed all major supermarkets are encouraging consumers to do 
so through advertising and marketing strategies. Consumers 
have a right to know  how long those products are good for 
before they stock up these bulk purchases.
<P>
<B>(1830) </B>
<P>
	Another major trend in modern society is the move to foods 
purchased without packaging. We have all seen and used the 
bulk bins in our local groceries to scoop out bulk amounts of 
literally anything from soup to nuts.
<P>
	Should there not be labels on these bins to tell consumers 
when the items were prepared and how long they retain their 
maximum quality? Should those foods not have some kind of 
durability date? Should products produced on totally different 
dates be mixed in the same bin? Surely what we need are some 
basic labels to give real meaning to the phrase health food.
<P>
	This issue is not a philosophical debate; this is a completely 
practical matter. To see how modern our standards are, just last 
evening I walked through a local supermarket and examined the 
most primary foods to see which products had packaging dates 
and best-before labels. I do not want to name names or blame 
anyone. The problem is the lack of any uniform standards. 
While I was walking around last night I looked at the chicken 
and the hamburger packaging. They had labels which had both 
date packaged on the top and best-before written on the other 
corner. Somewhere between these two expressions was a date, 
but I had no idea what date it was: the date it was packaged or the 
best-before date. Not only that, the date that was on there was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2958"> 2958 </A></B>
<P>
yesterday's date. Were those goods packaged yesterday, or was 
this the date when they were no longer any good?
<P>
	Since all the meat packaged in that area had yesterday's date 
on it, I had to assume that was the day they were packaged but 
maybe I assumed wrongly. Maybe if I had bought those things 
today they would be past their best date.
<P>
	On the major canned food goods in the store that I walked 
around which families stock up on for emergencies, there was 
almost no best-before dates. There was one major exception: 
sardines packaged in New Brunswick had very clear labelling 
and I salute the manufacturers for that. Some jars of peanut 
butter had best-before labelling and some did not. Some jams 
said to refrigerate after opening and some did not. Frozen foods 
had no best-before labelling at all.
<P>
	I might have made some errors and I might have omitted some 
products, but this was when I was casually walking through the 
store and arbitrarily picking products up and checking. I also 
had somebody check each one if I could not find it on the label. 
We both may have missed it, but we both tried to find the 
best-before dates. In fact walking around the store last night I 
noticed that no packaged foods had any information about how 
long the product retained its quality once the seal was broken.
<P>
	I am not claiming that the standards I found are typical of all 
products or all grocery stores. I am saying that there is no way of 
knowing what to expect precisely,  because we lack something 
as simple and as important as a expiry date and a best-before 
date on many foods and beverages. They should be marked 
clearly and legibly on the outside of product packaging.
<P>
	I have heard the argument that if people do not like the 
labelling standards on food at their local supermarket they 
should just shop somewhere else. I am afraid that many senior 
citizens in my riding of Hamilton Mountain would find it 
extremely difficult travelling from supermarket to supermarket 
to find easy-to-understand packaging. We are not talking about 
standards for luxury items. We are talking about standards for 
food, the most essential of all the goods we package.
<P>
	Canadians should be entitled to know when the food they eat 
was prepared and how long the food they purchase maintains its 
freshness. We need such basic information about the food we 
consume.
<P>
	I commend the member of Parliament from Winnipeg North 
for presenting this important motion to the House of Commons 
and I support him fully.
<P>
<B>(1835 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, my hon. 
colleague from Winnipeg North has put forward a motion which 
I believe all of us here can support at least in principle. I 
acknowledge each of you being here at this late hour tonight 
talking about food and I am very pleased to be speaking to this 
motion.
<P>
	The motion recognizes that there are changes coming in 
consumer preference regarding the packaging of food and 
beverage products. These changes address the changing mindset 
in the marketplace. Combined with food safety concerns, 
Canadians are now more health conscious and selective. 
Canadians scrutinize the appearance, the quality as well as the 
labels of food and beverage products. As people tighten their 
belts they are increasingly paying attention to food prices. 
Ultimately this is the single most important factor to consider 
before purchase.
<P>
	The Grocery Products Manufacturers of Canada have been 
polling grocery buying since 1987. They approached people 
buying groceries with the following question: ``When you are 
buying a product for the first time from the supermarket or 
grocery store, what kind of information would you be sure to 
look for on the label of a new food product that you were buying 
for the first time?''
<P>
	For every year that the study has been conducted from 1987 
through to 1993 consumers have answered with unswerving 
consistency. They most want to see the list price. The second 
most desired information is the printing of best-before dates. 
The polling showed that cooking instructions and ingredients 
came in third and fourth place respectively.
<P>
	This polling is only a snapshot of what consumers want on a 
more global basis, but it does show a consistent interest over six 
years for the appearance of best-before dates on packaged 
product. This demonstrates there is consumer support for and 
interest in this information.
<P>
	The marketplace is where the consumer has economic 
influence to bring about change. However for companies to 
provide this information costs would have to be incurred. 
Special encoding machines have to be bought or slight 
modifications will have to be made to the existing machinery. 
Traditionally companies are loathe to increase their cost of 
production if they do not believe that there is going to be any 
basic positive economic spin-off.
<P>
	In this case it has not been made clear to the companies that 
the printing of this information would increase the saleability of 
a product and that is something we need to consider in our 
debate on this topic. In supporting this motion we can help 
consumers get their message across to the processors and 
manufacturers if we give consideration to that element.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2959"> 2959 </A></B>
<P>
	It is interesting to note that some companies are voluntarily 
putting this information on their products. One of these 
companies is Pepsi-Cola. What I am about to say is definitely 
not an endorsement of Pepsi-Cola. However Pepsi has 
recognized the need for better, more accurate labelling on their 
products. They realize that Pepsi drinkers want to know how 
long their Pepsis will keep the fizz fresh. To meet this consumer 
demand Pepsi announced last week that it is going to be printing 
on all its products what it calls a freshness date, so watch that 
fizz. The date will be clearly and legibly stamped on the product 
and it will include the day, the month and the year.
<P>
	This motion is an adequate response to one of the 
recommendations made by the health protection branch in 1993. 
It published a review of the regulations under the Food and 
Drugs Act entitled ``A Strategic Direction for Change''. This 
review was comprehensive and as such the recommendation that 
it be put forward came as a result of thoughtful review. We 
always need to consider that those particular reports contain 
nuggets of information that will lead us in the right direction. 
However we always have to look at that end user which is the 
consumer.
<P>
	It stated that consumers expect the food label to provide basic 
information about the contents of the food, who made it and its 
shelf life in clear, understandable language that is easy to read, 
and we heard this from my hon. colleagues prior to my 
presentation tonight. This report also confirmed the need for 
best-before dates when it stated the main issues for consumers 
emerging from the consultation was a lack of ingredient 
information for many foods, the content and understandability 
of the ingredient list, the understandability of claims, and the 
need for best-before dating on more foods.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
	This report goes on in greater detail about best-before dates. 
There was extensive interest from consumers regarding the 
extension of date marking to all foods both for packed on dates 
and best-before dates.
<P>
	The Consumers Association of Canada advocated a date of 
manufacture. This organization also supported a durable life 
date for products with a shelf life of greater than 90 days in the 
case of low acid foods and hermetically sealed containers and 
refrigerated foods.
<P>
	I wonder how many of us have purchased bags of hermetically 
sealed foods only to find they are really quite questionable in 
terms of freshness when they are opened.
<P>
	Over all, although legibility was very important, the location 
of the information on the label was not a priority. In some cases 
providing information elsewhere on the label was acceptable.
<P>
	Even the food industry representatives conceded the 
importance of consumer information and generally support such 
current requirements as the ingredient listing on prepackaged 
foods and best-before dating.
<P>
	Having said that, the food industry does have some concerns 
and legitimately so. First, it is not clear which products will be 
included under this motion and I would ask the hon. member to 
give some consideration to that as he goes forward in this debate 
on the next reading.
<P>
	The report by the health protection branch stated that the 
extension of requirements for a durable life date to all foods was 
not generally supported by industry. They would prefer a 
voluntary approach rather than a legislated one. Interestingly 
the requirement for a durable life date given to food is a routine 
measure in European countries.
<P>
	The industry cite cost, wasted product, and the need for 
consumer education as reasons to oppose mandatory 
best-before dates. This motion would apply it seems most easily 
to retail dry packaged goods. However as we all know these are 
not the only ones that are in the marketplace.
<P>
	Like the speaker before me I too did some consultation but I 
spoke to some of my industry colleagues in Alberta who do not 
necessarily deal with dried packaged goods to determine what 
they might think of this motion because they are in the 
processing and manufacturing side of things.
<P>
	The concern of industry members from the Alberta potato 
industry is with the application of the best-before date. They are 
concerned about the extent to which this motion would apply to 
fresh produce.
<P>
	Presently they too are investigating the use of packed on dates 
as an attempt to satisfy the consumer demand for information on 
freshness. When you look at bags of potatoes and sometimes 
they are a bit soft or there is mushy stuff inside the bag it would 
be really helpful to see a packed on date on those bags.
<P>
	Further when it comes to meat products, regulation becomes 
quite tricky. It is important that if we improve measures that 
they apply equally to all areas and that regulatory compliance is 
not overly complex. We see ourselves caught up so often in the 
food industry with regulations that are built on other regulations 
and they interact and overlap with other departments and it 
becomes really quite self-defeating.
<P>
	As I have stated, I support this motion. It is clear that 
consumers want best-before and expiration dates to be printed 
clearly and legibly on the outside of product packaging in a 
non-encoded fashion. This is driven by a well-founded need for 
better information to be provided to consumers. This reflects the 
fact that consumers are better educated about health related 
issues and as a result of this more people are paying attention to 
what they eat and from where they are getting their food.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2960"> 2960 </A></B>
<P>
	I have also mentioned some concerns that the industry has put 
forward. We have to pay attention to the consumers' interest but 
we must also try to accommodate the concerns of the processors 
and manufacturer. When we construct regulations we should 
ensure that the printing of this information is based on a sound 
business decision, giving consideration to the marketplace and 
the consumer. We have to give consideration to the cost of the 
machinery needed for encoding, which is an additional cost of 
production.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	If the cost of production does not increase then the cost that is 
passed on to the consumer will be kept to a minimum and 
ultimately this is what we want.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate.
<P>
	I would like to begin by thanking the hon. member for 
Winnipeg North for introducing this motion. The question of 
best-before dating is an important component of the labelling of 
food and beverages. This is an issue that affects all of us as 
consumers and it is certainly worthy of consideration by this 
House.
<P>
	Under the food and drug regulations the labels of most 
perishable and semi-perishable prepackaged food with a shelf 
life of 90 days or less are required to carry a consumer friendly 
best-before date. The requirement is somewhat different for 
products that are packaged at the retail premises. These products 
must show the date they were packaged as well as the 
best-before date.
<P>
	These regulations have been in place for almost 20 years and 
they are there so that consumers can easily determine how fresh 
a product is and how long it is likely to stay fresh. It is obvious 
that this is a very popular measure. The Grocery Products 
Manufacturers of Canada regularly conduct surveys of grocery 
attitudes of Canadian consumers. When they ask what kind of 
information consumers look for on a label, food products they 
are buying for the first time, best-before dates consistently rank 
at the top along with the price.
<P>
	At the same time it seems there are some misconceptions 
about these dates. A best-before date is not an expiry date. 
Products do not go bad as soon as they pass the best-before date. 
This date is only a guide. If your milk is best-before April 12 
you can still drink it on the 13th or the 14th or even later if it has 
been stored properly.
<P>
	It is important to emphasize as well that this is not a question 
of food safety. There are regulations that enforce the use of 
expiry dates where there is a safety concern, such as infant 
formulas or formulated liquid diets.
<P>
	This motion, however, would extend the regulations to 
require best-before dates on foods and beverages with a shelf 
life longer than 90 days. While this is a popular idea and it might 
help consumers rotate products on their own shelves there are 
questions about how useful this information would be. It would 
entail additional costs for industry, costs that would have to be 
passed on to the consumer.
<P>
	At present these products are not required to carry such 
information, although many manufacturers provide it on a 
voluntary basis for products like peanut butter and salad 
dressings.
<P>
	One of the largest soft drink bottlers announced at the end of 
March that it would start putting freshness dates on its soft 
drinks. This subject was recently reviewed by the government in 
consultation with all interested parties during phase I of the 
review of the food and drug regulations. During this review all 
interested parties had a chance to be heard. It was an very open 
and up-front process.
<P>
	We found strong support for retaining the present 
requirements for perishable and semi-perishable foods having a 
shelf life of 90 days or less. We also found support for the 
voluntary use of best-before dates of foods with a shelf life of 
more than 90 days.
<P>
	During phase II of the review we will further study to ensure 
that the regulatory requirements adequately reflect current 
needs. Some changes are being proposed and we are continuing 
to review the regulations.
<P>
	This whole question is a part of a larger area of food 
regulations. Since last summer food regulatory issues including 
food and beverage packaging and labelling which used to be 
dealt with by the food division of the former Consumer and 
Corporate Affairs of Canada have become a part of the mandate 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.
<P>
	I would like to take some time today to talk about the 
expanded role of that department. Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada is one of the oldest government departments. It actually 
predates Confederation. Originally the department was 
responsible for immigration as well as agriculture. But times 
and the mandate of the department have changed.
<P>
<B>(1850 ) </B>
<P>
	Immigration has not been part of the mandate for a long time 
but recently the department acquired not only the agri-food 
packaging and labelling functions of the former CCAC but also 
the food products branch of the former Industry, Science and 
Technology Canada.
<P>
	These additions ensure that all federal services relating to the 
agri-food industry are housed under one roof, making it easier 
to do business with the federal government. Now the 
department's responsibilities extend all along the food chain, 
from the family farm to the food processor to the wholesale, 
retail and food service sector to the consumer's table.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2961"> 2961 </A></B>
<P>
	The department is now responsible for the inspection of a 
wide range of manufactured goods in 4,500 non-registered 
establishments as well as imports to ensure label compliances 
and consumer protection from economic fraud.
<P>
	By providing a single access point for the administration of 
federal agri-food labelling regulations and policies, these 
organizational changes will benefit both consumers and the 
competitiveness of the Canadian food industry.
<P>
	A single federal access point will provide more convenient 
and efficient service and greater national consistency and 
uniformity in the administration of its regulations and policies. 
It will also reduce the frequency in cost of after-the-fact label 
corrections.
<P>
	Since the reorganization, the department has opened 12 
offices across the country to provide single window access for 
people with concerns about labelling. The food division is now a 
part of the food production and inspection branch of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food Canada.
<P>
	The overall objective of this branch is to enhance 
marketability of agriculture and food products by eliminating or 
controlling plant and animal diseases and by facilitating 
compliances with food and safety quality standards.
<P>
	Our present system of food inspection has served us well. 
Food safety has always been a priority for this department. Our 
track record is excellent and surveys consistently show that 
Canadians have more confidence in the safety of their food than 
do consumers in the United States.
<P>
	Nowhere is the old expression ``the proof of the pudding is in 
the eating'' more appropriate. We are working with the 
provinces to develop a national inspection program that 
harmonizes standards across the country and streamlines the 
delivery of services. We are moving to a more market driven 
system in which the beneficiary of the inspection system is 
given the choice to pay for services deemed to be of value.
<P>
	We are building new assurances of food safety into the system 
through the introduction of inspection methods like the hazard 
analysis and critical control points, internationally recognized 
as a most effective means of  identifying and correcting 
problems during processing rather than at the end of production.
<P>
	Although the focus of this motion is the best-before date on 
packaging, I would like to add another dimension. As a member 
who represents a large rural riding of Lambton-Middlesex in 
southwestern Ontario, I am very interested in food quality. I am 
a strong believer that foods produced and processed with 
chemicals that are banned in Canada should not be allowed into 
Canada. Our inspection methods are second to none.
<P>
	We in Canada know that when we sit down to a chicken dinner 
which has been raised and processed in Canada meeting the most 
stringent standards that we are eating wholesome chicken. This 
may not be true with U.S. chicken which can be dipped in 
trisodium phosphate or zapped with gamma rays to pass 
inspection.
<P>
	As consumers, we must continue to have programs in place to 
protect the high quality of food Canadians have enjoyed. Our 
platform committed us to ensuring that only safe, wholesome 
food enters the Canadian market. This is exactly what we are 
doing and we are working hard to do it efficiently.
<P>
	To conclude, whatever we do to improve industry 
competitiveness, consumer safety will not be compromised.
<P>
	I strongly support the member in his motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron-Bruce):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to speak in this debate today.
<P>
	First I would like to thank the hon. member for Winnipeg 
North for raising this important issue. I believe that Canadian 
consumers are very discriminating when it comes to freshness 
and quality of food products. I also believe that it is in the best 
interests of the Canadian food industry and this government to 
ensure a healthy and safe food supply.
<P>
	The issue that the hon. member is raising is one that certainly 
is deserving of our attention today.
<P>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to take the focus off of this particular motion for a 
moment and perhaps put a different focus on this. As a primary 
producer I want to tell my colleagues in this House that having 
been at the root source of the products that we sometimes take so 
for granted it is important to recognize that there has been a lot 
of effort put into the manufacturing or the producing agencies. 
The farmers have done so very much to ensure that we have safe 
products. As we walk through our aisles in our food stores we 
recognize and take for granted the food that we see there. There 
is so much of it, particularly those of us who have travelled in 
areas of the world where they do not have the abundance that we 
enjoy.
<P>
	We also take for granted that all the food we have on our 
shelves is safe and that should be encouraged and I would hope 
that the policies that we enforce in this country will continue to 
ensure we have that safe supply of food.
<P>
	Some time recently I read an article which indicated the 
calamities that befall those people who short-change the health 
inspection system. Our American neighbours in the process of 
trying to expedite things formed a system called the streamline 
inspection system. This system was brought into being so that 
they could accommodate the inspection of chicken products as 
they were going through the assembly line much more quickly. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="2962"> 2962 </A></B>
<P>
There were consequences. An article appeared in a paper which 
indicated one child had died, another 300 people had fallen ill to 
salmonella. They have since turned from that policy in other 
directions concerning inspection.
<P>
	In 1991 another article that was posted in a paper coming from 
south of the border indicated that meat safety labels were going 
to cost $500 million a year more because they were 
implementing new safe handling label requirements. These 
were announced by the USDA that particular day.
<P>
	We see that we cannot short-change the system without 
consequences. Our food supplies in this country, while not only 
having been safe, have also been reasonably priced. I think that 
is another thing we need to recognize. Thirty-seven per cent of 
the food that we buy today is consumed in other than our homes, 
particularly in restaurants and other eating establishments; 63 
per cent of the food that we buy is consumed in our homes. This 
came to light in a recent discussion we had in a public forum on 
GST debate.
<P>
	We have to recognize that in this country we have been 
blessed. We have a great food source. We have reasonably priced 
food and it is also a safe source.
<P>
	It is important to note that this is something we have perhaps 
taken for granted. We have all gone to our refrigerators and 
found that there was food there which we thought was quite 
edible and yet found that it was not. As my hon. friend has 
already indicated, there are codes which most of us do not read 
and perhaps all of us do not understand.
<P>
	At this point I would like to discuss the packaging and the 
labelling regulations in Canada and some of the issues that 
revolve around them. Under the food and drug regulations which 
are administered by the Department of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, the labels on most perishable and semi-perishable 
prepackaged foods with a shelf life of 90 days or less are 
required to show a durable life date, commonly referred to as 
best before date, in a clear non-encoded manner.
<P>
	The product should also display storage instructions if it 
needs to be stored at other than room temperature. This is only 
applicable when the food is packaged at the non-retail level. 
When the product is packaged on retail premises the regulations 
require the label to show the packaging date instead of the best 
before date. For prepackaged foods with a longer shelf life, such 
as canned or frozen foods, manufacturers currently use a coded 
dating system for their own inventory control  purposes. In 
many instances the manufacturers will voluntarily display a best 
before date for customers to use.
<P>
	For example, peanut butter and salad dressing commonly 
have best before dates, though they do not have to.
<P>
<B>(1900 ) </B>
<P>
	The purpose of these regulations, which were introduced in 
1974 and became effective in 1976, is to provide consumers with 
useful information regarding the relative freshness and potential 
shelf life of food.
<P>
	It is important to remember that foods which have exceeded 
the best before date before being sold may still be acceptable for 
consumption but they may not be as fresh. However, this is not a 
health issue. When safety is an issue, such as with infant 
formulas or formulated liquid diets, products must carry expiry 
dates.
<P>
	Consumer surveys show the importance consumers attach to 
best before dating. Many surveys done in Canada reveal that 
after cost freshness, as has already been mentioned tonight, is 
the most important food quality consumers look for, followed by 
nutrition and composition. The freshness of a product tends to 
be equated with health and safety.
<P>
	A survey done for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada in 1992 
showed that 94 per cent of consumers usually or always look for 
the best before date when they shop for groceries.
<P>
	The requirements for durable life dating information on food 
labels have strong support and acceptance by consumers and 
industry groups alike which see these as effective ways to 
produce useful product freshness information to consumers.
<P>
	There is no doubt that best before dating is an important issue 
for consumers. The current system is working well in Canada 
and I think it should continue to be voluntary for products with 
longer shelf lives.
<P>
	Canada boasts one of the safest and healthiest food supplies in 
the world. We are recognized internationally for the quality of 
our food and our safety standards. This is the result of 
co-operation between government and industry. I encourage 
everyone to keep up the good work.
<P>
	I commend my colleague from Winnipeg North for this timely 
and important motion.

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Hon. members, I must inform you that 
we will change the order of proceedings. I will first give the 
floor to the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last March 18, I asked the Minister of Justice what I felt 
was an extremely important question which was also very much 
in the news following the release of the annual report of the 
Chief Commissioner of the Canadian Human Rights 
Commission, Mr. Yalden. The question had to do with sexual 
orientation and more specifically with the recognition of 
same-sex couples.
<P>
	At that time, there was a controversy and the issue made the 
news. Since 1979 Commissioner Yalden and his team have 
reminded us that it is a basis of discrimination and that, although 
various common law courts across the country have rendered 
decisions on the issue-and later we can go back to specific 
cases which set precedents-the Canadian Human Rights Act 
and, more fundamentally, even the Canadian Charter of Rights 
and Freedoms, do not specify that sexual orientation should be a 
prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	This creates a rather absurd situation in that no appropriate 
safeguards exists because the legislature has not, at least in any 
substantial way, updated the Canadian legislation since it was 
first passed in 1977. By contrast, most provinces, including 
Quebec which has always been a leader in that field, recognize 
in their charter that discrimination based on sexual orientation is 
a prohibited ground of discrimination.
<P>
	I was very surprised to see that the minister, who was said to 
be courteous as well as one of the more liberal members of 
Cabinet, pussyfoot around the issue and seemingly unable to 
give clear indications of his government's intention to make 
very specific changes to correct this injustice.
<P>
<B>(1905) </B>
<P>
	By rising in the House this evening, I hope to get some 
additional information and some genuine assurances that, as we 
are hearing from departmental circles, a bill will in fact be 
tabled in the fall, as many groups are demanding. The Human 
Rights Committee has heard representations on the subject from 
a number of witnesses and groups.
<P>
	I see that you are signalling to me that my time is nearly up so 
I will conclude my remarks. It is important to remember that this 
kind of discrimination takes many forms. Consider, for 
example, one case that was before  the courts involving a 
homosexual couple that had lived together for nearly 15 years. 
When the father of one of the partners died, the other was unable 
to get leave to attend his father-in-law's funeral. A major effort 
is needed in this area and I hope that we can count on the 
minister to act speedily and with an open mind to bring about the 
necessary changes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Russell MacLellan (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member for Hochelaga-Maisonneuve asked 
a question of the Minister of Justice about amendments to the 
Canadian Human Rights Act in this House on March 18, 1994, as 
he mentioned.
<P>
	In the throne speech the Prime Minister committed the 
government to amending the Canadian Human Rights Act. 
These amendments will add the ground of sexual orientation to 
the 10 grounds on which discrimination is prohibited in the 
federal public and private sectors under the act as it currently 
stands in the statute books.
<P>
	In fact, on August 6, 1992 a case brought under the equality 
guarantees of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
Haig and Birch v. Canada, the Court of Appeal of Ontario 
ordered that the Canadian Human Rights Act must be read to 
include that ground as of that date. The Attorney General of 
Canada at the time did not appeal the order to the Supreme Court 
of Canada. The government views this as the current and correct 
state of the law.
<P>
	Therefore the amendment to which this government is 
committed to making would give Parliament the opportunity of 
bringing the act up to date.
<P>
	I want to add that this government views this amendment as a 
matter of fundamental justice and not as a matter of conferring 
special rights to a particular group in Canada. The amendment 
would ensure gays and lesbians and moreover heterosexuals 
protection against discrimination in the areas of services and 
employment and against hate propaganda which are covered by 
the Canadian Human Rights Act.
<P>
	Such an amendment would not be a departure from what has 
been going on in other jurisdictions of our country. Eight 
provinces and territories, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Yukon, 
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British Columbia and 
Saskatchewan, have already amended their human rights 
legislation to add the ground of sexual orientation.
<P>
	The level of protection is now the norm in Canada. This 
government wants to add the federal laws against discrimination 
to this list and thereby assure Canadians-

	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Liberal Party's position on old age security is so complex 
and unclear that we cannot make any sense  of it. Contrary to 
what the Minister of Human Resources Development suggested 
when I asked him questions on that matter, the Official 
Opposition is not alone in its concern over this confusion.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	This confusion is not a figment of our imagination. It is the 
result of contradictory statements by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development and the Prime Minister. Senior citizens 
associations also reacted strongly against the government's 
hidden agenda. Our senior citizens demand clear answers on the 
future of their social programs.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Last month, when I asked the minister about that, I asked him 
to apologize to seniors he had upset. Indeed, after the minister 
indicated that Canadians could have to choose between old age 
pensions and youth training programs, he was rebuffed by the 
Prime Minister who said that his government had no intention of 
touching old age pensions.
<P>
	The federal government is brutally attacking the seniors' 
meagre income by taking $490 million out of their pockets. Not 
only is the minister refusing to apologize for having upset these 
people, he is now increasing their tax burden when they cannot 
do anything to increase their income. This measure will affect 
more than 800,000 seniors, 600,000 of whom earn between 
$25,000 and $50,000.
<P>
	Besides, statistics show that the vast majority of these 
600,000 seniors have income of about $25,000. The government 
should stop saying that only the well-to-do seniors will be 
affected by these drastic and unfair fiscal measures.
<P>
	How could seniors regain the $200, $300 or $400 they lose 
every year and that they need to survive? Will we force them to 
go back on the job market? Will they have to cut back on their 
outings, their housing or their food? Can the minister give us a 
clear answer as to the future of the income security programs for 
the people who built this country?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Prime Minister and the Minister of Human Resources 
Development stated clearly in this House that it is not the 
government's intention to touch old age security benefits and I 
would refer members to page 56 of the budget papers which sets 
out increases in OAS which will take place over the next few 
years.
<P>
	The government is not looking at reducing the pensions of 
Canada's seniors. There is a responsibility by the government to 
ensure that the next generation of Canadians can have the same 
security as this generation.
<P>
	Our society is aging and we need to prepare for a doubling of 
the senior population over the next several decades. We must 
begin now to be ready for these changes. The aging of society 
brings with it opportunities  as well as challenges and the issue 
is one of readiness, not cost cutting.
<P>
	The government's paper will not focus only on pensions but 
will look at aging more broadly. While we must of course be 
fiscally responsible and ensure sustainable programs we know 
that planning for an aging society cannot be done overnight.
<P>
	Governments, employers, individuals and families cannot 
engage in short term thinking. Canadians know that the sooner 
you begin planning for retirement the more likely you will be to 
have the kind of retirement you want. That is as true for this 
nation as it is for individuals. Now is the time to start looking at 
the kind of programs today's working age Canadians will need 
and want for their retirements in the next century.
<P>
	The paper we are preparing will be about people, their values, 
needs and responsibility. We will look at trends in our society, 
the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives, the fact 
they are retiring younger and living longer, the fact that family 
structures have changed, especially with regard to the role of 
women and that of a number of older seniors, those over age 
85-

	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I asked the 
minister a question and thought that his answer was clear, which 
was surprising coming from this minister. But the fact of the 
matter is that francophone and Acadian communities in Canada 
are still facing the same problems resulting from cuts.
<P>
	I had put the following question to the minister: in view of 
some discrepancies between his own statements and those of his 
senior officials, can the minister confirm that funding for the 
Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du 
Canada will not be cut by 5 per cent?
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	And the minister's answer was: ``I am pleased to say that we 
have managed to spare communities such as the one he just 
mentioned from existing cuts in my department.'' That sounded 
clear to me, but these communities keep getting conflicting 
information. I did not get to ask a supplementary question at the 
time. Had I had the opportunity, perhaps I could have got the 
minister to be more specific as to what cuts were made in funds 
allocated to the Francophonie.
<P>
	Since I have four minutes to discuss the issue, I would like to 
take this opportunity to ask the parliamentary secretary whether 
the Court Challenges Program, a program abolished by the 
Conservatives that the Liberals were talking about restoring, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="2965"> 2965 </A></B>
<P>
will be restored? Will this equity program for minorities in 
Canada be restored and what kind of funding will it have?
<P>
	I would also like to get more specific information on the cuts 
made in the Francophonie budget because, as much as the 
minister claims that overall operations are not affected, there 
are other programs of paramount importance to the 
Francophonie. Take for example the operating budget of certain 
small associations, not that of the large Fédération des 
communautés francophones et acadienne, important as it may 
be. There is also the community radio assistance program. Is 
that program affected by this 5 per cent cut on top of the 10 per 
cent cut already made by the Conservatives? Is the postal 
subsidy cut? Will the aid to French-language publications be 
cut? What about the $112 million school governance program 
that Lise Bissonnette, the editor of <I>Le Devoir</I>, called a way of 
subsidizing illegality? Will it be eliminated?
<P>
	Francophone and Acadian communities want an unequivocal 
answer. Unfortunately, the Bloc Quebecois members are the 
ones fighting for Francophone communities outside Quebec, 
while their own elected representatives in Ontario, New 
Brunswick and western Canada, themselves francophones, do 
not take the trouble to defend the interests of their own people 
and press the minister to give them a clear answer. I have no use 
for one of the minister's typical grey answers. It is either black 
or white. Are there cuts, yes or no?
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, the educational rights of francophones 
outside Quebec are clearly recognized in the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms. These rights were clarified by two 
Supreme Court decisions: the Mahé case in 1990 and the 
Manitoba reference in 1993.
<P>
	Most provinces and territories have school legislation 
consistent with Section 23 of the Charter. School governance 
has been granted or soon will be.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Education is under provincial jurisdiction. The role of the 
federal government is to assist the provinces to meet their 
constitutional obligations.
<P>
	For almost 25 years the federal government has helped the 
provincial and territorial governments to provide members of 
the French minority community with the opportunity to be 
educated in their own language.
<P>
	Since the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms came into 
effect in 1982, statistics show that more and more young 
francophones are educated in their own language.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The federal government recognizes that francophone 
minority groups still face difficulties, but it is working to 
address these deficiencies.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	French minority language education remains a high priority 
for the federal government and for the Department of Canadian 
Heritage. That is why the special initiatives on school 
governance and  post-secondary education in French have been 
exempted from the latest budgetary restrictions. It is expected 
that federal-provincial agreements negotiated under these 
initiatives will result in significant improvements for the 
francophone communities in these provinces.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on March 18, 1994, I put a question to the Deputy 
Prime Minister concerning her sensitivity to the plight of the 
unemployed.
<P>
	I realized how powerless the Deputy Prime Minister was in 
the face of the unemployment problem. Since then, I have also 
come to realize how powerless the Minister of Finance is and 
how he has failed to take any action to address the situation. In 
the words of Mr. Laurent Laplante, a respected journalist, ``by 
focusing all of their efforts on wrestling the inflation monster to 
the ground, the Conservatives ended up dragging the country 
into the first ever made-in-Canada recession. Mr. Martin has 
decided to go one step further and make the recession 
permanent.''
<P>
	As a complement to the question I am going to ask, and to 
which the minister did not really answer, I would like to echo the 
voice of that young engineer who stunned everyone at the 
seminar on employment, a few days ago, when he said that he 
had a master's degree in a very specialized field and nobody was 
able to find him a job. This sort of broke the empty rhetoric 
usually heard at such gatherings.
<P>
	I would like to know whether or not the government has a job 
creation strategy based on some government action, and really 
established as a primary objective of the government. At the 
present time, we only see some sprinkling here and there. The 
infrastructure program will create almost no jobs for women 
and, anyway, it is just a drop in the unemployment bucket. There 
are no programs for specific groups either.
<P>
	Was anything announced for unskilled workers? What do we 
have for graduates in various trades, technologists or university 
graduates? Is there anything specific to ensure the recovery of 
entrepreurship in Quebec and Canada?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="2966"> 2966 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like the government to finally give us some answers 
on this and really get to work instead of riding the wave as far as 
job creation is concerned.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Mr. Speaker, if 
the hon. member is referring to a comprehensive strategy on job 
creation, I would like for him to be mindful of the fact that the 
government has really begun a process of modernizing and 
restructuring Canada's social security system, creating job 
opportunities through the infrastructure program, the  Canada 
youth corps and the national apprenticeship training system.
<P>
	I am sure the hon. member would have to agree that since we 
have taken office in October over 100,000 jobs have been 
created.
<P>
	We want to not only create jobs but they should be long term, 
high paying jobs. What is important to note about the jobs that 
we have created thus far, particularly the latest statistic released 
recently, is the fact that these are full time jobs. They are not the 
part time jobs that we saw during the Conservative years. These 
are full time jobs that will once again provide to Canadians, 
particularly young Canadians, the type of confidence that is 
required to bring about economic renewal in our country.
<P>
	There is no question about the fact, and I remember his 
question clearly about the Group of Seven and the industrialized 
countries, that to them unemployment is an important challenge 
to face. That is why we are looking at ways to upgrade our 
training programs. We are looking at the entire social security 
system and ways to modernize and make it relevant to the lives 
of Canadians in the 1990s and beyond.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 7.23 p.m. this House stands 
adjourned until tomorrow at 2 p.m. pursuant to Standing Order 
24(1).
