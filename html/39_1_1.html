      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will begin with just a brief history lesson about this particular procedure of electing the Speaker by secret ballot, which was recommended in 1985 by the Special Committee on the Reform of the House of Commons, otherwise known as the McGrath committee. It was recommended at that time as a symbol of the independence of the House from the government and the independence of individual members. As members may know, before that, the Speaker was appointed by the Prime Minister. It is in that spirit that I invite you to participate in this particular exercise today.</div>

Unfortunately, over the past few years Canadians have become quite disillusioned by the behaviour of some of our colleagues in this august chamber. I would like to say that we owe it to all Canadians to give them an institution they can respect. Therefore, when I was approached by some of our colleagues to allow my name to stand, I agreed. I agreed because I think a positive change would make a tremendous difference in how this House of Commons is run. </div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28222"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dear colleagues, as you know, I have been a member here in this House for over 17 years. I sat as a member of the opposition for five years. I have served as the minister responsible for various portfolios and I proficiently dealt with all matters before me. I have also served on various committees. Furthermore, I am very familiar with the procedures of this House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28223"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is absolutely essential that we show respect for one another in this House. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28224"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a House of great debate and, yes, great disagreement, but we have all been elected by Canadians and we share a common bond of association in that we want to make this a better country. We want to represent our constituents well. To do that, we must have these great debates, but in the end we must respect each other's positions and work together. I propose to be very strict on the language that is used in the House of Commons because it starts with the language. I would call on all of the parties and all of the leaders to work with me to ensure that Canadians regain the respect this institution deserves.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28225"></a><p>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is always a pleasure to serve the House as a member of Parliament and I am grateful to the electors of Kingston and the Islands for giving me the mandate to represent them here once again.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28229"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who are back, I am delighted to see them back. For those who are new, I express my congratulations, and I hope they enjoy their experience as a member of this place.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28230"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As members know, I have been considered by some as a bit of a procedural junkie since my election here in 1988. I have enjoyed working in procedural matters from the beginning, whether it was on the opposition side, the government side or in the chair. I have been a chair occupant now since 1996, either as Speaker or Deputy Speaker or Deputy Chair of Committees of the Whole House.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28231"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During that time I always appreciated the cooperation of the hon. members from every party in the House and I wish to be able to continue in the role of Speaker during this Parliament.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28232"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three important aspects to being the Speaker of the House. Tomorrow the Speaker will deliver a short speech to the Governor General addressing the most important aspect, namely that the Speaker is a servant of the House.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28233"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As such, I believe the Speaker has a role to play in moderating debate and choosing who speaks next and so on, but there is also a great deal of cooperation that Speakers demand from members of the House in making the House function properly. I have always appreciated and enjoyed the opportunity to work with other members, with the whips and House leaders of the various parties and of course with the independent members to ensure that the House functions, not always smoothly, but that it does function.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28234"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Speaker must also represent the House and the hon. members.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28235"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, I have often had the opportunity to explain to Canadians the role and responsibilities of the members of Parliament and make Canadians aware of the importance of the work that the hon. members do here in the House and in their ridings. After all, as I said, the Speaker represents the hon. members and I believe it is very important to continue to explain their role to Canadians.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28236"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also feel that the Speaker has a role in making very impartial rulings in the House. I have had many occasions when issues have come before the House that required a decision from the Chair, including, of course, a number of ties on votes, which happens from time to time and sometimes involves the Speaker in making a decision. On each occasion I have appreciated the support of hon. members, even when they were on the losing side of the casting vote, because I think the Speaker has to try to make the decision based on procedural practice, which of course I have sought to do on the three occasions that have happened during my term as Speaker.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28237"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In every case I have worked with members in promoting the House and its values, in promoting this place as a debating chamber, as a place where we can work together, and where parties are encouraged to work with one another to ensure that the business of the House gets done. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28238"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel that over the past few years the House has accomplished quite a bit. We have addressed many bills presented in the House and considered every motion introduced here.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28239"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have had considerable progress despite the fact that we have had minority governments and of course shifting seating arrangements in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28240"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate the support of hon. members in the voting later today and I appreciate the years of support they have given me in the past.</div>

I see many new faces this morning, as well as many of my former colleagues:  young, old, women, men, newcomers, old-timers, anglophones and francophones.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a few words about the very important role the Speaker of the House plays. For my new colleagues, I would like to explain that the Speaker does more than allocate floor time. He or she presides over the House equitably and, if I am allowed a parenthesis in the context of a minority government with three opposition parties, the Speaker's judgment, resolve and impartiality in rulings on procedural issues will determine the quality of the working climate in the House.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28244"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To my former colleagues whom I am happy to see again—and I hasten to congratulate them on their re-election—I want to point out that the mood is not always as calm and generous as we find it this morning.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28245"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The climate in the House in recent years, particularly during question period, has had disastrous and unfortunate consequences on our credibility and on the democratic institution to which we belong. Let us not be surprised at the ever-growing indifference and skepticism we provoke. In fact, a recent survey revealed that politicians are trusted by only 14% of Canadians. I do not think that we have any reason to be proud of that score and I am sure we all want to improve ourselves. Let us think about that when we choose who will preside over our deliberations and work.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28246"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been a member of the House of Commons since 1999, and in that time I have had the privilege of working alongside members of all the parties represented in this venerable institution.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28247"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the last Parliament I occupied the Speaker's chair as deputy chair of committees of the whole. The comments I received from members told me I did a good job of protecting their freedom of expression and thereby allowing their constituents to be heard. I am proud of the work we did together.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28248"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also chaired the legislative committee on Bill C-38. Those who were there could judge my impartiality, my immense consideration for our democratic system and the rigour and open-mindedness I brought to the committee's meetings.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28249"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know how demanding our work can be, intellectually, morally and physically. We know how available we have to be for our constituents and for our work in the House, in committees and in subcommittees. However I think the role and duties of members of Parliament within our democratic system must be made better known and their value re-enhanced. I pledge to do this with members if they place their confidence in me.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28250"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear colleagues, Canadians have the profound desire and, dare I say it, the right to have parliamentarians who inspire respect. It would be inappropriate and unrealistic to expect them to respect the institutions if their MPs' attitudes did not demonstrate their pride in and deference to the country's primary institution. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28251"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is up to us to show Canadians that we respect the duty for which they elected us. We must represent their interests, express their convictions and debate on the floor of the House the great issues facing Canadian society. I would add that it is also part of our duty to elect a Speaker who can lead us to the fairest compromises and best decisions for the well-being of our country.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28252"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colleagues, in placing your confidence in me today you will be giving me the privilege of serving the democratic ideology that we all share. You can count on my commitment to directing this 39th Parliament with impartiality, resolve and dignity in both of Canada's official languages.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned this morning, the change in the seating arrangements is one that some of us find a little more dramatic because there has been quite a shift. I recognize the advantages of sitting on either side having done it before, so I appreciate the chance to recognize members from different sides. I hope I do not make too many errors in calling members by former titles or names. There has been a shift and I will try to be correct about that.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to say how much I look forward to the official opening of the House tomorrow and the debates that will follow.</div>

    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28278"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for electing me as your Speaker. I have spoken with a number of you.

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to acknowledge the presence in the gallery of three of my sisters, Katherine, Amanda and Elizabeth, and the husbands of Kathy and Elizabeth. My mother is also present with my brother and his wife, Pat. I am delighted they could be here today, as they have been in the past.</div>

I have always had, as many members of the House have, a great appreciation for your abilities and a great understanding of your aspirations for the country. We only ever had one difficulty, and that was your partisanship. By virtue of your achievement today, you have largely resolved that problem for me.</div>

      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all candidates who expressed an interest in taking on this function so vital to the operation of the House of Commons. Your duties and responsibilities will be especially evident in this context of a minority government, but you already have some experience in this area.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28303"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elected representatives in the House of Commons are the incarnation of the will of the people and, in the final analysis, it is this democratic assembly that must have the final say, that must make the legislative and financial decisions. We know the importance of your role, which is to defend the rights of MPs. It is, however, also to guard the rights of Parliament and the rights of all parliamentary democracies so that we may hold debates, which, while controversial and impassioned at times, are still essential to vibrant democracy in both Canada and Quebec.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28304"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you of the cooperation of the Bloc Québécois as you carry out your duties. In closing, I would like to wish us all a successful session.</div>

    </p><a name="Para28306"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you will give me the opportunity to say a few words.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28307"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, Mr. Speaker, I would like, I am sure on behalf of all of the House, to thank the dean of the House, the hon. member for Elmwood--Transcona, for the excellent way in which he conducted the procedures we witnessed here today. I also want to add my voice of thanks, and that of our party, to the member for Sudbury and the member for Hull--Aylmer for presenting their names and creating our first democratic moment here in the House of Commons.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28308"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, with regard to your success in becoming the Speaker of the House again, this in many ways is due not only to your deep respect for the institution, your understanding of your role as a servant of the House about which you spoke very eloquently, of decisions that you have made in the past, but also a deep sense that we all have of you, that you are a person of integrity, that you are a person who is able to deal with each and every one of us as equals in a friendly and straightforward fashion. We appreciate that very much. </div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28309"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to say a few words to my fellow members who are here, because we have the responsibility to maintain certain ethics in the House.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>English</i>]</p><a name="Para28310"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure that you heard from Canadians from coast to coast to coast in the last months about their disappointment in the way in which discussion was taking place in this House. I recall some of the words that Ed Broadbent said in his last major speech here. He called on all of us to recognize the inherent dignity of each and every person in the House and to recognize that Canadians by the thousands had selected each one of us to be here to represent them and to raise their concerns in the House.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28311"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope very much that all of the members here will, and I certainly will make this commitment on my own behalf and on behalf of my party, and I look to the other leaders to work with us on this, in order that we can do much better to present to Canadians a democratic process of debate of which we can all be proud.</div>
    </p>
    <p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><a name="Para28312"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, I realize that you need our help as you cannot do it all on your own. Thus, we will work respectfully with you at all times.</div>
    </p><a name="Para28313"></a><p>
      <div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations and good luck.</div>
