<P>
	I shall now propose Motions No. 1 and 69 to the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of 
order. After discussions with the House leaders and the party whips 
yesterday, I believe you will find that I have unanimous consent for 
my motion No. 25 to be included in group 1 for debate today.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I wonder if I might ask the 
assistance of the hon. member for Saint John. Is she referring to her 
motion No. 25 being in group No. 2?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Wayne:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, you are absolutely correct.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the 
request for unanimous consent to include motion No. 25 in group 
No. 2. Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Therefore I will present 
group No. 2 and No. 11 before the House simultaneously for the 
purpose of debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have had discussions with members of other parties and I 
believe if you seek unanimous consent you may find agreement to 
refer clause 27 of this bill back to the Standing Committee of

<B><A NAME="1086"> 1086 </A></B>
<P>
Transport for  reconsideration, given the further input that has 
come from the field.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The House has heard the the 
request of the hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke. Is 
there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, another point of order. I understand the 
groupings also include voting. Group 6 contains a motion to delete 
clause 27(2). That same grouping contains two different motions to 
modify clause 27(3), which is simply a part or refers to clause 
27(2).
<P>
	If they are voted on together and if the government chooses to 
defeat clause 27(2), which I suspect it will do, it will also defeat the 
minister's Motion No. 7. I do not believe that is the intent. It is 
going to add confusion.
<P>
	Could we get clarification that these will be voted on separately 
even though they are grouped together?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I believe that could be 
clarified at the time of voting.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In response to the

	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 25</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-14, in Clause 129, be amended by adding after line 41, on page 
58, the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(3) For the purposes of sections 129 to 136, the former Canadian Pacific 
line through Maine shall be deemed to be a route wholly within Canada, and any 
carrier serving any portion of the line between Saint John (New Brunswick) and 
Montreal (Quebec) shall be deemed to be a connecting carrier and any place 
where the line of a railway company connects with such connecting carrier shall 
be deemed to be an interchange.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
proposed to amend this clause in two places, essentially where 
prescriptions for requiring railways providing transportation 
services to people are written. According to the way the bill is now 
presented it takes into  consideration the special needs of people 
with special disabilities.
<P>
	I have proposed to add the words ``and the elderly'', because it is 
not always easy to describe the problems that come with age: being 
slower, not able to make such long steps. There are special 
requirements that are caused as a result in loading and unloading of 
conveyances.
<P>
	For that reason I thought it would be appropriate to include the 
needs of elderly persons as something of which providers of 
transportation would have to be kept aware.
<P>
	I note that most of the airlines now do that to a certain extent. 
Elderly persons are loaded in advance but there is no requirement 
in the act. As the act is now written there is nothing requiring them 
to do this other than the exigencies of the market.
<P>
	If we are going to draw attention to providers of service into 
perpetuity which this act will have the affect of doing, we should 
mention that it is a requirement of the Government of Canada for 
providers of those transportation services to keep the needs of 
elderly persons at the top of their order of priorities, along with the 
needs of people with special disabilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am in support of Motions Nos. 1 and 69. I have a little 
difficulty in so far as there is a bit of redundancy in it, but I feel we 
should support it nonetheless.
<P>
<B>(1015 )</B>
<P>
	The bill already contains a provision which provides no barrier 
to access for anyone disabled. I am puzzled as to exactly what kind 
of barrier we would put in front of an elderly person who was not 
already covered by the disabled part.
<P>
	That notwithstanding, it may be possible and we should 
recognize nonetheless that there is a need for access for elderly 
people. As the hon. member has just mentioned, we certainly do 
not want it to appear that we have not given due consideration for 
their concerns. They have a right to full access to all transportation 
modes in this country. That would clarify it at least in the bill. I do 
not think they would have been unduly hurt had it not been there, 
but why not be generous and ensure that proper provisions are 
made for these people so that they are assured that they have not 
been left out.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 25, I also think this is a fair 
consideration for Atlantic Canada. This does not provide any 
problems for anywhere else in Canada but it is a consideration that 
will have a significant impact on some of the Atlantic provinces in 
order to access some of the terms contained in the bill.
<P>
	The bill has been put out with the idea of making the rail section 
of it more fair to shippers across the country. In doing so, it has 
certain provisions that shippers and  rail companies must meet on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1087"> 1087 </A></B>
<P>
access to various services. To not include this would unfairly 
restrict Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It is consistent with the old policy held with the CPR line that ran 
through a portion of the United States in order to access the rest of 
Canada. We would be very remiss to penalize Atlantic Canada on 
what amounts to a technicality in the provisions of this bill. I will 
be supporting that one as well.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me 
great pleasure to speak to my motion today in Group No. 2 
concerning Bill C-14, the Canadian Transportation Act. I want to 
thank my leader, the hon. member for Sherbrooke, for seconding 
my motion.
<P>
	There was one major omission in the bill and that is why I have 
introduced Motion No. 25. The provision of the existing National 
Transportation Act section 134(6)(c) designates the Canadian 
Pacific line from Saint John through to Quebec as a route wholly 
within Canada for the purposes of the competitive line rates or 
CLRs. This existing section of the NTA has been dropped in Bill 
C-14.
<P>
	There are serious concerns that the wording of Bill C-14 is not 
clear enough to protect shippers in the maritimes from the captive 
position they would be in if CN would be the only railway which 
operates wholly within Canada from the maritime provinces to 
Quebec.
<P>
	The provisions of Bill C-14 that deal with the issue of 
competitive line rates are found in sections 129 to 136. These CLR 
provisions are basically the same as those contained in the existing 
National Transportation Act of 1987. The purpose of the CLRs is to 
protect the shippers against potential monopolistic prices by a 
railway which has an exclusive position with respect to a particular 
shipper.
<P>
	Without the CLR provisions there is the potential that a railway 
could threaten to charge unreasonably high rates for the exclusive 
portion of a route served by that railway. In virtually all parts of 
Canada other than the maritime provinces, there are alternative rail 
lines wholly within Canada over which the shipper may ship goods.
<P>
	For over 100 years CP Rail operated a line of railway from 
Montreal, Quebec to Saint John, New Brunswick. The line went 
through the eastern townships of Quebec, across the state of Maine 
in the U.S. and re-entered New Brunswick at McAdam, New 
Brunswick and from there down to Saint John with a spur to St. 
Stephen.
<P>
	Maritime shippers wishing to ship their goods to Quebec and 
beyond have the option of shipping through Moncton on the CN 
line or through Saint John via the short lines which now operate 
along the former CP line. Following an order by the NTA, CP 
abandoned a portion of its line between Lennoxville and Saint John 
effective midnight December 31, 1994. Four days later on January  
4, 1995 the line was bought by several short line operators.
<P>
	Those companies bought the line with the assumption that the 
competitive line rate provisions would still apply. Now with Bill 
C-14 the CLR provisions concerning the CP line have been 
eliminated. There seems to be no logical reason why such 
reactivated lines should be excluded from access to the CLR 
provisions under Bill C-14.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	I hope the example I will give will create a clear picture for my 
colleagues in the House of the situation we face in the maritimes. 
Let us take the example of a shipper located in Bathurst, New 
Brunswick. This shipper is located on a railway line owned by CN 
and wishes to ship a product to Quebec. Section 134(5) of the 
present legislation, NTA-87, states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Where the ultimate point of destination of a movement of traffic of a shipper 
is in Canada and there is available to the shipper more than one continuous route 
wholly within Canada that is cost effective and over which it is considered 
reasonable to move the traffic of the shipper, the shipper shall, in order to have a 
competitive line rate established, designate a continuous route that is wholly 
within Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Section 134(6)(c) states that ``the Canadian Pacific line through 
Maine shall be considered to be a route wholly within Canada''. 
These sections allow the Bathurst shipper to request and obtain a 
CLR rate from CN for the hauling of goods.
<P>
	Let us assume that Bill C-14 is law. The Bathurst shipper has put 
in a request to get a CLR rate. What would CN say to this request? 
CN would say: ``Section 131(1) of Bill C-14 denies you the right to 
a CLR quote unless you and all the connecting carriers have 
reached an agreement on shipping your goods''.
<P>
	Under section 111 of Bill C-14, a connecting carrier is defined as 
a railway company other than a local carrier. Under section 87 a 
railway company is defined as a person who holds a certificate of 
fitness under section 92. One can only get a certificate of fitness 
under section 92 if one is federally regulated. The short lines that 
now operate the former CP line are provincially regulated, not 
federally regulated, and are therefore not deemed a connecting 
carrier.
<P>
	Since the Bathurst shipper does not have an agreement with the 
connecting carrier under section 131(1), CN is forbidden to quote 
the Bathurst shipper a CLR. Thus, the Bathurst shipper would be 
placed at a competitive disadvantage as it would have to use the CN 
line and CN could charge whatever rate it wanted.
<P>
	My amendment would solve this problem. It would deem the 
line from Saint John through to Quebec as a line considered to be 
wholly within Canada as it has been for Canadian Pacific. It would 
add a provision that carriers serving the line from Saint John to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1088"> 1088 </A></B>
<P>
Montreal are  deemed to be connecting carriers. Thus, the Bathurst 
shipper would not be placed at a disadvantage.
<P>
	CP's sale of the Saint John to Sherbrooke line to other railways 
in January 1995 should make no difference in principle to the 
analysis of this issue. The fact that the owner of that line is no 
longer CP is irrelevant to shippers. They still want the option to 
ship over a route they have shipped over for many years. I know the 
government wants the private sector to succeed. The only way 
those in the private sector can succeed now is that they be deemed 
wholly in Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of my amendment is to gain a position for maritime 
shippers. It is not to gain a preferential position for them but 
merely to ensure that they have the same access to provisions of the 
CTA as shippers from other parts of Canada.
<P>
	The short line operators that recently purchased the abandoned 
CP line through Maine to Quebec felt that this was the situation. 
There was a natural reliance on the continued existence of the 
current legislation.
<P>
	The potential loss of domestic traffic on the former CP line 
would make it less viable and it is difficult to imagine how it could 
survive. The maritime provinces cannot afford to lose any more. 
We have taken unproportional cuts in the last three budgets. We 
have lost our regional freight rate assistance program that enabled 
us to get our products to market at a competitive price. The 
inability of shippers to get these competitive line rates will only 
make an already bad situation worse.
<P>
	I have asked myself why the term ``wholly within Canada'' has 
been dropped from Bill C-14. Has it been dropped only because CP 
has sold that line to a number of short line carriers? Are the short 
line carriers not as important as CP was? Is it that the shippers are 
not as important in the maritimes as they are in the rest of Canada, 
or is it because we want CN to be more attractive for sale?
<P>
<B>(1025 )</B>
<P>
	If the government does not accept this amendment, it will be 
perceived as discriminating against the maritimes. I am sure it does 
not want that to happen. I ask my colleagues, including government 
members, to support this amendment for the purposes of protecting 
an industry and maintaining the competitiveness of the railway and 
the ability of shippers to compete.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government cannot and will not 
support either of Motions Nos. 1 or 69.
<P>
	Concerning Motion No. 1, the national transportation policy 
already recognizes there should be no undue obstacle to the 
movement of all persons. The motion does not add to that and there 
will be no need then to make specific reference to elderly persons.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 69, we cannot support this motion. 
The government feels there is no need for a regulation which 
specifically addresses the mobility needs of elderly people. As I 
mentioned when I spoke to Motion No. 1, provisions are already in 
place for that kind of requirement.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 25, while we commend the concerns 
of the member, the government cannot and will not support this 
motion because there is already a non-legislative alternative 
available to resolve the problem.
<P>
	Specifically, the New Brunswick Southern Railway could put 
into effect immediately provisions that would overcome all 
problems the railway has mentioned to date and which the previous 
speaker has indicated. The Eastern Maine Railroad Company, an 
affiliate of the New Brunswick Southern Railway, could enter into 
an agreement with the New Brunswick southern to use the Saint 
John connection with CN. That would result in two federally 
regulated railways, CN and Eastern Maine Railroad Company, 
connecting Saint John. This would create an interchange that 
satisfied the eligibility requirements for competitive line rates 
which would then address all the concerns of the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am disappointed in the government's response to 
Motions Nos. 1, 69 and 25.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 1 and 69 go a step further and add to the list of 
people for which there would not be any barriers to transportation. 
The act already talks about persons of disability and the motions 
would include elderly people.
<P>
	There was some concern mentioned earlier about why we should 
include elderly people, that if they had disabilities they would 
surely be covered under that section. There is a grey area. People 
are living longer. They want to stay in their home communities 
rather than go to care facilities hundreds of miles away.
<P>
	I know several elderly people who live quite active lives but 
their eyesight prevents them from driving. Sometimes they might 
even have difficulty renewing their drivers' licences. It is not that 
they are totally blind, it is not that they fall into the disabled 
category, but there is a need there. It is also a transportation need, 
particularly if their eyesight is not good enough to allow them to 
drive on the highways. They still have this tremendous need to go 
to other centres for medical services or to visit family members and 
so forth.
<P>
	The amendment simply wished to spell out that elderly people 
should also be included in the grouping. If the government does not 
accept these motions, it will be because of the bureaucrats who do 
not like to see any changes to what they have proposed.
<P>
	Motion No. 25 was introduced by our colleague from Saint John. 
She made excellent sense in presenting her case. I am again 
surprised the government has not  listened to the legitimate 
concerns which are being expressed. Instead, it is listening to the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1089"> 1089 </A></B>
<P>
bureaucrats and ploughing ahead with what the bureaucrats have 
deemed, which is not what common sense would dictate.
<P>
<B>(1030 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to add my comments to those of my colleague who 
asked whether the government of the day cares adequately for the 
needs and interests of Canadians in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	It seems the hon. member for Saint John told us very clearly why 
this is a rather significant issue. We should be very careful to look 
after all sections of Canada, not just one. I lend my support to her 
appeal to the House to support motion No. 25.
<P>
	With regard to the other amendments being proposed to look 
after the interests of the elderly and put them into a situation where 
they are looked after and adequately provided for, the 
Transportation Act does deal with people who perhaps cannot 
move as quickly and who may be handicapped. However, we must 
recognize all Canadians need to be looked after.
<P>
	It makes excellent sense that we have two motions dealing with 
the elderly, that they be treated fairly, responsibly and equally. In 
addition, we must look after the interests of those in Atlantic 
Canada who want a fair and equitable market that will provide 
adequate facilities, efficiency and competition in the area.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 38, will we again see that the 
government does not have the interests of Atlantic Canada at heart? 
It is particularly significant that it recognize that all parts of 
Canada belong together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parkdale-High Park, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to put on the record that I do not know why hon. members 
opposite want to discriminate against the elderly. There are people 
who at the age of 90 do not want to be considered disabled, who do 
not want wheelchairs, et cetera. Then there are people at age 60 
who do require a wheelchair. For the ones who do desire assistance, 
it is already in the act and is already being practised. People are 
flying. Airlines provide wheelchairs for people of all ages.
<P>
	Why would those members discriminate against the elderly? I 
believe the elderly would be offended if that motion were adopted.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, most of the amendments appeared in the Order Paper for 
the first time yesterday with the notice of intention to bring this bill 
forward. It has been quite a scramble with 82 amendments to come 
up with some reasonable debate for today. We still have to sort 
through many of these. We want to make sound judgment decisions 
on these, not snap decisions. I do ask your patience as I am sorting 
through these.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1095"> 1095 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 2, I do support this. Basically it 
brings an old and acceptable definition of a federal railway into 
the new act. I see no reason not to go with that.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 28 and moving onward, I will pass 
over some of these very quickly because they require little 
comment. On Motion No. 28 I do not believe there is any 
justification for this. This we will not be supporting, nor will we be 
supporting Motion No. 29.
<P>
	In the case of Motion No. 29, and this will come up often under 
several of the motions by this member, this is inconsistent in my 
opinion with the intent of the bill. The hon. member did appear at 
the odd committee meeting. I recognize he is not a member and 
that he has other obligations, but various parts of these things were 
discussed at length in committee by all the parties present.
<P>
	Unfortunately he seems to be either missing part of it or by not 
taking part in the actual debate and participating did not understand 
the intent of what this bill is all about.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 30, also made the member, I will be 
supporting it although I think it could have been better defined. It is 
an improvement over that section of the bill nonetheless.
<P>
	Now we get into a mixture with the hon. member from the Bloc 
Quebecois. Motion No. 31 is a reasonable proposal as it deals with 
rail abandonment and I do not have a problem with it.
<P>
	On Motion No. 32 from the hon. member from the NDP, once 
again this goes completely against the widely accepted 
abandonment policy this bill has attempted to bring in, one I have 
support.
<P>
	There was a bit of controversial discussion of this during our 
hearings at committee, but I think the explanation was well given. 
Most of the witnesses who came before the committee did accept 
this.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 35 presented by the minister I believe 
all parties are in agreement with this motion and that it should pose 
no difficulty.
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 36, of course I will be supporting. It 
was put in on very sound information; I put this motion in. We 
believe this provides reasonable protection for the interest of utility 
companies.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	We had a lot of input on this. I have spoken with several of the 
hon. members from the other side. This is where I hope we do not 
get into what we have found in the past where individually they all 
agree with our position but collectively they vote opposite our 
position.
<P>
	I hope they will give this due consideration and in the end decide 
to vote with the interests of the public. This is not in the interest of 
one or two companies. This is in  the interest of the general public, 
the interest we are trying to protect with this motion.
<P>
	Likewise, Motion No. 37 continues the same.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Okanagan Centre mentioned Motion 
No. 38 with regard to the Liberals' indication that they are not 
supporting Atlantic Canada with Motion No. 25, for which they 
have already indicated no support. This motion asks for a provision 
to continue the CN line from Montreal to Halifax for a period of 
five years.
<P>
	Under Bill C-89, the CN privatization, I brought this up at the 
committee level. I asked for a 10 year of continuance at that time. 
The port authority from Halifax came forward and made a very 
sound and logical argument as to why this should be considered.
<P>
	This is not something that goes against anyone. It is simply an 
assurance that they will have a period of time to get financing for 
the necessary infrastructure improvements for post-Panamax 
vessels in place with an assurance that there is a rail line in place to 
carry their goods to central Canada and the American mid-west. 
With the use of the CN line and the Sarnia tunnel the port of 
Halifax is superior to anything in the New England states or in New 
York.
<P>
	We are moving to a deregulatory privatization or 
commercialization of the ports coming up very soon in the new 
year. The former Minister of Transport put us on notice of that in 
December.
<P>
	For an investor to look at the port of Halifax which under this 
new act will have to find money in the marketplace without 
government guarantees, any wise investor will say: ``What 
guarantee of return do I have on this? What happens if that line is 
taken out?''
<P>
	During committee study on this the head of CN Rail, Mr. Paul 
Tellier, came before us as a witness. He is required under this new 
act, when passed, to put out a three year outline of any line he 
proposes to sell off or abandon. I said: ``If you are to project for 
three years obviously you have to look beyond that, four or five or 
possibly beyond that. I ask you now in keeping with that, can you 
tell us if you have any plans over the next five years to abandon the 
rail between Montreal and Halifax''. His answer was an emphatic 
no. It is not a hardship on CN.
<P>
	Some hon. members opposite, particularly when I raised this on 
Bill C-89, said: ``This is unbelievable, the Reform Party interfering 
in the private marketplace by trying to put a restriction on a private 
company what it can or cannot do with its rail line''.
<P>
	Not only the Liberals but all governments for the past 80 years 
have interfered with the marketplace with CN Rail. It has caused 
most of the problems that we now have in our rail industry.
<P>
	It is unreasonable after 80 years of interference for the 
government to arbitrarily cut the string with no  transition period. A 
five year transition period is incredibly minimal, does not hurt 
anyone, does not hurt CN, and does not cost the government 
money. This is a win-win situation. I hope this time hon. members 
will support Atlantic Canada and give it this necessary provision so 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1096"> 1096 </A></B>
<P>
Atlantic Canada can become a shipping giant on the North 
American east coast and also a big boon for CN. It guarantees that 
traffic having come into Halifax must then be shipped on a 
Canadian rail system. I seriously ask them to consider their 
position on this one to make it non-partisan to support Atlantic 
Canada. All of Atlantic Canada will be watching.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Moving on to Motion No. 39, this motion by the hon. member 
from the NDP attempts to subvert the main purpose and intent of 
this bill. It carries on through Motions Nos. 40 to 55. Each of these 
in essence are amendments which attempt to defeat the entire bill.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that these are not supportable. He 
can vote against the bill as we may depending on what the Liberals 
do with certain very controversial clauses in this bill which we will 
be debating later on. However as the bill stands, I will not support 
these motions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for greater clarity in regard to the unanimous consent that 
was given some 10 minutes ago where the motions are all deemed 
to have been read, I believe that for the purpose of the record it 
should have been said at the time that Motions Nos. 2, 28, 29 and 
30 should have been deemed to have been moved by the hon. 
member for Mackenzie and deemed to have been seconded by the 
hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle.
<P>
	Motion No. 31 should have been deemed to have been moved by 
the hon. member for Blainville-Deux-Montagnes and deemed to 
have been seconded by the hon. member for Louis-Hébert.
<P>
	Motion No. 32 should have been deemed to have been moved by 
the hon. member for Mackenzie, seconded by the hon. member for 
Regina-Qu'Appelle.
<P>
	Motion No. 35 should have been deemed moved by the Minister 
of Transport, seconded by the minister of fisheries.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 36, 37 and 38 should have been deemed moved by 
the hon. member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke, seconded by the 
member for Calgary Centre.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 39 to 55 should have been deemed to have been 
moved by the hon. member for Mackenzie and seconded by the 
hon. member for Regina-Qu'Appelle.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the chief government 
whip. I believe that procedurally now the table officers and 
everyone else can rest comfortably. We are up to speed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support the concept that drives all of the motions which are before 
the House in this grouping, namely that the act should apply to 
main lines equally as it applies to branch lines. The abandonment 
of a main line would fall under the same requirements of the 
abandonment of a branch line.
<P>
	This was a shortcoming in the previous act. Had the previous act 
recognized that railways may someday want to abandon main lines, 
the motion today by my hon. friend from Saint John would not have 
been required because no one foresaw that the main line to her 
region was in fact abandoned. No one had taken that into account 
and the act ignored the problem.
<P>
	I am from the province of Saskatchewan which is crossed by 
four main line railways. The farmers and shippers who use those 
main lines would like to have some assurance that the railways 
could not just willy-nilly abandon those main lines, that they would 
have to submit to some sort of process.
<P>
<B>(1050 )</B>
<P>
	These rather detailed amendments do in fact outline a process 
which would require those railways before abandonment to show 
their costs and their losses. They would have to make a case for 
why they think they have to abandon these lines. Those numbers 
would be made public so that the shippers and users of those lines 
would have access to them in trying to make their case for 
maintaining the line to the agency which will make the final 
decision.
<P>
	With regard to the one or two amendments that refer to provinces 
and provincial governments being involved, you are darn right they 
have to be involved, Mr. Speaker. They are the ones who are going 
to have to pick up the slack and pay for the cost of the highways 
and the road system to take the place of the abandoned railway.
<P>
	I make no apologies for having those requirements in there. I 
think the concept of railways wanting to abandon main lines is for 
some reason in a state of denial in this place, in spite of the fact that 
pieces of main lines have been abandoned and are being considered 
for abandonment and resale. I hope most members of the House 
will agree that those requirements of railways for abandoning 
stretches of a main line should be precisely the same requirements 
as we put them through when they abandon a branch line.
<P>
	Just because the government members and the Department of 
Transport are in a state of denial saying that railways will never 
abandon main lines does not mean it should not be in the bill. I note 
the case by the member for Saint John where a main line was 
abandoned. There have been proposals to abandon slices of main 
line in northern Ontario. There are proposals to abandon here and 
there. We have service across the prairie region for collecting grain 
of four main lines.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1097"> 1097 </A></B>
<P>
	When we look at any of the maps into the future, most of the 
railways are considering having to abandon some of those main 
lines. If they are going to be doing that, then the restrictions on 
abandoning a main line should at least be equivalent to the 
restrictions applied to abandoning a branch line.
<P>
	I cannot see why some of the members would go into a state of 
denial by simply putting forward the same requirements for 
abandoning a piece of main line as we already have accepted for a 
number of years should apply to abandoning a branch line.
<P>
	I would hope that those members who have already stated their 
position would reconsider. They are doing the communities served 
by what are known now as main lines a disservice if Bill C-14, the 
bill that will guide the transportation future of this country does not 
contain such clauses.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I wonder if we could seek unanimous 
consent to have me speak very briefly on this same set in response 
to what the hon. member has just mentioned. There are other 
members who perhaps can talk on this but I can keep it very short 
and succinct and address from the committee's perspective why it 
has taken the position it has for the enlightenment of the member 
who just spoke.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is there unanimous consent.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, under the former system, rail abandonment took place 
after the railroad could prove financial hardship. Therefore, any 
rail company that wanted to abandon a railroad first made 
absolutely certain it had financial hardship, even though it may not 
have existed. I have spoken to the rail companies and they will 
never admit this on record but it is undeniable.
<P>
	What the rail companies do is they first demarcate the line. In the 
case of a rail line abandonment in my own riding they wrote a 
confidential trucking contract to a reload centre so that the 
customer would be gone and would not exist on that rail line.
<P>
	The second thing is they do absolute minimal maintenance. They 
do not break any safety standards but they do the minimal 
maintenance which may mean running their cars at half loads, at 
five kilometres an hour over the track so that it requires prohibitive 
capital investment if someone else were to come in or if they were 
ordered to continue to operate that line. Ultimately, they get 
abandonment but by that time no short line operator in their right 
mind is going to come in and buy this line that needs this 
tremendous capital infusion and has no customers.
<P>
	The intent of the new abandonment procedures contained in the 
bill is to ensure that does not happen. As  the hon. member has 
suggested, if they start putting all kinds of restrictions and 
prohibitions in the way of the rail companies, they would simply 
revert to the old system and we will not get any short line 
development in this country.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	The new system allows a rail company to sell off a line or 
abandon it. It is the company's choice. The company first has to 
offer the line, market it publicly by a set series of advertisements 
and a time parameter set out in this bill. If it does not find a 
customer, it then has to offer it to the federal government, then the 
provincial government, then the local government at net salvage 
value without first demarcating and running the line into the 
ground.
<P>
	The bill will enhance the viability of any lines considered for 
abandonment. I have talked to short line operators who are eager to 
expand their networks and to increase-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The House 
granted the hon. member the right to explain why he opposed the 
inclusion of main lines in the legislation. He has not once 
mentioned main lines. He has dealt with branch lines. He has not 
fulfilled the promise in his remarks. I suggest we should move on 
or have him get to the topic.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I can only apply the rules of 
the House. Unanimous consent was granted. Certainly that is 
available to each and every member at any occasion. I remind the 
House we only have a few minutes before we move on to members' 
statements and question period.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mackenzie respectfully was engaging in 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will wrap this up and address-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Althouse:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a new point of order. 
Perhaps I was not clear enough. The reason the House granted the 
member the right to additional remarks was for him to clarify the 
position on main lines. He has not once mentioned main lines and 
I-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again we are engaging in 
debate. With the greatest respect to all members of the House, the 
Chair does not grant unanimous consent; the membership, the 
House itself, grants one of its members unanimous consent. The 
Chair cannot withdraw that unanimous consent.
<P>
	With the greatest of respect again, the hon. member for 
Mackenzie has a point a view but which very respectfully is not a 
point of order.
<P>
	I see The Speaker is now here and I assume we will now proceed 
to members' statements and question period. I will be back 
following that and we will resume the debate at report stage.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration announced 
the establishment of four centres of excellence for research on 
immigration and integration.
<P>
	Located in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver, these 
centres represent the combined talents of 15 of Canada's leading 
universities. Their objective is to examine the impact of 
immigration on cities around the world and to identify the best 
ways to promote successful integration. Their partners include 
local community groups, private sector organizations, international 
experts and governments at all levels.
<P>
	A number of federal departments and agencies are collaborating 
to fund this visionary project because it has enormous practical 
applications in city planning, health services, housing and 
education to mention a few. Numerous countries will watch and 
learn from the work done at these centres which are Canada's major 
contribution to the international Metropolis research project.

	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday I heard the president of the Mining Association 
of Canada testify before the natural resources committee. I was 
sorry to hear him say that the mining industry remains very 
disappointed at the pace of improving federal mining regulations.
<P>
	The media claim that the natural resources minister wants 
binding timelines for environmental reviews. That would be a good 
start, but many other improvements are needed.
<P>
	As a Liberal member of the committee pointed out, mining 
approvals in our NAFTA partner, Mexico, commonly take six 
months. In Canada it can take two to ten years.
<P>
	I supported the committee's interim report on improving mining 
regulations which was tabled in December. The government is 
allowed 150 days to produce a believable response. I urge the 
government to use its time well and be able to announce it has 
achieved clarity, promptness and certainty in mining regulations, 
not just more good intentions tied up in government red tape.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, our country is about to close its doors to refugees who 
travel through the United States to get here, which is approximately 
one-third of refugee claimants.
<P>
	The proposed Canada-U.S. agreement allows for the returning of 
a refugee to whichever of the two countries they had reached first. 
The U.S. has a sorry record when it comes to dealing with refugees, 
especially those from South and Central America. It has a record of 
rejecting and refouling 98 per cent of refugee claimants from El 
Salvador and Guatemala. Amnesty International has warned that 
the U.S. is not a safe destination for refugees.
<P>
	This proposed agreement is just another example of the 
downsizing to the lowest common denominator. It strips away 
compassion from our society. It abrogates our moral responsibility 
to those fellow human beings fleeing danger and persecution. It 
makes our country less.
<P>
	This agreement will be signed by a Liberal government that in 
opposition strenuously opposed this measure. Concerned 
Canadians would say, shame to this government.

<P>
	Revenue Canada claims that these people were not entitled to the

to trace Canadian based subsidiaries? Now it is a hardship on these

own tax act? Another argument for a simplified tax system.
<P>
	Let us not complain. In a way, the government may be doing us a 
favour. It is saying that if an individual has obtained moneys from 
the taxpayers improperly then the money must be paid back with 
interest and penalties.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Supreme Court of Canada brought down a landmark 
decision concerning voluntary intoxication in murder trials, in 
connection with the McMaster, Robinson and Lemky cases. The 
judges of the highest court have decided that, in future, an accused 
may more easily use a state of intoxication to reduce murder 
charges.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Justice not agree that making it easier for an 
accused to plead voluntary intoxication is deplorable?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, no. When read properly, I suggest 
the judgments that were released yesterday simply confirm the 
practice in most Canadian courts already. It clarifies the 
instructions to be given to a jury in cases where the defence of 
intoxication is raised and makes technical adjustments to the way 
the law is put to juries in such cases.
<P>
	What is most important of all is that there are some crimes in the 
Criminal Code that by their very definition require the formation of 
specific intent. That is just the state of the law. If one is incapable 
of forming that intent, it is clear that one cannot be convicted of 
that crime.
<P>
	However, it is also true that by reason of the statute that was 
passed by the House of Commons last year with the support of 
parties opposite, we made it clear that if you intoxicate yourself 
voluntarily and then commit a crime of violence toward another 
you cannot escape criminal liability.
<P>
	That is the effect of Bill C-72 and the state of the law in Canada 
today.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, does 
the Minister of Justice not agree that the Supreme Court has quite 
simply made murder more  commonplace, by making it possible 
from now on for murderers who were intoxicated to get out of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1102"> 1102 </A></B>
<P>
prison earlier, because being found guilty of involuntary homicide 
will make them eligible for release after serving only one third of 
their sentences?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again I cannot agree with the 
suggestion made by the hon. member.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada yesterday did not change the law 
with respect to liability for murder. It simply clarified the technical 
instructions that judges must give to juries in cases where the 
defence of intoxication is raised.
<P>
	In manslaughter the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. It 
is open to the court in the facts of any given case, and the 
circumstances can vary widely, to determine the appropriate 
sentence. Sometimes that will not involve incarceration as in the 
recent case in Hamilton where a woman took the life of her 
terminally ill husband. In those circumstances the court felt that in 
that manslaughter case, incarceration was not appropriate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the beginning of his mandate, the Minister of Justice has done no 
more than pass legislation piecemeal. Here are a few examples of 
this: Daviault, DNA, genital mutilation.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Justice shoulder his responsibilities 
and propose the appropriate measures?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the foundation of the hon. 
member's question is an interpretation of these judgments that I do 
not share. So we start from different points of departure.
<P>
<B>(1120 )</B>
<P>
	With reference to her suggestion that our approach has been 
piecemeal, in the case of Daviault the House at the initiative of the 
government took specific steps to deal with the decision that we 
thought resulted in a criminal law that was inappropriate. There 
should be responsibility for acts of violence committed when one 
induces one's own intoxication.
<P>
	In other instances we have taken a very comprehensive 
approach, for example in Bill C-41 where we comprehensively 
reformed the whole structure of the sentencing process in the 
criminal law, and as in Bill C-68 where we entirely took a new and 
comprehensive approach toward the control of firearms.
<P>
	Our approach has been responsible, it has been coherent and it 
has been effective.

There has yet to be a resolution in one particular matter. It would be 
very wrong for me to comment in any way on the substance 
because I may prejudice the examination and the judicial process.
<P>
	My parliamentary secretary really hit the nail on the head 
yesterday in answering a similar question from the official 
opposition. All manner of procedures can be put in place, all 
manner of regulations can be put in place, but people sometimes 
commit errors of judgment.

its broken GST promise, $50 million a year, $200 million a year, 
$500 million a year?
<P>
	The government is so desperate to whitewash its promise on the 
GST, perhaps to save the political career of the Deputy Prime

the GST when it clearly promised to save taxpayer dollars and kill,

<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International

interested in the speculation in the press reports. We are interested, 
however, in negotiations with the provinces to harmonize the GST.
<P>
	I know members across the way will be very disappointed when 
we are successful in harmonizing the GST because they will not 
have any questions to ask any more.
<P>
	The report the hon. member refers to is pure speculation.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
unfortunate part is that the Liberals used to be interested in 
scrapping it when they sat on this side of the House before they 
formed the government in 1993.
<P>
	It is evident here that desperate men do desperate things.

They will not be fooled by talk of harmonization.
<P>
	The government is so desperate that it willing to spend 
truckloads of taxpayer dollars to get the Atlantic on side. When the 
minister says the rest of the Canadian public will harmonize 
gleefully, he is dreaming. The government is so desperate that the 
Prime Minister might just pop up in Etobicoke North on Saturday 
right at the end of the campaign.

of the red book again for the hon. member and so I will not do so.
<P>
	I will, however, quote from a minority report of the Reform 
Party: ``While the replacement goes part of the way in responding 
to concerns presented to the committee, many of the concerns will 
only be addressed by future negotiations with the provinces''.
<P>
	That is what we are doing. We are negotiating with the provinces 
and we will harmonize the GST. I know the Reform Party will be 
disappointed.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
provinces will certainly talk about harmonization; their answer will 
be no. They want no part of harmonization. They made it very 
clear.
<P>
	When the government talks about page 22 of the red book, that it 
will replace the GST, it is the same letters, the same meaning. GST 
perhaps means ``give Sheila time''. How much time does the 
Deputy Prime Minister need?
<P>

would increase funding for summer jobs for students to $120

<P>
million. Curiously enough, the  amounts allocated by the 
government add up to $105.65 million and not $120 million, a 
$14.35 million shortfall. How can the minister explain this 
shortfall in his release concerning summer jobs for students?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should send 
me a copy of the press release he is referring to. All I can tell him is 
that, this year, we managed, with the finance minister's help, to 
contribute another $60 million to the creation of summer jobs for 
students.
<P>
	In total, $120 million will be spent this summer on jobs for 
young people attending post-secondary institutions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the minister 
is cutting post-secondary education in Quebec by $150 million this 
year alone, how can he brag about doubling to $120 million the 
amount allocated to summer jobs for students, when the former 
Conservative government used to spend more than $180 million a 
year?
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the amount distributed to 
post-secondary institutions still falls under the responsibility of the 
provinces. Of course, some of the money comes from the Canadian 
government through transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	How this money is managed is up to each province, since we do 
not want to interfere in areas of provincial jurisdiction. If he hon. 
member is suggesting that we revert to the ways of the old 
administration, I can only tell him not to hold his breath, because 
we have no intention of acting as the former Tory government did 
for nine years, from 1984 to 1993.

officials from Ottawa, Victoria and the Nisga'a people are 
scheduled to sign the Nisga'a land claim agreement today.
<P>
	However, there is widespread opposition to the radical 
constitutional precedent which will be set here. There has been 
insufficient meaningful consultation with all of the people who will 
be affected by this agreement.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and

<P>
	Prior to this agreement in principle, over 200 public meetings 
were held, a number of open houses, a number of consultations to 
keep all of the interested parties totally posted on the process 
involved.
<P>
	As I am sure the hon. member knows, the negotiators will 
continue to ensure that public information is available and that the

this is a major move forward in the history of the country, one I am

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
it is very interesting that the minister believes there has been 
consultation.
<P>
	Here is what a forestry industry representative from the treaty 
negotiations advisory committee said about the process: ``I cannot 
say we worked on this document because we never saw any of it 
until February 15, just hours before it was signed; not one page, not 
one paragraph''.

today is the agreement in principle.
<P>
	There have been consultations and public information processes 
conducted up to this point. That process will continue. In the public

through to a successful conclusion. Obviously further consultation 
which is a part of the process is necessary to ensure that successful

Notre-Dame-de-Grâce stated: ``We do not believe it is reasonable 
to deport legitimate refugee claimants to the U.S. on the

objected to any reciprocal arrangement as long as legislation in 
both countries had not been harmonized.

legislation that would affect this kind of case in the United States 
would be rather technical and lengthy.
<P>
	If there are specific parts of the American legislation that she 
would want to be made familiar with I am sure my colleague, the 
minister of immigration, would be very pleased to prepare a 
package of information and allow for a briefing to be held so that 
she could be familiar with the American legislation.

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, last week, 
in her testimony before the Standing Committee on Citizenship and 
Immigration, the minister suggested that the arrangement was 
about to be finalized. However, the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Refugees in Canada told the same standing 
committee just the opposite regarding the harmonization of this 
legislation.
<P>
	Does this mean that the minister now condones U.S. practices 
that contravene the international convention relating to the status of 
refugees, for instance, automatically returning Cubans and Haitians 
to their country of origin without even having established whether 
or not they are legitimate refugees?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that we can all agree that 
the refugee determination rules vary greatly from country to 
country. The approaches taken by various countries are often very 
different.
<P>
	In response to the hon. member's question dealing specifically 
with the approach taken by the Government of Canada, over the 
years, we have always seen our role as that of one of the most 
welcoming countries in the world for refugees. As Canadians, we 
have a duty to keep playing this humanitarian role we have played 
on many occasions already.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is to the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	There has been a shroud of secrecy over the Nisga'a deal. The 
process has been manipulated by the politicians and taken out of 
the hands of Canadians.
<P>
	Nisga'a members have said they did not even know they were to 
vote on this agreement. They were invited to  an informational 
meeting. The vote was by show of hands instead of a secret ballot. 
This is not democracy, it is a fraud.
<P>
	Will the government respond to these disturbing allegations and 
resubmit the deal to the Nisga'a people for real consultation and for 
a real vote?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, again on behalf of my colleague, 
the minister of Indian affairs, the hon. member will know that in 
this process of dealing with this settlement we have been 
negotiating with representatives of the Nisga'a who are 
democratically elected under their own processes every year.
<P>
	Given the very broad scope and importance of the negotiations, 
some disagreement within the Nisga'a community is naturally to 
be expected. The agreement in principle ratification by the Nisga'a 
was an internal process which the Nisga'a have designed for 
themselves to inform and seek the support of their constituents.
<P>
	After the final steps are taken in the development of a final 
agreement on the land settlement, that final agreement must be 
formally ratified according to a formula that calls for 50 per cent 
plus 1 of eligible Nisga'a voters.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, once the agreement is ratified today it will be very 
difficult to change anything.
<P>
	This agreement in principle will encode different treatment of 
Canadians based on race, different constitutional status based on 
race, different taxes based on race. If this is put into the 
Constitution Canadians will never again be one people. We will be 
permanently divided by race. This will affect our children and our 
grandchildren, all of us.
<P>
	On behalf of all Canadians, will the government postpone the 
signing of this agreement until a broad consultation of all 
Canadians has occurred? This is too important to leave in the hands 
of a few politicians. Postpone it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all 
Canadians, I congratulate the parties who after decades of 
unresolution have finally reached an agreement which should be

	When the aboriginal people were driven off their lands and when 
the aboriginal people were put into a situation that was not of their

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Acting Prime Minister.
<P>
	On February 16, Canada and the United States reached an 
agreement in principle on softwood lumber. The five year 
agreement seeks to restrict Canadian softwood lumber exports to 
the U.S. It provides for an increase in stumpage fees in Quebec, 
Ontario and Alberta, and for the implementation of a quota system 
of sorts in British Columbia.
<P>
	Does the minister realize that letting British Columbia set up 
such a system violates the free trade agreement itself, which is 
precisely based on the elimination of control measures at the 
border?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member obviously knows that the question he is 
posing is based on a false premise and a false fact.
<P>
	The reality is that agreements have been negotiated with the 
provinces. Their interests have been totally taken into account. 
Negotiation is now simply being worked out in detail between the 
representative spokespersons for the two countries.
<P>
	The hon. member might want to go back and check what he is 
saying because it does not relate to truth.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not 
question the fact that this was done in co-operation with the 
provinces. We question the federal government's approval of new 
barriers in a free trade context. The federal government was ill 
advised in that regard. If you set up barriers, it is no longer a free 
trade environment. At first it was wheat, and now it is softwood 
lumber.
<P>
	Will the minister recognize that the current agreement will not 
solve anything, since Americans are still not happy with the 
concessions made so far, and will he also recognize that his 
government is opening the door to similar agreements in other 
economic sectors?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the whole point of having the agreement is to allow us to 
have a process through which we can work out agreements so that 
trade can flow.
<P>
	There is not some kind of arbitrary ideological perfect world. 
The reason the NAFTA agreement was put into place was to ensure 
that the immense flow of commerce between the two countries can 
be organized by a set  rules, a set of practices and a set of 
institutions. The minister of trade is using those rules and those 
practices to negotiate a deal that will allow us to continue the very 
lucrative and very important trade with the United States in 
softwood lumber.

	<B>Mr. Collenette:</B> These questions were answered yesterday by

that an incident occurred last weekend at Gagetown and we view 
any incident as described to be quite serious. The matter is being 
investigated not by me but by the military police. The hon. member

system works. When the matter is fully investigated, then the 
judicial proceedings will take place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Hart (Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the sad reality is that the minister only acts when

<P>

are not participants in these activities nor do they condone these 
activities.
<P>
	Today the base commander declared that he has no explanation 
on how to prevent these incidents.
<P>
	This is beyond hazing. This is about the chain of command in the

want to know.

<P>
	As my parliamentary secretary said yesterday, the very good 
procedures that have been put in place especially as a result of 
some problems we have had in recent years cannot always be seen 
to be working if certain people in the forces display errors in 
judgment. There is very little we, the chief of the defence staff and

<P>
	Given the government's continued political and moral

	Will the Minister of Justice commit today to act to ensure that 
killers cannot use drunkenness as a way to escape the justice that 
is due to them? Will he do it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think it is far better to take the 
supreme court judgments and read them rather than misread them. 
If that is done, one will know that the organizing principle of the 
criminal law in Canada is that those who do harm to others are held 
accountable for their misconduct.
<P>
	I was very grateful to the hon. member last year when he stood 
with others to support the government's initiative to change the 
Criminal Code by Bill C-72, and ensure that those who intoxicate 
themselves are held accountable in the criminal law. That is the law 
of Canada today.
<P>
	The judgments yesterday, if one goes beyond the headlines and 
looks at the substance of what was done, simply clarified the 
technical elements of charges to the jury, when juries, people from 
our communities, have to decide whether someone was able to 
form the specific intent to murder. If they were not, then they are 
culpable for manslaughter which is punishable by life 
imprisonment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, stable waste has reached a new height in this Chamber. 
Canadians have lost all faith in the justice system and they are 
looking to Parliament to restore some of that faith.
<P>
	I ask again, so that Canadians can be sure that the justice system 
is going to work to protect the victims of crime and protect 
Canadians from becoming victims, will the minister do something 
to ensure that killers will not escape justice by simply claiming 
they were drunk? Will he do it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my perception that Canadians 
have not lost confidence in the justice system. Canadians are losing 
confidence in politicians who engage in sloganeering and 
fearmongering for narrow partisan purposes.
<P>
	The hon. member must allow himself to at least be distracted by 
some of the objective facts. I suggest that when he does that, when 
he takes his eyes from his slogan filled question sheet and looks at 
the judgments of the court and the reality of the law, he will see that 
those who commit the crime of taking another life in this country, 
intoxicated or not, are held accountable in the criminal law.

	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	As the minister must be aware, the moving of the some 50 jobs 
of the income security program from Regina to Winnipeg has 
become a major issue. The cost of the move could climb as high as 
$2.6 million and will certainly result in the deterioration of services 
to seniors and the disabled in Saskatchewan. Will the minister 
rescind this move of jobs from Regina to Winnipeg, a move that 
will squander scarce dollars?
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand the concerns. The 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has expressed his views on 
this matter. The decision was made some time ago.
<P>
	The number of jobs that are actually affected and that would be 
moved are less than half of the number attributed to this situation 
by the hon. member in his question.
<P>
	Any job that is being rearranged is always the grounds for great 
concern. I want to assure the hon. member that the purpose of 
making changes throughout the delivery system of human 
resources development is to improve service and to manage those 
scarce dollars, to which the hon. member referred, in the best way 
possible.
<P>
	The department will be doing some work in Regina that is new, 
that is innovative, that will support the people to whom the hon. 
member has referred and that will actually increase the number of 
jobs in that sector.
<P>
	There will always be an ongoing exchange of responsibilities 
and jobs, but in the final analysis, money will be spent wisely and 
as fairly and equitably as it can be to workers in all of the provinces 
of Canada.

is for the Minister of Transport.
<P>
	Can the minister inform the House if his department has 
undertaken an investigation of reports of failure in rear door latches 
on certain Chrysler minivans and if the Department of Transport 
has the authority to order automobile manufacturers to conduct an 
immediate recall of all automobiles found to have safety hazards?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for his concern 
about safety which is the primary duty of Transport Canada and its 
main responsibility.
<P>
	With respect to the question of all issues relating to automobile 
safety, investigations of accidents are carried out for all categories 
of motor vehicles so that a safer fleet can be created.
<P>
	More stringent standards have been applied to minivans. In 1994 
roof strength standards were introduced and next year a slide 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1110"> 1110 </A></B>
<P>
protection standard is  proposed for the 1997 model year. This 
spring the rear door latch regulation for the 1998 model year will 
be introduced.
<P>
	As you can see, Mr. Speaker, there has been a continuous 
improvement through regulation for safety of minivans.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADATRANSPORTATIONACT">CANADA TRANSPORTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-14, an act to 
continue the National Transportation Agency as the Canadian 
Transportation Agency, to consolidate and revise the National 
Transportation Act, 1987 and the Railway Act and to amend or 
repeal other acts as a consequence, as reported (with amendments) 
from the committee; and motions Nos. 2, 28 to 32 and 35 to 55.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I see the hon. member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke rising. Before he resumes his 
intervention and just to situate us all, the hon. member for 
Mackenzie had a response in terms of the unanimous consent that 
was granted. I think the words from the hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke were to the effect that he asked the House for a 
``brief intervention''.
<P>
	I would remind the hon. member of the sensitivities that have 
been raised by other members so that we could pursue this debate at 
report stage. I would ask him to please keep that in mind in his 
closing remarks on this intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will make it extremely brief. I have actually finished 
except to comment on the intervention by the hon. member from 
the NDP.
<P>
	When I spoke, I spoke not of branch lines or specifically of main 
lines, I spoke of railway lines. It does not matter if it is main lines, 
branch lines or the line that the hon. member gave you, his motion 
subverts the whole intent of this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I am a little confused. One 
moment no one is rising. The very next moment everyone is rising. 
Let us start all over.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the intent of our Motion No. 31 is to improve clause 141 
of the bill, which we support entirely and which we aim simply to 
improve.
<P>
	The clause in question is very short, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A railway company shall prepare and keep up to date a plan indicating for 
each of its railway lines whether it intends to continue to operate the line or 
whether, within the next three years, it intends to sell, lease or otherwise transfer 
the line-or take steps to discontinue operating the line.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This clause is all the more needed, because, up to now, under the 
present legislation, when a railway company wished to stop 
operations or sell or lease its facilities, public hearings were held 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1112"> 1112 </A></B>
<P>
by the National Transportation  Agency. This is no longer the case, 
and this discrepancy will be covered by another of our motions.
<P>
	As regards Motion No. 31, which applies to the plan the 
companies are required to prepare, the aim of our amendment is to 
avoid untimely and premature changes to the plan proposed by the 
company, and the motion provides that: ``A plan prepared by a 
railway company that does not indicate the company's intention to 
discontinue operation of a line shall not be amended by the 
company for twelve months''. It is simple and is intended solely to 
improve the clause.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sorry that you were confused by 
those of us who were eager to enter into the debate. Just take it as 
an indication that we wish to represent our constituents with the 
kind of enthusiasm they have come to expect, at least from those on 
this side of the House.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	If I may, I would like to express the government's position on 
Motion No. 31. The government cannot support this motion. This 
requirement would unreasonably restrict the railway's ability to 
change its activities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	After hearing the witnesses in full deliberations, the standing 
committee reached a conclusion about amendments to the 
conveyance provisions of the bill including the time periods that 
the committee member considered appropriate. This side of the 
House values the deliberations of the committee and must agree 
with its decisions. Therefore, we cannot support this motion.
<P>
	On Motion No. 2, the section sets out a definition that 
differentiates between main lines and branch lines of the railways. 
The distinction provides the basis for a different treatment of main 
line and branch line tracks under other motions. There is no 
practical reason for treating main lines and branch lines differently. 
The government does not support this motion because a different 
treatment will discourage the formation of short line railways. I 
thank our colleague from Kootenay West-Revelstoke for 
supporting the government's position on this because it reflects the 
committee deliberations on the matter.
<P>
	With Motion No. 28, the proposal is redundant. The opening 
words of the section already allow for an ``interested person'' to 
present applications to the governor in council. Again the 
government cannot and will not support this motion.
<P>
	On Motion No. 29, I have already indicated that separate 
treatment of main line and branch line tracks for the purpose of sale 
or abandonment is unwarranted.  The government again supports 
the standing committee's reflections and amended versions of the 
conveyance provisions and therefore will not support the motion.
<P>
	On Motion No. 30, this would potentially require railways to 
have a plan available for inspection in every office since every line 
will be included in the plan, even those the railway intends to keep 
operating. In our view that would be excessive and an unwarranted 
burden on the railway. Again, I make reference to the standing 
committee's amended version of the conveyance provisions. Since 
the government supports the standing committee's deliberations, it 
will not support this motion.
<P>
	I now turn to Motion No. 32. The hon. member for Kootenay 
West-Revelstoke made reference to the government's or 
Parliament's concern for the Atlantic provinces in terms of linking 
them with the rest of Canada. That has been a tradition of policy 
development with this government and this party ever since 
Confederation. We keep those considerations very much in the 
forefront whenever we make pronouncements on legislation like 
this. I would not want the member to think or to attempt to convey 
the impression that members of the Liberal Party have forgotten 
their roots. The reason we are still very much acceptable in Atlantic 
Canada is precisely because we consider its needs and its interests 
first and always.
<P>
	After hearing witnesses on Motion No. 32 and after full 
deliberations, the standing committee reached a conclusion about 
the amendments on the conveyance provisions of the bill which I 
mentioned earlier. It did not support renewed regulation by the 
agency. Therefore, in support of the standing committee's amended 
version, the government will not support this motion.
<P>
	The government does not support Motion No. 36 because 
property negotiations generally occur on a case by case basis in the 
commercial world and are not placed in any uniform, regulatory 
scheme that the utilities propose to apply to the railways. Utilities 
face the same problems in their dealings with municipalities and 
other property owners. The utilities as property owners are under 
no similar obligations as to the timeliness or quality of easements 
that they must provide to other parties.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	If there are problems with the genuine transportation dimension 
to be addressed, the agency should assess them as a matter of 
course in its annual review and with any amendments carried out at 
the time Bill C-14 goes through its final review.
<P>
	On Motion No. 37, I can offer the same kind of rationale. 
Therefore I can advise the House that the government will not 
support this motion.
<P>
	On Motion No. 38, the government cannot and does not support 
this amendment because it runs contrary to one of the main thrusts 
of the bill, which is to allow  railways to rationalize their network 
as commercial transactions. The best way to assure the continued 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1113"> 1113 </A></B>
<P>
operation of the CN Halifax to Montreal line is to allow an 
unfettered rationalization of underutilized track.
<P>
	I consider Motions Nos. 39 through 55 as one in the interests of 
time and offer the comment that would apply to all of them. I hope 
that members of the House will accept that the government does 
not support any of Motions Nos. 39 through 55 because Bill C-14 
recognizes, as I said earlier, that railways are commercial 
enterprises and must have the freedom to adjust their networks 
under change of conditions. I can further add that these motions 
would require the railway whose lines are uneconomical to operate 
them without being compensated for losses. This would be in direct 
conflict with the existing national transportation policy. I repeat 
that the government will not support Motions Nos. 39 through 55.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to take a moment today to speak to a few 
issues relating to Motion No. 35.
<P>
	To provide some background, the present Railway Act is a piece 
of virtually historic legislation. It provides railway companies with 
their own independent powers to expropriate land. This dates from 
the era when railways were used for the purpose of nation building 
when just about any government would make just about any deal to 
achieve the construction of a railway. Under the Railways Act, 
private land can be taken by the railways. However the Indian Act 
requires that governor in council approval is needed for taking of 
reserve lands.
<P>
	Over the years statute for water related facilities like ports and 
bridges, although not rail or transportation, adopted the 
expropriation provisions of the Railway Act. This means that other 
private companies and some public corporations can also use the 
Railway Act as an expropriation mechanism to take private and 
reserve lands pursuant to the wording of other acts.
<P>
	Bill C-14 is primarily a transportation bill and it cannot advance 
measures that potentially set important precedents with respect to 
aboriginal rights. That having been said, the bill does attempt to 
address some of the longstanding problems which are found in the 
Railway Act with respect to reserve expropriation. It also attempts 
to address several other issues which are of interest to aboriginal 
peoples.
<P>
	First, the bill eliminates the private expropriation power of 
railway companies. These companies in future will have to apply to 
the Minister of Transport following which the provisions of the 
government's Expropriation Act will be the governing statute 
rather than the Railway Act, which is to be repealed with the 
passage of Bill C-14. Other private interests and some public 
corporations would, like railway companies, also fall under this 
expropriation mechanism and would lose under the Railway Act 
approach the rights that they now have.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	Second, the new sale and discontinuance process under Bill C-14 
requires that if a private sale of a line cannot be made, federal, 
provincial and municipal governments will sequentially have 30 
days to exercise an option to purchase the line for no more than the 
net salvage value.
<P>
	Initially under former Bill C-101 from the first session of this 
Parliament, the federal option applied only if the line crossed a 
provincial or international boundary. During the review of the 
former bill, the Standing Committee on Transport approved an 
amendment which expands the federal option to include reserve 
lands. This amendment is being made to address the concerns 
which have been expressed by some aboriginal groups that land in 
reserves over which rail lines pass might otherwise not be protected 
when the rail operations cease.
<P>
	Third, section 96 of Bill C-14 states that a railway company 
cannot alienate land taken from the crown, except to transfer the 
land for continuing railway operations or to transfer the land back 
to the crown. Following review by the standing committee, section 
97 of the bill was amended to indicate that nothing in this section 
would be construed to negate any pre-existing right or interest that 
anyone might have in the lands transferred under this section. That 
of course includes aboriginal rights.
<P>
	Fourth, amended section 145 with one further proposed 
amendment will require an offer to the minister of any line or 
portion of a line which passes through land that is or was part of a 
reserve or that occupies land which is affected by land claims, 
provided the minister or the railway's owner have entered into 
agreement for the minister to recover the land.
<P>
	I believe that Bill C-14 as amended is further evidence of the 
efforts of the government to accommodate the special concerns of a 
particular group in our society in transportation policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do wish to present a few points in this debate. Most have 
already been made by my colleague for Mackenzie in whose name 
several of the amendments have been presented.
<P>
	We have been accused by the transportation critic of the Reform 
Party of trying to subvert the bill. Indeed we are. We feel that the 
bill before us does not meet the needs of Canadians and we make 
no apologies that as an opposition party we are opposing it. Had 
members of the Reform Party spent a little less time listening to 
bureaucrats in committee in Ottawa and gone to the prairies and to 
the back roads and listened to the people in the coffee shops, maybe 
they would have heard an entirely different requirement of how rail 
transportation should be dealt with.
<P>
	In essence, the bill is everything the railways want. It totally 
ignores the needs of the users. Let us not forget  that a tremendous 
amount of public money has gone into both of the major railways. 
There is a tremendous amount of public investment and public 
interest which has been backed up by Canadian tax dollars in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1114"> 1114 </A></B>
<P>
rail transportation system. The users, the public, the people of 
Canada have some legitimate rights on the question of rail 
transportation.
<P>
	That is why many of our amendments tried to create two classes 
of rail lines for the purposes of abandonment so that the main lines 
are considered in a separate category. These are not just the veins, 
they are the arteries of the system. We could lob off a finger and 
bits of pieces of the rail transportation system but when we start 
attacking the main line, we are attacking the essential structure of 
our transportation system. That is why many of our amendments 
tried to create two different categories for the purposes of 
abandonment.
<P>
	Among many other things we tried in the amendments to make it 
a little more user friendly. One example is Motion No. 30. The act 
now states that if there is a plan for abandonment, the railway 
company has to prepare and keep up to date a plan and they shall 
make the plan available for public inspection in offices of the 
company that it designates for that purpose. We want to make 
certain that the plan is also available in the affected communities 
and that the plan is not just tacked on a bulletin board in head office 
in Montreal and the local people have no idea what is going on.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	Our amendments are intended to make this act more user 
friendly, to protect the interests of the users, the communities, 
especially rural communities whether they are in the maritimes or 
in northern Quebec, Ontario, on the prairies or in the interior of 
British Columbia, communities that depend on the railway, that 
their interests are also taken into account, as they certainly are not 
in this present legislation. That is why we are opposing this 
legislation.
<P>
	It would be interesting as well to see how the Reform Party will 
end up voting on it. We are being accused of trying to sabotage a 
bill that I suspect the Reform Party in the end will also be voting 
against.

<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I have nine minutes to deal with ten motions, or a 
little than a minute per motion. I will therefore group them, starting 
with Motions Nos. 4, 9 and 14, which deal with the administration 
of railways and assign certain powers to the governor in council 
and the minister.
<P>
	These three clauses assign the power to appoint the chairperson 
and the vice-chairperson of the agency, to make orders on the steps 
to be taken in any extraordinary disruption to operations, other than 
a labour disruption, that would be contrary to the interests of users 
and operators, and thirdly, in No. 14, to appoint those who will 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1117"> 1117 </A></B>
<P>
review the act to determine whether it is properly  adapted to the 
situation, and to recommend amendments if required.
<P>
	We are in agreement with this, except that we want the 
government to have the possibility of doing what it always says it is 
going to do, yet never does, which is, if not to decentralize, to at 
least consult provincial authorities on issues that are of concern to 
them.
<P>
	That is the aim of Motions Nos. 4, 9 and 14, to associate the 
provinces in an advisory role with the exercise of these powers 
awarded to the governor in council and the minister, as well as to 
provide the agency with certain additional powers.
<P>
	Now, turning to Motion No. 17, which addresses clause 89, one 
so interesting and significant that I am going to read it, despite the 
time constraints:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>89. If the construction or operation of a railway is authorized by a Special Act 
passed by the legislature of a province-</BLOCKQUOTE>
If the construction is declared by an Act of Parliament to be ``a 
work for the general advantage of Canada, this Part-in other 
words, this act-applies to the railway to the exclusion of any 
general railway Act of the province and any provisions of the 
Special Act that are inconsistent with this Part''.
<P>
	Clearly, we cannot accept this, for it is such clear evidence of 
how the government is taking advantage of this bill to satisfy its 
appetite for swallowing up the powers of the provinces. Our 
amendment is aimed at modifying the situation by adding the 
words ``way is declared by an Act of Parliament, after obtaining the 
approval of the province concerned, to be''. This strikes us as both 
obvious and minimal.
<P>
	Now, moving to Motion No. 27, which is aimed at smooth 
continuity of services between the railway companies' systems and 
the short line railways. This is a text to be added after clause 138, 
which would give the short line railways the authority, for a fee of 
course, to operate on the facilities of the railway companies up to 
an interswitching point. This is the purpose of Motion No. 27, to 
ensure reciprocal rights for the short line railways equal to those 
given to the railways over them, which is totally justified.
<P>
	Passing to Motion No. 68 on arbitration, I shall read my 
comment on this. It is merely a clause to ensure cohesion, given the 
amendments we have proposed to clause 138. We are amending 
clause 160 to ensure conformity with the preceding amendment.
<P>
	I hope to have the time to say a couple of words on Motions Nos. 
72 and 73, which address clause 228. If it becomes necessary to 
expropriate land for the construction of a railway, the company 
may ask the minister to have the land expropriated. According to 
the bill:
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	``The Minister, with the consent of the Governor in Council, has 
the land expropriated''. The purpose of the amendment is to require 
the minister to also obtain the consent of the province concerned. It 
would be unreasonable for the situation to be otherwise, when we 
think of the provinces' responsibilities in the areas of urban 
planning and land use, as well as those of the municipalities under 
their jurisdiction.
<P>
	This way, the province will have some say in what is done with 
its land. The provinces are the ones most directly responsible for 
regional development and land use, and it is therefore logical for 
the federal government to obtain their consent.
<P>
	I think I have touched upon everything now.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will quickly touch on some of these grouped motions so 
it is very clear to everyone exactly where we stand.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mackenzie put a substantial number of 
amendments together. While we rejected the majority of them, we 
have carefully examined each one and will support those that are 
supportable. This is the same in the case of the Bloc Quebecois' 
amendments.
<P>
	We do not support Motion No. 4. This motion might be an aid in 
trying to prevent government patronage. We certainly are not in 
favour of supporting government patronage but unfortunately this 
motion would create such a stalemate that there would be a total 
lack of consensus within the CPA, which would basically grind it to 
a halt.
<P>
	We are also opposed to Motion No. 9. It is very vague and 
cumbersome in how the consultation would take place and would 
bog the entire thing down.
<P>
	We also oppose Motions Nos. 14 and 15. They are not necessary 
amendments.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 17 because it is very compatible with the 
Reform Party's constitutional proposals. These are changes that 
should take place on a much broader basis and certainly are within 
the scope of Bill C-17.
<P>
	Motion No. 27 deals primarily with running rights. As I 
explained, under the old problem of rail line abandonment, the 
railroads had to prove financial hardship. Therefore before they 
applied for abandonment they ensured they had financial hardship. 
This was contrary to the creation of short lines, an objective which 
we all wanted to see accomplished.
<P>
	If it is not feasible for a main federal railway to continue to 
operate a line we want to try to ensure whenever possible that a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1118"> 1118 </A></B>
<P>
short line operation would take it over and continue rail services to 
the various  communities on that line. If running rights are given to 
these short lines, they would take the customers of the former main 
line operator.
<P>
	The main line operator that sold this line could then be forced to 
carry the goods of its formers clients over its rail line. These new 
short line operators could connect with the main company's 
competitors and it would simply revert to the old process. The main 
line operator would demarket and reduce the maintenance on these 
lines so that they would be shut down rather than having a new 
short line operator running over its tracks, carrying its former 
client's goods to its competitors, interfering with its operating 
schedules and many other problems.
<P>
	I consulted with many of the short line operators in this country. 
With the exception of one I did not find any other operator that was 
interested in having these running rights. Therefore, we will not be 
supporting this motion.
<P>
	We support Motion No. 68. It clarifies jurisdiction.
<P>
	We oppose Motions Nos. 72 and 73 because certain things 
should be within federal jurisdiction, notwithstanding that we 
would like to see a lot of things taken from the federal government 
and given back to the provinces where they belong. The items 
covered under these two sections are not in that category. We 
should not be involving the provinces in something which is the 
clear responsibility of the federal government.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Health, Lib.):</B>Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague 
for Kootenay West-Revelstoke for his support not only of the 
government but of the standing committees of the House.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 proposes sharing with the provincial governments 
the power to designate the members of the agency to act as the 
chairperson and vice-chairperson of the agency. The proposal 
would mean that a provincial impasse could block the management 
and day to day operations of the agency. Accordingly, the 
government cannot support this motion.
<P>
	This also applies to Motion No. 9. It would introduce 
considerable procedural delays in the powers aimed at enabling the 
federal government to intervene quickly and effectively in the 
event of a transportation emergency.
<P>
	Motion No. 14 proposes giving an official role to the provincial 
governments in decisions on the way federal legislation is reviewed 
and the choice of persons to review it. This proposal would simply 
complicate and delay the review provided for by the act. Therefore, 
the government cannot support this motion.
<P>
	As regards Motion No. 15, the wording of the clause as it stands 
already provides for the consultation with the  provincial 
governments my colleague would like. There is, accordingly, no 
need to mention the provincial governments separately. Therefore, 
the government cannot support this motion.
<P>
	Motion No. 17 proposes limiting Parliament's ability to declare 
by act that a particular work is for the general advantage of Canada, 
in other words, that it comes under federal jurisdiction. We cannot 
support this motion.
<P>
	With respect to Motion No. 27, the existing railway companies 
have stated clearly that allowing secondary provincial railroads to 
operate on portions of federal lines would discourage the selling of 
tracks for secondary lines. This would go against one of the prime 
objectives of Bill C-14. It would simply cut the traffic and revenues 
of federal railway companies and deny them the opportunity to 
access other markets through the principle of competition. As you 
will understand, we cannot support this motion.
<P>
	As regards Motion No. 68, mutually acceptable commercial 
arrangements between federal railways and provincial secondary 
lines are vital to the successful operation of the secondary lines. 
Accordingly, an arrangement imposed by an outside arbitrator on 
the federal carrier and the secondary line would not promote long 
term co-operation. The government cannot support this motion.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 72 and 73 propose an official role for the 
provincial governments in the process of determining whether 
expropriation is to come under federal legislation. Existing 
legislation on expropriation already provides procedures for parties 
with an direct interest in the matter to be heard. These motions are 
not necessary, in our opinion, and the government supports neither 
Motion No. 72 nor Motion No. 73.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, I would like to deal first with motion No. 6 
which amends clause 27(2). Members of Parliament debate 
legislation in the House, they vote on it in the House and then the 
legislation is referred to a committee.
<P>
	I have to accept that they do this for some reason other than the 
exercise of carrying the paperwork out of the House up to another 
committee room and then back down to the House. I have to 
assume that they have some rationalization for doing this.
<P>
	Subject to being corrected by the Minister of Transport, who is 
no doubt going to speak to this, I  assume that in committee, when 
this is opened up for discussion and when witnesses have been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1120"> 1120 </A></B>
<P>
invited to come forward, they are going to listen to what those 
witnesses have to say.
<P>
	If 100 witnesses come in and five want this and seven want 
something else, then the committee has to make a decision.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	If 100 people come in and a significant majority of those people 
tell you there is something in that bill that is catastrophically 
harmful to them, you have to listen to them.
<P>
	If you do not, why did we go through the cost of transportation, 
costs of the meetings, the interpreters, the technical people, the 
research people, the clerk and tying up the time of the House and its 
members? Why do we bother to go through that exercise if we are 
not going to listen to the people who come before that committee?
<P>
	The strong majority of people who came before the committee 
said section 27(2) is a disaster. We cannot have it. It will cause us a 
tremendous amount of harm. They talk now of significant harm. It 
started as significant prejudice and now it is significant harm.
<P>
	They do not need to show significant harm later on by the actions 
of a rail contract, they are getting it from the government if section 
27(2) goes through. I believe that section 27(2) is very divisive on 
the government side. There are many members who have said they 
are rethinking this and who have some problems with it.
<P>
	That is why I tried this morning to find a face saving way for the 
government to take this off the table, take it back to committee in 
an all-party jurisdiction and agree to make these changes the 
majority of the witnesses who came before that committee asked 
for and then bring it back to the House. No holding their feet to the 
coals. No saying you were wrong, I was right, I forced you to do 
something.
<P>
	That was not my intent. I made it very clear I will try to find the 
most palatable way for them to make this change in the interest of 
democracy and in the interests of the shippers right across the 
country. They rejected that offer.
<P>
	I said I am not here to make political points. I am here to pass a 
bill that will satisfy the majority of Canadians affected by it. They 
did not avail themselves to that offer.
<P>
	When Bill C-101 was taken from the Order Paper because of 
prorogation Moya Greene, an assistant deputy ministers in the 
transport department, one I have a measure of respect for, called 
me in British Columbia and asked whether I would agree to 
unanimous consent to bring Bill C-101 back on the floor. I asked if 
section 27(2) had been taken away. She said: ``No. Why would you 
want it taken away?'' I said it is not acceptable to the majority of 
people who came before the committee. She  said: ``But we fixed it. 
We made amendments to it and we fixed it''.
<P>
	I made her perhaps the most generous offer she has ever had as a 
member of Parliament: ``If you believe you have fixed it, of all the 
numbers of people on record as objecting to section 27(2), if you 
can get me two or three who say they now accept it I will reconsider 
my position''. Her response to me was: ``I do not think I can do 
that''. To which I said: ``Then you have not fixed it''. The 
government has not fixed section 27(2).
<P>
	The new Minister of Transport has listened to people. They have 
come out of that meeting telling me they have some cause for hope 
that the government is to redress what is an intolerable clause in an 
otherwise generally good bill.
<P>
	I hope members will take this opportunity not to make a partisan 
decision, not just to support the Reform Party, because we are not 
here to bring our agenda forward. We are here to represent the 
people who came before that committee, as I hope the hon. 
members on the other side are. If they are intent to do that I 
congratulate them. I hope they support the removal of section 
27(2).
<P>
	With regard to Motion No. 7, the Minister of Transport's motion, 
and Motion No. 8 which is mine, both dealing with section 27(3), 
in essence supplements to section 27(2), section 27(2) should be 
taken away but if it is not we should at least try to make it as 
palatable as possible keeping in mind these changes are not 
satisfactory to those witnesses who came before the committee and 
asked that section 27(2) be removed.
<P>
	We will support in sequence each of these motions. The most 
important way is to remove section 27(2). Knowing the 
government can pass anything it wants, knowing that even if we 
vote against the entire bill because of section 27(2) it can still pass 
it, we will at least try to disguise the bad tasting medicine a little.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	During the committee meeting one of the witnesses who came 
forward was from the National Transportation Agency. At that time 
section 27(2) was still called significant prejudice. It was the same 
thing but by a different name. I asked him to define significant 
prejudice. His response was that it would be argued by lawyers for 
years to come. One of the primary reasons section 27(2) must be 
removed from this legislation is to make it a better piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I also had a 
motion similar to Motion No. 6 to pull section 27 out of the bill. I 
do not believe it has served users very well.
<P>
	When the bill was introduced the minister at the time said that 
the old transport bill had been too much in the interest of shippers 
and that this piece of legislation would be the railways bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1121"> 1121 </A></B>
<P>
	With the inclusion of section 27 it may not only be the railways 
bill but also perhaps the legal professions and negotiators bill. The 
activities will go on, meeting the requirements of section 27, to 
identify what a lot of those words mean, words that are not now 
identified in the bill or in the section describing what words mean. 
There is no mention of what the words commercial harm or 
substantial commercial harm mean. Yet that is the basis on which 
the agency is required to intervene on behalf of a shipper with 
the new wording of section 27(2).
<P>
	Some of the shippers made it quite clear in a press release 
yesterday that sections 27(2) and (3) of Bill C-14 will significantly 
hinder the ability of shippers to use the shipper protections of the 
bill. They said the spirit of Bill C-14 is to create a more market 
oriented, efficient transportation system. ``We strongly support 
that'', said the president of the Alberta Wheat Pool, Alec Graham, 
``however, clauses 27(2) and 27(3) fly in the face of the whole 
purpose of the legislation''.
<P>
	The grain shippers made it abundantly clear that these sections 
would not increase competitiveness or financial viability of the 
railways and would not do anything for the shippers except impose 
extensive, expensive and lengthy legal battles over what is 
subjective language.
<P>
	Given that, I suggest we spend a fair bit of time on this and that 
government members pause before bringing this one to a vote. The 
new minister has perhaps not had a chance to do the amount of 
background work and research necessary for him to make a 
decision on this. This should not be proceeded with at the moment. 
We should pause the debate at this stage and bring it forward after 
the weekend so that the minister can again have a chance to revisit 
this and to pay further attention to the concerns of shippers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, after an impassioned plea by the hon. 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke I have to remind the 
House that on clause 27(2) and his Motion No. 6 there was a lot of 
testimony before the standing committee. There were a lot of 
deliberations. After much debate the committee came to a 
unanimous conclusion about the best way to amend this section.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	It is incumbent on the government to respect the unanimous 
decision of that committee and to incorporate it in the bill. I think 
all of his concerns are already incorporated in the bill. Therefore 
the government will not support Motion No. 6.
<P>
	On Motion No. 8, keeping in mind what I have already said, we 
are talking about an unnecessary expansion of detail. Three of the 
existing criteria well known in legislative language are taken 
verbatim from section 5, whereas these proposals have no history 
of court interpretation and therefore lead to introduced legal 
uncertainties.
<P>
	Long lists of criteria tend to be treated as check lists and increase 
the likelihood of rejections simply on the basis that an applicant 
does not meet the majority of criteria. This is something that was 
discussed as well in committee.
<P>
	The legal obligation then to put forward evidence against a long 
list of technical points as required by this motion can be both costly 
and burdensome to the applicant and in the end acting as, if I might 
use a phrase, a chill against the availability of relief. For those 
reasons we will not be supporting Motion No. 8.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. members opposite, the hon. member for 
Kootenay West-Revelstoke and the hon. member for Mackenzie, 
for their kind words. I did meet with a large number of people who 
had concerns about this area of the bill and I did have a completely 
fresh look at it.
<P>
	I concluded after that examination that the decision of the 
committee was the appropriate one. As my hon. friend from 
Eglinton North stated so eloquently a moment ago, it was a 
decision of the committee and all members of that committee.
<P>
	They did take the time to examine potential alternate wordings in 
great detail and they came to a compromise solution which in my 
mind is a very appropriate one. After considering the 
representations made I decided the members of the House who took 
part in that committee discussion were correct in their assessment 
of what should be done.
<P>
	Let me quickly go on to the issue in Motion No. 7. Section 27(2) 
of former Bill C-101 contained the words ``significant prejudice'' 
as a factor in the regulatory disposition of complaints. This 
subsection was the main target of criticism for most of the shippers. 
They viewed it as barring access to the agency rather than a factor 
in the agency's decision making.
<P>
	Concerns also tended to centre on whether the meaning of the 
term significant prejudice was clear and precise enough in law. 
They were worried also that the section would be applied to final 
offer arbitration.
<P>
	Section 27(2) was and is intended to give procedural direction to 
the agency and not to prevent people from getting before the 
agency. Section 27(2) applies to all agency decisions concerning 
rates and services, whatever the mode of transportation. It is an 
interpretive section. Its purpose is to assist the agency in carrying 
out its regulatory duties in an expeditious manner.
<P>
	The provision as amended is consistent with objectives of the 
bill. One is to streamline the regulatory process to establish more 
commercially oriented relations between shippers and carriers. 
Another is to reserve regulatory intervention to cases where there is 
a lack of effective competition. Another is that economic 
regulation should always be a last resort and mindful of that policy  
backdrop but also of the need to respond to concerns about section 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1122"> 1122 </A></B>
<P>
27. It was amended by the Standing Committee on Transport in 
several important respects. I will deal with these briefly.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	First of all, the term ``significant prejudice'' was replaced with 
the term ``substantial commercial harm''. The term, of substantial 
harm, is more familiar to the industry. Second, to add further 
precision, a new subsection 27(3) was introduced. It sets out factors 
that the agency is to consider when determining whether an 
applicant would suffer substantial commercial harm were the relief 
not to be granted.
<P>
	The criteria introduced are: first, the market conditions relating 
to the goods involved; second, the location and the volume of 
traffic of the goods; third, the scale of operations connected with 
this traffic; fourth, the type of traffic or service involved and the 
availability to the applicant of alternative means of transporting the 
goods.
<P>
	It should be noted that three of these criteria merit points now 
found in the policy statements at the beginning of the National 
Transportation Act and as such they are well grounded in law. 
While the criteria give the agency more precise guidance, the 
agency will still have discretion to consider any other matter that is 
relevant to a specific case. The wording of the subsection precludes 
any all-encompassing statutory definition since the agency's 
determination needs to be made in light of all the circumstances of 
each case. That is only fair to all parties affected by such an 
application.
<P>
	Third, as originally worded, some argued that subsection 27(2) 
would require the agency to proceed with a two-step approach. The 
section was therefore also amended to address that concern and to 
make it perfectly clear that it was not a bar to access to the agency.
<P>
	Furthermore, section 161 on final arbitration was amended to 
more explicitly stipulate that it does not apply to agency decisions 
such as section 27 on ``substantial commercial harm''.
<P>
	While some may have preferred that the whole section simply be 
deleted, I believe the Standing Committee on Transport has done 
an admirable job in finding compromise wording that adds the 
precision wanted and yet at the same time respects the policy intent 
behind the new legislation, Bill C-14.
<P>
	This motion which changes the word ``shall'' to the word ``may'' 
will allow the agency the discretion to consider the criteria set out 
in subsection 3 for determining ``substantial commercial harm'' 
where it considers it appropriate to do so.
<P>
	In my mind, the bill, as amended, will continue to strike that 
appropriate balance among these competing interests.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-14 be amended by adding after line 6, on page 18, the following

	He said: Mr. Speaker, these motions require making information 
readily available to the ministers of transport in the provinces 
where changes to the rail system may occur.
<P>
	I believe this makes some sense. The information has to be 
available as soon as the railway has made the decision to abandon. 
It allows for discussion within the province and allows for planning 
to get the alternative transportation modes in place with the 
provinces and the municipalities. It is something that might happen 
without it being required if the public relations department of the 
railway thinks it is important but it would be much better if it was 
required to happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Reform Party will be opposing all four motions. We 
are opposing motion No. 10 simply because we cannot find any 
rational justification for this amendment whatsoever.
<P>
	In the case of motion No. 11, the authority being asked for 
already exists through the agency and that is where it belongs. The 
minister does not need to have the lever of power on everything 
which is what this motion asks for.
<P>
	Motions Nos. 12 and 13 relate to previously insupportable 
motions by the member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government will not support 
motion No. 10 because section 50 of the act already allows for all 
information that is legitimately required to support transportation 
policy discussions be collected.
<P>
	The integrity of every kind of confidential reporting to 
government depends on the circulation of data being kept to the 
essential minimum to ensure against risks of intentional and 
unintentional disclosures.
<P>
	As members know, some provinces already operate 
transportation enterprises that compete or negotiate with the 
federal carriers and would have at least the appearance of being in a 
conflict of interest if they would receive confidential data in the 
manner prescribed by this motion.
<P>
	The government does not support motion No. 11 because, as I 
said earlier, section 50 allows for the collection of all information 
that is legitimately required. The proposed authority under motion 
No. 11 to separately specify the collection cost data for railways is 
obviously redundant.
<P>
	Similarly, for motion No. 12, I refer to what I said with respect to 
motion No. 10. The government will not be supporting motion No. 
12 either.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1124"> 1124 </A></B>
<P>
	What I said about motion No. 10 applies to motion No. 13. 
Already there is a section in the act which allows for  the collection 
of all information, and as responsible representatives of the people, 
we are required to ensure that there is a reduction of risks of 
intentional or unintentional disclosures of data that would put 
people in an embarrassing situation or in a conflict situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Simon de Jong (Regina-Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am surprised to hear both the spokesperson for the 
government and for the Reform Party joining again together to 
protect the interests of the large railway companies at the expense 
of the people who are affected by those decisions, in this case the 
provincial governments.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	All of our motions have been requested. The inclusion of the 
three new clauses were called for by the representatives of the three 
prairie provincial governments in their submission and appearance 
before the transportation committee. These new clauses are 
extracted from the previous Railway Act provision, sections 351 to 
354.
<P>
	Also under these provisions, provincial governments which have 
since 1972 been receiving confidential cost information concerning 
the railways would continue to do so.
<P>
	There has never been a question of the confidentiality of this 
information ever being compromised by the prairie governments. 
For the government and the Reform Party to raise the issue now is 
nonsense. It has never been a problem.
<P>
	The information is required if the provinces are to continue to 
have meaningful input with the Canadian Transportation Agency 
when the agency establishes maximum grain rates and 
inter-switching rates, for example. There are some real reasons 
why we are introducing the motions.
<P>
	The prairie provincial governments had requested them and it 
will make things easier for them. I understand why the government 
and the bureaucrats are not interested. I suspect that what we are 
hearing from government members is what the bureaucrats have 
been telling them. However, I am really surprised to hear the 
Reform Party members consistently coming out in favour of the 
interests of the large railway companies.
<P>
	Maybe it is the fact that they are just paying off the debt of 
$40,000 that the CPR donated to the Reform Party last year. 
Perhaps today is the payback period.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on Motion 
No. 11. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those in favour of the 
motion will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> All those opposed will 
please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> In my opinion the nays have 
it.
<P>
	I declare the motion defeated. I therefore declare motions Nos. 
12 and 13 defeated.
<P>
	(Motions 11 to 13 inclusive negatived.)

	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.) </B>moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, the government should strike an impartial 
public judicial inquiry into the total process of awarding and cancelling the 
1993 Pearson airport redevelopment contract, leading up to and including the 
allegations that the Prime Minister of Canada solicited a $25,000 campaign 
contribution from Paxport Inc. just prior to the last Liberal Party leadership race 
and the awarding of the Pearson airport contract to Paxport.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I believe that the only way we are ever 
going to clear the air on this whole odour of the Pearson 
development contract is to have a full, genuine, public judicial 
inquiry. I have called for that for over two years.
<P>
	I am going to do a little bit of crystal balling. I suspect that in 
responding to this today the government will say that there has 
been an investigation, that the Senate held a full hearing.
<P>
	Let us see how impartial the Senate investigation is. On one side 
the Liberal senators are justifying what the government did. On the 
other side the Conservative senators are trying to justify what the 
Conservative government did just before its defeat in 1993. But 
who is really interested in Pearson airport? That is the real 
question. Somebody needs to be concerned about Pearson airport, 
about the right of law, about the people in metro Toronto, about the 
flying public and about the Canadian taxpayer. Who was there 
representing them? Nobody.
<P>
	Before I leave the subject of the Senate inquiry, I might add that 
at the inquiry the senators on both sides were able to call any and as 
many witnesses as they wanted to call. Despite having that ability, 
the Liberals only managed to pull in two or three people out of all 
the witnesses who came forward who supported their position, and 
they were on the Liberal payroll. I do not think that was a 
particularly good defence for the Liberals.
<P>
	There was another investigation. Perhaps this one was more 
impartial. There was an investigation when the government first 
took office. The government said it was going to investigate this 
deal and if it found it was not a good deal for the Canadian 
taxpayer, it was going to cancel it. Was it an impartial 
investigation? Let us see. The investigation was done by one 
person, Mr. Robert Nixon. Mr. Nixon had 30 days to investigate 
this deal but he actually took a little less time. He received $80,000 
for doing it.
<P>
	Who is this Mr. Nixon, this impartial investigator? It seems he is 
a long time Liberal supporter, party fundraiser, treasurer for the 
Liberals in Ontario, father of a sitting Liberal member of 
Parliament in the current Liberal government. What did he get for 
doing this? He got $80,000, but the government will argue there 
were a lot of costs so he really did not make a huge amount of 
money.
<P>
	Did he get anything else? Immediately after he put in his report 
with no substantiating evidence whatsoever, which said that it 
looked like a bad deal which he thought the government should 
cancel, the government responded by saying: ``Good enough, Mr. 
Nixon. For that we are now making you the chair of Atomic Energy 
of Canada''. That is really impartial.
<P>
	How did we get into this mess in the first place? During the 1993 
election the Liberals needed an issue. They needed a few issues. 
Everybody needs issues at election time. The Tories were really on 
the outs. They were accused of anything and everything and I 
suspect they were guilty of most of what they were accused of.
<P>
	One of the things the present government accused the Tories of 
was having a corrupt deal in the Pearson development contract. The 
Liberals accused them that it was a pay off for their Tory friends 
and supporters and said that they were going to investigate it. I do 
not argue with the premise to look at it.
<P>
	We started to investigate the contract in the House under the 
guise of Bill C-22, probably the most undemocratic piece of 
legislation this government has brought forward since 1993. I 
wanted to see if there was justification for the $30 million these 
very generous Liberals on the other side were going to give the 
consortium. I questioned whether those in the consortium should 
even get that, given all the things they were accused of. When I 
began to investigate this to decide if I should be arguing against 
giving them that much, to my surprise I could not find one single 
solitary piece of evidence to justify cancelling the contract in the 
first place.
<P>
	I have never questioned the government's right to cancel the 
contract, only the relative wisdom of it. I certainly questioned the 
passing of a piece of legislation that enabled the government to 
cancel the contract retroactively which in effect would say that it 
never existed, that would set the compensation by legislation and 
that would ban the consortium from seeking redress from the court. 
The Minister of Transport then proceeded to call them corrupt and 
a great number of other names. He then took away their ability to 
defend themselves in court. We have found absolutely no 
justification for this.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	However secret government documents came to me. When I say 
secret I mean documents that came to me  stamped ``secret''. They 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1126"> 1126 </A></B>
<P>
cannot get more secret than that. When we finally got our hands on 
these documents they did not support the government's position. 
They in fact clearly instructed the government beforehand that it 
was making a bad move.
<P>
	After two years the Prime Minister, who has not produced one 
single piece of supporting evidence to justify the legislation 
dealing with the Pearson airport, has not been able to get royal 
assent. When the government brings forward legislation and it is 
defeated, that is a motion of non-confidence. After two years the 
government cannot get the bill through the Senate. It has never 
passed. After two years it has failed. That is as close to a message 
of non-confidence we can give to this government as it is likely 
going to get in this session.
<P>
	I am using the Prime Minister primarily because the then 
Minister of Transport and the now Minister of Transport, who no 
doubt are going to end up trying to support the Prime Minister on 
this sad piece of legislation, it is not their bill. It was the Prime 
Minister's bill all the way and there should not be any 
misunderstanding about that.
<P>
	The Prime Minister and his lackeys have repeatedly attempted to 
justify the cancellation of the Pearson contract by saying it is far 
too rich a deal, that it is taking far too much taxpayers' money and 
shoving it into the pockets of Tory supporters, that it is just too 
great a return on their investment to justify letting it proceed.
<P>
	A few things have turned up. When we investigate this we find 
that there are more Liberals than Tories in this. Now it has gone to 
court. A lot of people are not aware because the bill never passed, 
which amounts to a non-confidence motion on the government, that 
it went to court in Ontario.
<P>
	The contract holder sued the government for breach of contract 
and the court said: ``Guilty. The federal government is in breach of 
contract''. Of course the federal government has tons and tons of 
taxpayers' money and it just trots down to the justice department 
and says: ``Start preparing our appeal''. When the government has 
unlimited funds it can prepare the best appeals in the world and it 
did. The courts again said: ``Guilty. You are wrong. It is a breach of 
contract and you are going to have to pay''. The matter is now in 
court to decide on the damages. The government is being sued for 
$600 million to $650 million.
<P>
	The government has a defence. Members opposite should have 
some patience because we are going to defend the government. We 
are going to tell everybody what the government is using for this 
wonderful defence. Again, the government has all the justice 
resources in the world available to it. Keep in mind what I 
mentioned earlier about how the Prime Minister and his lackeys 
said the reason to cancel this deal was because it was far too rich 
and gave those Tory hacks far too much money, that the rate of 
return was way too high for the investment.  What did the justice 
department come up with for a defence?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> A drunken defence?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Maybe a drunken defence would be good. That 
might explain some of it.
<P>
	The justice department went into court and said: ``Your Honour, 
we should not be paying any compensation to the contract holders 
because they are mainly looking for compensation for lost profit 
and the actual fact is this was a terrible contract. They would have 
gone broke, lost their shirts and would not have made any profits so 
why should we compensate them for any?''
<P>
	Is it not interesting that the government talks out of both sides of 
its mouth at the same time. That is quite a trick. Mind you, the 
Liberals have had decades and decades to practise with many years 
in opposition. I do not know how well they could practise it on this 
side of the House because when they go to the other side they say 
everything differently. Perhaps they got confused and thought half 
the time they were on this side of the House and the other half they 
were on that side and that is why they have two different stories on 
the same thing.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has repeatedly misinformed the public on 
the matter of lease revenues. He said that we are giving up all these 
revenues that we currently get. That is a-well, I cannot say what I 
was going to say; I almost let it slip out. That is wholly inaccurate. I 
think that term is acceptable. It is wholly inaccurate because we 
have public government documents which clearly show that the 
lease payments are deferred during the construction period but they 
are repaid with interest. That is hardly what the Prime Minister has 
been telling everyone.
<P>
<B>(1340 )</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister also deliberately disregarded government 
reports. Again these were stamped as secret all over them. These 
government reports clearly pointed out that cancellation of the 
contract would leave the government open to damages ranging 
from $500 million to $2 billion of taxpayers' money. Right now it 
is in court defending an action for over $600 million plus the cost 
of defence.
<P>
	The manner in which the Prime Minister cancelled the contract 
brings into question the value of a contract signed by the 
government in the event that the government changes. The Prime 
Minister again deliberately disregarded secret government 
documentation which pointed out that the legislation limiting the 
government's liability left the crown open to many problems, 
including severe capacity and congestion problems at Pearson, 
increased construction costs and the danger of undermining the 
government's future leasing and contracting process. This is in a 
report that  went to the government before it brought forward this 
odious piece of legislation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1127"> 1127 </A></B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister has spent $2 billion on false government job 
creation, the infamous infrastructure program. Call it 
infrastructure, fine. If we need some money to kickstart the 
infrastructure repairs in this country that is one thing, but to call it 
job creation is an absolute farce. The government spent $2 billion 
on this and it has virtually no permanent jobs. It is something like 
4,500 permanent jobs.
<P>
	The cancelled Pearson contract would have created 14,000 
person years of construction employment with 1,200 new jobs at 
absolutely no cost to the Canadian taxpayer whatsoever. Now the 
government, in addition to this $600 million or $700 million worth 
of compensation that it could lose in court, in addition to all the 
legal costs that it is incurring, still has to do something about 
terminals 1 and 2. The consortium was going to spend $850 million 
of private investors' money in that.
<P>
	The costs have gone up so we are now looking at $1 billion, or 
$1.2 billion which was the last estimate I heard. Where is the 
government going to get this money? It is not in its wonderful 
budget. Maybe it is going to spend the surplus money, but gee, it 
cannot. That is the money it is giving to Atlantic Canada to try to 
buy away the GST. I do not know where the government is going to 
get it.
<P>
	The Prime Minister's mishandling of the Pearson contract has 
jeopardized 1,140 airport jobs, 560 direct off airport jobs and over 
3,000 indirect jobs in the metro Toronto area. It also results in a 
tri-level government tax loss of $72 million a year.
<P>
	Bill C-22 works against the interests of metro Toronto and all 
Canadians because after introducing open skies, things that have 
been long awaited for in the aviation industry, it has now 
jeopardized the future potential of Pearson airport as Canada's 
primary hub.
<P>
	The final point I would like to raise is an allegation. I stress it is 
only an allegation that has come from many sources. The allegation 
is that the Prime Minister solicited a $25,000 contribution from one 
of the principals in the Pearson consortium for his leadership 
campaign fund.
<P>
	There have been lots of allegations of this. The Prime Minister 
had the opportunity to at least partially dispel this. Part of the 
reason we cannot prove this one way or another is that his law 
partners refused to disclose documents because they are 
confidential. They are covered by the Privacy Act of lawyer-client 
confidentiality. The Prime Minister could have released all those 
documents to the public but he did not choose to do so. I think we 
should have a full and proper investigation to determine what these 
are.
<P>
	I will close by making the same offer to the new Minister of 
Transport which I made to the old Minister of Transport. It can be 
the Prime Minister, I do not care who it is, who stands. If he is 
going to defend this then he had better be prepared to defend it 
publicly. I offered to publicly debate this with the previous 
Minister of Transport anywhere, anytime. One of the nation's 
television networks was prepared to cover it. I pointed out to him 
then as I point out to the new minister now, that the balance should 
be in their favour.
<P>
<B>(1345 )</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Transport can go armed with all his assistants, 
the deputy minister, the assistant deputy ministers, all his special 
assistants, executive assistants, all the justice department lawyers, 
and I will come armed only with the truth. The venue for the new 
minister, if he wishes, can be the University of Victoria in his 
riding or it can be one of the lighthouses he vowed to save after 
they pulled his bacon out of the straits when he was about to go 
under.
<P>
	The offer is open and it stands but there needs to be full public 
disclosure on this. It has not happened and I suspect with the 
Liberal government it never will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Joseph Volpe (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope I will not collapse to the same 
sort of seductive attraction that rhetoric holds for my colleague 
opposite. I hope we will be able to look at the facts rather than 
engage in disparaging repetitions of allegations from sources he 
well knows are suspect at the very best and at the very least 
motivated by self-interest.
<P>
	We can address the issue in the motion presented by the member 
but we would also have to take a look at the premises he has cast 
forth in the House about the process. He says this has been an 
undemocratic system. He says that in the House where people get 
elected, where people have to go through a lot of trials to get the 
public to appreciate the position they will present in this place, in a 
place which is open and being televised today all over the country. 
Nothing is being hidden.
<P>
	This is a House which authorizes committees both from the 
House as well as in the other for public inquiries that he requests. 
Then he says the system is undemocratic, it does not work. His 
colleague beside him says this place does not work. Why did you 
seek office? You come here to make it work.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I take note on this Friday 
afternoon, as the week draws to an end, that there is a difference of 
opinion, but please express it through the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> I guess I was letting the truth, the facts and the 
evidence that have come forward over the course of the last several 
months influence my approach to this discussion. It is unfortunate 
that my colleagues are not infected by the same kind of democratic 
disease.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1128"> 1128 </A></B>
<P>
	My good friend from Kootenay West-Revelstoke admits the 
Prime Minister and the government were well within their rights 
to cancel this deal. He questions whether deals with governments 
can be considered legitimate because they are prone to be 
cancelled. Can anyone imagine that, in 1993 right in the middle 
of an election campaign in which the Pearson airport deal was a 
nationwide issue?
<P>
	As one who comes from Toronto and was very much in tune with 
what was going on at Pearson, I see a colleague opposite refer to an 
issue that was of national significance, controversial to say the very 
least, and the government of the day proceeded, nonetheless, to 
sign a deal. Can anyone imagine that he would then be surprised 
that it would be cancelled because it had been advertised that it 
would be? He should direct his anger at the former administration, 
but unfortunately there are none of them any longer in this place to 
take some accountability.
<P>
	I hope members will forgive me if I chastise or perhaps simply 
chide my colleague and ask him why he continues to defend the 
indefensible.
<P>
	I am astounded that the member is asking for yet another review.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	The first review was in the public context of the election. It was 
there for everyone to see, but it was not sufficient. Even though we 
followed through on our promises, the member asks for continuing 
expenditures of taxpayer money on an inquiry that has already been 
held.
<P>
	We should not be considering a judicial inquiry or a Senate 
inquiry. That has already been debated in the Senate and it was 
decided the Senate inquiry would have the power to send for 
people, for papers, for records to examine witnesses under oath and 
heaven knows what else.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, on May 4, 1995 the special 
committee of the Senate on the Pearson airport agreement was 
formed with the following mandate: ``That the special committee 
of the Senate be appointed to examine and report upon all matters 
concerning the policies and negotiations leading up to and 
including the agreements respecting the redevelopment and 
operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester B. Pearson International 
Airport and the circumstances relating to the cancellation thereof''.
<P>
	That committee sat between July and November and heard 
testimony from over 60 people including all major private sector 
participants involved in that project, from former ministers and 
senior public servants who acted on the government's behalf to the 
people who were protecting their own private interests. That was 
fine.
<P>
	In addition, the committee reviewed thousands and thousands of 
pages of documentation. The evidence demonstrated conclusively 
that the Pearson airport deal was not in the best interests of the 
country in terms of substance and process.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is a bald faced lie.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Volpe:</B> I am speaking the truth. This is an open place and if 
we do not speak the truth we are very quickly found out.
<P>
	The notable achievement of this special committee is that it 
heard more than 130 hours of testimony given under oath by 65 
witnesses.
<P>
	The public following this debate may be shocked to hear these 
kinds of things after having heard the rhetoric from the member 
opposite. From witnesses from both the public and private sector, 
those most knowledgeable on all the issues, all of the negotiations 
and all of the decisions made about Pearson, that committee saw an 
abundance of evidence including construction management 
contracts, architectural and engineering service contracts, other 
management contracts. Shall I go on?
<P>
	The inquiry revealed to the public the role of lobbyists in the 
Pearson airport agreement. The report of the special Senate 
committee on the Pearson airport agreement is a very thick volume 
and I recommend it for the member's reading. This is a product of 
extensive inquiry which examined all of the relevant players and 
over 10,000 pages of documents, and which addressed all the 
motions put before the committee. I think that is very thorough.
<P>
	An inquiry has been done. It has been open. It has followed the 
process of judicial inquiries. It has followed the process required 
by an open democratic system.
<P>
	Given all the time and extensive consideration already devoted 
to such a comprehensive inquiry, I do not understand, but maybe 
other members do, how a member can demand that the government 
be expected to use millions more in taxpayer dollars to have yet 
another inquiry to come to the same conclusion. Need we go 
through this again? The answer is clearly and absolutely no. No 
further review is required.
<P>
	Through the entire process, the allegations with respect to wrong 
doing have been substantiated by evidence that has been put 
forward. My colleague opposite is trying to score points in this 
political arena where we never take a partisan side. He introduces 
that element in this political forum.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	I should advise him that some of these allegations attack 
individuals whose known service in the public domain at the 
provincial level such as the first individual who looked at the 
impartial agreement. We cannot cast aspersions on people who 
dedicate themselves to public  service. They are under constant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1129"> 1129 </A></B>
<P>
scrutiny. If we want to cast aspersions, let us do so outside the 
Chamber.
<P>
	The government has gone through the entire system as is 
required by the taxpayers and citizens of the country. It has acted 
responsibly, followed all the processes and it is being held 
accountable. All the procedures are maintained in their integrity 
and the public interest is first, foremost and always safeguarded.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak in support of the motion put forward 
by the member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke.
<P>
	What we have here will undoubtedly go on for a while and will 
probably be viewed like a television mini-series by the time we get 
through. It has all the elements. It has intrigue, influence peddling, 
patronage and unholy relationships between very strange 
bedfellows and their respective party friends, the Liberals and the 
Tories. This could win an Oscar by the time we are through.
<P>
	When this story is finished I do not think there is an author in the 
world who could write anything as intriguing that would carry all 
the elements that people look for as entertainment.
<P>
	Unfortunately this is not something the Canadian people look on 
as entertaining, and it should not be something the Liberals and the 
former government smile smugly about, thinking all the bases are 
covered and that this will not come out into the open. It will. 
Something as unholy as the relationship in the Pearson Airport deal 
cannot be covered up forever. It will come up.
<P>
	I am familiar with this issue, having sat for a number of months 
on the transport committee. I appreciate the opportunity to 
contribute to the debate and probably expand on the truths coming 
from this side of the House so that the Canadian people following 
the debate in the media and on television will get a real grasp on 
what actually has happened and what will happen around the 
Pearson airport deal.
<P>
	We are talking about something the Liberals talked about prior to 
the election. The Liberals actually put this in their red book. They 
called for openness and transparency in the operation of 
government. How good they said it would be to get a Liberal 
government that would operate in an open and transparent manner, 
something that has been missing in all other governments that were 
not Liberal.
<P>
	Quite frankly, we think that is a good idea. That is why the 
member for Kootenay West-Revelstoke has put forward a motion 
that calls on the government to deal with the Pearson airport deal, 
this whole mess, by establishing an impartial public judicial 
inquiry to look at all the events surrounding this apparently 
clandestine deal.
<P>
	My hon. friend is asking for nothing different from what the 
Liberals promised in their campaign, openness and transparency 
and truth. This type of inquiry is needed when we consider how the 
matter has been handled up to now by the government, the Senate 
and the committees. A lot of time and money was wasted on the 
issue. To this date we are no closer to the truth than we were before 
this whole thing started.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	The Liberals blame the Tories, which is not surprising. The 
Tories blame the Liberals, which is not surprising. I am surprised 
that both of them do not blame the Reformers and we were not even 
here yet. Make no mistake, Reformers are here now and the 
government has to deal with Reformers when it comes to openness, 
transparency and truth. There will be no more getting away with 
the stuff that the Liberals and their Tory friends have been doing for 
decades.
<P>
	As I indicated, if the truth were known it would clearly show, not 
to the surprise of too many people, that the Liberals and Tories 
have been, still are and will continue to be in bed with each other 
until maybe we are no longer a country. Hopefully that will never 
happen, although the way the Liberals are treating the Bloc and the 
relationship developing between them, we never know what can 
happen.
<P>
	This entire affair has been under the control of the government 
since the start. If there was ever a time to take an impartial look, an 
open look, a transparent look, a look where the criteria is truth, the 
time is now.
<P>
	As members know, the previous Tory government signed a deal 
with a private sector consortium to take over Pearson International 
Airport. What upset the Liberals was the fact that this contract was 
signed during the 1993 election campaign. Their spin doctors and 
their strategists probably got them together and said: ``You might 
lose some votes around the Toronto area if this thing gets signed by 
the Tories, so what can we do to turn this thing around? We will call 
it a lousy deal and we will threaten to cancel it''. They have the 
money to get good spin doctors. They did put a different spin on it. 
They made the contract an election issue. They promised to scrap it 
should they be elected.
<P>
	This is surprising. It seems to me they made a similar promise 
about the GST before the election. Am I mistaken that they were 
going to scrap the GST?
<P>
	Nevertheless the airport deal was scrapped. In order to justify the 
termination of this project the government thought after it was 
done that perhaps some people were wondering about it. They 
thought they had better bring someone in to back them up, someone 
who would speak the truth, who would be impartial, who would be 
open, who would show transparency and truth, someone people 
could trust. They picked Robert Nixon, Liberal Robert Nixon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1130"> 1130 </A></B>
<P>
	Is it true that this Mr. Nixon was a Liberal member? He could 
not have been a Liberal member. There are allegations that he was 
a Liberal bagman. Could that be true? There are allegations that 
he had some very strong ties to the Liberal Party. Let us not forget 
where he is now. He could not be the CEO of some crown 
corporation that is controlled by the Liberal government? Could 
the recent round of ministerial appointments be in any way 
affected by the fact that Mr. Nixon was a long time friend of this 
Liberal government? Perish the thought.
<P>
	The Liberals have said and of course everyone must believe 
them-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I apologize for not 
being very familiar with the rules but this particular line is getting 
very close to casting aspersions upon an hon. member of this House 
and I think improperly.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I give my assurance to the 
entire House that I am listening to the debate with great attention. 
Respectfully the member does not have a point of order. He is 
engaging in debate.
<P>
<B>(1405 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harris:</B> Mr. Speaker, I was asking questions that had been 
raised.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon reported back to the Liberals in 30 days-that was 
quick work-with a report that argued in favour of terminating the 
contracts. Were we really surprised? This was because of undue 
influence peddling among the chief players in the consortium and 
the Tory government. Can we be surprised about that?
<P>
	I will not stand here and deny that I do not have any doubt that 
the previous Tory government may have ventured into patronage 
payoffs to friends of the party. Mr. Nixon had this in his report 
which took only 30 days and nevertheless cost $82,000. I am sorry, 
he got a bonus. After his bill was paid, he was then appointed as 
chairman of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. I missed that 
earlier.
<P>
	He issued an 11-page report which works out to $7,000 per 
page-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I regret interrupting 
but member's interventions are limited to 10 minutes and I must 
resume debate. The hon. member for Mississauga South.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on Motion No. 167 which 
proposes the government strike an impartial inquiry into the 
process of awarding and cancelling the 1993 Pearson airport 
redevelopment contract.
<P>
	I have every sympathy for the hon. member's idea of an 
impartial inquiry. I am all for openness and impartiality. However, 
I am also in favour of protecting the Canadian taxpayer from a 
terrible waste of money.  The motion would inflict this waste on the 
Canadian taxpayer because the cancellation of the Pearson airport 
contract has already been reviewed. It has been reviewed by the 
Senate and now it is being reviewed by the general division of the 
Ontario Court of Justice.
<P>
	First I will discuss the Senate inquiry. The issue of the awarding 
and cancellation of the Pearson airport redevelopment contract was 
subject to a very lengthy inquiry by a special committee of the 
Senate. The special Senate committee was created for the express 
purpose of looking into all aspects related to policies and 
negotiations which led to the conclusion of the Pearson airport 
redevelopment contract, as well as the circumstances which led to 
its cancellation.
<P>
	The committee was given the power to compel witnesses to 
appear under oath and to produce documents. The special 
committee heard more than 130 hours of testimony given by more 
than 65 witnesses, including all of the main players in this matter. 
Among the witnesses to appear were interveners from the private 
sector involved in the redevelopment project as well as high 
ranking civil servants representing the government. The witnesses 
who were called and who appeared were the people who were most 
aware of the stakes, the negotiations and the decisions surrounding 
the contracts. Their testimony was given in a very public manner 
with ample media coverage.
<P>
	The inquiry resulted in the facts coming to light in a very 
detailed manner. The volume of documents alone provides 
evidence of the thoroughness of the review conducted. In order to 
assist the inquiry, the government reviewed hundreds of thousands 
of Department of Transport documents. It organized and shipped 
roomfuls of these documents to the Senate committee. I understand 
those documents are available to the public. The hon. member is 
perfectly free to visit that document room and review each and 
every one of those documents if he so wishes.
<P>
	After such extensive consideration of the awarding and 
cancellation of the redevelopment contract, it would appear to me 
to be a waste of time and money for another inquiry to be called to 
look into the same issue. The process was very open and public and 
Canadians are now well aware of the main elements of the 
awarding and cancellation of that contract. To contend that another 
inquiry would somehow be beneficial to Canadians is to say the 
least misleading. Furthermore such an exercise would be a waste of 
precious tax dollars at a time when fiscal responsibility is the order 
of the day.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	In the same breath with which the Reform Party is calling us for 
cutting spending, it is again also calling for the government to take 
steps which would involve the irresponsible spending of precious 
dollars in an inquiry into an issue which has already been the 
subject of very extensive and public inquiry. This is difficult to  
understand, irresponsible, and I stress, another clear indication that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1131"> 1131 </A></B>
<P>
the Reform Party is out of touch with what is most important to the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	Let me turn to the other important review that the hon. member 
appears to have forgotten in presenting this motion to the House. 
The crown and the T-I, T-II partnership are currently engaged in 
litigation in the Ontario Court of Justice, general division. In short, 
the issues raised by this motion are already the subject of court 
proceedings. Why would the government duplicate that court 
process with a separate, expensive judicial inquiry? Surely a 
judicial inquiry is completely redundant to the process that is 
presently under way.
<P>
	I would like to review very briefly what is at stake in the ongoing 
litigation. Hon. members opposite should know that the damages, 
if any, to the partnership will be very thoroughly reviewed by the 
court. The partnership originally informed the judge that it 
intended to present over 50 days of testimony to her. That is 50 
days of examination by the partnership's lawyers, 50 days of 
detailed information by expert witnesses and others on the ins and 
outs of the Pearson agreement. Those 50 days do not even include 
the cross-examination by the crown's lawyers.
<P>
	Now that the court has begun its hearings it is clear to everyone 
that those hearings are going to stretch well into the summer and 
likely into the fall. The first witness for the T-I, T-II partnership 
testified for over 10 days before the crown's lawyers even had a 
chance to cross-examine. Many other witnesses will be put through 
a similar process by the lawyers. Surely the hon. member does not 
really intend to duplicate that process.
<P>
	Once the partnership has submitted its case, the crown will put 
its case to the judge. The Department of Justice has its own team of 
expert witnesses who will testify in open court. Those witnesses 
will also be cross-examined in detail by the lawyers for the T-I, T-II 
partnership. Then after all the examinations and 
cross-examinations, the lawyers on both sides will make weeks of 
closing arguments on the evidence and on the law.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite surely cannot be seriously asking that 
we duplicate this process on the backs of the Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	In summary, the hon. member's motion is asking Canadians to 
pay for yet another expensive inquiry into the Pearson airport 
transaction. The Senate has conducted an extensive and expensive 
public inquiry already. The Ontario Court of Justice, general 
division, is currently reviewing the contracts in detail. These issues 
have already been very thoroughly reviewed.
<P>
	Therefore, this House should conclude that the review proposed 
by this motion is in fact redundant. The taxpayers of Canada should 
not be asked to spend any more money on yet another review.
<P>
	In the last moments that I have in the time allotted to me I want 
to comment on the last speaker's presentation to the House. I can 
tell you as a member of Parliament I was quite disturbed by the 
references to a member sitting in this place by casting aspersions 
on the minister of revenue's personal integrity and ability to do the 
job.
<P>
	As a seatmate of that person over the last two years, and having 
participated with that member in the finance committee and in 
other matters to do with this honourable place, I can tell you I know 
of no finer, capable minister of revenue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, a point of order. I listened 
intently to the speech previous to the one of the hon. member. I did 
not detect the slightest reference to the present minister of revenue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Cabinet appointments.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Respectfully I would rule 
that the member for Edmonton Southwest does not have a point of 
order. It is a matter of debate.
<P>
	Let me take the occasion, as members from both sides of the 
House have intervened, to remind hon. members to be judicious 
with their our words.
<P>
<B>(1415 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just a few words I would like to have on the record.
<P>
	My experience in the House with the Minister of National 
Revenue would reflect the same as the member who just spoke: a 
very capable and a very hardworking member. I do not think we 
should leave on record the thought that there is any aspersion cast 
on that particular minister.
<P>
	Having said that, there is aspersion all around. There is a saying 
that if it walks like a duck, talks like a duck in so far as it quacks, if 
you find it in your water and you see it in a group of other ducks, 
the chances are it may well be a duck. That is the underlying 
principle this motion tends to speak to.
<P>
	We know full well, and those who have been in politics 
understand, that it is possible to promise much during an election 
campaign and deliver little or nothing after the election. The 
important thing is getting elected. Once you have been elected and 
if you have power then, as members opposite and the government 
have so ably shown in the distasteful handling of the GST promise, 
you can promise one thing and then do quite another and claim all 
kinds of reasons for doing this.
<P>
	In the case of the Pearson airport deal, a deal was launched for 
well over a year. Whether we liked it or not, there were people 
involved from both political parties, the Liberals and the Tories, 
who had in good conscience come together to take over the Pearson 
airport.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1132"> 1132 </A></B>
<P>
	This deal was signed by a Conservative Prime Minister. There 
are those around who feel that signing it during an election 
campaign, which I submit was very poor timing although the deal 
had been concluded by Treasury Board officials well before the 
election was called, did not show good judgment. In any event, 
it did become a political football during the election campaign.
<P>
	During the campaign, the Liberals decided they would cancel the 
deal. This points out one of the weaknesses in the political process 
in our country. If someone of high enough stature within any 
political party, including our political party, but in the political 
world says something and then instead of saying: ``Whoops, maybe 
I should not have said that'', or: ``Whoops, I was wrong'', all the 
king's horses and all the king's men are rallied to support whatever 
position the person in power might have presented. Whether that 
position was right or wrong, good or bad, whether it was wise or 
just ill-tempered, it always seems that we have to salute the flag. 
No matter what flag is on the pole when we go by it we salute it. 
This is the genesis of the whole Pearson airport problem.
<P>
	During the thrust of the election debate, because of the 
perception that this was an ill-timed move by the Conservatives to 
perhaps reward their friends before their government fell, the 
Liberals during the heat of the campaign said that they would 
cancel the Pearson airport deal. It was a campaign promise just 
like: ``We will scrap, abolish, get rid of the GST''.
<P>
	Had the Liberals opposite worked with the same dispatch to get 
rid of the GST, there would be rejoicing in the land. But they did 
not. What they did do was work with dispatch but without much 
reason to cancel the Pearson airport deal. Why? Pourquoi? Because 
it was perceived to be a sweetheart deal that would favour some of 
the Tories that were part of it. That is the political reality of the 
situation.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	As it turns out, this whole deal starts to unravel. After it was 
cancelled, and after the people who were negatively impacted were 
able to prove that they had gone into a deal with the Government of 
Canada in good faith, the Government of Canada in order to save 
any semblance of face or any semblance of honesty to ensure that 
the Government of Canada's word was its bond, had to buy its way 
out.
<P>
	Now we have a situation where the taxpayers of Canada have to 
cough up something like half a billion dollars or $800 million 
because someone, probably the Prime Minister and those on the 
Liberal side, made an ill-timed, ill-tempered campaign promise. 
He should have said: ``We will review it carefully and if it turns out 
that it is wrong, we will cancel it''. He did not. He said: ``We are 
going to cancel it''. Eight hundred million dollars later we have no 
change in the airport, we have  no new airport. It is the busiest 
airport in the country and nothing is happening.
<P>
	This motion and the situation represented by the Pearson airport 
deal is perhaps a lesson to all of us in politics. Our fiduciary 
responsibility is not to ourselves, it is not to the parties that we 
represent, it is to the people whom we represent. It is to the 
individual citizens of Canada whether they voted for us or not.
<P>
	We are charged with the responsibility of using our best efforts 
to do the right thing for the right reason at the right time. We need 
to put politics behind us and put principle ahead of us. That is what 
this issue is all about: politics before principle. In my opinion, we 
should be making sure that the foundation of everything we do is 
based on principle and not politics.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this 
debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Oh no, not the red book.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Thompson:</B> Put it down, put it down.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> I hear a few cat calls from across the way. I cannot 
understand why I would get Reform MPs so agitated. That being 
said, I want to assure my colleagues that I do not intend to agitate 
them any more than is absolutely necessary.
<P>
	The motion before us today proposes that the government 
establish an inquiry into the process of awarding the Pearson 
airport contract, an award that occurred under the previous Tory 
government.
<P>
	I have had some opportunity to deal with the issue of judicial 
inquiries. I would like all Canadians to understand the following.
<P>
	The commission of inquiry into the Sinclair Stevens affair which 
I think was quite necessary was not exactly free. It cost the 
taxpayers of Canada millions of dollars. The commission of 
inquiry into reproductive technology I believe cost the taxpayers of 
Canada $97 million-
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> What did it happen to do? It happened to get 
the Liberals elected. And you would put a price on integrity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria:</B> The hon. member across asked whether I would 
put a pricetag on integrity. No, because the integrity is already 
there, it is not necessary to put a pricetag on it. The integrity is 
there. That is not the issue.
<P>
	The issue is whether in addition to the inquiries that have already 
been held we need to waste taxpayers' dollars so that we can please 
the hon. member across the way. For months and months he was 
asking questions here in the House, questions that the lobbyists for 
the Pearson airport project just loved. They were applauding all 
over the place. They were breaking open the bottles of champagne 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1133"> 1133 </A></B>
<P>
after listening to the hon. member from  Kootenay West asking all 
those questions. The lobbyists loved him.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I was not elected to please those lobbyists. The hon. member 
across the way is quite free to love lobbyists. However, when we on 
this side of the House were elected during the 1993 election-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> It was a mistake.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Boudria: </B>No, the people of Canada when exercising their 
democratic rights do not make mistakes. I have more respect for 
them than that. Notwithstanding what the Reform Party just said, 
that the people of Canada made a mistake in electing the present 
government, I do not think they did. Had they elected the people 
across the way, even though I would not have particularly 
cherished that proposition, I would not have called that a mistake 
either.
<P>
	That would be disrespectful of my constituents and I do not 
intend to do that. I do not intend to leave a remark like that on the 
floor of the House of Commons without responding to it. I am sure 
on second thought the hon. member will want to withdraw that 
remark.
<P>
	Let us get back to the issue at hand.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The issue before us is as follows. A contract was signed by the 
previous government at a most inappropriate time-a few days 
before an election, which it knew it would lose. This contract was 
particularly rewarding-juicy even-for those who stood to benefit 
from it.
<P>
	When we came to power, we did what the Prime Minister had 
promised we would: we set up a commission of inquiry headed by 
Mr. Nixon, a very distinguished Canadian, a former minister of 
finance in Ontario, the son of a former premier of Ontario. I would 
add, without fear of contradiction, that Mr. Nixon is probably 
Ontario's most respected citizen.
<P>
	Mr. Nixon conducted the inquiry and concluded that the Pearson 
contract was particularly generous to those who had signed it and 
not so to Canadian taxpayers.
<P>
	The government therefore took the necessary measures and 
proposed the bill before this House. The House passed it and sent it 
to the other place, which chose not to pass it. They will get to it 
later, no doubt, but in the meantime the House, the Prime Minister 
and all of us on this side of the House did what had to be done for 
Canadian taxpayers, that is to say, we cancelled this contract. I 
think that that was the right decision.
<P>
	Now, the hon. member across the way, who for months has been 
siding with the lobbyists, would like another inquiry. One has to 
ask oneself what is the reason for this inquiry, which is being 
requested by someone who is sympathetic to the lobbyists, 
someone who kept telling us  for months that the contract, which 
had already been signed, the lucrative contract which benefited the 
companies in question, should go ahead.
<P>
	Why did he want this contract to go ahead? I do not know. Today 
he wants a commission of inquiry, he wants to spend more of the 
taxpayers' money, on top of the money that would have been 
squandered if we had allowed the airport contract to go ahead. No, 
Mr. Speaker, I myself am not ready, in any case, to launch into 
something like that, which would waste perhaps $100 million of 
the taxpayers' money, when we already know that the people of 
Canada did not want the Pearson contract. The people of Canada 
elected us to office, and one of the things they asked us to do was to 
examine it. We did so, we cancelled it, and we are proud to have 
done so. Now we must see to it that the people in the other place 
respect the wish of Canadians and of parliamentarians in this 
House.
<P>
	Let us leave all this behind and move on with an offer of good 
government for the people of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>]

consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. The
