	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure on 
behalf of our government to table the 1995 plan for immigration 
levels.
<P>
	One year ago this week our Liberal government took office 
and put in motion a new style of governing. That new approach 
included the creation of a department for citizenship and 
immigration. This new department better reflects the 
relationship that has always existed in Canada between 
newcomers to our country and nation building. The two are 
mutually reinforcing. Liberals believe in the positive 
constructive force that is immigration.
<P>
	Ten months ago I launched a process of consultation with 
Canadians on the future direction of our immigration program. 
Our consultations were guided by two principles: first, to 
engage Canadians in an informed and constructive debate, to 
debate issues, to debate facts, to debate figures, to debate 
expectations, to debate aspirations of what we want for our 
country, and to try to put aside as best we can, as dispassionately 
as we could as a nation, the myths and some of the 
misconceptions that unfortunately from time to time have 
gripped this very emotional area of federal public policy.
<P>
	The second was to reach out more broadly to Canadians, not 
only to talk to the traditional groups that have helped build this 
positive immigration policy but to involve all Canadians who 
wanted to make a contribution. The views of special interests are 
important but they must be balanced with the interests of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	In so far as that is concerned, it was important to try to bring 
into the tent for the very first time, at our government's 
initiative, the non-traditional players of immigration; to bring 
in the boards of education, the municipalities, the labour 
movement and the labour organizations, to give force to 
citizens, the ability to go to the microphones at York University 
or at the other places at which we met, and to voice their feelings 
and their beliefs about Canada and the immigration policy. The 
process of what we were doing could also be said to be equally 
important as the substance of what we were debating. For the 
first time we were enlarging that tent so that we would be able to 
try to build a consensus among the Canadian lobby for what we 
want our immigration policies to do for our country in the 
future.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We wanted to actively encourage broad participation: Over 
13,000 kits were distributed across Canada to school boards, 
elected officials, groups and individuals interested in 
immigration. One hundred and thirty thousand information 
tabloids were distributed. And Canadians responded.
<P>
	From February to September thousands of Canadians told us 
what they thought in town hall meetings and study circles. We 
received hundreds of letters.
<P>
	Six weeks ago we met in Ottawa at our national conference to 
listen and learn.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Today we are making the decisions that Canadians expect of 
their government and which participants asked us to make. 
Consultation will always be the hallmark of how this 
government decides policy. The ultimate purpose of 
government is to decide and to move forward.
<P>
	Today we table before Parliament our immigration policy for 
1995 and beyond, a policy rooted in our values and which 
reflects our ideals for our country.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	While we only have a few minutes to distil this plan, the 
document entitled ``A Broader Vision, Immigration and 
Citizenship Plan, 1995-2000'' represents a fundamental change 
to Canada's immigration program. In the past I believe too much 
emphasis was placed on the numbers game rather than on trying 
to produce a long term comprehensive plan that would give full 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7470"> 7470 </A></B>
<P>
expression and comfort and understandability to that eventual 
number.
<P>
	From our consultations a new approach has emerged, one that 
calls for a broader vision and a clearer sense of Canada's 
objectives. First, instead of putting a single number before the 
House of Commons, this plan introduces the concept of a range, 
a realistic range that for 1995 anticipates between 190,000 and 
215,000 immigrants and refugees will come to Canada.
<P>
	It is a range, realistic and honest, in terms of more or less what 
we would anticipate based on our decisions as a government and 
as a country but also on what those inventories across the world 
will yield because some of them are low. There are fewer 
independents coming to the country whether because it was of 
the bad shape of our economy or the fact that those economies 
were doing well or the perception that the doors were closed. 
The number of families is down. The number of business 
immigrants is down for similar reasons. We also have to take 
stock of those inventories across the world.
<P>
	What we heard across the country was the need for a better 
balance among the four categories of immigration. Sometimes 
we were too obsessed with the global one number figure that 
became the lightning rod for most of the debate. Instead we have 
four categories that we should pay close attention to and then 
decide how one plays off the other. What are the tradeoffs that 
we need to make between a family class category, an 
independent category, a business category and a refugee 
category?
<P>
	It seems to me that as a Parliament and as a government we 
need to give greater clarity, greater focus and make some of the 
trade-off decisions of how those compartments play with each 
other rather than simply talking about the end number of the 
equation.
<P>
	In looking to that balance the share of economic immigrants 
will rise from 43 per cent to roughly 55 per cent of overall 
immigration, while the family component will shift from 51 per 
cent to approximately 44 per cent over the period of the plan.
<P>
	This will make the immigration and citizenship program more 
affordable and sustainable. We remain determined to target 
immigration levels of approximately 1 per cent of the 
population over the long term based on our ability to absorb and 
settle immigrants.
<P>
	It should also be said that the whole question of the principle 
of family is not only contained in the family class category but 
throughout the program so that when we invite an independent 
immigrant to Canada that individual brings with him his 
immediate family. It is the same thing when we invite and accept 
a business immigration applicant as it is when we accept a 
refugee, he or she has an ability of bringing in the family.
<P>
	The family class is also beyond that narrow category and the 
principle of family is applied equally and compassionately 
across the spectrum which is based on a Liberal philosophy for 
immigration.
<P>
	Moreover, changes to the selection of skilled workers and 
immigrants will increase the economic benefits of immigration 
and lower the cost eventually of settlement. It is important as 
our documents raise that our point system be changed and 
adapted to the kind of skills that our country at this time 
requires.
<P>
	Pre-eminent among those skills is the whole question of 
language. That is priority number one, here in our country and 
how we deal with language abroad in terms of our visa officers.
<P>
	Other skills and aspects are education, age, experience, 
moving away from just the job classification to basic job skills 
that will allow those individuals to make an easier transition 
into the new economy, as well as the feature where people will 
now be having two, three and sometimes four careers in their 
lifetime. That shift is not born out of any movement. It is taking 
stock of the economy today. The forces moving the world are 
very different from the forces following the second world war. 
The tools we use in immigration, namely the point system, must 
be adapted to the pace of that change both globally and here at 
home.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	The new approach to family class will respond to the desires 
of many who cannot now sponsor those they would like to bring 
to Canada. It will also ensure that all sponsors are held 
responsible for fulfilling their obligations.
<P>
	Beginning with the 1995 plan, the refugee and immigration 
components will be managed separately. This will underscore 
the distinction between the protection and resettlement goals of 
the humanitarian and refugee program, of which Canadians 
should be very proud, and the economic and social objectives 
that frame the skilled workers, business and family class 
categories.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The plan renews our commitment to develop a new 
Citizenship Act designed to create a common bond between 
Canadians by birth and by choice. An increased emphasis on 
responsibilities, apart from rights, will underline the value of 
citizenship for all Canadians. Finally, the plan confirms our 
commitment to co-operate with the provinces in our shared 
responsibility for immigration.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The other major document we are tabling today talks about the 
strategic framework, looking down the 10-year road. I outline 
the direction the government intends to take immigration and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7471"> 7471 </A></B>
<P>
citizenship policy into the 21st century. It sets out a framework 
based on five basic and key elements.
<P>
	First, the enrichment of our social fabric through selection of 
immigrants and their successful integration into Canadian 
society as full participating citizens.
<P>
	Second, the supporting of Canadian economic growth through 
actively promoting our country as the best place in the world in 
which to live and work, something that the UN has recognized 
two years out of the last three.
<P>
	Third, the recognition of the importance that Canadians place 
on the family and maintaining that program in a manner that is 
sustainable and responsible.
<P>
	Fourth, the realization of Canada's humanitarian mission 
through a coherent strategy that separates the refugee and 
immigration streams and meets the twin challenges of 
protection and prevention. It reflects fully the commitments 
which the government made in September at the International 
Conference of Population and Development in Cairo.
<P>
	Fifth, the provision of fair access and ensuring that the rule of 
law is respected at all times by all people in our country.
<P>
	Throughout the elaborate and extensive consultations 
Canadians pointed to a loss of confidence in the immigration 
program's ability to control who enters Canada and to enforce 
the Immigration Act against those who have been ordered 
removed. Through legislative initiatives such as Bill C-44, 
which is before the House, we are seeking to restore Canadians' 
confidence and thus contribute to the government's broader goal 
of creating safe streets, safe homes, safe communities.
<P>
	The consultations also reveal that Canadians are concerned 
about the sustainability of Canada's social benefit system. The 
government is addressing that broader challenge by opening a 
dialogue on improving social security in Canada. For our part 
we will contribute to the solution by focusing more on those 
immigrants less likely to require public assistance.
<P>
	Changes to the sponsorship obligations and their more 
rigorous enforcement will enhance the fairness of access to 
social benefits. We have already begun discussions with the 
provinces and agreements on information sharing have already 
been signed with six municipalities in Ontario.
<P>
	In closing, a successful immigration policy has always been 
part of our history and our development as a nation. Liberals 
believe that immigration has worked well for Canada. Liberals 
believe that the forces of migration have helped build a nation 
when many other people view these forces as a negative.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	Liberals also believe that we need to manage those positive 
forces in the face of monumental change across the globe. The 
strategy and plan that I have tabled on behalf of my caucus and 
government sets the right direction as we prepare Canada for the 
21st century.
<P>
	The plan is fair, sustainable and affordable to the newcomer 
and to Canadians. I invite all members, indeed all Canadians, to 
join with us as we move forward boldly, confidently and 
aggressively into the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, although 
we received only this morning the document tabled today by the 
minister, we still have a few preliminary comments to make.
<P>
	As the minister said, consultations lasted 10 months and cost 
$1 million. Unfortunately, the paper before us does not outline a 
real policy on immigration and citizenship. We do not detect a 
dominant theme either in the minister's speech or in the 
document tabled today. We still do not know where the minister 
is going with regard to immigration and citizenship. We thought 
that today the minister would announce decisions or reveal what 
he intends to do in the years to come.
<P>
	All he said is that, in 1995, the number of immigrants will be 
between 190,000 and 215,000 and the number of refugees, 
between 24,000 and 32,000. Incidentally, this violates and 
contradicts the red book, whose goal was 1 per cent of the 
population per year.
<P>
	The goals set by the minister himself for the year 1994 will 
not be achieved. No more than 230,000 people will immigrate to 
Canada in 1994, instead of the 250,000 announced by the 
minister at the beginning of the year. We, however, agree with 
the minister about reducing the number of immigrants. We were 
told that the number of applications to immigrate to Canada is 
down, and we are also aware that the economic recovery is still 
creating difficulties, that the unemployment rate remains very 
high in Canada and even more so in Quebec.
<P>
	We would like the minister to focus on immigrant integration 
in 1995. Thousands of immigrants who come here cannot find 
jobs and do not receive government assistance either.
<P>
	As for refugees, we want to ensure that the minister will 
continue to honour Canada's international humanitarian 
commitments to this class of people seeking Canada's 
protection.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	There are still too many refugees in the world-more than 20 
million-and Canada must do its share in this regard; we in the 
Bloc Quebecois are very sensitive to this problem. The 
documentation submitted by the minister does not give us a very 
clear indication of whether he intends to respect Quebec's 
jurisdiction for immigration, if he intends to comply fully with 
the McDougall-Gagnon-Tremblay agreement signed in 1991, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7472"> 7472 </A></B>
<P>
which recognizes Quebec's exclusive right over the integration, 
reception and selection of immigrants.
<P>
	As you all know, Quebec is a distinct society. It has its own 
official language and as the only French-speaking state in North 
America, it must protect and encourage francophone 
immigration. Neither does the minister's document show us how 
he intends to promote immigration to Canada. We know that 
there is a growing feeling of hostility to immigrants and 
especially refugees, but we believe that the Canadian 
government and the provinces will have to inform the public 
about the benefits and positive aspects of this immigration.
<P>
	Immigration has made a tremendous contribution to Canada's 
economic prosperity. Immigration is necessary to deal with the 
demographic problems in Canada and Quebec. Immigration is 
necessary to renew our rapidly aging population. This must be 
explained. We must tell Canadians that the advantages far 
outweigh the disadvantages, that despite all the propaganda to 
the contrary, immigrants make less use of social services in 
Canada, that the crime rate of immigrants is less than the crime 
rate of Canadians born here.
<P>
	In his document, the minister does not say either how he will 
resolve the problem of appointments to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. He continues to make appointments. 
Complaints are still coming from lawyers, immigration and 
refugee groups, clients and the public at large. Some 
appointments not based on competence are still being made. 
Some appointments are still purely political and we would have 
liked the minister to propose mechanisms for making 
non-partisan appointments.
<P>
	Is it possible to create a committee of lawyers from the bar or 
immigration organizations so that there is a pre-selection before 
the commissioner is appointed? The minister does not deal with 
another problem, the backlog at the Department of Immigration 
and Citizenship. Too many cases are outstanding, too many 
applications take months and even years. The minister 
unfortunately endorsed the Conservative Party's decision to set 
up a processing super centre in Vegreville, Alberta, and this has 
caused a great many problems.
<P>
	People can no longer find their way around. Today you can no 
longer reach an official to explain the situation. You have to 
keep calling numbers which are always busy. It is not easy to 
obtain the documents to be completed and to submit an 
application.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Civil servants are not pleased with the system. Jobs were 
eliminated in Quebec and in all the other provinces. Services 
provided in French by the centre in Vegreville are not adequate.
<P>
	The minister also says that he will table a bill on citizenship. 
We are waiting for that legislation. I ask the minister to 
reconsider the concept of dual citizenship. The Standing 
Committee on Citizenship and Immigration has recommended 
to the minister that dual citizenship be eliminated. Such a 
measure would be an unacceptable step back, considering that 
countries now recognize more and more the concept of dual or 
triple  citizenship, and that the mobility of people has increased 
considerably throughout the world. We cannot eliminate such a 
precious right for all Canadians and particularly for those 
immigrants who want to keep a tie with their country of origin. 
This concept is good for Canada and also for immigrants, who 
can be good communicators with their country of origin and 
promote Canadian trade there. It is good that people can have 
this dual citizenship if they want it.
<P>
	We are also concerned by the fact that, in some documents 
given to us today, the minister talks about occupational training 
and about promoting co-operation between his department and 
the Department of Human Resources Development, regarding 
immigrants. We, Bloc Quebecois members, have clearly said 
that occupational training falls under exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. The federal government should not interfere in that 
sector. The provinces are closer to the client group. They are 
more aware of the needs in manpower training. The minister 
now says that his department will set up a vocational training 
centre for immigrants, in co-operation with the Department of 
Human Resources Development. This is unacceptable and the 
Bloc Quebecois strongly opposes this proposal by the minister.
<P>
	I also want to say that the Bloc Quebecois is a 
pro-immigration party. More often than not, we do not share the 
somewhat exaggerated views of our friends from the Reform 
Party regarding immigration and citizenship issues. Quebec is, 
and remains, a country, a nation and a province open to 
immigration. There is a consensus in our province in favour of 
accepting immigrants. Incidentally, we anticipate that, for 1995, 
Quebec will maintain the objective of 40,000 new immigrants; 
for 1996, it will be 42,000, while for 1997, the number should 
reach 43,000. Bloc Quebecois members, as well as Quebec 
society as a whole, are open to immigration, which we consider 
to be a source of social, cultural and economic wealth.
<P>
	I am proud to be an immigrant myself. I am proud to be a 
Quebecer and to be of Chilean origin.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am dumbfounded and Canadians should be outraged over what 
has just been revealed here by the minister.
<P>
	Almost a year ago this minister initiated a $1 million 
consultation during which thousands of well meaning patriotic 
Canadians put time, talent and energy to work proposing 
changes to immigration. During the last several months this 
minister has engaged in a series of well planned media leaks, 
floating trial balloons, raising expectations, talking a tough line 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7473"> 7473 </A></B>
<P>
and trying to out reform the Reform Party in policy, or at least 
that is the impression he has left.
<P>
	In the last week the minister admitted to a cost to the taxpayer 
of at least $700 million in family sponsorship breakdowns. He 
promised he would do something about it. This morning we 
found out that nothing has changed, nothing has been done. The 
consultations were a fraud. There has been a lot of talk, talk, 
talk, study, study, study, and it looks like the studying will 
continue.
<P>
	For anyone who wants a lesson in old style politics, we are 
learning it right now. It is a lesson in trying to manipulate the 
media, a lesson in trying to manipulate the public, a lesson in 
trying to please everyone by not offending anyone. It is a lesson 
in government inaction.
<P>
	One need look no further than this government and its 
minister of immigration to get a good picture of what has 
happened. Let me outline with no fancy language or rhetoric 
what the minister is going to do this year.
<P>
	The percentage of economic immigrants with their families 
was 43 per cent. In 1995 that number will still be 43 per cent. 
The percentage in the family reunification class of those already 
in Canada was 51 per cent. This year it will still be 51 per cent. 
Other immigrants were 6 per cent last year. This year, surprise, 
surprise, it is 6 per cent. The total number of immigrants 
accepted this year is 230,000. The total number expected next 
year is up to 215,000, a change of only 6 per cent.
<P>
	That is not a cut. It is nothing more than an expectation of 
lower application levels. The levels are so high that our sources 
in immigration tell us there are not enough applications to fill 
the slots. This minister wants to take credit for lower numbers 
and those lower numbers have nothing whatsoever to do with 
government action.
<P>
	A bond for sponsors will be studied but no immediate action 
taken. During the year or so this government plans to study this 
issue, Canadians will have to fork out at least $700 million more 
in sponsorship breakdowns. Where is the enforcement of what is 
happening here already to save those taxpayers dollars?
<P>
	Changes to refugee policy, there are virtually none, except an 
ongoing amnesty that rewards those who can tie up the system 
for three years. There are no changes to control and 
enforcement, except for the defective Bill C-44 which is already 
pending in the House.
<P>
	This minister said changes would be made that would make 
immigration work to the benefit of society. He said that more of 
an emphasis would be placed on independent immigrants. 
However this plan for the next year says that family 
reunification is still the highest priority of the government and 
that the ultimate goal of immigration levels equal to 1 per cent 
of the population still stands. We are talking about numbers in 
the vicinity of 300,000.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> I rise on a point of order, Mr. Speaker. I am 
sorry, but we cannot follow the debate because we cannot hear 
the simultaneous translation.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. We were having 
technical problems, which have now been solved.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hanger:</B> Listen to the minister's math on page 8. In 1995 
accompanying family and sponsored families together are 
expected to make up about 80 per cent of total immigration from 
the broader vision immigration and citizenship outline. On page 
9, economic immigrants, skilled workers and business 
immigrants will make up 43 per cent of the immigrant 
component for 1995. This percentage remains unchanged from 
1994. If you add up family and independent immigration you get 
a whopping total of 123 per cent. That is Liberal math. Nothing 
changes. The numbers are fudged. No action is being taken. 
Today's announcement is pure smoke and mirrors.
<P>
	This government thinks the Canadian people can be swayed 
into believing that non-action is action, that no real change in 
numbers means a cut, that tough talk equals tough action in the 
minds of the voters. Well I have news for government members. 
The people will not buy it.
<P>
	Today's announcement says that enforcement will be beefed 
up and that removals will be clarified when in fact the minister 
has created a permanent amnesty for failed refugee claimants. 
That is pretty convenient. Those people who have tied up and 
backlogged the system with taxpayer funded appeals, with legal 
manipulation for three years get an automatic amnesty.
<P>
	This government punishes those applicants for immigration 
who make a real contribution to this country, those who play by 
the rules, who fill out the right forms, who wait in queues that 
last for years in some cases. At the same time the government 
rewards those applicants who come in illegally, who work the 
system with legal aid lawyers and who can evade removal for 
three years. That is disgraceful.
<P>
	Let us look at the numbers again. The 1994 plan calls for 
30,700 skilled workers. The 1995 plan calls for 24,000 to 26,000 
skilled workers. The 1994 plan calls for 6,000 business class 
immigrants. The 1995 plan calls for 4,000 to 5,000 business 
class immigrants. The total economic class was 97,700 in 1994. 
This year it is 71,000 to 80,000.
<P>
	In other words we are looking at substantial cuts to those 
immigrants who can make an immediate and substantial 
contribution to the economy. There is no change to the level of 
those immigrants whose contribution is unknown and there is an 
amnesty for those immigrants who jump queue and abuse the 
system.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7474"> 7474 </A></B>
<P>
	Again the independent and economic classes are dropping 
substantially and do you know why? Because the same woolly 
headed policies that are guiding the immigration department are 
also guiding the finance department, the human resources 
department, and on and on.
<P>
	This Liberal government has created an economic climate of 
high taxes, huge debt and low return on investments. It is 
discouraging those immigrants who could contribute the most to 
the economy of the country. In fact in Calgary there are 
something like 400 business class immigrants who have not 
invested their money because they do not see any advantage in 
doing so. Canada is no longer an attractive place for investors 
and business people. It is however the most attractive 
destination in the world for queue jumpers and failed refugee 
claimants.
<P>
	The immigration plan speaks of a broader vision, a 10-year 
framework. It is a broader vision of the same old thing, a new 
framework for the same old policies. It has cost the immigrant 
program its legitimacy. It has discouraged independent 
immigrants. It has made the Canadian people fundamentally 
question the role of immigration to Canada. That is a shame.
<P>
<B>(1045 ) </B>
<P>
	Immigration can and should work for the country. 
Immigration should be about nation building. That term has 
been used by the government time and time again but it really 
rings hollow when said from that side. It should be about 
enriching Canada. It should be about benefiting immigrants and 
Canadians alike.
<P>
	The plan is about deceit, number fudging and politicking. The 
government has let down immigrants and Canadians alike.

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 27 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-57, an act to implement the agreement 
establishing the World Trade Organization, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is certainly 
a pleasure to be able to speak for a few minutes this morning on 
Bill C-57 and to talk about world trade and the importance of 
world trade to Canada and to Canadians, in particular the men 
and women who work in the country's agriculture and agri-food 
sector.
<P>
	The legislation we are discussing today will establish the new 
World Trade Organization or the WTO. It will incorporate the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a sweeping 120-nation 
accord which was agreed to in principle in December last year 
and was approved by member countries last March or April in 
Morocco. The agreement and the WTO which will administer it 
offer great benefits for Canadians in the creation of jobs, wealth 
and the opening and securing of new and vital markets for the 
country's export commodities.
<P>
	Canada is a nation that is dependent on trade, and we all know 
it. Nowhere is that more evident than in the agriculture and 
agri-food sector. In 1993 Canadian agri-food exports of $13.3 
billion contributed a surplus of almost $3 billion to Canada's 
balance of trade, almost one-third of Canada's total 
merchandise trade balance. As former Liberal agriculture 
minister, Eugene Whelan, once noted, agriculture pays the bills.
<P>
	At the same time Canada's share of the world agri-food 
market has declined since the early 1960s. In contrast the 
European union's share, particularly that of France and the 
Netherlands, has increased significantly. From Canada's per-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7475"> 7475 </A></B>
<P>
spective exports to Europe fell from $1.35 billion in 1981 to 
about three-quarters of a billion in 1993. At the same time our 
imports from the  European union rose from about $400 million 
to almost $1 billion. This tells us that while the sector is doing 
well it must continue to do better.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Last year the industry and federal and provincial governments 
agreed on the goal of increasing Canada's agri-food exports by 
50 per cent from $13 billion per year in 1993 to about $20 billion 
per year in 2000.
<P>
	In July of this year the agriculture ministers reaffirmed that 
goal and added a further target of achieving a 3.5 per cent share 
of world agri-food trade. That is an objective in line with our 
historic share, but it will push the requirements to meet that to 
exports which will reach a value and total of about $23 billion.
<P>
	In addition to steps that are being undertaken in Canada, the 
new WTO will have a large role to play in increasing our 
exports, increasing jobs and increasing prosperity. The World 
Trade Organization represents a significant step forward for the 
agriculture and agri-food sector. The agreement sets down for 
the first time ever clear rules for international trade of 
agricultural products.
<P>
	The agreement represents a substantial reduction in trade 
distorting export subsidies, better trade rules for agriculture, 
and improved and more secure access to markets around the 
world for Canadian producers and processors. It will greatly 
assist Canadian producers and processors in their continuing 
efforts to develop new markets around the world. The new 
markets will be in addition to the Mexican and U.S. markets that 
we have obtained through NAFTA. New rules will apply equally 
to all countries and the specific exemptions of countries will be 
eliminated. This will allow Canadians to compete in a more 
predictable and fairer international trading environment.
<P>
	What does it mean in real terms? The respected OECD or 
Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development 
predicts that for all sectors, the total, the agreement will inject 
almost $8 billion into the Canadian economy by the year 2002. 
That is $8 billion into the pockets of working men and women 
across the country over the next eight years.
<P>
	The government was elected to create jobs and wealth. That is 
why I am bullish on the WTO. I know some members, 
particularly those from Quebec, Ontario and Atlantic Canada, 
have some genuine concerns about just what sort of impact the 
agreement will have on the country's vital and prosperous 
supply managed sector, the dairy, egg and poultry sector.
<P>
	Let me take this opportunity to assure the House that supply 
management will be able to continue to operate as an effective 
Canadian approach to producing and marketing dairy and 
poultry products. The agreement supports the continuation of 
the supply managed industry through two fronts. The first front 
is the import tariffs first announced in December 1993. They 
will maintain a high level of protection for the sector. It is  true 
these levels will be reduced by a total of 15 per cent over the 
course of the next six years, but it will still afford producers and 
processors with the protection they require. The six-year phase 
in period will give them ample opportunity to make the 
necessary adjustments in order to compete and win in the new 
international marketplace.
<P>
	Imports which will be coming in under the minimum access 
commitments will not unduly disrupt the Canadian market. For 
butter the access commitment will rise from about 1,900 tonnes 
to around 3,200 tonnes from the year 1995 to the year 2000, a 
five-year period. In the poultry area import access of chicken 
will continue to be governed by the CUSTA or the FTA. Access 
for turkey will rise slightly to about 5,600 tonnes by the year 
2000 while egg access will also rise very slowly. It is unlikely 
there would be imports of dairy, poultry or egg products outside 
these access commitments since the tariff levels will make them 
uneconomical.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The government regards very seriously its commitment to the 
future and to the well-being of the supply managed sector. That 
is why on December 16, 1993 the federal and provincial 
agriculture ministers formed a small task force, headed by 
myself, to look into the specific implications for Canada's 
supply managed industries.
<P>
	After consulting with all stakeholders the task force proposed 
that an industry ad hoc review committee in each case be 
established for each commodity group sector. These ad hoc 
committees have been meeting throughout the year, will be 
meeting over the fall, and will continue to meet to determine 
whether a consensus can be reached on orderly marketing 
frameworks for the future. The task force was scheduled to 
report to the federal-provincial ministers meeting in December. 
I can report the results are very promising, although they have 
been incredibly challenging and are not all completed yet. 
Successful conclusions will be reached in order to maintain the 
sustainability of our orderly marketing system to the benefit of 
the industry and to all Canadians.
<P>
	The World Trade Organization also holds benefits for other 
sectors within the Canadian agricultural industry. Volumes of 
European union and United States wheat shipped with export 
subsidies will be reduced over the next six years by 40 per cent 
from the levels they are at present. The reductions in export 
subsidies for wheat, barley, vegetable oils and other grains are 
expected to significantly improve market prospects for 
Canadian grains and oilseeds in world markets.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7476"> 7476 </A></B>
<P>
	The agreement offers good export potential for other 
commodities as well. Replacing import restrictions and levies 
with tariffs in the European union, Japan and Korea will result in 
additional export opportunities for beef, pork, malt and a range 
of processed food products. The inclusion of an agreement on 
intellectual property rights will offer protection for Canadian 
whisky and wine names. This is expected to improve the 
marketing of these products throughout the world.
<P>
	Processed food and vegetables such as French fried potatoes, 
canned corn, frozen blueberries and raspberries, and other 
products such as honey, maple syrup and apples, will benefit 
from reduced tariff and non-tariff barriers notably in the 
European union and Japan. Special crops such as dried peas, 
beans, lentils, tobacco, mustard, canary seed and alfalfa will 
also benefit from improved access. For example, the European 
union will eliminate tariffs on lentils and white pea beans over 
the phase in period. Japan will reduce its tariffs on lentils by 36 
per cent.
<P>
	A framework of rules will reduce the misuse of technical 
measures as unjustified barriers to trade. Measures to protect 
human, animal and plant life or health, which measures were 
usually referred to as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, will 
be subject to clear disciplines. We will continue to have the right 
to establish the level of health protection that we consider 
appropriate in Canada. However, the measures any other 
country uses to achieve that level of protection must be based on 
a sound scientific approach.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the WTO will for the first time 
establish clear rules for international trade of agricultural 
products and eliminate heavy handed and unfair trade rules and 
restrictions. A good example is the U.S. and its use of the section 
22, a trade measure it has used that has been featured 
prominently in recent Canada-United States bilateral relations.
<P>
	When the World Trade Organization is implemented in 1995 
the United States will have to give up its GATT waiver which 
allows it to take section 22 trade actions. Obviously there will 
continue to be disagreements in our large and mutually 
beneficial trade. We will deal with those on an individual basis 
as they arise. Thanks to the WTO a particularly onerous piece of 
trade protection such as section 22 will be a thing of the past.
<P>
	As countries around the globe change to meet their WTO 
commitments, Canada too will have to make some adjustments 
in order to comply with the new world of international trade.
<P>
<B>(1100 ) </B>
<P>
	While the export subsidy provisions of the agreement will 
have an impact on the Western Grain Transportation Act, the 
Government of Canada has already been consulting with the 
sector to reform the WGTA. This consultation is designed to 
ensure that the WGTA better meets the needs of producers, 
industry and Canada's export customers and to bring it in line, 
along with other  government programs and policies, with the 
new fiscal realities being faced by the government.
<P>
	This consultation will ensure that affected stakeholders will 
have a vital role to play in crafting a made in Canada reform of 
the WGTA. Over the course of the next few months the Minister 
of Agriculture and Agri-Food will conclude these consultations 
with a view to being in a position to make an announcement 
early in 1995. The government is confident that these reforms 
can be implemented long before the World Trade Organization 
reduction provisions would take effect.
<P>
	The world is changing and it is imperative that Canada change 
with it, lest we will be left behind. The WTO will usher in a new, 
vibrant and exciting period in international trade, a period where 
clear trade rules will replace unfair and discriminatory trade 
barriers, where Canadian products will be able to compete in 
markets around the world on their own merit and not be hobbled 
by the extra weight of trade restrictions, where Canadian 
producers, processors and exporters do not head for the end zone 
only to find that the goal posts have been moved.
<P>
	As I said at the beginning, Canada is a trading nation. Much of 
its wealth depends on trade. Fully one in four jobs in this country 
are trade related. The agriculture sector, indeed all sectors, need 
the stability and the market certainty that the World Trade 
Organization has to offer.
<P>
	Canadians are ready, willing and able to do the job. They 
simply require access to the proper tools with which to do that 
job. The WTO will provide them with the necessary tools to 
compete and to win the export markets, to further hone our 
competitive edge and to create jobs and prosperity for all 
Canadians. I think they deserve that chance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to congratulate the parliamentary secretary for his speech on the 
World Trade Organization this morning. He shares a view that a 
lot of us share, that it is vitally important to Canada to 
implement the World Trade Organization.
<P>
	I was interested in his comments regarding agriculture and the 
fact that agriculture probably is one of the biggest winners in the 
GATT negotiations. For the first time we have trade rules 
established that are going to govern agriculture. I would like to 
ask if the parliamentary secretary shares my view that one 
important sector in agriculture still needs quite a bit of work, 
and that is the whole area of supply management. For the first 
time border restrictions have been converted to reducing tariffs. 
Very high levels of tariffs are set. It is my understanding that we 
have a second round of negotiations in agriculture down the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7477"> 7477 </A></B>
<P>
road, either in five or six years, under the World Trade 
Organization, once it is set up.
<P>
	I wonder if he shares the view that it is imperative that we 
continue to move this process along toward reducing tariffs with 
the ultimate goal in Canada and the United States of having free 
trade in the supply managed sector as well. Would it not be 
important to ask the supply managed industries to move toward 
a certain period of time? Everybody realizes that they need some 
time to adjust. I certainly do because these people have financial 
obligations which they had made under the rules of the day.
<P>
	However the new World Trade Organization is going to shed a 
lot of light on the fact that Canada has some weaknesses at 
home, as does the United States, in the area of supply managed 
tariffs that are extremely high. I wonder if the parliamentary 
secretary could share his views on how that can be achieved.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member across expects 
members on this side of the House to say that they do not believe 
in supply management of the dairy, egg and poultry sector, he is 
speaking to the wrong group. We believe in it. We support it. We 
are working with those sectors.
<P>
<B>(1105 ) </B>
<P>
	I have had the opportunity and still have the privilege of 
chairing the task force that is working with all of the 
stakeholders in the supply managed sector. Each one of the 
commodities, be they dairy, egg or poultry, are adjusting and 
evolving.
<P>
	I am sure the member is somewhat familiar with what has 
taken place during the last few weeks in the poultry industry. 
The supply managed industry has provided, at a reasonable cost 
to Canadian consumers, the highest quality, most constant 
supply of those products that any country in the world has 
without fluctuating prices. The supply is always there. It is of 
high quality and it is safe.
<P>
	In return it has given a tremendous amount of stability not 
only to the primary producer but to the processors and to the 
complete agri-food chain. They know where their product is 
coming from. They negotiate what the price is going to be and 
then the consumer knows that product will always be there and 
be of top quality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
during his main speech, the hon. member for Prince 
Edward-Hastings said earlier that supply management could 
be maintained. And then he started to talk about higher tariffs 
that could protect farmers working in a supply managed 
industry. Every member in this House knows full well that the 
supply and demand oriented farming industry is concentrated 
mainly in Quebec and in Ontario and that supply is regulated by 
quotas.
<P>
	In order to reassure me and to reassure our farmers, be they 
involved in dairy farming, poultry farming or egg production, 
can the hon. member tell us what will happen to their quotas?
<P>
	Again last week, I met a big dairy farmer who told me that he 
evaluated his quota at $750,000. He feared that the value of his 
quota would decline, even maybe down to nothing after six, 
seven or eight years. He said: ``Mr. Chrétien, my quota was my 
pension fund. If it is not worth a thing tomorrow morning, I have 
lost my pension fund''. If he loses his quota, this would be a hard 
blow to the real value of his farm.
<P>
	I would like the hon. member for Prince Edward-Hastings to 
reassure us, since, as you know, Quebec accounts for 48 per cent 
of all dairy production. Of course, most Western farmers are not 
subject to supply management. For these farmers, GATT is 
obviously a marvellous thing, but for Quebec farmers, it may 
not be so wonderful.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Vanclief:</B> Mr. Speaker, I beg to differ with the hon. 
member for Frontenac. The dairy farmers of Quebec and all of 
the supply managed sectors in Quebec know the value of supply 
management. If the translation was correct, he indicated that 
they did not realize the value or they did not know. However, in 
his previous comments he said that they did.
<P>
	Forty-eight per cent of industrial milk production in Canada 
is held by producers in Quebec, not 48 per cent of the total 
production. There is a lot of fluid milk or consumer milk but the 
industrial milk is that milk which goes for cheese and further 
processing. That is held in Quebec.
<P>
	I have said for a number of years and I will continue to say that 
even though there has been some tariffication used as border 
controls rather than a quantitative control, I am very confident 
that supply management will be there for those sectors for a long 
period of time.
<P>
	I question the member's statement of the value of quota. If the 
member looks at what has happened to the value of quota, he 
will find with very few exceptions that its value in the last 
number of months or since the GATT agreement of about a year 
ago has not increased. I do not believe it has decreased, but if it 
has it has been a very marginal amount. That happens over the 
years because of production et cetera. It will go up and down.
<P>
<B>(1110) </B>
<P>
	It is solid and it can be maintained. The government has 
shown very clearly in working with the all the stakeholders in 
the industry over the last number of months that it is our 
intention to maintain it for the betterment of all Canadians right 
from the farmer to the consumer.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7478"> 7478 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Benoît Tremblay (Rosemont, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
continue this morning second reading of this bill to implement 
the new GATT agreements and to establish the World Trade 
Organization. I must say this debate was brilliantly launched by 
the Minister for International Trade and by my colleague for 
Verchères who is the international issues critic for the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	Second reading provides for a discussion of the principles and 
general direction of a bill while more technical aspects are 
closely analyzed in committee and, if necessary, the Bloc 
Quebecois will table amendments at third reading.
<P>
	After long negotiations, Canada, like all other GATT 
members, must pass legislation bringing into force at the target 
or desired date of January 1st, 1995, the GATT agreements 
reached last April. These agreements strengthen significantly 
the legislative framework for international trade and define 
more clearly the rules of the game. They increase the number of 
sectors subject to these rules, improve the trade conflicts 
settlement mechanisms and, finally, establish the World Trade 
Organization, which we have been waiting for since the second 
world war.
<P>
	This is considerable progress towards equal opportunity on 
the world markets for small and medium-sized countries like 
Canada and Quebec and, in fact, most countries of the world. 
Even if great economic powers like the United States, Europe 
and Japan still largely control the negotiation process, once they 
agree to new rules, these rules apply automatically to all GATT 
members, which, then, can benefit from a greater protection for 
their international trade activities.
<P>
	Whith a level playing field, performance on the international 
markets depends less and less on the size of a country and more 
and more on its ability to design, produce and sell high quality 
products and services at competitive prices. Under such 
circumstances, small and medium sized countries can do quite 
well and even succeed better than large entities, as is proven 
every day in the world economy.
<P>
	I understand perfectly well the enthusiasm shown by the 
Minister for International Trade who said in his opening speech, 
and I quote: ``By creating a more open and stable international 
trading environment this agreement will generate increased 
Canadian exports and investment''.
<P>
	The minister is quite right and I can assure him that, on the eve 
of becoming a sovereign country, Quebec shares his enthusiasm 
and his understanding of the evolution of international trade 
rules.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Allow me to read another excerpt from his speech: ``Canada's 
economic strength now and in the future will depend 
fundamentally on our willingness to stay on the leading edge of 
freer trade, to continue to take an  active and creative role in 
forging new relationships and in building new structures that 
over time can extend the reach of a rules based international 
order.
<P>
	The multinational system centred on the World Trade 
Organization will be the foundation of that international order, 
but it is not the only element of what is and must be a complex 
and constantly evolving trade order. We must harness for 
positive ends the profound forces pushing us all toward deeper 
economic integration. Today it is more accurate to speak not of 
trade policy as such but of international economic policy''. And 
listen carefully, this is the minister speaking: ``Jurisdictions and 
policy areas that have long been considered to be 
quintessentially domestic are now increasingly subject to 
international negotiations and rule making''.
<P>
	The minister is perfectly right. Again, Quebec is in total 
agreement with the Minister for International Trade, so much so 
that one might wonder if the minister consulted Mr. Jacques 
Parizeau or Mr. Bernard Landry before he wrote his speech. That 
is exactly what we keep saying when we consider the future 
relations between Quebec and the rest of Canada.
<P>
	On the eve of a referendum that will determine the political 
future of Quebec and of the rest of Canada, I have to admit it is 
heartening to hear at least one federal minister making the 
realistic, clear and enthusiastic statement of the rules and 
policies that will govern economic relations between Canada 
and Quebec.
<P>
	That conclusion and the praise I give to the Minister for 
International Trade may come as a surprise, but it is quite simple 
and natural. How could the Canadian minister seek economic 
ties will all sovereign countries of this world and not with 
Quebec, when we already have significant and productive trade 
relations with the rest of Canada?
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers would have a hard time 
understanding such an attitude, and the whole world would be 
taken aback. But since other ministers, the Prime Minister 
included, do not have that same open and realistic attitude, let us 
specify what is at stake. While Quebecers wish their Canadian 
partners will have an open and realistic attitude, the rules 
governing our future economic relations will not depend on 
attitudes only, but largely on rules set under the GATT.
<P>
	It is largely a matter of international law, the broadening and 
reinforcement of which the minister praised today. Article 
XXVI(5)(c) of the GATT agreement provides that a new state 
carved out of a country which is already a member of GATT 
automatically becomes a member on becoming a sovereign 
state, provided it accepts conditions and requirements applying 
to the parent state. It is quite simple and clear. A C. D. Howe 
Institute study says that most Canadian experts fully recognize 
that fact.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7479"> 7479 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	It is primarily a matter of law. Quebec has already said that it 
would apply for membership and that it would accept all 
conditions and requirements that apply now to Canada. The only 
choice for the international trade minister, then, is to welcome 
the future relations between Quebec and Canada with the same 
enthusiasm he demonstrates for other sovereign states. He 
should so advise the Prime Minister. Given that the Prime 
Minister just said he likes a good fight, especially with Quebec, 
he will probably not greet the GATT rules with the same 
enthusiasm as that shown by his Minister for International 
Trade.
<P>
	According to what he said, if Quebec becomes politically 
independent, the rest of Canada will want to separate 
economically from Quebec while remaining associated with all 
other sovereign countries of the world. Well, Mr. Minister, you 
will have to tell your Prime Minister that Quebec being a de 
facto member of the GATT, the same rules will apply to Quebec 
as to all other sovereign countries members of the GATT, and the 
rest of Canada will have to abide by these rules.
<P>
	In international trade or GATT terms, this very simple 
principle is called the most favoured nation treatment. When a 
country gives a tariff concession to another member, that 
concession must immediately and unconditionally apply to all 
similar products coming from all member countries. That is one 
rule of law that will considerably restrain the Prime Minister's 
aggressiveness.
<P>
	But that is not all. GATT goes further. It does not merely 
prevent discrimination between countries. It also anticipates 
discrimination once the product is inside the recipient country 
and therefore prevents discrimination towards other domestic 
products. That is what we call the ``national treatment''. It 
requires that GATT members adopt legislations on sales, 
transport and usage of foreign products which are identical to 
those governing similar domestic products coming from 
national companies so that both foreign and domestic products 
be treated equally.
<P>
	The Prime Minister will have to admit that, if he is to abide by 
the law, his leeway is limited. Naturally, if his aggressive 
instincts are too vivid, he could break the rules of law and 
trigger a trade war with Quebec.
<P>
	If instincts were to prevail over reason, let me repeat word for 
word what his Minister for International Trade said when he 
tabled this bill. The agreement excludes the adoption of 
unilateral measures in response to trade disputes. The new 
integrated system of dispute settlement which would mean 
clearer rules, shorter waiting periods and, for the first time, an 
appeal process with a binding ruling, constitutes a major 
improvement in the previous GATT system.
<P>
	Finally, the effectiveness of the rules depends on the means of 
having them enforced. You will note that we now have an appeal 
process with a binding ruling, which means the possibility of 
having them enforced.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Consequently, this comprehensive reform of the multilateral 
system of trade dispute settlement represents a major advantage, 
although that is impossible to quantify for commercially less 
important countries such as Canada, which are fundamentally 
vulnerable to the unilateral approach of economic giants. That 
would also apply, of course, to Quebec and Canada, so that there 
would be no unilateral action in response. That argument 
applies, of course.
<P>
	What can we conclude from this short analysis of the GATT 
rules and the speech of the minister responsible for International 
Trade when comparing them to what the Prime Minister said 
about future economic relations between the rest of Canada and 
a sovereign Quebec?
<P>
	I think that you will agree with me that the Prime Minister of 
Canada seems to confuse the preparing of the referendum 
campaign with the preparing of an Halloween party. Instead of 
clearly and simply presenting the true face of future economic 
relations between Quebec and Canada, he is looking for a 
disguise to make people insecure, to scare them before the 
referendum, while we all know that, after a winning referendum 
for Quebec, the rest of Canada would simply not have a choice of 
rules to apply. It would have to imperatively and minimally 
follow the GATT rules.
<P>
	After the fact, the Prime Minister will undoubtedly seek to 
play down his strong language from the past referendum, the 
hardly concealed threats made before the referendum. He will 
probably want to explain to us that they were only minor 
mistakes which would certainly not force him to resign.
<P>
	I must admit that, personally, I have a lot of difficulty 
respecting that kind of politician. A politician who was saying 
during the last election campaign that he would not sign the 
North American Free Trade Agreement without major 
renegotiation, and who rushed enthusiastically to sign it a few 
weeks after taking office. Today, he is playing exactly the same 
game with the future economic relations between Quebec and 
Canada.
<P>
	During the last election, he did not fool Quebecers and they 
massively voted for members of the Bloc Quebecois. I dare hope 
that, today, the rest of Canada agrees more with the realism and 
enthusiasm of the Minister for International Trade, who is 
seeking to build open and stable economic relations with 
sovereign states, than with the narrow minded and obsolete 
attitude of the Prime Minister, when he talks about the future 
economic relations of a sovereign Quebec with the rest of 
Canada. The rest of Canada needs a spokesman like the Minister 
for International Trade to prepare its future economic relations 
with Quebec on an open, stable and  productive base which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7480"> 7480 </A></B>
<P>
would fit into the irreversible evolution of international 
economic rules.
<P>
	I can assure the minister that he will find in Quebec 
negotiators just as enthusiastic and determined as he is in 
supporting openness, stability and economic growth, something 
which would be mutually profitable.
<P>
	Today, thanks to this bill, we were able to discuss GATT. I can 
say that we are just as prepared and willing to discuss possible 
negotiations with regard to free trade, the auto pact and all the 
other commercial rules that bind Quebec and Canada.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened with great interest to the comments by the 
hon. member from the Bloc about a potential trade relationship 
between Canada and Quebec as a result of a Quebec separation.
<P>
	The hon. member has the perfect right to ask these questions 
even in a hypothetical situation in this Parliament. It is part of 
the longstanding plan to make what is unacceptable acceptable. 
If they talk about it long enough they will just wear us down and 
we will accept it as fact.
<P>
	However, I would like to pose to my colleague the following 
scenario. Other Bloc speakers have addressed the importance of 
supply managed industries, particularly the dairy industry, to 
Quebec. As a matter of fact, with 25 per cent of the population 
Quebec industrial milk supplies almost 50 per cent of Canada's 
total needs.
<P>
	In a sovereign Quebec competing on a worldwide basis for 
these fundamental products, what does my colleague think 
would happen to that quota in the rest of Canada? Does my hon. 
colleague think for one moment that consumers in the rest of the 
country would continue to pay a premium price for supply 
managed or priced fixed products?
<P>
	Supply management is a euphemism depending upon whether 
you benefit from it or pay a premium for it. If you benefit from 
supply management it is great. If you happen to be a consumer it 
is price fixing. Supply management and price fixing depend 
upon which side of the equation you are on.
<P>
	Sooner or later Quebec will not have the benefit of supply 
managed or price protected industries. Quebec will have to 
compete on a worldwide basis. Would the hon. member please 
respond to the core question. With a sovereign and separate 
Quebec does he think that the rest of the country will continue to 
buy Quebec products at a premium price?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for 
Edmonton Southwest for his comments and question. Of course, 
you can approach this debate on the general principle armed 
with technical data, but we will have an opportunity later on, in 
committee and at third reading,  to talk about the more technical 
details, especially the GATT provisions regarding this issue. 
Canada cannot unilaterally change existing or agreed upon 
rules. We will have an opportunity to discuss this some other 
time.
<P>
	In general, in Canada, we have a whole series of protected 
industries, although to a lesser degree than previously. The 
member may know that because of subsidies, transportation 
costs between Ontario and the maritimes are much lower than 
between Montreal and Louiseville, which is only 30 kilometres 
away. Subsidies are going to be decreasing because they will no 
longer be allowed on the world market in which we must 
compete.
<P>
	The member also knows that for the past few years, it has cost 
billions of dollars to support grain producers and that in view of 
the present financial situation, it will soon no longer be possible 
to provide the same level of support. Trade negotiations are 
aimed at reducing grain subsidies in all the countries.
<P>
	The same is true of production quotas. We are aware of it; 
indeed, it is planned under the GATT agreement. Nothing comes 
as a surprise. The GATT agreement provides for quotas to be 
replaced by tariffs which will gradually decrease.
<P>
	What you are saying is that should Quebec become politically 
sovereign, Canada could unilaterally decide to speed up the 
reduction of tariffs, which is already provided for under the 
GATT agreements. My answer is that we have the GATT rules. 
You can always try it; we will see what happens during the GATT 
negotiations, unless Canada wants to withdraw from GATT and 
isolate itself from the rest of the world. The rules are there. Of 
course, farmers will have to adapt.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	You know what the problem is. Assistance to help farmers 
adapt is completely ineffective.
<P>
	I can tell you that last week the Bloc Quebecois met with the 
president and the executive director of Quebec's Union des 
producteurs agricoles. The executive director is a well known 
economist who has, on a number of occasions, advised the 
American government on agricultural issues and who knows the 
agricultural side of international trade very well. He is quite 
prepared to deal with the realities of GATT and the international 
scene and is aware that agriculture in Quebec will have to adapt, 
as it has in other countries.
<P>
	As I am sure you know, the GATT agreements provide for a 
certain number of stages and, within a certain number of years, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7481"> 7481 </A></B>
<P>
these trade barriers will have to be lowered. But, as you know, 
there is also the problem of the quality of what we are feeding 
animals. When is a chicken a chicken? Is the quality of milk 
nowadays, with all the new hormones, the same as it once was? 
It has reached the point where we wonder whether we are 
looking at a chicken or a chemical product.
<P>
	So, there are problems with respect to the quality of animal 
feed and of milk. A well known French scientist has said that, 
for the first time in the history of the world, we are beginning to 
wonder if science is serving mankind. For decades, until the 
atomic bomb, we were not in any doubt. Now we are asking 
questions about the food supply, <I>in vitro </I>fertilization, the list 
goes on. We are wondering if science is truly serving us. Before 
liberalizing all food trade with the United States, we must stop 
and think about the health of Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
always dangerous when we get into the realm of the 
hypothetical. My friend from the Reform Party, the member for 
Edmonton Southwest, posed a very significant question. 
Whether Quebec separates or not it will have to deal with the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	I do not think there was an answer with regard to how we 
would deal with it, if it would be more effective than it is now or 
not. Our Prime Minister is from Quebec. Our finance minister 
comes from Quebec. The interests of Quebec can be best served 
by our current system. There will be some arrangements and 
what have you.
<P>
	The rest of Canada will suffer and Quebec will suffer should it 
separate. The people of Quebec have to understand that they are 
going to substitute one set of people, intellectuals, government 
for another. They have to ask if that is going to be a better 
method than the current one. It will get terribly problematic.
<P>
	The member for Edmonton Southwest posed a question about 
the milk quotas. We have a lot of agreements as part of the 
family. What happens when you are not part of the family and 
you are separated? What happens in a case like that? We are in 
the hypothetical realm.
<P>
	The interests of Quebec are served best by the current system. 
Notwithstanding that, it will change because the dynamics of the 
way humanity is going have to change. We have come through 
different kinds of revolutions. We have come through the 
industrial revolution and we are into the information era now.
<P>
	Quebec does a lot of good things. Its court systems are good. 
The way it deals with young people is good. There are a lot of 
things that the rest of Canada can learn from Quebec. However, 
for Quebec to go with this bunch of intellectuals who are just 
seeking power for their own sake I think is wrong.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just like to say that I did 
not hear anything of consequence in my colleague's 
intervention. As for his attempt to tell Quebeckers that he likes 
them better than their members of Parliament, I will let them be 
the judge of that.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I listened to the debate preceding my speech on 
Bill C-57, I am almost tempted to change it and make a few 
remarks with regard to a separate Quebec and what would 
happen to supply management as it now exists in the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Needless to say, I would briefly say that the hon. member for 
Rosemont is circumventing the issue and is not prepared to deal 
very frankly with his constituents and the people of Quebec as to 
what would happen if there were a separate Quebec trying to 
deal in trade issues with the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The purpose of my address this morning to the House is to 
speak to Bill C-57. I want to speak to it more directly as it 
affects grain transportation in western Canada. This bill will 
very directly affect the lives of my constituents in 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. On balance this bill will have a very 
positive effect on the farming industry and I fully understand the 
need for this piece of legislation.
<P>
	I have some concerns about some of the things that are not in 
the bill and the fact that in many areas more should have been 
done. It is essential that this World Trade Organization 
agreement be implemented to move the combatants in the 
international trade war in the direction of trade, peace and 
sanity.
<P>
	This large, three-inch thick bill represents the successful 
completion of the Uruguay round of the GATT and this 
agreement is the largest, most complex and most comprehensive 
trade negotiation ever undertaken. The major agreement for 
Canada is the introduction of a common set of rules to govern 
trade in agricultural products.
<P>
	This bill has the effect of causing changes in 31 existing 
statutes to bring Canada's internal trade distortions in line with 
international regulations. I will concentrate my remarks today 
on the changes to the Western Grain Transportation Act and the 
impact they will have on the agricultural industry, particularly 
the Canadian Wheat Board region of Canada.
<P>
	Unfortunately this legislation makes only the minimum 
possible changes to the WGTA in order for it to comply with the 
new GATT and World Trade Organization rules. I believe we 
must continue to work toward a complete overhaul of the WGTA 
to make it relevant to today's realities. I am discouraged that the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7482"> 7482 </A></B>
<P>
Liberals are making only minor changes only because they have 
been forced to.
<P>
	The WGTA was enacted in 1983 and it is recognized that the 
requirements for agricultural transportation have changed. 
Farmer productivity was up and is up. Farms were bigger and 
crop yields were growing rapidly.
<P>
	The minor changes to the grain transportation system found in 
this bill fail to recognize that the changes in the industry since 
1983 have continued the pre-WGTA trend. It has become clear 
that the international community views the current grain 
transportation system as a direct subsidy.
<P>
	Bill C-57 makes very few changes to the act ensuring 
technical compliance with international rules at present. 
However, this is minimum compliance and will come back to 
haunt us for two reasons. The fact is that as the schedule of 
GATT regulations come into force we will have to continue to 
make changes to our transportation system.
<P>
	Rather than a real overhaul of the system to prepare Canadian 
agriculture for the 21st century, the Liberals would rather make 
a series of small changes with an eye to preserve as much as 
possible of the past.
<P>
	The second reason why making only minor changes to the 
WGTA is inadvisable is that these changes will create some 
inequities and biases between Canada's grain handling ports.
<P>
	The Lakehead port at Thunder Bay gets singled out in the 
subsidy regulations from the other main terminals in Vancouver, 
Churchill and Prince Rupert. Historically Thunder Bay has been 
favoured over western ports and this entrenchment of special 
status will only deepen farmers' resentment of the system.
<P>
	Legislators have always defended this action with 
assumptions that it is cheaper to ship grain east through Thunder 
Bay than to go to the west coast.
<P>
	However, a 1992 study by the National Transportation 
Agency revealed that it actually cost on average $1.04 more per 
tonne to ship east. It would appear that even in the face of this 
evidence, the special treatment continues. The St. Lawrence 
Seaway is sinking in debt and burdened with growing costs and 
shrinking traffic. Those in the industry are concerned that the 
changes to the Crow rate will spell the end for the seaway.
<P>
	Rather than make the necessary transportation reforms to help 
the ailing waterway, it seems the government has decided to 
play politics with agricultural transportation policy.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	The introduction of this bill provides an excellent opportunity 
to completely overhaul the WGTA. The grain transportation 
issue has been studied to death. It is clear that farmers are 
calling for a much improved system. I realize this government 
prefers studies to action but there have already been so many 
studies on this issue that there are no more studies that are 
conceivable.
<P>
	I really have to question the reasoning behind creating a two 
tier system for grain transportation, one for Thunder Bay and 
one for everyone else. Under the new regulations for Vancouver, 
Churchill and Prince Rupert ports there will be a cap on the 
amount of grain that can receive the WGTA subsidy.
<P>
	More specifically this cap takes the following form: one, the 
volume of subsidized exports must be reduced from 1993 levels 
by 21 per cent over a six year period; two, the level of total 
expenditures on export subsidies must be reduced over a six year 
period by 36 per cent within a minimum of 15 per cent for each 
specific commodity; three, over that six year period the level of 
domestic support programs must be reduced by 20 per cent.
<P>
	Regional development, research, environmental protection 
and farm income protection programs are exempt. In the area of 
market access all measures other than tariff duties must be 
replaced by tariffs and lowered by an average of 36 per cent over 
the six years.
<P>
	After the cap is exceeded 100 per cent of the transportation 
subsidy will be paid by the shipper who will then pass that cost 
on to the producers. There will be none of these caps for grain 
moved through the Thunder Bay terminal. Very interesting. This 
encourages gross distortions like shipping grain to Thunder Bay 
and then back out west before export just so it can qualify for the 
WGTA subsidy.
<P>
	It is no wonder our competitors have reservations about our 
system. It might look as though this is a way of subsidizing 
Canada Steamship Lines and the other lake freighter companies, 
some which may affect the business interests of the Minister of 
Finance.
<P>
	Although changing the way the WGTA operates will create 
some administrative difficulty, the common rules that our 
international competitors now use are of net benefit to Canadian 
farmers. Compliance may have some drawbacks for the 
administrators but it is clearly in the best interests of farmers.
<P>
	As I said before these changes that the government is making 
are generally good but it would have been much better to 
completely overhaul the transportation system.
<P>
	Currently the WGTA legislates that the Crow benefit is to be 
paid to the railroads. There has been an ongoing debate in farm 
circles about the advisability of the pay the producer model for 
transport assistance. There are those who have argued that it 
would be much more effective and efficient to pay the Crow 
subsidy directly to farmers and then have those producers pay 
for the full cost of shipping a product to export.
<P>
	Reformers have argued that the best way to encourage 
efficiency in the system and to ensure that our agricultural 
industry is GATT green is to undertake a complete overhaul and 
consolidation of government agricultural support. We have 
argued that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7483"> 7483 </A></B>
<P>
WGTA spending should be included in a new trade distortion 
adjustment program available to farmers caught under  siege in 
the trade war between the U.S.A. and Europe. Our trade 
distortion program could be harmonized with the phase down 
export subsidies of our trading competitors, particularly the 
U.S.A. with its EEP program. We could target producers who are 
caught in the crossfire of the trade war.
<P>
	This trade distortion adjustment program appears to meet all 
the GATT conditions for fair trade. It is publicly funded. It is not 
commodity specific. It does not provide artificial price support 
to producers. Not only would this kind of reform comply with all 
of the GATT and WTO regulations, it would also provide the 
Canadian industry with a more efficient system. A consolidated 
support system would provide farmers with a more cost 
effective agricultural plan that is more responsive to an ever 
changing environment.
<P>
	A thorough reform of the grain transportation system would 
have to correct the many problems within the current WGTA. 
The current system encourages inefficiencies like the 
backhauling of carloads of grain from Thunder Bay which I 
mentioned earlier. In many cases the same grain is shipped from 
Winnipeg to the lakehead and then back again. Not only is this 
gross waste but it is being done in part with taxpayers' money. 
Unfortunately the minister of agriculture is delaying the action 
he promised to rectify this absurd practice forced on us by the 
WGTA.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	Canada probably has the most inefficient hopper car 
allocation system in the world. No doubt the Soviet Union had 
one which was worse but it sort of went out of business. There 
are far too many different players with their fingers in the car 
pool. Everyone in the industry, the producers, the grain 
companies, the Canadian Wheat Board, the grain transportation 
agency and the railroads have cars going every which way and 
no one has the overall control to allocate and co-ordinate grain 
cars in the Canadian Wheat Board region.
<P>
	One possible solution to that problem is to at least consider 
privatizing the railway's rolling stock. Economic incentives 
matter and it is unlikely that someone whose livelihood depends 
on the efficient movement of hopper cars would continue the 
current practice of bunching up idle cars at one end of the line 
while grain is waiting at the other. Neither would they let them 
sit for weeks at the end of sidings, either full or empty.
<P>
	In the small community of Kyle in my constituency quite 
often the railroad sends the cars down to the community. If they 
would just work for 15 more minutes they could spot all those 
cars and they would be filled that day and hauled out of the 
community back on their way to export. In fact, because of the 
regulatory system we have those cars cannot be spotted until the 
train sits for eight hours. The cars are then spotted after that 
period of time. This does not happen all the time but does occur 
quite often. The crew then leaves Kyle leaving the empty cars 
behind. The cars could have been filled  during that eight hour 
period but some of the regulations would have to be changed.
<P>
	The other day a train arrived in the small community of 
Beechy in my constituency. Because of a mixup in orders 
several cars left the community empty. There was no procedure 
whereby those cars could be allocated from one company to 
another that had the right grain and could fill the orders at that 
time.
<P>
	There is another incident I would like to raise. A friend of 
mine travels quite frequently between Calgary and my 
constituency. He kept driving by the same cars which were 
sitting on a siding in Hanna, Alberta. He was curious so he wrote 
down the serial numbers of the first and last cars sitting on the 
siding to make sure it was the same group of hopper cars sitting 
there. Several months later when he drove by the same hopper 
cars were sitting on the same siding, not rolling, not serving the 
purpose for which taxpayers' money went toward in buying 
those cars. The system has to change.
<P>
	The current system has no incentives for efficient 
performance in shipping grain. Perhaps more important, there 
are no penalties for inefficient performance. All of the players in 
this system are not adequately encouraged to make the system 
work beyond their own small involvement in the whole process.
<P>
	The current system is inflexible and tends to reflect the 
agriculture production of yesterday. Our transportation system 
should serve the agriculture economy of today and have a very 
watchful eye on the future. The inflexibility of the WGTA, both 
of today and after the minor changes enacted by this bill, stifles 
that evolution.
<P>
	Farmers of today have diversified and are now growing 
canola, lentils, peas, mustard and canary seed, to name just a 
few of the newer farm commodities. Currently our 
transportation system is not adequately equipped for this 
diversity and is therefore not serving the needs of Canadian 
farmers.
<P>
	Also, the current system hinders innovation in transportation 
solutions. For instance, many private operators have offered to 
take over the branch lines which the CN and CP can no longer 
afford to run. These entrepreneurs have usually been blocked at 
every step by the government, crown corporations and other 
quasi-governmental agencies. I cannot imagine why the 
government would hinder any proposal that would provide a 
service to Canadian farmers which it cannot provide.
<P>
	In short, the Canadian grain transportation industry needs a 
complete overhaul to bring it into the 1990s and prepare it for 
the next century. This bill makes a few long overdue 
adjustments to the system, but again only the minimum was 
done to ensure compliance with GATT.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7484"> 7484 </A></B>
<P>
	I cannot oppose this bill because the ratification of the GATT 
agreement through this World Trade Organization bill is 
absolutely essential if we are to effectively participate in the 
wide areas of trade and export.
<P>
	I challenge the government to do more than tinker with the 
WGTA. In fact, I challenge this government to break down the 
dozens of interprovincial trade barriers which prove that our 
country is functioning less efficiently within our borders than 
we are prepared to function with our trading partners through 
this new World Trade Organization agreement. I challenge our 
government to bring agriculture support mechanisms into the 
21st century. I challenge the ministers of trade and agriculture to 
follow up Bill C-57 with a complete and very necessary reform 
package.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member of the Reform Party said so well, Canada is a 
big country. And in this big country, there are wide differences 
in both views and geography. The same applies to agriculture.
<P>
	Throughout his speech, my Reform Party colleague had a lot 
to say about grain producers, the Western Grain Transportation 
Act and hopper cars that ride empty in order to get the subsidies, 
but at no time did he mention the problem of Eastern producers, 
or only in passing. Most of these producers earn their living 
under a supply management system.
<P>
	I hope that the tariffs that will eventually be substituted for 
supply management will be high enough to protect our farmers 
in Quebec and Ontario, including dairy, poultry and egg 
producers. These tariffs are supposed to go down by 15 per cent, 
while all tariffs will reach 36 per cent over a six-year period.
<P>
	My question for my Reform Party colleague is this: How does 
he see the position of article XI in the GATT negotiations, which 
raises the question whether the markets of farmers who depend 
on supply management will be sufficiently protected? I realize 
that since the hon. member lives in Western Canada, he was 
more intent on the needs of his own constituents, and I 
understand that, but Quebec is still part of Canada-for a little 
while yet, I hope.
<P>
	I would appreciate the hon. member's opinion on supply 
management and tariffs, as well as his party's position on these 
issues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the question from 
my colleague from the Bloc. I would first like to inform him that 
there are supply managed producers not only in western Canada, 
but a number of them are in my constituency. A number of them 
support the Reform position with regard to what will happen to 
supply managed industries.
<P>
	During the election campaign Reform was the only party that 
was calling a spade a spade. We said there were going to have to 
be changes to the supply management industry if we were going 
to be able to comply with the GATT negotiations that were under 
way at that time and which were not completed until after the 
election.
<P>
	In fact what we predicted almost happened to be 100 per cent 
accurate. The import quotas were replaced by tariffs. We 
suggested those tariffs would have to be high enough to protect 
those industries during a transition period to a global market 
economy. The GATT agreement has actually been very generous 
to the supply managed industries in that there are extremely high 
tariffs in place, 300 per cent tariffs for many commodities, 
which basically excludes any importation of those products.
<P>
	As a result of this World Trade Organization agreement and 
regulation it seems that the supply managed industries have 
preferential treatment over many other sectors of agriculture 
which are phased down more quickly and have to take much 
greater reductions in subsidies.
<P>
	I would respond to the hon. member in saying that the supply 
managed industries have probably fared better than the majority 
of producers in my part of the country who are going to see 
substantially higher reductions in the subsidies they receive.
<P>
	I would also take this opportunity to remind the hon. member 
that if he does get his way and Quebec does separate from the 
rest of the country, these favourable conditions certainly would 
be very difficult to sustain. I am sure that Canadians would not 
continue to give the province of Quebec as high as a 50 per cent 
market share of industrial milk into Canada for instance.
<P>
<B>(1200) </B>
<P>
	It would be wise if he would explain the situation to his 
constituents. In fact they would be hurt much more by opting out 
of Canada than by remaining in Canada, even though we agree 
that supply management has to be reformed and that some of the 
basic rules under which it functions have to change.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will try to be as brief as I can. I was a little upset by what I just 
heard from my Reform Party colleague, when he said that if, as 
they say, Quebec should separate from the rest of Canada, the 
rules for selling Quebec milk on the Canadian market would no 
longer be the same.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7485"> 7485 </A></B>
<P>
	May I remind the hon. member that Western Canada, and 
especially Alberta, enjoys certain facilities for marketing its 
beef in Quebec which are also very attractive.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Eight hundred million.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bergeron:</B> Eight hundred million dollars worth of beef 
annually, I am told. That is quite a lot. I imagine Canada will not 
be so stupid as to jeopardize its markets in Quebec by trying to 
strong-arm a future sovereign Quebec. The president of the 
Mouvement Desjardins said that if Canada wanted to play hard 
ball with Quebec after sovereignty, the financial consequences 
would probably be the same for both parties.
<P>
	Since Canada is a free trade country-at least I hope so-and 
since it is a capitalist country and wants to make a profit, it will 
not forego this attractive market in Quebec and thus will not 
close its own markets to Quebec products, which would make it 
vulnerable to the same treatment from Quebec.
<P>
	That being said, my Reform Party colleague should also 
realize that in a North American free trade context, these 
so-called threats that Canada might close its doors to products 
from Quebec are an anachronism, and Quebecers realize this.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is interesting the hon. 
member would refer to the beef industry because it is one of the 
most freely traded commodities in Canada. If there is anything 
we have done in Canada in the way of regulation it is to help the 
beef industry in central Canada by shipping our feed grains to 
eastern Canada at subsidized rates under the Western Grain 
Transportation Act, which I said should be eliminated and 
administered in different ways.
<P>
	I am not sure if there is a problem with the beef industry in 
Quebec, but I assure the hon. member that industry is not 
subsidized in western Canada. I am not sure if it is in his part of 
the country. The only area where there are significant subsidies 
is in the transportation of feed grains to his part of the country 
for the beef industry there.
<P>
	It must be that the producers in western Canada are very 
efficient and are able to make a profit in the marketplace. I 
applaud that and say that if they lose the Quebec market I am 
sure they will be able to fill other markets without any difficulty.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to draw the attention of 
my colleagues to the specific impact on culture of the current 
trend towards globalization. We are now examining Bill C-57, 
an Act to implement the Agreement Establishing the World 
Trade Organization. The purpose of this bill is to harmonize 
Canadian laws with the broad principles negotiated by GATT 
members.
<P>
	During the Uruguay Round, we maintained and we continue to 
maintain, that in these wide-ranging global trade talks, culture 
should enjoy special safeguards that respect the sovereignty of 
states and their desire to preserve their specific identity. We are 
of course referring to the demands made by the Americans to 
include culture in free trade.
<P>
	The Americans have been trying to impose their cultural 
industry throughout the world for some time. The U.S. 
audio-visual industry is their second largest export sector. They 
have been able to develop a very powerful industry, since their 
domestic market is the biggest in the world.
<P>
<B>(1205) </B>
<P>
	That is why according to them, culture should be considered 
as just another commodity, like a pair of shoes or a computer. In 
fact, the Americans totally dominate the industry.
<P>
	As early as 1947, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
contained a major provision, article IV, which was intended to 
protect national cultures against the unbridled implementation 
of the principle of the free movement of goods. This article 
covered special provisions relating to cinematography. Member 
countries were allowed to set screening quotas, in other words, a 
minimum of domestic films to be screened in the country 
concerned.
<P>
	In 1961, the Americans demanded national treatment as 
provided under article III and felt that the quantitative 
restrictions imposed by certain states, including Canada, with 
respect to U.S. television programs were discriminatory and 
violated article III. Canada argued that its right to impose such 
restrictions arose from article IV of the agreement, which 
provided that a country had the right to limit access to its film 
market. In fact, Canada extended to television its right to limit 
the screening of foreign films. Of course in 1947, when the 
GATT agreements were signed, television was a technology 
whose impact was hardly predictable.
<P>
	Various attempts to reach an agreement were unsuccessful, so 
that as far as television programs are concerned, the intent of 
article IV is still not quite clear. However, the controversy 
clearly showed the lack of enthusiasm of the American 
government for trade restrictions on cultural grounds.
<P>
	In the late 1970s, the Americans are at it again. The GATT 
secretariat is mandated by the contracting parties to compile a 
list of all non-tariff barriers. The US list mentions various 
foreign practices designed to limit the importation of American 
cultural products. Also and for the first time, the United States 
denounced the subsidization of national film producers and 
distributors practised in 21 member countries. Again, the 
principle of financial freedom advocated by American interests 
clashes with that of cultural development and national identity. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7486"> 7486 </A></B>
<P>
This exercise did not result in any concrete measures at the 
Tokyo Round, in particular because the  major part of the 
cultural product was often considered within the OECD as 
falling under trade in services instead of trade in goods, which 
automatically excluded it from the scope of the GATT 
agreement.
<P>
	Starting in 1986, at the insistent request of the United States, 
three new subjects were to be covered in the new round of trade 
negotiations: intellectual property, investments and services, 
culture being assimilated to a service. It then became 
increasingly difficult to exclude cultural products from the 
market logic peculiar to GATT.
<P>
	In 1990, in the context of these negotiations, a special 
committee was set up to look into the liberalization of trade in 
the specific area of audiovisual. Two opposite sets of views were 
represented in this committee, with the United States insisting 
that no restriction be put on the movement of goods and 
services, while the European Community was asking that, where 
the cultural identity of a state were involved, the State in 
question not be forced to make concessions that could put its 
cultural identity at risk. This committee was eventually 
dissolved, it being absolutely impossible for its members to 
come to an agreement.
<P>
	At the same time, Canada was negotiating a free trade 
agreement with the United States. And again, culture and 
cultural sovereignty were at the centre of the debate. All the 
lobbies directly or indirectly associated with cultural industries 
set out to convince negotiators and the public that cultural 
products had to be excluded from this agreement. The 
Conservative government changed its mind on this issue 
depending on which way the wind was blowing: one day, culture 
was on the table; the next day, cross my heart and hope to die, it 
was not.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	Completely contradictory statements made it impossible to 
get at the truth. The government claimed that the question of 
cultural sovereignty was not negotiable, but in fact did not 
demand the exclusion of the cultural industries for fear of 
jeopardizing the success of the negotiations. Furthermore, 
during the negotiations, the government scrapped a film bill 
designed, among other things, to guarantee better control over 
the distribution of foreign films within Canada.
<P>
	In other words, even while the North American Free Trade 
Agreement was being hammered out, the Canadian government 
was backing away from one of its fundamental responsibilities 
intended to support cultural development. Knowing that 
Americans produce 97 per cent of the films we see, we cannot 
help but be concerned by the lack of vision of the Canadian 
government of the day.
<P>
	The withdrawal of this bill is a threat to our cultural future. In 
fact, according to the experts, the cultural protection obtained 
by Canada in the Free Trade Agreement and renewed in NAFTA 
remains ambiguous and could be challenged. This ambiguity is 
summed up in article 2005 of NAFTA. Paragraph 1 provides that  
cultural industries are exempt from the provisions of the 
agreement, and paragraph 2 allows the Americans to take 
reprisals in other areas of activity if they feel that Canadian 
cultural policy goes against their interests. So much for 
Canada's ability to undertake any legislative measures 
necessary to further its cultural development. Such measures 
could be ill viewed by the Americans, who would take 
retaliatory action by virtue of the powers given them under 
paragraph 2 of article 2005.
<P>
	Now we understand why the Canadian government withdrew 
its bill limiting distribution of foreign films within its 
jurisdiction and why the present government is dragging its feet 
on amendments to the Copyright Act.
<P>
	In the last round of GATT negotiations, we are told, culture 
had a narrow escape. The Americans' push for unanimous 
agreement that culture is a product like any other and should be 
exempt from national and international regulation failed 
because of the forceful intervention of France, supported by the 
European Economic Community.
<P>
	In this last-ditch attempt to save cultural expression and the 
democracy of ideas, Canada played a minor role, overshadowed 
by our cousins from France. The current government, need I 
remind you, belatedly supported the agreement after a period of 
guilty silence. This attitude reveals Canada's position on the 
whole issue of culture.
<P>
	The Ginn Publishing affair reveals just as much about 
Canada's position on protecting our cultural development. 
Under the Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA, the Canadian 
government can take measures to protect its publishing and 
book industry. This provision was designed to allow the 
Canadian government to maintain its policy on foreign 
investment in publishing.
<P>
	Why did the Minister of Heritage agree to sell Ginn 
Publishing? By enacting a law on foreign investment, the 
Canadian government had given itself a tool to protect the 
Canadian publishing industry. Yet, the Minister of Heritage 
ratified the americanization of one of our publishing houses 
with a smile and his proverbial naivety. This minister submitted 
to our neighbour's blows by willingly abandoning what nothing 
was forcing him to relinquish.
<P>
	Do you really believe that, in the current circumstances, we 
can trust this minister to protect our country's culture in the next 
round of multilateral negotiations?
<P>
	Cases like that of Ginn Publishing make us wonder about what 
many call the ``secret clauses'' of the Free Trade Agreement. Is 
it normal that, in a democratic country, our government makes 
its decisions not by consulting Parliament and the people in 
accordance with its own laws, but under pressure from other 
countries?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7487"> 7487 </A></B>
<P>
	Some observers noted that Canada's lack of involvement in 
the GATT multilateral negotiations was due to the fact that it 
considers its cultural sector as already protected by the FTA and 
NAFTA. But, as we know, this protection is limited by the fear 
of retaliation from the American giant, by verbal agreements 
that leave traces and by the Canadian government's 
unwillingness to stand up in promoting this country's culture.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Furthermore, Carla Hills told Congress that GATT had 
precedence over the FTA, that there was therefore no cause for 
concern about this concession to Canadians. I should point out 
that she said this to the U.S. Congress. In fact, the FTA has 
precedence over GATT. Still, this statement by the woman who 
was in charge of FTA negotiations for the American side says a 
lot about the relative importance given to this agreement by the 
U.S. and their intention of re-opening it in the future.
<P>
	Let us go back to the last round of GATT negotiations, which 
addressed for the first time the issue of intellectual property. 
The bill before us today contains some 20 clauses on copyrights. 
As with the rest of the bill, these amendments are proposed to 
make our Copyright Act comply with the agreements in the 
<I>Trade Related Aspects of International Property Rights</I>, a 
document containing the rules of the World Trade Organization, 
including those related to copyright.
<P>
	These changes are minor, to be sure. They create only one new 
right: they allow the performing artist to authorize or refuse to 
permit the recording and broadcast of his performance. The 
remaining clauses on copyright are intended to update our 
Copyright Act by including the agreements in <I>Trade Related 
Aspects of International Property Rights </I>and the provisions of 
the Universal Copyright Convention, to which this international 
agreement refers.
<P>
	As examples of these changes, note the clarifications made to 
the definitions of ``infringing'' and ``performance''. 
Accordingly, industrial piracy and trade in illegally copied 
merchandise will be limited.
<P>
	The changes imposed by international trade are 
commendable. Nevertheless, they put the Canadian 
government's inaction on copyright on the national agenda. 
Phase II of the Copyright Act review was planned for last spring. 
The Minister of Canadian Heritage, who appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage on May 4, said this: 
``I have said right from the beginning, probably even when I 
became responsible for this portfolio, that our copyright 
legislation is out of date. There has not been any major change 
for many years. It is not even fully in keeping with the 
international agreements on copyrights. We need an overhaul. 
We are working on it. We have teams of people doing an 
examination of all this. They are doing the economic impact 
studies and extensive consultations -I am quite determined to 
see amendments to the Copyright Act before too long''.
<P>
	But like everyone in the cultural community in Canada and 
Quebec, we are still waiting for this Copyright Act. This delay is 
tragic. Of course, it is tragic for our working artists who for ten 
years or so have been calling for major changes to this law. It is 
also tragic because we suspect that this delay could be due to the 
difference of opinion between the Department of Industry and 
the Department of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	On December 22, 1993, the Union des artistes wrote this to the 
Prime Minister: ``The Copyright Act is now being reviewed 
-Under the previous government, there was an obstacle to the 
harmonious review of that legislation: The sharing of 
responsibility between the Department of Canadian Heritage 
and the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. That 
arrangement led to a dual vision which, more often than not, 
resulted in contradictory objectives. That act is the only one 
protecting the right of Canadian creators''.
<P>
	As for the Minister of Canadian Heritage, he said on CBC 
radio that he did not really know what the content of phase II of 
the legislation on copyright would be, and that there would 
probably be a phase III. It seems that the heritage minister no 
longer has any authority to impose his views on that issue. He 
finds himself in a weak and isolated position in his wrestling 
match with the Minister of Industry. This is truly tragic, 
considering that it is incumbent upon that department to protect 
the cultural interests of Canada.
<P>
	The government resorts to a stopgap measure, namely Bill 
C-57, to make up for the tragic and unacceptable delay. The 
Department of International Trade is trying to ensure that the 
current act is in compliance with international agreements.
<P>
	I want to emphasize the importance of cultural development 
for a society.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The role of the department in this issue is crucial and vital. 
Why? Because, as evidenced by the Ginn episode, as evidenced 
now by the government's apathy regarding the review of the 
Copyright Act, and as evidenced also by what observers called a 
very close call with GATT, the right to culture, on one hand, and 
economic considerations, on the other hand, are on a collision 
course. And if the Minister of Canadian Heritage does not start 
creating strategic alliances right now, it is not only Canadian 
cultural industries which will be in jeopardy, but also 
democracy itself.
<P>
	To understand that, we have to define culture. We could, of 
course, quote several authors. Let us take the definition given by 
British sociologist Raymond Williams, whom authors Marc 
Raboy, Yvan Bernier, Florian Sauvageau and Dave Atkinson 
quote in their book <I>Développement culturel et mondialisation de 
l'économie</I>: ``At various times and in various contexts, the term 
culture has been used in one of three ways. First, it may refer to a 
general process of intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic 
development; second, it may describe the way of  life of a people 
or a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7488"> 7488 </A></B>
<P>
group in a specific location or time; third, it may refer to the 
activities of artists or intellectuals in a given society''.
<P>
	Except for the last definition, which only applies to cultural 
producers, it appears that culture includes a wide array of 
information and knowledge which allow individuals to develop 
(including through education, as shown by Williams' first 
definition), to adjust and to play a role in their community (as 
shown by the author's second definition). From this viewpoint, 
it would seem that artists and intellectuals as well as cultural 
producers not only participate in the intellectual, spiritual and 
aesthetic development of individuals, but also help create an 
awareness of their living environment. This shows the 
importance of their activity, which comes under all three 
definitions of culture according to Williams.''
<P>
	Canadian economist Michael Walker also gives the following 
definition, and I quote: ``What we refer to as culture is simply a 
society-wide summation of the individual choices people 
make''.
<P>
	From this perspective, culture is essentially demand as 
expressed by the markets. This definition puts less emphasis on 
cultural content, as a set of information and knowledge, than on 
the mechanism that promotes culture, namely a market free of 
any restrictions.
<P>
	To compare the definitions provided by Williams and Walker 
is somewhat of a joke, but it goes to show the conflict between 
sociological and economic approaches to culture, and 
particularly the historical conflict between economy and culture 
which has characterized to this day the evolution of 
industrialized nations.
<P>
	To conclude, the proposed amendments to the Copyright Act 
are imposed upon us from the outside, as a result of multilateral 
trade agreements signed by Canada. Are we going to let foreign 
countries decide what is good for Canada in terms of culture or 
will we pass legislation that reflects our directions, our wishes 
and those of our creative artists as well as the needs of our 
cultural industry, which promotes Canadian and Quebec talent? 
The Bloc Quebecois has made a choice and opted for the cultural 
sovereignty of this country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, I would like to heartily congratulate my colleague from 
Rimouski-Témiscouata on the excellent speech she just gave 
us. I find it quite revealing that she could make a twenty-minute 
speech dealing specifically with the cultural issue of the 
Uruguay Round accords and their applications to Canada.
<P>
	She presented some facts on the implications of the Uruguay 
Round accord for culture in Canada and more specifically for 
copyright in Canada. Once again, I find it quite revealing that 
international trade agreements force us to make some 
adjustments to Canada's copyright law.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	For months, my colleague has been clamoring for the federal 
government to legislate clearly on the issue of copyright. Is 
there not some ambiguity, a problem when the federal 
government is forced by international trade agreements to act or 
react on the subject of copyrights?
<P>
	I put my question to the hon. member because I am sure that 
she has some points to make about this. Personally, I am very 
surprised that the federal government has taken so long to 
legislate on copyrights and that it is doing so in a roundabout 
way, when forced to by international agreements. Is this not 
further proof that the present Minister of Canadian Heritage 
lacks clout and credibility?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite clear that it is 
imperative for Canada to legislate as soon as possible, calmly 
and in all fairness with respect to copyright. Of course, this is a 
very complex subject, but it will only increase in complexity as 
we travel further on the electronic highway. It will be 
complexified.
<P>
	In terms of culture, I am particularly concerned when I hear 
Mrs. Hills tell us that neither the FTA nor NAFTA afford us any 
protection, while we had been led to believe they did. If indeed 
we are not protected under these agreements and the GATT 
agreement will prevail, this means in the short run that, before 
we know it, Canada will have been invaded by the American 
culture.
<P>
	I would not want to be accused of trying to score political 
points here, but it is high time that the people of Canada, from 
Newfoundland to Vancouver Island, realize that the threat to 
English Canada is much greater than the threat to the 
francophone community in Quebec. The American culture is 
much more of a threat to you than to us. We are French-speaking 
and intend to remain so. That is why we want to leave this 
country which is oblivious of the fact that it is going to the dogs.
<P>
	Wake up, English Canada, before it is too late and you have 
become Americans! Because we are your credit card, right now, 
and we are about to cut your financing.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened with 
interest to the presentation and certainly would find areas of 
agreement in it. However I have a real concern when I hear about 
a bogeyman being out there in the world that is trying to close in 
on us and shut us down. I am not quite sure what the member was 
talking about concerning all the threats that exist outside the 
country.
<P>
	We are becoming a smaller and smaller world and in fact have 
to start moving outward. We cannot stay looking in as we so 
often hear the Bloc talking about. We cannot hold everything in 
and keep everybody out.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7489"> 7489 </A></B>
<P>
	I would like to know from the member exactly what the 
terrible threats are against our culture from outside the country 
other than from the Americans.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think that the greatest threat 
to any country comes from the United States of America. 
Immediately after the war, the Americans sought to impose their 
culture upon Europeans countries, which were flat broke coming 
out from the war years.
<P>
	The international response was: ``No way. We will not let 
American films invade our market this easily''. And the famous 
motion picture production agreement was signed.
<P>
	When television broadcasting first started here, in Canada, 
the Americans attempted once more to invade our market, going 
as far as boycotting Canada for a while. But they eventually 
realized that we were not giving in and that we were protected 
against such an invasion by our regulations, so they accepted to 
sit down and talk. What the Americans are doing now is trying 
again, in a roundabout way, to impose their culture around the 
world, from coast to coast, without forgetting anybody, because 
they can afford to do this. And the day when only American 
films, soaps, news and variety programs can be seen around the 
world, this world of ours will no longer be a democratic world 
because democracy starts up here, in your head.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I guess I am fairly 
shocked at that answer, that the terrible threat out there are the 
Americans.
<P>
	I certainly cannot imagine why any part of Canada would 
want to separate. Obviously the rest of Canada is going to look 
less favourably on a province that would separate because it 
would destroy the country we believe in.
<P>
	Then it will be forced to deal with the Americans and let them 
totally dominate its culture. The best way I see for Quebec to 
lose its culture is the threat of separation when it would be 
totally dependent on the United States.
<P>
	I guess I just totally do not understand the answer that I just 
got to my question.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> It is quite simple, Mr. Speaker. We are 
francophones, while the Americans are English-speaking. We 
do not tune in to American stations. We watch the French CBC 
network, TVA and TQS, mostly because programs produced in 
Quebec is of such superior quality, as compared to American 
and English Canadian productions, that we feel no need to check 
what is on in English to spend a lovely evening in front of the 
TV. We watch our shows. In addition, we have concluded 
agreements with the international French-speaking community 
and gained access to TV5. We are happy with  this. But English 
Canadians are asleep. They do not realize that the American 
cultural steam roller is at their door. Too bad for them if they 
would rather sleep and become Americans. As far as we are 
concerned, we plan to remain Quebecers and so we will, by 
leaving this sleeping country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my privilege and honour to be in the House today 
to address Bill C-57.
<P>
	Just before I start my address I would like to make a couple of 
comments on the debate I have heard this morning. I have 
travelled quite a bit and I think culture is very important. I have 
never had the opportunity to meet a cow that speaks French or a 
chicken that speaks French or English. I have had different 
cultures fry bacon and eggs for me in the morning and I have 
always enjoyed them no matter with what type of vocabulary 
they were prepared.
<P>
	I think this is something that sometimes overshadows the 
problems we really have. It is always important to me that we 
address the real issues and make sure those things that help us to 
survive or give us the opportunity to live in this country are not 
destroyed.
<P>
	As we know, this bill implements Canada's full participation 
in the World Trade Organization. This is the result of our signing 
the Uruguay round agreement on the GATT in April this year.
<P>
	The Uruguay round agreement was the largest and the most 
complex trade negotiation ever undertaken. The final package 
included more than 25 separate agreements. The nations that 
signed this agreement have made commitments to eliminate 
tariffs and other barriers to trade.
<P>
	From Canada's standpoint this makes it necessary to amend at 
least 31 different statutes. Each country will have to amend its 
subsidy and support programs and its border control measures in 
order to harmonize them with an overall world standard.
<P>
	Reductions will occur in the volume of subsidized exports.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	These must be reduced by 21 per cent over a six-year period 
ending in the year 2001. Our country's expenditures on export 
subsidies must be reduced by 36 per cent over that same 
six-year period.
<P>
	With a minimum reduction of 15 per cent for each commodity 
domestic support programs must also be reduced by 20 per cent 
over the six-year period. Regional development, research, 
environmental protection and farm income protection programs 
are exempt from this.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7490"> 7490 </A></B>
<P>
	The system of quotas in supply management sectors will be 
replaced by tariffs that will be lowered an average of 36 per cent 
over the six years.
<P>
	I must agree that supply management has very good 
protection under this tariffication program. I will generally limit 
my comments to the areas for which I am responsible as the 
Reform Party critic. They are the areas of agriculture, 
transportation and agriculture trade. These are truly areas where 
the nations that took part in this agreement have worked toward 
establishing a common set of rules to standardize their 
industries.
<P>
	The Reform Party is very much pro free trade. We supported 
the free trade agreement with the United States and we support 
further extension of free trade in general through the NAFTA 
and the GATT.
<P>
	With agreement on the Uruguay round I think we can look 
forward to more economic growth around the world. This will in 
turn lead to more investment and more jobs. About 50 per cent of 
Canadian farmers revenues are generated by exports. That 
means the agriculture sector will definitely benefit from 
increased access to foreign markets and from reductions in trade 
distorting subsidies in other countries which are the major 
reasons for low world grain prices.
<P>
	The Reform Party supports several transportation reforms. 
The underlying principle on which we base our reforms is the 
belief that Canadian agriculture products should move to market 
by any expeditious mode, any route in any form or state of 
processing based exclusively on the principle of cost 
effectiveness and with the best interests of the consumer in 
mind.
<P>
	This is one reason I have been a very strong supporter of the 
Hudson Bay Route Association in promoting the port of 
Churchill. When I look at the distance to Churchill and to the 
other ports I realize how much saving there is as far as rail line 
maintenance is concerned.
<P>
	When I see statistics, and these are done by different 
investigations or task forces, that we could cut our costs of 
transportation by about $20 to $25 a tonne, I think it is not only 
cost effective but also environmentally friendly.
<P>
	The other thing we have to realize is that we have a huge north 
in Manitoba where the native people depend on this type of 
transportation.
<P>
	We should be striving to develop an atmosphere that provides 
for a viable, self-reliant market driven industry by creating an 
environment in which regional development is eliminated as a 
goal of transportation policy.
<P>
	We support elimination of transportation subsidies but the 
funds should be redirected systematically to comprehensive 
safety net programs that are designed to defend Canada's food 
producers against matters over which they have little control.
<P>
	We cannot eliminate transportation subsidies altogether 
without a definite long range plan to help the industry adjust 
accordingly. By reallocating the funds and paying them to 
farmers as part of a GATT-green program we can allow our 
economy to diversify and can give farmers the opportunity to 
take advantage of the market forces of the new international 
trading agreement.
<P>
<B>(1240 ) </B>
<P>
	One thing that was really impressive to me the other day when 
the former agriculture minister, Mr. Whelan, was a witness 
before the standing committee was how we have lost our 
secondary industries, our processors and are killing plants due 
to transportation problems and other types of subsidies.
<P>
	It is of the utmost importance that we try to resolve that 
problem. Canada should endeavour to create a genuinely 
competitive transportation system. To achieve this end the 
deregulation of the railway system and the privatization of 
Canadian national rolling stock should be clearly defined goals.
<P>
	I do not know what the answers are but when I looked at the 
speech that the transportation minister delivered the other day, 
seeing that the labour force is only 64 per cent as efficient on our 
rail lines as it is in the United States, I know that subsidies are 
not the only problem. When I also see the United States 
transports 66 per cent more freight per rail mile than we do, we 
also know there is another problem of moving the products in 
the most expeditious way.
<P>
	In the area of grains, oilseeds and special crops, Canadian 
producers should benefit from a more stable trading 
environment. Greater opportunities for exports and hopefully 
international prices will increase over the six year 
transportation period. With the volumes of subsidized wheat 
exported from the United States and the European union 
expected to be reduced 40 per cent over the next six years, 
significant market shares should open up for Canadian farmers.
<P>
	Once this agreement goes into effect, the United States will no 
longer be able to use section 22 against imports of Canadian 
wheat. I would note however that these trade agreements can 
mean little if the government does not have the fortitude to back 
them up. We have seen other GATT agreements and they have all 
been broken by the bigger trade partners. As Canadians that is 
one thing we have to be very concerned about.
<P>
	We look back to the wheat pact this government not only 
agreed to with the U.S. but imposed on itself. We see an example 
of where we were within our rights under the free trade 
agreement but were bullied away. Article 705.5 of the 
Canada-U.S. free trade agreement states clearly that the cross 
border grain shipments can be restricted only if they increase 
significantly as 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7491"> 7491 </A></B>
<P>
a result of a substantial change in either country's support 
programs for the grain in question. That was not the case last 
year.
<P>
	Increases in wheat and durum to the U.S. last year were the 
result of an increased demand in the U.S. resulting from many 
factors. There was definitely no increase in Canadian support 
programs. This government agreed to surrender anyway. Mere 
days after this wheat pact occurred we saw the United States 
sign a wheat deal with Algeria with what had been a major 
Canadian market, export enhancement durum. The disturbing 
influence of the United States export enhancement program 
always allows it to distort grain markets.
<P>
	If the Canadian government had not buckled under the U.S. 
pressure, its senators, congressmen and farmers would soon 
have realized how detrimental the export enhancement program 
really was. Canadian farmers would only have recouped a small 
percentage of damage done by the U.S. unfair trade practices.
<P>
	Hopefully we will see it align its harmful subsidy program 
under the terms of this agreement. I would point out that 
although this was a bilateral dispute, there are provisions in the 
new rules for GATT that would force the United States to prove 
Canada was unfairly subsidizing exports.
<P>
	Hopefully this provision will be helpful in avoiding the 
capitulation that we have seen in the past from our government. 
This was brought home again last week when the United States 
department of agriculture began to require that Canadian wheat 
farmers who export into the U.S. have end user certificates. This 
despite the fact that the wheat pact signed with the U.S. included 
a peace clause that stipulated that Canada would be free from 
further restrictions or harassment for 12 months.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	It is just another example of how trade agreements are useless 
if the government seems either unable or disinterested in 
standing up for the rights of its citizens. A partner in a trade 
agreement cannot be allowed to be a bully. If this is allowed, the 
agreement will fall apart sooner or later.
<P>
	All that Canadian farmers really want is a level playing field. 
They know they can compete and be the best in the world at 
producing, but they cannot be expected to continue to be at a 
disadvantage in trading situations. With a fair set of trade rules 
that apply equally to all countries across the board, we can 
achieve that level playing field.
<P>
	Before these changes can take effect there will have to be 
major changes to the Western Grain Transportation Act. Any 
government policy that favours export shipments is deemed as 
an export subsidy by the GATT. Canada has maintained that the 
Western Grain Transportation Act provides internal support to 
farmers, but some countries, including the United States, insist 
that it provides export assistance.
<P>
	Recent studies confirm that it will be viewed as an export 
subsidy by the GATT. This point emphasizes that the shortest 
route to an export port is the best route. Under the agreement 
there will be two systems governing WGTA subsidy 
restrictions; one will be for grain shipped through Vancouver, 
Prince Rupert or Churchill. This is specifically export grain that 
is subject to an export reduction subsidy under the GATT.
<P>
	The second system is for grain shipped through Thunder Bay 
or Armstrong. This is deemed as grain for export or for domestic 
use, and therefore the transportation payments for grain 
movements under the WGTA can be considered either an export 
subsidy or domestic support, depending on which shipping route 
is used.
<P>
	This clause seems to me to set up a recipe for a tremendous 
amount of conflict and disagreement. It can only be a 
detrimental clause in this agreement and will probably cause a 
lot of hard feelings, not just between producers but also between 
shippers in the different regions.
<P>
	WGTA payments on grain that travels through the west ports 
are contingent on that grain being exported. The GATT was 
notified that these payments were export subsidies and will be 
subject to the reduction commitment of 36 per cent for export 
subsidies and also the 21 per cent reduction in the volume. 
WGTA payments on grain shipped through Thunder Bay have 
been notified to the GATT as green domestic support.
<P>
	I do not know how we can resolve that issue. I think it will be 
challenged and history will tell us that it is improper and we will 
have to address it.
<P>
	According to the GATT text the total Western Grain 
Transportation program is an amber domestic support program, 
while the portion related to grain movement to the west coast 
and Churchill is considered an export subsidy. Canada will have 
to make according changes to address the export subsidy 
provisions of the GATT.
<P>
	The challenge for Canada is to make the WGTA GATT-green. 
The Reform Party had addressed this problem very well with a 
trade distortion program that we recommended for WGTA 
during the election campaign. It was well received. I think the 
government will sooner or later have to realize that this type of 
program is the only one that will really be fair and beneficial to 
western farmers.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Since the GATT requires a change in the WGTA subsidy 
payment method from paying the railways to paying directly to 
farmers, it is likely the only method that would comply with 
GATT requirements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7492"> 7492 </A></B>
<P>
	This is another area where the Liberal government will have 
to be tremendously diligent and innovative. It has to find a way 
to pay that subsidy out so that it does not distort the value of 
land, it does not distort taxation to municipalities because we 
could be find a number of different real problems.
<P>
	As I stated, under GATT countries have agreed to reduce their 
export subsidies by 36 per cent. There are several questions that 
arise in this bill. I know that farmers in my riding will have a 
number of concerns.
<P>
	For example, what safeguards are there for farmers that the 
railways will be obligated to move grain to other ports? Also, 
what safeguards do we have that our rail cars will not be going to 
the United States?
<P>
	Last year was a disaster for grain transportation. One of the 
main factors was that the railways decided to chase business in 
the United States. With the longer car turnaround cycle, this 
took needed grain cars out of the picture and caused serious 
ramifications. What assurance do we have that this will not be 
repeated?
<P>
	There are also reports that the railways do not have enough 
engines. I would like to know if anyone has looked especially at 
this problem. We have the rail cars but we do not have the 
engines to pull them. That does not give us a very effective 
transportation system.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gordon Kirkby (Prince Albert-Churchill River, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to know this. You indicated 
earlier in your speech that grain or whatever agricultural 
product is being transported should be moved by whatever 
means to whatever destination that the market sees fit.
<P>
	At the end of your speech, you are criticizing the rail 
companies for-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I would like to 
interrupt for a brief moment to remind members to make all 
interventions through the Chair and not directly to each other 
across the floor of the House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Kirkby:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member mentions that the 
market should determine by what mode of transportation grain 
or agricultural products should be shipped. Near the end of his 
speech he indicates that there is a shortage of grain cars because 
the companies have decided to use them to ship grain into the 
United States. It would suggest that he has been quite 
inconsistent in his approach and I would like him to explain the 
inconsistency.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think I was inconsistent 
in my remarks. The reason why these grain cars have been 
diverted to the United States is that under the Western Grain 
Transportation Act the railways get paid on the amount of grain 
they move.
<P>
	However if we do not have the engines to pull these cars, it 
does not do us very much good to try to get the amount of cars on 
the system that are needed. Therefore these cars that provincial 
governments, the federal government and the wheat board 
bought for the  transportation system have been diverted across 
to the U.S. to gain income. They could not be used in Canada 
because of the lack of engine power.
<P>
	It is financially beneficial to the railways to do that. Freight 
rates in the United States, the pace at which they move their 
cars, the time of turnaround for these cars are far superior to the 
Canadian system.
<P>
	We exported some grain last year and the agent who was 
shipping that grain further down the line paid from $250 to $750 
per car according to the need that he had for them. There was a 
tremendous amount of incentive to move cars that the railways 
could not use to the U.S. because of a lack of engine power and 
benefit financially by probably millions and millions of dollars.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to thank my colleague from Verchères for his excellent job 
in directing the debate on Bill C-57. I want to point out at the 
outset that the time has finally come to deal with the important 
matter of GATT.
<P>
	Bill C-57 allows us to question some aspects of this 
agreement which remain what I would call grey areas. The 
purpose of my comments is not to oppose this bill, but to raise 
questions to show the members of this House that it is essential 
that we have enough time to consider this bill before approving 
it.
<P>
	Quebecers have been open and in favour of free trade for a 
long time. You will recall that Quebec stood alongside the U.S. 
among the first free trade supporters and that, without their 
support, Canada might have refused to sign the free trade treaty. 
You certainly remember that, in the 1988 election, when the free 
trade agreement with the U.S. was the main election plank of the 
Conservative Party led by Mr. Mulroney, the former Tory leader 
found his staunchest allies in Quebec.
<P>
	Despite the misadventures encountered by the Conservative 
Party during its first mandate, Quebecers gave their 
overwhelming support to the Progressive Conservative Party 
precisely because it advocated tree trade with the U.S. Quebec 
showed consistency by greatly facilitating the signing of 
NAFTA, and it now favours extending this agreement to other 
countries in Latin America.
<P>
	It is not hard to see the logic behind this attitude. It is crucial 
for Quebec's small and medium-sized businesses to secure 
access to larger markets. Like all Quebecers, I am prejudiced in 
favour of free trade and therefore in favour of Bill C-57 before 
us today. What I would like, however, is enough time to look at it 
carefully, and the Liberal government's railroading of such an 
important bill is unacceptable.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7493"> 7493 </A></B>
<P>
	When several major powers with sometimes conflicting 
interests sit around the negotiating table, we realize how 
difficult it is to please everyone. In the current economic 
context, it is essential to agree on how to develop free trade 
mechanisms. That is why this agreement can, if it is used 
properly, provide a basis for future trade negotiations.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	The potential increase of $755 billion in international trade 
between now and the year 2005 is the most convincing guarantee 
of the positive impact of that agreement. The Final Act of the 
Uruguay Round signed on April 15, in Marrakesh, meets some 
of the expectations of Quebec and Canada. However, as regards 
agricultural issues, that agreement is far from making Quebec 
producers happy.
<P>
	The structure of GATT has always differed from that of most 
major UN agencies. Even though Canada was among the 23 
original members, it is now at the same level as the other 107 
member countries. It is at the mercy of talks dominated by three 
major players: The United States, Japan and the European 
Community.
<P>
	Like all the other members, Canada is somewhat subjected to 
the priorities and decisions of these giants, particularly the 
United States and the European Community. Yet, when a sector 
as important for Quebec and Canada as agriculture is targeted, 
the federal government must react and stand up for our 
producers.
<P>
	Canada did very poorly when it came to protecting the 
interests of agricultural producers, regarding article XI, because 
it was trying to do two different things. Article XI essentially 
allowed Ontario and Quebec dairy producers to benefit from 
their supply management system. That initiative was obviously 
extremely important to them. In the east, producers wanted to 
keep their supply management programs, while in the west, they 
wanted new markets for their grain. Given its political situation, 
Canada tried to please both groups at the international level. In 
the end, it lost some of its credibility and more. The government 
found itself caught between a rock and a hard place.
<P>
	As regards article XI, the government could not let down 
Quebec producers in the current political context. On the other 
hand, grain exports have very significant economic spin-offs. 
When you negotiate, you have to make concessions in order to 
make gains on those issues which are important to you. 
However, in order to do that, you must first define your 
priorities.
<P>
	This example of double-edged sword is clear evidence that 
we have to put our house in order. The problem is a major one. 
How can only one voice protect the diverging interests of 
western and eastern producers?
<P>
	The fight on Article XI also undermined Canada's credibility 
with its own agricultural producers. Indeed, the government 
tried to be reassuring by explaining that, in the short term, 
higher tariffs would provide producers subjected to quotas the 
same protection as under article  XI. However, the government 
was silent on the medium term and the long term.
<P>
	Even though the tariffs proposed by Canada to GATT were not 
opposed, there is no guarantee that we will not find ourselves in 
a perpetual trade dispute once they are implemented.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	However, during the bilateral talks on durum wheat, Canada 
made concessions in order to avoid prolonging the dispute by 
going before a panel.
<P>
	What will Canada do when the Americans revive the debate 
on quota production and tariffs on yogurt and ice cream, for 
instance? Who will decide whether GATT or NAFTA takes 
precedence? These issues are still unclear.
<P>
	We need assurances that the government is prepared to answer 
some very specific questions. You may recall, Mr. Speaker, that 
during the last election campaign, in the fall of 1993, the Prime 
Minister, the leader of the Liberal Party, was travelling across 
Canada and saying: ``I will not sign NAFTA unless everything is 
reviewed from A to Z. And I will negotiate''. A few weeks after 
he was sworn in, the Prime Minister went on a short trip to the 
United States, came back and quickly signed NAFTA.
<P>
	Just another instance of the past being no guarantee of the 
future.
<P>
	What will Canada do when the Americans revive the debate 
on yogurt and ice cream, for instance? Who will decide whether 
GATT or NAFTA takes precedence?
<P>
	We need assurances that the government is prepared to answer 
some very specific questions. We must go to committee to 
assess the impact of this bill. We must also keep abreast of steps 
being taken by our principal trading partners to conform to 
GATT. The Canadian government should be able to tell us, for 
instance, whether it and the American government agree on the 
definition of dumping.
<P>
	Although we realize that our agricultural policies must 
conform to our international trade agreements, the government 
must not take advantage of our obligation to conform to GATT 
to justify certain measures to reduce the deficit. In many cases, 
Canada has already reduced its domestic subsidies by more than 
20 per cent, which means that for this round of talks, it has met 
its commitments for subsidy reduction.
<P>
	If we look at the amendments to the WGTA to harmonize it 
with GATT requirements, a number of issues are still 
outstanding. We still do not know whether the Crow benefit will 
be transferred to producers or how that will be done. This matter 
should be dealt with immediately. The Minister of Transport, 
who has been responsible for the Crow so far, announced last 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7494"> 7494 </A></B>
<P>
spring that he would not renew the subsidy. His colleague, the 
Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, was quick to announce 
that his department would be responsible for the subsidy and 
would, we may assume, make it more effective by making 
certain changes.
<P>
	Since that time, the minister has asked the Producer Payment 
Panel to examine the question. This review led to 
recommendations about which the minister has not said a word 
yet. About the Crow's Nest Pass Rates, he told the magazine <I>Le 
Coopérateur</I> last June: ``Although this problem has been around 
for many years, we must, for various reasons, tackle it without 
delay. Not the least of these reasons is the GATT Agreement''.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	We, however, still do not know anything about the minister's 
intentions. It must also be pointed out that Quebec and Canada 
will benefit from stronger trade regulations. In the last 15 years, 
several member states, in particular our American neighbour 
and the European Community, made excessive use of 
protectionist measures. Clarifying the GATT regulations on the 
definition of the types of subsidies that are allowed, 
compensatory or prohibited and the use of countervailing and 
anti-dumping duties largely favours an international system 
based on relationships dictated by law rather than force. For 
smaller states like Quebec and Canada, this strengthening of 
trade regulations is a safeguard against giants like the United 
States.
<P>
	There may be many advantages to an agreement such as the 
one we are discussing this afternoon. In any case, there is no 
doubt that, given the internationalization of markets, we must 
take our place on the international scene and take advantage of 
trade treaties. Agriculture is only one component of the 
agreement but its place in Quebec's and Canada's economy does 
not allow us to minimize the impact of measures affecting this 
sector. Losing Article XI will require us to restructure our 
agricultural sector. However, only the future will tell us whether 
these adjustments were worthwhile. I still think that the grey 
areas or outstanding problems justify our asking that some 
aspects of Bill C-57 be clarified in committee.
<P>
	Furthermore, I find it hard to understand why it is so urgent to 
conclude this debate when the two giants, the U.S. and Europe, 
are taking their time. The Americans are moving slowly since 
some members of Congress are in the middle of an election 
campaign and this type of agreement is not very popular with 
voters. Europeans, for their part, have turned this into a power 
struggle between the European Commission and the Council of 
Ministers. If this bill is really acceptable, why is it so urgent?
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, thank you for your attention, and I must again in 
closing point out that my colleague from Verchères is doing an 
admirable job of dealing with this matter, for which he is 
responsible, in order to defend Quebec's major interests.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have listened with considerable interest as the debate 
has unfolded today. The Bloc speakers have been virtually 
unanimous in their support of supply management.
<P>
	Those who are consumers have an opinion of supply 
management that is somewhat different from the opinion of 
those who are producers. It depends whether they are getting 
paid or are paying for the product under supply management. 
Supply management in any other industry would be considered 
price fixing.
<P>
	Could the member comment on his perception in Quebec, 
leaving aside the relationship between Quebec and the rest of the 
country? Is it his opinion that supply management is a net 
benefit and, if it is not a net benefit, given that consumers are 
paying a premium for dairy products and poultry products their 
costs of living are greatly increased?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to thank my 
distinguished colleague from the Reform Party for his very 
pertinent question. Nevertheless, as you know, three 
agricultural sectors in Quebec are covered by supply 
management: poultry, eggs and milk. Supply management in 
these three fields is so well structured that every month 
delegations from the UPA, the Quebec farmers' union, receive 
invitations from other countries that want to know how we could 
have set up such an effective supply management system.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, do you know that without this supply 
management system in Quebec and in Ontario, no farmer could 
make a living from producing poultry, eggs or milk? Why? 
Because we would have been invaded by the Americans. Last 
week, the president of the UPA told me that he visited a farm in 
the United States that raises 100,000 steers a year. A hundred 
thousand!
<P>
	He told me that Quebec does not produce 100,000 steers a 
year. Down there, a single huge farm produces more than 
Quebec does. But once agriculture in Quebec and Ontario is 
killed off, prices would not be set by government bodies in 
Quebec or Ontario but by American farmers. The independence 
of a country is at stake.
<P>
	When a country cannot feed its people, it is weak. If we want a 
strong country, this strength must be based on an agricultural 
system that is competent, productive and also versatile. Thanks 
to supply management, farmers enjoyed some security and 
could invest and acquire farms and make them profitable. As for 
milk production, because I am more familiar with this field, I 
could tell my distinguished colleague that some farmers have 
been bled white. They have mortgaged their farm to buy the 
right to produce-they have bought quotas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7495"> 7495 </A></B>
<P>
	This past weekend, I met one of these farmers, who estimates 
that his quota is worth $750,000. Three quarters of a million 
dollars and he is afraid that when the tariff system is well in 
place, quotas will lose their value. Quotas could eventually 
disappear.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	I have been asking the same question to Agriculture Canada 
officials week after week. I even asked the agriculture 
committee and I was told: ``Time will tell. One thing is sure: no 
problem is to be expected for the first six years''. But what about 
the seventh year or the tenth? When a farm producer has 
borrowed huge amounts to buy this piece of paper allowing him 
or her to have 25 or 30 more cows but is told: ``Look, ten years 
from now, your $750,000 quota may not be worth a penny'', is 
that reassuring? Would you find it encouraging, Mr. Speaker, if 
you were told: ``Your pension plan that you have accumulated 
here, at the House of Commons, will not be worth a penny, six or 
seven years down the road''? This is hypothetical. It may be 
worth something, but then again it may not. You would be 
concerned, I am sure you would.
<P>
	Farm producers need reassurance. When you see a farmer 
with a production quota worth $1.5 million or $2 million and 
they come and tell him: ``We expect no problem for the first six 
years. Later on, we will have to see'', take my word for it, supply 
management becomes awfully important.
<P>
	On predatory pricing, I cannot say that I share the views of my 
colleague from the Reform Party, which reflect a lack of 
knowledge of the situation in Quebec. To get a one cent per litre 
increase, milk producers have to go before a Quebec 
government agency called dairy commission where consumer 
associations, the farm producers association and the Dairies' 
Association are represented, and negotiate. ``Our production 
costs are such and such, and there has been no increase in the 
past six months to a year''. Consumers say that milk already 
costs too much and that its price should be reduced, not 
increased. Farmers want a five-cent increase. And then you 
have UPA representatives trying to come up with a compromise. 
Finally, farmers ask for a five-cent increase and often get only a 
one-cent increase.
<P>
	So, if you come to Quebec or to Ontario, you will realize that 
farmers do not work 40 hours a week and then rest. They usually 
work seven days a week, 365 days a year, along with all their 
family, and still cannot afford to spend three weeks or a whole 
month in Florida or in Europe. They have to stay on their farm to 
operate it.
<P>
	I would now like to give my view of the outlook for supply 
management. Of course, I would like the government to stand up 
and tell us what will happen to supply management six or seven 
years down the road. Farmers have the right to know. In fact, 
they represent the class of workers in Quebec for whom we 
should have the most respect. According to statistics for all of 
Canada,  the people who work on farms are those who work the 
highest number of hours in Canada.
<P>
	On average, Quebec farmers work more hours than other 
Canadian farmers, precisely because we have a more diversified 
agriculture.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to make a brief comment.
<P>
	I am a bit overwhelmed by the very eloquent speech that we 
just heard from the hon. member for Frontenac. My colleague 
focused on what was, I think, the main problem for Canada in the 
Uruguay Round, namely the double talk used by the federal 
government in trying to protect the interests of producers in 
Canada and Quebec, those of grain producers from the western 
provinces on one hand and those of poultry and dairy farmers 
and other producers on the other hand.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	It must be said that this double talk, this double standard still 
exists today. The problem is still there and it became obvious 
when we asked the government very recently, as my colleague 
was saying, which rules would have precedence, the NAFTA 
rules or the GATT rules, with regard to tariffs on dairy products, 
poultry, etc.
<P>
	The problem that exists right now is related to the fear of 
seeing that western grain production will be played off against 
Quebec's egg, milk and poultry production in future 
negotiations with the United States. At the present time, the 
United States imposes limits on Canadian grain imports and the 
Canadian government could very well be tempted to reduce the 
tariffs that will be imposed on Quebec's agricultural products in 
the place of quotas in order to obtain greater access to the 
American market.
<P>
	The Canadian government could be tempted to reduce its 
tariffs in order to open the American market to Canadian grain. 
The danger is there and the double talk to which the hon. 
member for Frontenac was referring still exists. It is important 
to note that we are well aware of the problem and that we will 
watch the government very closely on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chrétien (Frontenac):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague, the 
hon. member for Verchères, is absolutely right. This reminded 
me of what my Reform Party colleague said earlier about high 
prices.
<P>
	I went shopping with my wife on Friday evening and I saw 
Prince Edward Island potatoes at a price which was 
exceptionally high for the season. Three years ago, there was an 
oversupply of potatoes in New Brunswick. The Canadian and 
New Brunswick governments of the time bought the potatoes to 
bury them in an open dump. On the CBC news, they showed us 
hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tons of potatoes being 
bulldozed 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7496"> 7496 </A></B>
<P>
into a hole while we could have fed the starving people of the 
world with those vegetables.
<P>
	To support the price of potatoes, our two governments had 
bought the farmers' production. They deliberately kept the 
potatoes from being marketed precisely to create scarcity. 
Sometimes we talk about environmental protection. Well it is 
certainly not very clever to bury potatoes, and not even make 
compost, when you think there are millions of people, tens of 
millions of people who cannot even eat a meal a day. And here, 
in New Brunswick, three years ago, we buried hundreds and 
hundreds of thousands of tons of potatoes.
<P>
	When we talked about supply management, do you not think 
that a supply management system for potatoes would have been 
much better? Of course in Quebec, we could produce 25 per cent 
more milk if we wanted to. But why produce 25 per cent more 
milk if you cannot sell it?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak in the debate.
<P>
	I always enjoy the interventions of my hon. colleague from 
Frontenac. I should point out to him that I believe the potatoes to 
which he was referring that were buried in Prince Edward Island 
were not buried to support a price. They were seed potatoes and 
there was a problem. There was a potential for disease and in 
order to protect the integrity of Prince Edward Island seed 
potatoes, which is among the highest in the world, it was 
determined that it would be best to do away with the potatoes. It 
was not a question of price fixing.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	I also thought this might be the crowning glory and 
achievement of the Bloc. We have heard a lot of statements from 
the Bloc in this House from time to time, some statements more 
or less preposterous than others. I have to tell you when the hon. 
member for Frontenac said that we have to protect supply 
management because the farmers in Quebec worked harder than 
any other farmers, I mean that was it. How does he know? I 
really do believe that farmers as people and business persons in 
our country do work very long hours, but don't we all? I really 
do not think the farmers in Quebec work any harder than the 
farmers anywhere else in the country.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> How can you know?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Obviously I cannot know. I just do not think 
that is one contest we need to get into. This debate has been most 
enlightening today because we have an interesting separation.
<P>
	We are talking about whether or not Canada should sign into 
the World Trade Organization. The actual title of this bill is the 
World Trade Organization Agreement Implementation Act. It is 
at the second reading stage. We support this bill.
<P>
	There is a truism about being competitive: If you do not 
compete, you cannot be competitive. Therefore we have to have 
within our psyche the desire to compete and to be competitive. 
That is the dichotomy which has come in this debate thus far 
today. There are members of the Bloc who are by and large 
supportive of the notion of free trade and expanded trade, but 
with a severe reservation because of its impact on supply 
management.
<P>
	It is fair to say that as a result of the implementation of the 
GATT agreement supply management will have seen the last of 
its days in Canada. Let there be no mistake: Supply management 
is price fixing. If it was supply management of photo finishing, 
it would be called price fixing. If it was supply management of 
shoe manufacturing, it would be called price fixing.
<P>
	Supply management creates a situation whereby a limited 
number of producers have access to the market exclusive of 
anyone else. They are thereby provided a guaranteed return on 
their investment. What happens of course as a result of that is 
that everybody else who makes a living based on that investment 
also has a guaranteed return on their investment, the feed 
suppliers, the implement suppliers, everyone down the line. You 
know who gets it in the neck? Mr. and Mrs. Joe Consumer in the 
land.
<P>
	If we want a situation where we are going to have industries 
which are non-competitive, where we are going to have winners 
and losers in society picked not by the marketplace but by the 
government, then supply management is a textbook illustration 
on how to do it. Therefore, one of the main beneficial and most 
important things that will come as a result of signing this 
agreement will be the ordered timely end of supply 
management.
<P>
	This whole exercise as many people know started in 1944. It 
was called the Bretton Woods agreement. It was determined that 
at the conclusion of the second world war it might not be a bad 
idea if the nations of the world figured out some sort of an 
arrangement whereby they could learn to trade with each other 
under certain rules and conditions that might help to prevent 
future wars. That was essentially the reason behind the United 
Nations and the Bretton Woods agreement.
<P>
	Three major decisions were reached at Bretton Woods in 
1944. They were the International Monetary Fund, the 
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and 
the International Trade Organization.
<P>
	The International Trade Organization did not really get off the 
ground but the successor, which is the GATT, did. To most 
people GATT is an obscure term. It stands for General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. It really has a tremendous 
impact on the lives of all Canadians daily. It is not just an 
obscure international agreement that we are signing. It is an 
agreement that will fundamentally change the way we function 
as a nation. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7497"> 7497 </A></B>
<P>
As Canada goes forward into the next century it is perhaps a 
very timely agreement for us to be signing.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	We should compare our nation today with our nation when we 
got involved in the free trade agreement. Going back to the time 
when we got into free trade with the United States it was a major 
leap of faith for most Canadians. It said we were going to start to 
break down the trade barriers within Canada and start competing 
on our own as a nation within the world.
<P>
	First we had to compete with the United States. Then we went 
to the North American free trade agreement in which we decided 
we were going to compete with the United States and Mexico. 
Now we are going one step further with the GATT which means 
we will be competing sooner or later with everyone in the world.
<P>
	What does that mean to us here in Canada? How does it affect 
us when we are trying to get by, trying to get a job, trying just to 
pay our rent? This is it. If we are not the very best that we can be, 
if we do not as a nation and as individuals strive for excellence, 
we are going to be buried in the world. We can no longer hide 
behind tariff barriers.
<P>
	The tariff barriers in Canada existed for years and years. They 
created artificial subsidies. The unnatural but natural 
conclusion were things like the back-in agreements or the 
backflow where empty grain cars go to Thunder Bay and then 
come back so that the railways can get a subsidy, so they can get 
more money for some God forsaken government program. We 
have the situation where grain grown in western Canada is 
subsidized to be shipped east. It goes into a feedlot in central 
Canada so that we can sell beef raised in central Canada on 
western grain rather than having the beef fattened on western 
grain in western Canada and then sending dressed beef to the 
markets, a natural advantage.
<P>
	All of these distortions that are built into our trade agreements 
within our own country serve one purpose only: to make us less 
competitive on the world stage. That is why it is so important 
that we as Canadians in the present supply managed sectors and 
all other sectors understand the absolute necessity of becoming 
competitive as world traders.
<P>
	A quarter of our nation's wealth is derived from international 
trade. Eighty per cent of our international trade is with the 
United States. Twenty-five per cent of that trade is internal trade 
within branch plants.
<P>
	In last Saturday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> there was a business report 
from the Royal Bank. I will just show it very briefly for those in 
television land-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. With all due 
respect to all those people in television land, within the confines 
of this wonderful Chamber we do not use ``props''. We will 
listen attentively to the wisdom of the hon. member for 
Edmonton Southwest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thought I might be able to 
sneak that in because I wanted to give credit where credit was 
due. Less attentive Speakers have allowed me that privilege, but 
I can see you are on your toes today.
<P>
	In any event distributed with the <I>Globe and Mail</I> last Saturday 
was a report by the Royal Bank.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	This might be a good time to put in a plug for the industry 
committee of the House of Commons which has put together a 
report on small business. I think most members of Parliament 
have been inundated with innovative initiatives by all of the 
banks to try to foster small business.
<P>
	In any event the Royal Bank publication points out some of 
the benefits and some of the realities of the trade situation we 
find ourselves in. The reason I would like to quote some of these 
statistics is that the signing of the GATT and our commitment to 
become international traders will inevitably lead to the fact that 
we had better pay a lot more attention to the next generation of 
Canadians so that they can compete on a world stage. The next 
generation of Canadians will compete because of their 
knowledge based resources.
<P>
	We in Canada have been very fortunate. We have been blessed 
for many years. We were able to live a standard of living far 
beyond our means because we exploited Canada's natural 
resources. By and large we were the suppliers to the world of 
natural resources at a relatively low price, but it brought a 
tremendous amount of wealth into Canada. We were then able to 
transfer that wealth into the social programs we have all grown 
very accustomed to and that we really like. The problem is that 
we are no longer such an exporting nation. We do not have the 
resources to export and we have not replaced them with anything 
else.
<P>
	Let me give an example. One-quarter of our national wealth is 
derived from international trade. One-third of our jobs depend 
on international trade. Nine thousand new jobs result from every 
billion dollars of additional exports. Nearly half of Canada's 
manufacturing output is exported. Exports generate more than 
$5,000 for every Canadian every year. That is really kind of 
nice.
<P>
	This is what we are exporting and this is where the problem is: 
passenger cars, $24.1 billion; trucks, $10.5 billion; motor 
vehicle parts, excluding engines, $9.6 billion; softwood lumber, 
$9.2 billion; and crude petroleum, $6.9 billion. Where do you 
see anything there other than the automobile industry that we 
have any value added?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7498"> 7498 </A></B>
<P>
	In Alberta we have spent zillions of dollars building one of the 
neatest pulp mills you have ever seen. It is one of the least 
polluting mills ever made. The problem is that we cut our trees 
down and we get something like 25 cents value for every tree 
that goes into that pulp mill. We turn that pulp into a finished 
product, bleached so that we get the environmental problems 
down the road, and we send that to Japan and buy it back as 
finished paper, as fine paper.
<P>
	I learned earlier today from my hon. colleague from 
Lisgar-Marquette that Canada used to export a tremendous 
amount of milled flour to Japan. We do not any more. We export 
wheat to Japan. The Japanese mill it and then they sell it around 
the world. How is it we can get ourselves into a situation where 
we still end up being the purveyors of raw materials? We have to 
get the tertiary secondary manufacturing or we cannot allow our 
raw materials to be exploited any more in the same manner 
which was just fine for 30 or 40 years. Things have changed and 
we just cannot do that any more.
<P>
	I mentioned a few minutes earlier about some of our primary 
exports. Our primary imports are motor vehicle parts excluding 
engines, $18 billion; passenger cars, $11.9 billion; electronic 
computers, $9 billion; crude petroleum, $4.6 billion; electronic 
tubes and semi-conductors, that sort of thing; $4.5 billion.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Therefore, basically through the auto pact, when we start 
talking about how great an exporter we are, we are great 
exporters if we are talking about the auto pact where we export 
and import and we are great exporters when we start talking 
about wheat or petroleum.
<P>
	However, we are not great exporters when we are talking 
about anything that has value added. This is where we as a nation 
have a real problem, especially coming into the next generation.
<P>
	I had a letter from a constituent the other day saying the 
difference between a politician and a statesman is that a 
politician thinks about the next election, a statesman thinks 
about the next generation.
<P>
	Perhaps we in this Parliament have to start thinking as 
statesmen, not about the next election but about the next 
generation. We have a serious problem here. How do we go 
about competing on a world stage?
<P>
	Think about internal trade barriers that exist now within 
Canada. We do not have the ability or the resolve as Canadians 
to get rid of these trade barriers within Canada that exist today. 
When we were negotiating the North American free trade 
agreement with the United States and Mexico there were three 
players around the table: Canada, the United States and Mexico.
<P>
	When we were trying to break down the trade barriers within 
Canada, how many players were around the table-all the 
provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	If we as Canadians are prepared to take the bull by the horns 
and break down these trade barriers we may have to go into a 
situation and say: ``We are the federal government. We represent 
Canadians. We do not represent Albertans. We do not represent 
people from Ontario or Quebec. We represent the national 
interest. These trade barriers are killing us. They are killing our 
ability to compete internationally. It is time to get them out of 
here. You guys have exactly one year to get rid of your trade 
barriers. If you have not done it and negotiated an end to them 
within a year, kiss them goodbye because they are gone. They 
are out of there''.
<P>
	If we do not have the kind of resolve that will do it, how can 
we compete internationally if we cannot compete within our 
own country, within our own borders? It is essential that before 
we take on the world as these trade barriers come down, as the 
tariffication takes effect and the tariff barriers start to come 
down, we ensure that we are competitive within our own 
country.
<P>
	It means that we have to first of all eliminate the 
interprovincial trade barriers. It means we have to ensure that 
our taxes are as low as any tax regime in the world. How do we 
go about doing that? We make sure that they are fair and that we 
do not use tax incentives that distort the marketplace.
<P>
	It means that we do not use the tax money paid by someone 
earning $10 or $12 or $8 an hour, barely getting by, take it into 
government and then regurgitate it, give it to somebody else to 
go into business with the person who paid the taxes in 
competition with the person who paid the taxes in the first place.
<P>
	It means that we have to lower the cost of being a Canadian. 
We have to be competitive in the world and it means that we 
have to make some very strategic investment decisions in the 
future. It means that we have to ensure that we are not only the 
sources of ideas, we have to be the innovators and the 
implementors.
<P>
	We cannot just have a brainwave, invent something and have 
that innovative idea brought to the market by Americans or by 
the Japanese or the Germans.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	It is going to be a new relationship between the innovators, the 
entrepreneurs, government, education and business. It is a 
whole new attitude so that we in our nation will honour, revere 
and bring to some degree of respect innovators and 
entrepreneurs who would at least be on the same level as a 
hockey player.
<P>
	It is important. Think about it. Someone in our country who is 
a great business person, a great entrepreneur, a great innovator, a 
scientist-who do we know? Are they our heroes? No, they 
certainly are not. Somebody who can put 50 goals into a net or 
play baseball at all is a hero. It is a quantum change in the whole 
way we think about ourselves and what is worthwhile in our 
nation.
<P>

<P>
	We know that our new economy is not going to work if we try 
to replicate what we did in the past. Going into the new economy 
we can do so with confidence because we can compete on a 
world scale. We can only do it if we strive for excellence in 
everything we do.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as always I enjoy listening to 
the member when he speaks on the economy.
<P>
	I would like to focus on a very specific remark that the 
member made in his speech. The member said that we must 
make strategic investments in ideas. Many years ago we as a 
government made a strategic investment in the automobile 
industry in this country.
<P>
	We used taxpayers dollars to create a sector of the economy 
that is recognized today to be one of the best in the world. We 
can do joint ventures with Mercedes Benz, with the Japanese, et 
cetera. We did make a strategic investment with taxpayers 
dollars and the member acknowledged that strategic investment 
in his remarks.
<P>
	My question to the member is in what sectors of the economy 
is he proposing that we make such strategic investments today?
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, the strategic investment that 
the hon. member for Broadview-Greenwood refers to is the 
auto pact. The auto pact came into being because we in Canada 
were importing all of our automobiles from the United States. 
We thought it would not be a bad idea that since we drive these 
cars here we should make a few.
<P>
	We ended up getting involved in the auto pact. The auto pact 
almost died, as the hon. member would know. It was not easy for 
the agreement to reach fruition. During those years-35 years 
ago the auto pact came into being-that was in my opinion a 
very worthwhile strategic investment.
<P>
	What kinds of strategic investments should we be making 
today? In my opinion it should be through our universities, 
through research and development, in colleges. We are doing 
reviews of all sorts of things.
<P>
	The National Research Council has a budget of something in 
the region of $450 million a year. Imagine if the National 
Research Council's budget of $450 million a year were 
somehow worked into universities so that instead of getting 
$450 million worth of value from that investment, we could get 
$1 billion worth of value from that investment and we would 
also have a direct rubber meets the road responsibility. Here are 
people actually doing things, innovating, transferring that 
technology and applying it.
<P>
	Another area in which we should be looking at strategic 
investments is the electronic highway. Years ago we had a 
situation in which communication in Canada was via rivers, then 
it was via railroad, then by air. We strategically put airports all 
over the place that we are  desperately trying to get rid of now. 
At the time we needed them for communication.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	Our future will be based upon our ability to innovate and use 
the collective brain power of all of our citizens, those working at 
home in their study, businesses and universities. There are 
people hacking away at their computers right now somewhere in 
Canada who could have the secret that we absolutely must have 
to make something else work. Somehow we need to connect all 
of this brain power. That is the kind of innovation and strategic 
value of government led initiative that in my view would be 
worthwhile.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member talked a lot about efficiency, productivity and strategic 
investments. He did not have much to say about the tremendous 
amounts spent by the federal government on manpower training. 
As you know, the federal government probably wastes one or 
two billion dollars annually on poorly-organized manpower 
training. When we realize that the provinces are responsible for 
training, the federal government's involvement in this field 
means that a lot of money is being wasted.
<P>
	I believe that if we keep going in this direction, there is a real 
danger that we will be unable to compete with the rest of the 
world. I am all in favour of free trade and globalization but, to 
deal with that, our people must be properly trained. He did not 
have much to say about that, and I would appreciate his 
comments on manpower training, federal involvement in this 
field, the attendant inefficiencies and the adverse impact of 
those inefficiencies on the potential of our economy.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the hon. 
member for the opportunity to say a few words about manpower 
training and, in a more general sense, overlap and duplication, 
the favourite mantra of the Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	Irrespective of whether the Bloc is successful in its quest to 
take Quebec out of Canada, and I hope sincerely that it is not 
successful, we should be devolving responsibility as close as 
possible to the people who are going to be the consumers of that 
responsibility.
<P>
	If a job can be done by the federal government but could be 
done better by a municipal government, then the municipal 
government should do it.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being 2 p.m., pursuant to Standing Order

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, for more than 18 months, Ottawa has been trying to 
make up its mind about replacing the old <I>Lucy Maud 
Montgomery</I>, the ferry link between the Magdalen Islands and 
Prince Edward Island. Since the beginning of this Parliament, 
the Bloc Quebecois has urged the Minister of Transport to 
decide what should be done, but the minister still cannot make 
up his mind and is trying to shirk his responsibilities. However, 
interprovincial ferry services are a federal responsibility and the 
Magdalen Islands transportation co-op cannot go ahead without 
federal financing.
<P>
	Not long ago, the Minister of Transport received letters from 
Quebec MNAs on the subject. Mr. Farrah, MNA for the 
Magdalen Islands, and Mr. Paillé, the Quebec Minister of 
Industry, agreed to ask the minister to act without delay.

decision, what is he waiting for?

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
while Reform with the support of grassroot Canadians is asking 
for more protection from violent, ruthless offenders proven in a 
court of law to be a threat to society, the Liberal government 
states that any bill seeking to keep sexual predators behind bars 
will not pass a constitutional challenge. The Liberal government 
is saying that it does not have the will or the courage to introduce 
legislation to protect our innocent children.
<P>
	A learned lawyer stated that if the government contacted 
constitutional lawyers instead of bureaucratic bosses, whose 
only interest is keeping their departments running smoothly and 
not for the best interest of Canadians, legislation could indeed 
be drafted that would pass the challenge.
<P>
	When is the Liberal government going to get some gumption, 
some concern for protecting grassroot Canadians and stop its do 
nothing, say nothing leadership? Using provincial health laws to 
keep offenders in jail is even a more stupid idea.
<P>

seems unwilling to give them: a safe and secure Canada.

	<B>Mr. Ivan Grose (Oshawa, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at this time of 
year when most of us are wearing the symbol of supreme 
sacrifice, the poppy, a question nevertheless is sometimes 
asked: Did the young Canadians who made this sacrifice die in 
vain?
<P>
	Yesterday in a citizenship court in Oshawa this question was 
answered eloquently by 54 people of 17 different countries. 
These people had decided that the country bequeathed to us by 
the total sacrifice of too many young Canadians was, to use the 
words often quoted by a prominent member of the House, ``the 
best country in the world''.
<P>
	I say to those who may oppose this comment that the evidence 
suggests they are mistaken. Being a long time gambler I will go 
with the odds. Fifty-four people from seventeen cultures say 
they are wrong. Come join with us and make it 18 different 
cultures working to enhance that which was so dearly bought.
<P>
	I would also like to point out to all hon. members wearing a 
poppy that as a symbol of the supreme sacrifice it should be 
worn above all other symbols and decorations including the

	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
adding insult to injury, yesterday the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage indicated that he was prepared to  consider letting 
Quebec play a role with respect to the electronic highway, a role 
as important, said the minister, as that of cable companies or 
municipalities.
<P>
	In so doing, the minister showed how indifferent he is to 
Quebec's cultural identity. It should be obvious that the 
electronic highway would have a decisive impact on Quebec 
society. It should be obvious that its cultural and educational 
content is the exclusive jurisdiction of the government of 
Quebec.
<P>
	And incidentally, how does the minister account for the lack 
of representatives from Quebec's cultural community on the 
advisory council on the electronic highway?
<P>
	The minister's incompetence and his lack of sensitivity to 
these issues are another good reason to demand his resignation.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in addition to questions about the integrity of this 
government regarding the Minister of Canadian Heritage, I must 
raise the issue of integrity within the defence department.
<P>
	It has now become clear that defence, along with Industry and 
Science Canada, is actively attempting to undermine and close 
down the operation of a small military magazine, <I>Esprit de 
corps</I>, which had the audacity to criticize defence department 
procedures and officials.
<P>
	By threatening to refuse contracts to companies like 
Mercedes Benz and General Motors that advertise in the 
publication, the government is attempting to remove the base 
upon which the magazine operates. These are the tactics of a 
police state, not a developed democracy. In Canada, citizens 
have a right to criticize the government if they disagree with its 
policies or practices.
<P>
	I do not agree with everything <I>Esprit de corps</I> says or how it is 
said, but I passionately defend its right to say it and I am 
appalled that senior government officials think otherwise.
<P>
	The minister of defence has been repeatedly advised but 
refuses to act on problems within his department. He has no 
excuse for inaction here.

Canada by promoting Canadian heritage. In eastern Ontario, for 
example, the Trent, Severn and Rideau waterways are part of our 
national heritage. They are a great attraction to tourists from 
other provinces and countries.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, we are informed that the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage sent at least seven other letters directly to the CRTC, in 
addition to his letter supporting a licence application. The 
minister's error is definitely compounded by the frequency with 
which he interferes with the CRTC's decisions. In fact, the 
minister sees nothing wrong with maintaining a regular 
correspondence with a quasi-judicial tribunal. The minister 
himself said this morning that the news about seven other letters 
improved his credibility, which just shows how good his 
judgment is.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7504"> 7504 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to ask the government how it can keep maintaining that 
the Minister of Canadian Heritage committed an honest 
mistake, knowing now it was not an isolated incident but 
common practice for this minister.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the 
Opposition was once a minister, and he knows that as such, one 
has certain responsibilities. For instance, when people write to 
complain about the content of television programs, a minister 
not only has the right but also a responsibility to refer such 
complaints to the CRTC, which was done in the case of the seven 
letters. It is, after all, the minister's responsibility to make 
appropriate references to the CRTC.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I may recall that five ministers were caught 
sending letters of support and, in four cases, letters very 
specifically advising the CRTC of that support, which means 
they were directly and unduly interfering with the CRTC's 
decision-making process.
<P>
	I want to ask the government how many more letters from the 
minister it will take to convince the government of the 
minister's lack of judgment. Does the Deputy Prime Minister 
share the position taken yesterday by the Minister of 
Immigration that a minister should not communicate directly 
with an agency for which he is responsible, thus directly 
condemning the behaviour of his colleague for Canadian 
Heritage vis-à-vis the CRTC?
<P>
	Are we to understand that in the mind of the government, in 
the mind of the Deputy Prime Minister, there are two codes of 
ethics, one for the Minister of Immigration and one for the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Leader of the 
Opposition was a minister.
<P>
	In his capacity as a minister he was required from time to time 
to write to bodies that were under his authority. Not only did he 
have the right to contact those bodies he had the responsibility.
<P>
	It seems to me that when the minister responsible for 
communications receives complaints from the public about the 
cost, for example, of cable increases he not only has the right to 
refer those letters to the CRTC he has the responsibility.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition would be the first person to 
complain if the minister responsible for communications 
refused to communicate with the body that develops those kinds 
of regulations. That is his responsibility. He is doing his job and 
he will continue to do his job under the guidelines that the Prime 
Minister has now established.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when we hear the Prime Minister promise a stricter 
code of ethics for the future, what the Deputy Prime Minister 
just said is not reassuring. She promises that things will go on as 
before since there are no objections. I may remind the 
government that under Prime Ministers Joe Clark and Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau, there were specific rules prohibiting ministers 
from communicating directly with tribunals like the CRTC.
<P>
	To show how far removed the Minister of Canadian Heritage 
is from the real world, I would ask the government to consider 
the fact that one of the letters that the minister sent to the CRTC 
and that were revealed this morning is dated October 13, less 
than two weeks after he received absolution for his first blunder, 
the letter of support dated March 15. Does the Deputy Prime 
Minister not realize that the hon. member for Laval West lacks 
the judgment required of a minister and that he is inept and thus 
incapable of performing the duties of a minister?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a copy of the 
letter in question. I would like to table it, along with the other 
letters that have been referred to, because I think they make the 
point very clearly that the minister was only carrying out his job, 
his responsibilities and his function as minister.
<P>
	What he was responding to was a letter from the member of 
Parliament for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt who wrote to 
the minister complaining on behalf of a constituent about cable 
television rates.
<P>
	The minister in his capacity as minister for communications 
very appropriately referred this letter from the member for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt to the CRTC. If he had 
ignored the letter or thrown it in the waste basket, which seems 
to be the reference of the hon. member, he would have been in 
breach of his duty.
<P>
	We believe the minister should carry out his duties in the 
context of the very strict guidelines that have been established 
by the Prime Minister to avoid any conflict of interest.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the Canadian Press, the government's ethics 
counsellor, Mr. Howard Wilson, had signing authority for 
federal contracts taken away from him in July 1992 as the result 
of an investigation by the Auditor General himself. This action 
was taken against him for having awarded contracts worth close 
to a million dollars without a call for tenders.

did the government know that he had his signing authority taken 
away from him by the Deputy Minister of Industry in 1992?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
and the Government of Canada have full confidence in the 
integrity and the ethics of the ethics counsellor.
<P>

otherwise, let him come forward and make a charge.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
conclude from the Deputy Prime Minister's answer that the 
government knew and so did the Prime Minister. In this context, 
how could the Prime Minister hide this information from the 
opposition? Does the Deputy Prime Minister not recognize that 
when the Prime Minister consulted the opposition last June 
regarding the appointment of Mr. Wilson, he himself committed 
a serious breach of elementary rules of ethics by keeping this 
information from the opposition?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, yesterday, at noon, the 
Leader of the Opposition, in response to the Prime Minister's 
statement said, and I quote: ``We never doubted the Prime 
Minister's integrity''. He said it himself yesterday, he was even 
consulted on the appointment of the person in question.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stated yesterday that he takes full and 
entire responsibility for his ministers' decisions. If the member 
opposite wants to attack civil servants who are not allowed to 
defend themselves, let him make accusations.

<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has said that ministers are handed a 
set of confidential rules of conduct by the PMO when they 
assume their responsibilities. This is the minimum we would 
expect from a government that claims to have a serious interest 
in integrity. The public and Parliament have a right to see such 
guidelines so they can judge whether they are kept or broken.
<P>
	In keeping with the Prime Minister's commitment to integrity 
and openness in government, would the Deputy Prime Minister 
agree to table these original guidelines given to the ministers in 
November so we can compare them with any proposed new 
guidelines and the government's position on the activities of the 
Canadian heritage minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has 
promised a full and open debate of the new guidelines. I am sure 
in the context of those guidelines the commissioner for ethics is 
going to want to bring all the facts forward.
<P>
	I hope there will be a full public debate because I know the 
guidelines will stand the test of time. However no guideline is 
the measure of a person's honesty.
<P>
	The Prime Minister said that he was putting his integrity on 
the line because the hallmark of this government was not 
determined by what was written down in guidelines, but rather 
the fact that he and his ministers carried out their jobs with 
honesty and integrity. Nobody is challenging the honesty or the 
integrity of the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, they will not submit the guidelines.
<P>
	Anyone who has studied the relations of ministers to quasi 
judicial tribunals knows there is only one guideline that ought to 
guide their communications. They should communicate only 
through statutes, orders in council and the submissions to public 
inquiries.
<P>
	Yet yesterday the Prime Minister said the only guideline he 
gave ministers last November on such communications was that 
they should only do so through the duly authorized officials. 
Surely a Prime Minister who has spent 30 years in public life, 
some of them as justice minister, can come up with a better 
guideline than that.
<P>
	Are the rest of the government's guidelines on ethics as weak 
and as poorly worded as this one? If so, what specifically is the 
government going to do to strengthen them?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if you follow the 
rationale of the leader of the third party, basically you would tell 
the member for Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt, who wrote 
to the minister on behalf of a constituent who was concerned 
about the increase in the cost of cable television, that the 
minister cannot pass his concerns along. The minister has a 
responsibility in the discharge of his duties to make sure that the 
cable television system is working properly.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has set in place is a system where all 
future correspondence must go through the ethics counsellor. 
We think that is an interim fair measure. We are looking for a 
very full and open debate in the House on guidelines that will 
permit ministers to do their jobs and at the same time will make 
sure that members of Parliament get the service they deserve 
from ministers of the government.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, what 99 per cent of ministers in other jurisdictions do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7506"> 7506 </A></B>
<P>
in that case is tell the constituent to  communicate directly and 
give the reason why. This is not exactly rocket science.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That is right.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manning:</B> Mr. Speaker, the rules of conduct for ministers 
and the role of the ethics counsellor are inseparably related. 
Yesterday in the House the Prime Minister refused to disclose 
the content of his office's discussions with his own ethics 
counsellor on the dubious activities of the Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. This sort of closed room, back door, ad hoc handling 
of an ethical issue runs contrary to his profession of interest in 
integrity and openness.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister directly, what specifically 
was the advice that the ethics counsellor gave to the 
government? Did he or did he not say that the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage should resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot accept the 
premise of the hon. member that when Jim Hart, MP for 
Okanagan-Similkameen-Merritt wrote to the minister-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1430 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, it would be better to refer to 
one another by our ridings rather than mentioning our names.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Copps:</B> Mr. Speaker, the letter reads: ``Dear Minister: A 
constituent of mine has a concern in regards to pending fee hikes 
at Regional Cable T.V. Inc. It would be very much appreciated if 
you''-the minister-``would review the enclosed letters from 
Mrs. Kirkland and provide explanation as to why she must pay 
$3 more per month in basic rates even if she does not want the 
additional channels''.
<P>
	Presumably the minister in making a reference to the CRTC 
was passing along the concerns rightfully expressed by a 
member of Parliament on behalf of his constituents. That is part 
of the job of being a member of Parliament. We would hope the 
Reform Party would not want to tie the hands of members who 
are trying to represent their constituents.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, when I listen to the answers of the Deputy Prime 
Minister, I realize that the Minister of Canadian Heritage is not 
the only one to confuse the duties of a member of Parliament 
with the role of a minister.
<P>
	Can the Deputy Prime Minister tell us what credibility the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage still has, considering that he is 
not even able to understand the responsibilities he has regarding 
the CRTC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
himself said in this House that mistakes were made. Is the hon. 
member looking for a solution or a political issue?
<P>
	Last week, the Prime Minister adopted the following solution: 
he wrote to every minister that no correspondence can be sent 
directly to quasi-judicial bodies. That solution was arrived at 
before Mr. Wilson proposed more elaborate rules which will be 
debated in this House. There was a problem and mistakes were 
made. These mistakes were corrected and we should respect the 
integrity of ministers when they are carrying out their duties.
<P>
	The Leader of the Opposition was a minister at one time. He 
knows that he had a responsibility to his constituents from 
Lac-Saint-Jean and also to his position as minister. We would 
not want his constituents to have their hands tied just because 
their member of Parliament happened to be in the cabinet. They 
want to obtain services. We want to provide good, efficient and 
honest services. And that is what we are trying to do.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am not a minister, but last Wednesday evening, 
when I heard about this issue, I immediately knew that the 
minister had to resign. That is the real solution.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay: </B>And if it is not, then this will turn into a 
political issue.
<P>
	What kind of credibility can a minister have when he does not 
understand the basic rules governing his department's 
operations, and how can he deal with the important issues for 
which he is responsible, including the financing of the CBC, the 
future of Telefilm Canada and the National Film Board, the 
electronic highway, as well as the review of the Copyright Act 
which we have been waiting for so long?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister has 
made it very clear that a mistake was made and that the 
government has put in place a system to ensure it does not 
happen again. The minister himself made it very clear that as 
soon as he understood the CRTC was misinterpreting his 
original letter, he sent a second letter to rectify the issue.
<P>
	The member says she is going to turn it into a political issue. 
If the member is really interested in a solution she will 
recognize the fact that as of last Friday the Prime Minister 
issued a directive to all members of the cabinet that any letter by 
any minister to any quasi-judicial body will go through Mr. 
Wilson.
<P>

<HR>
<B><A NAME="7507"> 7507 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	In the meantime Mr. Wilson is working very hard. In fact he 
had a meeting with cabinet this morning to establish hard and 
fast guidelines for dealing with quasi-judicial bodies that will 
respect the work of ministers and at the same time respect the 
rights of constituents across this country to be rightfully 
represented in Parliament. I do not want the electors of 
Hamilton East to have their hands tied just because I happen to 
be in the cabinet.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, once again I would appeal to 
you to make both the questions and the answers as brief as 
possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage.
<P>
	We learned that the Minister of Canadian Heritage has written 
eight letters to the CRTC. Seven of these letters do recognize 
that he cannot interfere, yet in the eighth letter he does not 
qualify his interventions. The minister knew that he was not to 
interfere in seven cases. Why did he choose to intervene in this 
particular case with the quasi-judicial body for which he is 
responsible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the premise of the hon. 
member's question in fact is refuted by a letter that she received 
from the person to whom she referred yesterday when she said 
there were allegations of undue influence.
<P>
	In fact the secretary general of the CRTC has written back to 
the hon. member stating: ``All communications related to a 
public process are treated in the same way regardless of 
originator. This includes a minister of the crown or other 
members of Parliament''. The member will know that because 
she received the letter from Mr. Darling which clarified very 
specifically that no special treatment had been received.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question was directed to the Minister of Canadian Heritage. I 
believe we still do have a Minister of Canadian Heritage on the 
other side.
<P>
	With respect to the communication between the CRTC 
secretary general and my office, yes indeed I did have a 
panic-stricken secretary general call me yesterday.
<P>
	My question is focused on the Deputy Prime Minister in this 
instance. Yesterday in an interview the minister of immigration 
stated he would not send a letter to the Immigration and Refugee 
Board. He said it would be wrong for him to write to a 
quasi-judicial body that reports directly to him. I do not 
understand this. The minister of immigration appears to 
understand it, but the Minister of Canadian Heritage does not.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is not applying the same ethic 
requirements to all of his cabinet. I ask this question specifically 
and directly for an answer. Why is he giving the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage such special treatment in this instance?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister 
came to this House and provided members with all the facts and 
information surrounding the matter. In fact he stated quite 
clearly that the minister in question made a mistake.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	The minister in question made a mistake and the guidelines as 
they relate to quasi-judicial bodies were not clear. He had 
moved to rectify the mistake, first of all by the member's letter 
specifically to the CRTC. Second the Prime Minister moved to 
clarify the guidelines by asking Mr. Wilson to reintroduce a new 
package. In the meantime he has established interim guidelines 
where all future communications of all ministers to 
quasi-judicial bodies must go through the ethics counsellor.
<P>
	I think he has done the job in four days and I feel that he has 
delivered on his promise of honest government. I believe he has 
reinforced the notion that ethics and integrity are the hallmark 
of his administration, they are not simply a regulation.

while the Minister of Canadian Heritage continues his soul 
searching and is probably getting ready to confess all, let me 
address another issue. My question is for the Deputy Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	CSIS is back in the hot seat. According to a book entitled 
<I>Betrayal</I>, which will hit the stands this week, CSIS asked one of 
its agents to plant a bomb aboard an Air India plane in Rome in 
1986, so that Sikh terrorists would be blamed for it.
<P>
	Does the government intend to check such troubling 
allegations and does it acknowledge that, if they are proven true, 
the strongest measures should be taken against such criminal 
activities?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House

Speaker, this matter was reviewed by the Security Intelligence 
Review Committee and was reported on in its public report in

Review Committee in that report found that CSIS had acted 
properly, contrary to the allegations.

me point out to the Leader of the Government in the House of

allegation.
<P>
	Considering the allegations that democratic organizations 
were infiltrated by CSIS, that the conversations of members of 
the Quebec government were monitored by the CSE and a bomb 
was placed aboard an Air India plane by a CSIS agent, will the 
government agree to set up a real public inquiry on the actions of 
federal secret agents?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the </B><B>House

Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	With regard to the matter reported in the press as being the 
subject matter of a book, which I have not seen yet, I have just 
read about it in the press, I understand the matter of Ryszard 
Paskowski was thoroughly examined by the Security 
Intelligence Review Committee. In its annual report for

	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Deputy Prime Minister and has to do with the role of the 
ethics counsellor in the now infamous Minister of Canadian 
Heritage affair.
<P>
	We have it on good authority, namely from the counsellor 
himself, that he first found out about the letter on Wednesday, 
October 26 and that his source was the press and not the Prime 
Minister's office. He was not asked by the Prime Minister's 
office to do anything. He was not asked to prepare a report on the 
letter and he has not done so.
<P>
	My question is simple: Why did the Prime Minister take the 
trouble to appoint an ethics counsellor and obligate the 
taxpayers to pay for the cost of that position if he does not 
consult with him on an issue this critical when he had over a 
month to do so?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the Prime 
Minister more than adequately answered that question when the 
same question was posed yesterday and last week.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> I suppose, Mr. Speaker, we 
will ask the same question again until we get an answer that is 
correct for the Canadian people.
<P>
<B>(1445 ) </B>
<P>
	The ethics counsellor has confirmed that it was only on Friday 
last, October 28, that he was given a document which outlines 
the rules for ministerial conduct and that he was asked to bring it 
up to date vis-à-vis dealings with quasi-judicial bodies. The 
Prime Minister stated yesterday that his recommendations were 
to be discussed by cabinet.
<P>
	Would it not enhance public confidence if the guidelines for 
ministers would be made public, be presented, debated and 
possibly amended in this House and approved by a free vote of 
members of Parliament on behalf of all Canadians?
<P>

question is for the Minister of Canadian Heritage. Speaking 
yesterday at the convention of the <I>Association des 
câblodistributeurs du Québec</I>, the heritage minister stated that 
only the Canadian government should control the electronic 
highway, in order to be able to set national objectives and 
promote the Canadian cultural identity. He categorically refused 
to acknowledge the role or responsibility of the provinces in this 
matter.
<P>
	How can the heritage minister exclude Quebec and all the 
other provinces from the electronic highway project and 
consider them, along with cable operators and municipal 
governments, as mere lobbies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage, 
Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, had our colleague taken the time to read the 
speech I made yesterday, he would know that what he has just 
said is absolutely incorrect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am just 
quoting today's newspaper.
<P>
	Must we infer from the scornful attitude of the minister that 
not only does he deny in fact Quebec's distinct character, but 
that he also rejects off-handedly all our historic claims in 
matters of culture and communication?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage,

Industry.
<P>
	It has been one year since we were all elected to this 
prestigious House of Commons. In reviewing my files I 
happened to notice that this government had made a 
commitment one year ago that we wished to become a nation of 
exporters.
<P>

this ministry has moved ahead on making sure that we become a 
nation of exporters?
<P>

very timely question from the member for Nepean.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> The Reform Party 
does not seem to show a lot of interest here in the government's 
commitment toward small and medium sized business. This is 
National Services Month.
<P>
	The service companies of this country employ close to 9 
million Canadians and the Government of Canada has made a 
commitment to work with the service organizations of this

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
would like to change the line of questioning. The Liberals of the 
1990s are scandalously similar to the Liberals of the 1970s, 
smacking of allegations and conflict of interest.
<P>
	In 1971 our present Prime Minister called a Quebec judge. 
Regardless of the reason he maintained he could call since he 
was acting just as a member of Parliament and not as a minister. 
Sound familiar? He did not say that was a mistake.
<P>
	Could this be the reason 20 years later why the Prime Minister 
will not ask this minister to resign because he could not hold this 
minister to a higher level of responsibility than he himself had?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am surprised and 
disappointed at the line of questioning of the hon. member.
<P>
	The fact is there is no one in this House who has a greater 
sense of integrity or honesty than the Prime Minister.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
1976 Prime Minister Trudeau brought in guidelines that stated: 
``Nor may any member of cabinet communicate with members 
of quasi-judicial bodies'', except of course through the proper 
formal channels. Even in 1984 Mr. Mulroney put guidelines in 
place.
<P>
	Are these guidelines of the 1970s and the 1980s not good 
enough for these Liberals of the 1990s? Will the Prime Minister 
live up to that fine sense of integrity and ask this minister to 
resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the hon. 
member is somehow leaving the impression with the public that 
this guideline is in someway different from the guidelines that 
have been in place in the past.
<P>
	The guideline the Prime Minister instituted with respect to 
quasi-judicial bodies was the guideline that had been in place 
for more than a decade. The guideline is obviously not clear and 
that is why last Friday the Prime Minister asked the ethics 
counsellor to make sure there is a full public-the previous 
minister of Mulroney's government did not seem to mind when 
they were his guidelines at that time in 1989.
<P>
	The fact is the current guidelines are not clear and to clear up 
any uncertainty the Prime Minister is asking for a full open 
parliamentary public debate on new guidelines. I do not see how 
much clearer the Prime Minister can get than that.

servants reached $617 million, which is more than $2.5 million 
a working day in travel by federal civil servants.
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	The minister asked members of the Bloc Quebecois for 
suggestions; should he not work at reducing travel by federal 
civil servants which costs, as I said, $2.5 million a working day?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, actually the amount of travel costs has been going 
down.
<P>
	There has also been a decline in the number of people in the 
public service as has been pointed out previously. Of course this 
is kept under very close scrutiny by the Treasury Board and by 
the various ministries. We intend to keep doing that.
<P>
	We are in a position in which we have to cut the cost of 
government to get the deficit down to 3 per cent of GDP. It 
requires that we keep vigilant on all of our expenditures 
including travel expenditures. We intend to do that.

my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	With respect to the Minister of Canadian Heritage, it is 
becoming increasingly obvious that the application process of 
the CRTC was tainted by political interference by the minister.
<P>
	The CRTC in refusing the application may itself have made a 
political decision just to be on the safe side. The panic stricken 
phone call from Mr. Darling to the member for Calgary 
Southeast yesterday merely confirms the concern felt by many 
Canadians that this quasi-judicial body is now feeling pressure 
for political reasons.
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister assure us that the integrity of the 
CRTC and its decision making process have not been 
compromised by the actions of the minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the letter of the 
secretary general to the hon. member he states quite 
categorically that all communications related to a public process 
are treated in the same way. This includes a minister of the 
crown or other members of Parliament.
<P>
	The member pointed out quite rightly yesterday that 
obviously the influence of the minister could not have been that 
substantial because the application was denied.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when a letter comes from a minister it is often as much what is 
not said as what is said that influences an outfit like the CRTC.
<P>
	In 1976 the Minister for Public Works at that time telephoned 
a judge on behalf of the current Minister of Foreign Affairs. That 
minister offered his resignation voluntarily to the Prime 
Minister but the Prime Minister of the day, Mr. Trudeau, refused 
to accept it.
<P>
	Surely it is not Liberal tradition to interfere with judicial 
bodies and get away with it. Will the Prime Minister, if it is, 
break with that tradition, do the right thing and ask for the 
resignation of the Minister of Canadian Heritage?
<P>

IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-57, an act to implement the agreement establishing the World 
Trade Organization, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as a 
Quebecer and as the member of the Bloc Quebecois representing 
the riding of Longueuil, I am pleased to take part in this debate 
on the bill to implement the World Trade Organization 
Agreement. In my remarks, I will rely on my personal 
experience.
<P>
	I worked in the business sector for 15 years. I owned a small 
business that employed about 25 people. I was also the president 
of a company in the wholesale business with some 30 employees 
and president of the Chamber of Commerce of the South Shore 
of Montreal, the third most important chamber of commerce in 
Quebec. During the same period, I sat as director on the board of 
a credit union. I say all that just to show that most business 
people in Quebec are deeply involved in their community, just 
as I was, and can be pressed for time.
<P>
	It is sometimes difficult for them to deal with international 
matters. I am proud of my deep  involvement in the business 
sector, because it is a marvellous and exciting sector. Business 
people are constantly looking for means to improve both 
management and productivity. It is a world of constant change 
and inventiveness.
<P>
	As a businessman and a politician from Quebec, I am 
delighted at the new opportunities that will flow from the new 
GATT.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	Business people, through trade, will also get to know each 
other better and probably become the best instrument for 
achieving a more lasting peace in the world. So the Uruguay 
Round and Bill C-57 are important steps, as I have just 
mentioned. Today, the globalization of markets creates 
important and increasing opportunities. Businesses have to be 
more and more efficient.
<P>
	Businesses need a flexible and efficient framework regulating 
trade as well as credible dispute-settlement mechanisms. 
Businesses must be able to count on the co-operation of 
enlightened government partners as well as unions sensitive to 
the economy. Businesses need laws and rules adapted to this new 
environment.
<P>
	The Uruguay Round negociations will lead to an increase in 
international trade. Some statistics put the increase at $750 
billion over the next 10 years. The amount of money flowing 
from one country to another is potentially enormous on the 
international level. So we must carefully watch this increase in 
international trade. This will also bring about an increase in 
total wealth of some $200 billion.
<P>
	Here also, people will be richer, they will be able to spend 
more and they will have a greater potential for doing so. With 
Bill C-57, which implements the accord in Canada and Quebec, 
what are the stakes for Quebec, what is the importance of trade 
for Quebec? Quebec has a long commercial tradition. The 
history of our people is marked by trade.
<P>
	Fur, fish and softwood trade has been the backbone of our 
economic development for the last four centuries. Today, we 
still export softwood, newspaper, electricity, aluminum and 
communication services. The last thirty years have allowed 
Quebec to open to the world.
<P>
	The increase of international trade in Quebec is important 
and, of course, we have established some bases in other 
countries. We have several offices in several major cities of the 
world, in the United States as well as in Europe. Even in Japan, 
we have trade commissioners, so that Quebec is remarkably 
open to the world, and we will continue to work in that direction.
<P>
	Quebec is very open to the world. Here is an example that 
happened not too long ago. In 1988 the government had a free 
trade project with the United States. Quebec was one of the first 
to support free trade. Free trade was supported almost unani-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7512"> 7512 </A></B>
<P>
mously, certainly by the Quebec  Liberal government, the Parti 
Quebecois and the vast majority of Quebecers.
<P>
	Of course, at that time, federal Liberals were against free 
trade. Over time, they finally understood, but I can tell you that 
it was a never-ending battle, particularly during the 1988 
election, which was mostly based on free trade. Unions were 
also against it because they were supporting the NDP. But now, 
they have changed and are starting to understand that free trade 
with the United States is a good thing, that world market 
liberalization is a good thing for most businesses.
<P>
	Quebec also supported the latest agreement, NAFTA, between 
Canada, the United States and Mexico. Once again, that 
demonstrates that Quebecers are very open to world markets. I 
will now talk about Quebec's openness towards the coming of 
new partners in NAFTA. Quebec, a growing society, has become 
a partner which is credible, efficient and well respected not only 
in North America but also in Europe. More and more 
businessmen and businesswomen in Quebec are active in 
international trade. Quebec needs a legal framework in order to 
develop its export industry. International trade is a challenge for 
business people in Quebec. There are numerous and daily 
challenges in the business sector but international trade is even 
more demanding.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	There are some aspects to be considered. First, the financial 
soundness of the company. Before considering the export 
related costs, we have to assess all the costs in terms of 
prospecting and distribution network. For instance, as far as 
foreign accounts receivable are concerned, we have to take into 
consideration customs clearance and exchange rates.
<P>
	Second, the control of production costs. Can the production 
be done within the timeframe without altering services provided 
to local customers who bring in our daily bread and butter?
<P>
	Third, staff qualifications. Is the staff fully qualified to meet 
the demand? In terms of foreign languages, legal and technical 
vocabulary, business networks, financial support agencies, 
market, traveling, etc., can we train current staff? Should we 
hire qualified staff or people abroad?
<P>
	Fourth, the marketing instruments. Before investing in 
marketing activities, a company should get some information on 
the way of doing things in the country with which it intends to do 
business.
<P>
	Fifth, the expectations of customers. Check if the product or 
the service you wish to export meets the expectations of our new 
customers. International trade is a complex matter, hence the 
importance of trade agreements and mechanisms necessary to 
their implementation.
<P>
	The role of governments. International governments, the 108 
governments party to the agreement must first establish a 
framework for international trade; negotiate trade agreements 
furthering the access to new markets as well as preserving 
harmony and balance; eliminate barriers to international trade. 
The Uruguay Round satisfies those requirements to a great 
extent.
<P>
	Sixth, business support. I believe the government should keep 
a close eye on the performance of businesses, their needs and the 
different matters that I have already mentioned, for example a 
certain guarantee concerning accounts receivable. When you 
export, collecting bills can be a difficult thing. The government 
should establish some sort of guarantee. That already exists for 
larger companies but it becomes very difficult and costly for 
small business, small and medium-sized firms. Governments 
should create a fund that would guarantee accounts receivable 
for small and medium-sized firms wishing to export.
<P>
	There is also the issue of loans for the promotion of our 
products. It is often very difficult for small firms who have 
excellent products to export them if they do not have the 
necessary cash flow and it is often difficult to obtain it from the 
banks. Measures should be taken to ensure provision of funds 
for the promotion of our products. These funds would not 
constitute a gift but would rather be a loan guaranteed by the 
government or by independent insurance companies or others. 
Such a fund should definitely be set up to promote our products 
on foreign markets.
<P>
<B>(1515) </B>
<P>
	There are also trade bureaus abroad that are dynamic and 
available, people who are very willing to help our small and 
medium-sized businesses wishing to export and to develop 
markets. Public servants often lack drive. There is a lot of 
diplomatic talk, but when the time comes to do business, it is 
considered inappropriate. But I believe that the best way to 
survive is to do business, especially in these very open markets. 
It will really be necessary to support our businesses, to at least 
give them the information they need about the culture and the 
economy of those countries, the way they do business, all kinds 
of information that is available to the staff of the Department of 
Foreign Affairs and that could be useful for small and 
medium-sized businesses.
<P>
	Because it is important I want to focus on an area over which 
Quebec has been claiming exclusive control for a long time, 
manpower training. We shall have to really consult each other, 
to try to be as efficient as possible and to train highly advanced 
people in order to be able to produce, create, be productive, to 
have adequate manpower, etc.
<P>
	This is a very important point. I read in <I>L'actualité</I> of 
September 15 an article I found interesting. I knew a little bit 
about it, because when I was chairman of the Committee on 
Science and Technology we toured Europe. I had been struck by 
the dynamism shown by the  Germans in the area of training in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7513"> 7513 </A></B>
<P>
science and technology. Scientists I met there were utterly 
different from the scientists here; they acted like car salesmen. 
They were extremely energetic and, what is extraordinary, they 
had business acumen.
<P>
	In the article I was mentioning, Sylvie Halpern writes: ``A 
small town of 15,000 inhabitants can have its own technical 
school, provided there is some industry and specific needs for 
specialized manpower. The financing comes from the Lander, 
the 16 administrative regions of Germany''.
<P>
	In Germany, the regions are responsible for vocational 
training. The federal government does not tell the regions what 
they need in terms of training, they each look after the needs of 
their area. It is said that Quebec and Ottawa quarrel about that. I 
should have said at the start: ``Here is a model that works, the 
German model''.
<P>
	This system has been in existence in Germany for a long time. 
They decentralized manpower training long ago, and they did it 
in a way which is more responsive to the needs of business.
<P>
	Here is another interesting excerpt: ``The strength of the 
German technical colleges resides in the fact that students come 
and go constantly''. I must say that in the vocational schools, 
even in the schools of high technology, students share their time 
between the workplace and the classroom. They put to use what 
they learn and are much more capable and efficient when they 
get on the work market. This way, products are better, 
productivity is greater, etc.
<P>
	It is also reported that: ``Technical colleges are a new type of 
university focusing on practical abilities''. That is what they do. 
The report says we simply must be more practical in what we 
teach instead of teaching vague notions, horizontally. We must 
be closer to businesses and focus more on their needs. It will be 
necessary.
<P>
	It goes on to say: ``About 800 industry professionals teach in 
these institutions''. Their teachers are not people who know 
nothing of the industrial environment but only big principles 
learned in books. They are people who work in the industry and 
are well-acquainted with this environment.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	What I mean is that manpower training must be managed by 
Quebec, by businesses and even by those regions with highly 
specialized sectors. This is the only way we will become truly 
productive and be able to meet the competition from other 
countries in a global economy. I support the opening of markets, 
but, at the same time, we must ensure that our labour force, be it 
technicians, managers or business owners, is adequately trained 
to compete on the world markets.
<P>
	Germany is an excellent example of this. I even took the 
trouble to send a copy of this article to Mr. Garon, the new 
education minister in Quebec, for him to read.
<P>
	It bears to be repeated. We will never repeat it enough because 
the federal government is so stubborn. We have been talking 
about it for the past 20 or 30 years, but during all that time we 
have been falling behind. That is why we have to repeat it again 
and again. I wonder if we will ever succeed. The federal 
government is so pig-headed and, as you know, it wants to keep 
its spending power all for itself so that it can tell Quebecers: 
``Look, if I had not been here, this would not have been 
possible''. That is the idea, you see. This is not logical, this is 
not practical. This is not the right thing to do. But what the 
federal government is saying is this: ``I want to impose my will. 
I want to prove that I am important. If I were not here, you would 
not be able to succeed''. And herein lies the misconception.
<P>
	Have I run out of time, Mr. Speaker? I feel as if I have only 
been speaking for ten minutes. I still had a lot of things to say. 
Anyway, I am very proud to have taken part in this debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Patrick Gagnon (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I just heard the hon. 
member opposite talk about the stubbornness of the government 
of Canada and governmental services such as the FORD-Q, the 
Federal Business Development Bank, and the services 
responsible for promoting Canadian exports.
<P>
	I would really like to know whether the federal government 
was stubborn when it came to providing assistance to Canadair, 
Bombardier, SNC Lavalin, when it came to providing assistance 
to Spar Aerospace in Montreal and Quebec pharmaceutical 
companies. Did they call it stubbornness on the part of the 
federal government when tens of thousands of jobs were created 
with the direct participation of the government of Canada?
<P>
	Unfortunately, the hon. member takes a stand that completely 
ignores such accomplishments as well as the unconditional 
support of the Canadian government to Quebec businesses.
<P>
	The member opposite talks about the qualifications of Quebec 
representatives abroad, but what does he think of the 
appointment of the former chairman of the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste of Montreal, an ideologist who knows 
nothing about Quebec business, let alone about international 
affairs. You would call him a worthy representative of Quebec 
and Quebec business people abroad?
<P>
	I know what I am talking about. I speak from experience. I 
have had the privilege of working in Japan myself on a number 
of occasions. To think that we, Quebecers, are represented by an 
ideologist from the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste of Montreal 
whose sole purpose for being there is to sell separatist 
propaganda instead of working to open up new channels of trade 
for  Quebec businesses, I say it is time that we determine how 
useful 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7514"> 7514 </A></B>
<P>
these Quebec offices abroad really are, when we are represented 
by the likes of Mr. Doyon, the former chairman of the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste of Montreal.
<P>
	With respect to education in Germany for example, one must 
remember that nothing prevented Quebec from training 
semi-skilled manpower because, as we know, education is a 
provincial jurisdiction. Quebec has had control over education 
matters for much more than 30 years; it has had it for 125 years.
<P>
	So, nothing is preventing Quebec from setting up a real 
vocational training program that meets the needs of the people 
of Quebec and the challenges of the next century.
<P>
<B>(1525) </B>
<P>
	I would be curious to hear what the hon. member opposite has 
to say on these three subjects: first, the fact that the federal 
government has always participated and that many businesses in 
Quebec have benefited from its participation; second, the fact 
that I challenge the qualifications of the Quebec delegate 
general in Tokyo and, third, whether or not he recognizes that 
Quebec was never prevented from conducting its own in-house 
vocational training program.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Mr. Speaker, when the hon. 
member talks about the subsidies received by Quebec 
businesses, I agree with him. However, he forgot to mention 
something I pointed out in my speech earlier, namely that the 
money received by Quebecers is the money they sent to Ottawa 
previously. It is not a gift from the federal government; that is 
the problem.
<P>
	Federalists are always trying to make Quebecers believe that 
Quebec could not survive without the federal government. In 
fact, the money given to Quebec, whether it is the New Horizons 
Program for seniors, the old age pension or business subsidies, 
comes from Quebecers. Let us stop pretending that this money 
comes from the federal government, when it comes from the 
pockets of Quebec taxpayers. God knows how much we pay in 
taxes! God also knows how much is wasted because, while this 
money goes from Quebec to Ottawa and back to Quebec, 
perhaps 25, 30 or 40 per cent is lost through waste, 
inconsistency, etc. That is the first answer.
<P>
	As for representatives abroad, I can say that the Government 
of Quebec is doing an excellent job. Four or five representatives 
in New York, Boston, Tokyo or elsewhere have already been 
replaced as it is quite normal for a government to be represented 
by people who share its vision and its business policy. Would the 
Liberal Party of Canada not replace its representatives if they 
did not share its vision? The Parti Quebecois is moving quickly 
and doing a very good job, and I do not see anything wrong with 
that.
<P>
	As for the former President of Montreal's 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, I know him personally. I can tell 
you that he is an exceptionally intelligent man. His vision is 
much wider than that just outlined by the hon.  member for 
Gaspé, much wider than the hon. member thinks. If he has such a 
narrow view of people, I think that he has no place in this House. 
He shows flagrant disrespect for this person who devoted 
himself body and soul to protecting the French language in 
Quebec. He may not think French is important in Quebec but it is 
very important to us; we have great respect for this language and 
I think he should, too.
<P>
	As far as training is concerned, there is no doubt that Quebec 
is responsible for training, but the federal government 
stubbornly continues to spend billions of dollars on manpower 
training. There will be a $2 billion UI surplus. Of course, the 
federal government will want to keep this money and then spend 
it in Quebec so that it can boast that it is doing Quebecers a 
favour. We know that this money is being spent in a disorderly 
fashion. It is spent with an efficiency rate of about 25 per cent. I 
am not saying that it is completely wasted, but spending on 
manpower training is about 25 per cent effective.
<P>
	Very little really adequate training is going on for the money 
that is spent. The amounts are huge! Imagine if the federal 
government left this $2 billion with Quebecers or gave it to the 
Quebec Department of Education to create proper programs that 
are more focused on businesses that need better adjusted 
training. No, that is not what happens. Seventy-five per cent is 
wasted.
<P>
	On Monday, I was in my Longueuil riding office and three 
people with manpower training problems were there to say that 
they were finishing high school and their aid was being cut. 
They were told that they were not entitled to assistance anymore 
and it was over.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	That is crazy. I prefer not to talk about it. I am tired of it, 
because every week we have problems with this system. For a 
long time, Quebec has demanded control of manpower training. 
It is essential and Quebecers are unanimously for it. Everyone in 
Quebec-business people, labour, the Department of Education, 
the former Liberal government, the Parti Quebecois, the present 
government-demands it. The Bélanger-Campeau Commission 
also called for it, but the federal government is stubborn and 
nothing can be done about it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Okanagan Centre 
will have the floor next. I might indicate to colleagues that after 
the member speaks, we will go to 10-minute speeches because 
we will have debated the matter for five hours.
<P>
	However the hon. member for Okanagan Centre has the full 
20 minutes.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7515"> 7515 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to enter the debate on Bill C-57.
<P>
	This bill supports the conclusions of the latest round of GATT, 
an agreement that provides a framework in which Canada and 
the rest of the free trading world can share in prosperity and put 
the world economy on a sound footing as it heads toward the 
21st century.
<P>
	For Canada, a country heavily dependent on trade, the GATT 
represents the world's commitment to a strong international 
trading system. GATT shows us that the world has the courage to 
co-operate, not hide behind destructive, protective measures 
and that it is able to find a trade dispute mechanism which can be 
agreed on, not only in principle but in the real world.
<P>
	The GATT has created the World Trading Organization, a 
strong, effective, permanent institution which will oversee 
world trade policy and settle disputes between nations on a 
multilateral basis.
<P>
	The GATT has strengthened trade rules on subsidies and 
countervailing duties. The GATT has achieved commitment 
from 120 participating countries to lower or eliminate tariffs or 
other barriers to trade. The GATT is multilateral. One hundred 
and forty-one partners in 21 countries came to these 
agreements. It is progress. It is prosperity.
<P>
	But the GATT does something else, succinctly, clearly, 
loudly. It points out a glaring deficiency. It is easier for 
Canadians to trade with the world than it is for Canadians to 
trade with Canadians. While the world creates its own window 
of opportunity, the federal government and the provinces are 
still unable to make any real progress toward achieving the 
same.
<P>
	Emphasis is put on the fact that one in five jobs are dependent 
on international trade and that 30 per cent of Canada's GDP is 
reliant on international trade. But what about the four jobs that 
rely on internal trade within Canada and the 70 per cent of GDP 
that still relies on a sound fiscal and monetary climate right here 
within our own boundaries?
<P>
	It is like throwing salt in a wound to know that the textile 
industry can find more support in the GATT than it can at home. 
Canada's textile market is about to gain improved access to 
major developed trading partners including the European union 
and Japan. It is what the textile industry pushed for and it is what 
they got. But not here in Canada.
<P>
	The same is true for 11 other sectors from wood to steel to 
agriculture. Everywhere in the world, but not here. This must 
change.
<P>
	More than an avenue of tacit trade globally, the GATT has 
provided Canada the blueprint for success in breaking down 
internal trade barriers. Like the GATT, we must acknowledge 
that it takes the development of a strong, central body like the 
World Trade Organization to ensure a well engineered program.
<P>
	In Canada we need a strong central federal government able to 
direct the provinces toward initiation of a multilateral, equally 
beneficial agreement among the provinces like the GATT. It is 
important to acknowledge that in large part the success of 
Canada in the GATT negotiations has been inspired by an 
industry driven agenda.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Industry knows what it needs to increase production and 
provide more jobs. The federal government must listen to it, as 
the world has, for industry's drive and confidence will give the 
provinces the incentive to want to trade with other provinces.
<P>
	Like the GATT, we must seek to find a level playing field. We 
must encourage the internal trade market to expand so that the 
trading system does not operate solely for the benefit of a 
powerful few. We must create an environment in which all 
provinces will be encouraged to become key players. Each 
province must have the opportunity to access the Canadian 
market without fearing counter-protective measures or costly 
compromise.
<P>
	The Minister of Industry has said again and again that we 
must ensure Canada's prosperity, that trade barriers are a 
question of economics, that we must liberalize trade in Canada. 
The minister says we are making progress in this direction, but I 
cannot agree. The urgency of this matter seems apparent to only 
a few. Otherwise the government and the provinces would be 
trying harder to come to an agreement.
<P>
	The GATT agreement should give Canadians the confidence 
to reach an interim trade agreement and prove that the advantage 
lies in being less protective of our home markets, not more. 
Industry knows it, but government is slow to respond. Industry 
is anxious to develop a strong market inside the country, but it is 
being forced to rely more and more on what is outside. Why? 
Because the provinces have become so adept at their political 
agendas they have forgotten the initial agenda.
<P>
	We do not act like a country. We act like jealous neighbours 
whose sole interest is to protect ourselves. By doing so we fail to 
see that we are divesting, not investing, in ourselves and 
creating limits to the markets we could access. Internal trade is 
about economic unity. Without it we do not progress, but are 
mired down on issues like sovereignty which only serve to 
divert our focus.
<P>
	While we struggle with these secondary battles the rest of the 
world moves on and takes advantage of the global marketplace. 
While we bicker about organization and administration, we fail 
to consider strategy. We do not present ourselves to the world as 
Team Canada, but 12 small and separate countries.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7516"> 7516 </A></B>
<P>
	The irony is that while we work so hard at being separate, we 
all bear the cost of those Canadians who are not given the 
opportunity to succeed. It is a sad commentary that we define 
ourselves as Canadians through our failures more than our 
successes.
<P>
	We have failed at internal trade. Canadians are not good at it 
and it is an attitude that reflects much too often on the way we 
trade internationally. For all that Canada's international trade 
represents 30 per cent of our GDP, only 100 companies or so 
really represent that volume of trade. Perhaps industry would 
trade better and would take advantage of international 
opportunities if the governments of the country provided them 
with a safe environment in which to practice their trading 
abilities.
<P>
	We must ask ourselves whether Canada can take advantage of 
the opportunity provided by this round of GATT. Can we provide 
a world market? Can we survive a world market and fully 
participate in it if we do not bind together and pull together as a 
whole? Can we find a way to work together so that issues of 
sovereignty do not jeopardize us in the eyes of the world 
monetary culture? Will we have the luxury of fighting our 
cultural battles if we do not establish a strong economic 
foundation first? Can we take full advantage of trade 
opportunities if we insist on being the sum of our parts and not 
the whole?
<P>
	Some have suggested that the new era of global trade is 
making the necessity for internal trade barriers obsolete. Soon 
industry, they say, will lobby Geneva not Ottawa. Soon, they say 
also, nation states will gradually delegate their sovereignty to 
world trade organizations; but 70 per cent of our GDP says 
otherwise. Four out of five jobs say otherwise. It may be the 
future but we will not survive there in the future if we do not 
survive and master the present.
<P>
	We require the federal government to pursue the breakdown 
of internal barriers with the same commitment it did in the 
GATT negotiations. It must do more to ensure Canadians work 
better together and enhance the opportunities of our internal 
trade market. If it does not, the government will be guilty of 
negligence both to the people and to the unity of this country. It 
is true that the divided are more vulnerable to failure but we 
have all the makings of a true economic union. It is time we saw 
the necessity to achieve it. We cannot drift on the premise that 
failure is far round the corner. It is not.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
	We need freer trade within the country. We need an agreement 
that will reflect all the valuable lessons that have been achieved 
in the GATT. We need to emphasize co-operation to create jobs 
and balance the budget. We need to bypass the political agendas 
for an industry driven agenda that will give all parts of the 
country equal access to opportunity. We need to respect that 
trade barriers are a question of economics and not issues of  
cultural protectionism. We need to lay more than a foundation, 
we have to break through the barriers and take advantage of a 
potentially profitable internal trade market. We need Canada to 
succeed at home as well as abroad.
<P>
	One hundred and forty-one partners in 21 countries found a 
way. Surely 13 partners in one country can do the same.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Maud Debien (Laval East, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on 
behalf of the Bloc Quebecois to discuss Bill C-57. This 
government bill, tabled by the Minister for International Trade, 
concerns the implementation of the agreement establishing the 
World Trade Organization.
<P>
	Consequently, this legislation primarily aims to bring 
Canadian laws into conformity with the agreement signed by 
117 GATT member countries, in Marrakesh, on April 15. The 
agreement marks the end of the Uruguay Round of negotiations, 
which started more than seven years ago. Bill C-57 confirms 
Canada's full participation in the World Trade Organization, 
which will replace GATT, as of next January.
<P>
	It comes as no surprise that the Bloc Quebecois supports the 
signing of this agreement, as well as the bill tabled by the 
government. As you all know, Quebec has always been very 
open to the world. For many years now, Quebec governments 
have maintained economic, scientific and cultural links with 
several countries. Quebec has been aware of the global village 
reality for a long time already. Therefore, it is normal that the 
Bloc Quebecois be in favour of free trade.
<P>
	In fact, you all remember that, during the 1988 federal 
election campaign, Quebecers were the strongest supporters of 
the Free Trade Agreement. More recently, we all remember as 
well that Quebecers greeted the coming into force of the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, NAFTA, with maturity and 
confidence and, of all Canadians, Quebecers are still the 
strongest supporters of free trade.
<P>
	On the other hand, just a few years ago, our Liberal 
colleagues, when they were in opposition, fought the fight of 
their lives against the free trade agreement. More recently, in the 
latest federal election, the red book said that the two free trade 
agreements were seriously flawed, referring to the Canada-U.S. 
Free Trade Agreement and NAFTA. It said that a Liberal 
government would renegotiate them. The Liberal program went 
so far as to mention cancelling the trade agreements if the 
proposed changes were not made.
<P>
	We are pleased to note that our colleagues have caught up with 
economic reality today and become fervent advocates of freer 
trade. But as they abandon their election promises, we warn the 
Liberal government that we in the Bloc Quebecois will insist 
that it keep its commitment to help businesses and workers 
affected by the trade treaties.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7517"> 7517 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	The red book is clear on this subject. I quote: ``Governments 
must assist individuals and firms to deal with the restructuring 
that is occurring as a result of trade liberalization. Such 
assistance is critical to building acceptance of structural 
reforms in the Canadian economy''.
<P>
	The federal government must urgently meet its responsibility 
for the integration or reintegration of workers and companies 
affected by the adjustments necessary for the transformation of 
our economy. International competition will affect some 
industrial sectors more than others. The federal government 
must fulfil its commitments so that Quebec and Canada can 
move toward innovation and excellence.
<P>
	We know that, on the whole, freer trade promotes economic 
growth and, in that sense, the agreement stands to make more 
winners than losers. It is estimated that increased exports and 
imports could translate, says the OECD, into potential gains of 
$270 billion US, with six or seven billion dollars going to 
Canada. Even then, the people of Quebec and Canada have to 
feel that the government is behind them, that it is implementing 
industrial reconversion measures to enable businesses to adjust 
to new realities and meet the challenges of the 21st century.
<P>
	And we will not be the only ones to benefit from this more 
buoyant economy. The poorest countries of the planet as well as 
developing countries could also take advantage of this. Too 
many trade barriers have proven to be discriminatory in the past 
with respect to products that these countries are in the best 
position to produce and to export.
<P>
	The North-South Institute recently pointed to a glaring 
contradiction between our foreign aid policies and trade 
barriers. For example, under the Multifibre Arrangement, 
Canada applies restrictions on textiles from Bangladesh. If 
Canada lifted these restrictions, the net gain to Bangladesh 
would amount to $370 million, or three times our 
government-to-government assistance.
<P>
	I could quote many more examples of protectionism targeting 
disproportionately products from the Third World. We have only 
to think about anti-dumping measures, export subsidies and 
customs tariff increases. Under the new agreement, 
governments may no longer resort to these measures, which had 
a major negative impact on poor countries.
<P>
	The measures adopted as part of the Uruguay Round should 
raise the net revenue of developing countries by about US$70 
billion a year, which is equivalent to a 3 per cent increase in their 
export earnings. This exceeds the aid they now receive from 
other countries. However, as the OECD and the World Bank 
recently reminded us, the poorest region of the planet, 
sub-Saharan Africa, may well lose out after these agreements 
are signed. Canada and the other signatory countries will have to 
redouble  their efforts to ensure that this region of the globe can 
also benefit from a richer world.
<P>
	It will also be necessary in the next few years to check on the 
distribution of the wealth created in developing countries. 
Except for our humanitarian efforts, Canadian aid too often 
ended up helping our local businesses, propping up dictatorial 
regimes, making the wealthiest people in those countries even 
richer, or financing the purchase of military or paramilitary 
weapons.
<P>
	The internationalization of trade, however irreversible it may 
seem, must not be restricted to northern countries. Trade 
practices towards developing countries must be redefined.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The new World Trade Organization will, we hope, deal with 
issues affecting not only the restructuring of rich economies but 
also the distribution of wealth as well as improved social and 
economic justice.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a western farmer it is a special privilege to have the 
opportunity to speak today to Bill C-57. This bill as has already 
been noted provides the legislation to follow through on 
Canada's commitment to participate in establishing the World 
Trade Organization. I am pleased to support this legislation.
<P>
	For farmers who have struggled through many years of 
depressed grain prices caused by the grain subsidy war between 
the European Economic Community and the United States, the 
completion of the Uruguay round of the GATT negotiations last 
spring after more than seven years of seemingly endless 
negotiations was as welcome as the first spring rain.
<P>
	While all of us recognize that this agreement is just another 
step toward the ongoing liberalization of international trade 
regulations and not the end of the process, we must not forget it 
is a very important step for Canada and the other signatory 
countries. As I have said Canadian grain producers in particular 
applaud this step because it at least brings the world a little 
closer to restoring some sanity to the international grain trade.
<P>
	The establishment of the World Trade Organization as the 
successor to GATT is especially encouraging. For the first time 
against the powerful lobbying efforts of the European farmers 
the GATT negotiations included agriculture. The dispute 
settling mechanism and appeals process is a long awaited ray of 
hope for Canadian farmers. So much for the good news. Does 
this bill go far enough to eliminate the trade distorting 
inefficiencies in our agricultural sector?
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7518"> 7518 </A></B>
<P>
	My oldest daughter turned 16 today. I wonder what the future 
holds for her and other potential farmers. If she chooses to stay 
in agriculture, without restructuring our programs will she and 
other Canadian farmers be able to survive in the next century?
<P>
	Although it is a good first step the Uruguay round just touches 
a fraction of the unfair subsidies our farmers face in the 
international marketplace. Bill C-57 amends 31 statutes toward 
the implementation of GATT. However it fails to achieve the 
spirit and the intent of GATT which is the elimination of trade 
distorting policies built over decades of government 
interference in the market.
<P>
	What has this government done with the bill? Instead of a 
complete overhaul of the agriculture programs to create a truly 
internationally competitive industry, this government is doing 
the absolute minimum to be in compliance with GATT. It looks 
at GATT green programs but does not touch them even if they 
create a further distortion in our domestic market. It looks at the 
Western Grain Transportation Act for example which is not 
GATT green and searches for an easy out to redesign WGTA just 
enough to make it less objectionable to the international 
marketplace.
<P>
	Canada has been blessed with some of the finest agricultural 
land in the world. Due to a combination of factors such as the 
short growing season and the long distance to potential markets 
our prairie grain farmers face unique conditions that influence 
their decisions on what to grow, how much to grow and where to 
send it.
<P>
	The Canadian Wheat Board was established in 1935 to 
provide some stability as well as equity of prices and export 
market shares to the grain producers spread across the prairies. 
Because of the size of its purchases this virtual monopoly has 
led to a system of dependency and distortion.
<P>
	Lately the Canadian Wheat Board appears to be moving far 
beyond its traditional mandate as a central marketing agency for 
Canadian farmers. Just as Canada Post competes with private 
courier services, we now find the Canadian Wheat Board 
operating in direct competition with grain trading companies.
<P>
	While the establishment of the CWB may have been 
necessary to ensure the survival of Canadian grain farmers when 
it was first set up, we live in a different world today. As GATT 
reduces agricultural subsidies in other countries we cannot 
afford inefficiencies in our marketing and transportation system 
if we want to be successful internationally.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	We have all read the news. Entrepreneurial farmers in border 
zones are prevented from trucking their grain a short distance 
south across the border. Instead they must sell their export 
grains to the CWB which will probably load it on a freight train 
and ship it thousands of miles to a Canadian port.
<P>
	About 90 per cent of the grain produced by Canadian farmers 
is exported. We must remain internationally competitive if we 
are to keep our market share. However, we are not playing on a 
level field. Domestically, grain transport subsidies have 
distorted the costs of production and delivery to our markets and 
internationally, producer subsidies abound.
<P>
	Over the last few years Canadian grain producers were caught 
in the middle of the subsidy war between the U.S. and the 
European Community. They have poured billions of dollars into 
their war in an effort to steal each other's market shares but they 
only succeeded in driving international grain prices down to 
levels not seen since the depression.
<P>
	Despite Canada pouring billions of dollars into aid for grain 
and oilseed producers, thousands of grain farmers still went 
bankrupt. In addition to the billions spent directly on 
stabilization and insurance programs for farmers, the 
government also spends over $700 million a year in grain freight 
subsidies to the railway companies through the Western Grain 
Transportation Act.
<P>
	Under the WGTA the federal government pays the railways an 
annual subsidy on a dollars per tonne basis to cover the 
transportation of eligible grain from prairie shipping points to 
Thunder Bay, Churchill, Vancouver and Prince Rupert. As a 
result of GATT's analysis of our transport subsidies, Thunder 
Bay is not subject to the GATT sanctions but the western ports 
and Churchill are.
<P>
	Already, valuable rail cars are tied up backhauling grain from 
Thunder Bay merely so the grain qualifies for the subsidy. Does 
this make sense? Yet this government's minister of agriculture 
has indicated it may take him until next summer to halt this 
ridiculous practice.
<P>
	Because only the WGTA payments for grain transport to the 
west coast and Churchill have been deemed export subsidies by 
the GATT community, this means we will have to substantially 
reduce export shipments of grains and oilseeds through these 
ports within the next few years. In addition to a volume 
reduction, a portion of the total tonnage would also be assessed 
at the full freight rate.
<P>
	This creates yet another distortion in our agriculture transport 
sector. There will be a major incentive for detouring grain 
shipments through Thunder Bay. This is despite the fact that 
grain markets have changed and the Pacific rim countries 
constitute a growing share of our grain market and it is the 
western ports that will be subject to the volume caps. Even 
though some of the grain going to Thunder Bay is also destined 
for export, the GATT has deemed those WGTA payments part of 
the domestic support program and not subject to GATT 
sanctions and countervailing measures by other countries.
<P>
	Considering two of the targeted ports are in British Columbia, 
I question the fairness of this section of the agreement. British 
Columbians overwhelmingly rejected the Charlottetown accord 
because of the special status awarded to some citizens and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7519"> 7519 </A></B>
<P>
provinces. This is merely  another example of special status 
being granted to central Canada.
<P>
	Signatories to the GATT have agreed that by the year 2000-01 
they will reduce their export subsidy levels by at least 36 per 
cent in dollar terms and by 21 per cent in volume terms below 
the 1986 to 1990 average levels.
<P>
	The 36 per cent target does not eliminate major subsidies to 
our competitors. Instead the export subsidy reductions are tied 
directly to average support levels during the height of the grain 
subsidy war between the U.S. and the EEC. At that time 
subsidies for some European grain exports reached levels at 
least twice the price of the product. Reducing these subsidies by 
36 per cent would still leave a subsidy in place worth more than 
the cost of the grain, hardly what I would call a level playing 
field for Canadian farmers.
<P>
	We cannot afford to tinker with our subsidy programs in the 
hopes that they might comply with future GATT agreements. We 
must act now to eliminate disincentives inherent in our system 
which prevent more efficient handling and transport of grains. 
We must act now to give farmers the information and tools 
necessary to make sound management decisions based on real 
market prices and transportation costs.
<P>
	Given a fair chance I believe Canadian farmers can compete 
successfully on the world market. However we must go much 
further than this bill does when it merely modifies our programs 
to meet with current international approval. As subsidies are 
brought down over time we must restructure all of our programs 
to prevent more internal distortions from creeping into the 
domestic decision making process.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today we all 
have to take a look at what is going on around us and realize the 
globalization that is occurring leads us to where we are in terms 
of the agreements we are talking about.
<P>
	I have heard today that farmers are asking for a level playing 
field. I have heard that there is new hope for the industry and for 
Canadians. I have heard that supply management is on its way 
out but we do have time for adjustment so that people can get 
used to it.
<P>
	I heard from one Bloc members that there is a great fear and a 
hatred for the U.S., that it is trying to destroy our culture, and 
that it is going to gobble us up. Separation, it seems to me, is a 
good way to get gobbled up, certainly with regard to whom they 
are going to be trading with. When they start having to trade 
with the Americans they had better believe it will be in English. 
The young people of Quebec will certainly be speaking English 
rather than French.
<P>
	It is incredibly ironic we are making good progress on 
eliminating trade barriers internationally but have an awful long 
way to go at home. Under the current system Canada's domestic 
market is seriously fragmented by provincial trade barriers. 
This not only affects our competitiveness internationally but 
reduces our collective prosperity at home. Provincial 
impediments to free trade in Canada add around $6.5 billion 
annually to the cost of doing business in the country. It is around 
$1,000 per family and is absolutely unacceptable.
<P>
	While the government is pressing hard for freer trade 
worldwide and is presenting the WTO enabling legislation in the 
House, it must also spearhead a movement to get rid of 
provincial trade barriers once and for all. If we could eliminate 
barriers to trade at home, the efficiency of Canadian businesses 
would be increased and their ability to trade internationally 
would be expanded. What better way is there to improve our 
position in the international marketplace? This is especially true 
for small and medium sized businesses which are suffering 
under the current system.
<P>
	Today we are globalizing. We have talked a lot about that. We 
are finding that the world is probably breaking up into three 
major units. We have Europe including the eastern part of 
Europe. We have the Americas both north and south, and we 
have the Asia-Pacific. We must get onside. We must realize that 
the world is much smaller and not stick our head in the sand and 
hope that it will not catch up to us.
<P>
	I was fortunate to travel across the country to listen to briefs 
presented by Canadians. Everywhere we go, including many 
international areas, we are told that we are not competitive 
because we are not aggressive enough, because we do not get out 
there and sell the country and the products we have.
<P>
	We have trade departments that are doing a good job. They are 
attempting to market Canada and our products throughout the 
world. Something like the WTO is a great boon to them because 
it gives them a common level playing field on which to market 
the country and its products.
<P>
	In my role in the foreign affairs area I have heard time and 
again about the importance of such rules based multilateral 
systems. While the WTO does not solve all the problems that 
exist over international trade, it does take a giant step in the 
right direction. Such a rules based multilateral trading system 
will protect countries like Canada from the unilateralist 
tendencies of the largest trading companies and increase our 
position in bargaining and negotiating with the United States. 
Hopefully in the years to come Canada will play a leadership 
role in the strengthening of the rules based multilateral system 
by promoting the WTO to effectively deal with the questions of 
trade remedies and anti-dumping actions.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7520"> 7520 </A></B>
<P>
	Over one in five Canadians depend on exports for their jobs. 
That is over two million jobs. In addition over 30 per cent of 
Canada's gross domestic product comes from exports. 
Therefore it is vital that Canada aggressively promotes itself 
throughout the world. If we become naval gazing isolationists 
and protectionists all Canadians will lose. It is also vital that the 
House support Bill C-57.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	The WTO offers Canadian farmers and businessmen a great 
opportunity to continue building our sales abroad. While we 
also have to open our markets to others, I do not see it as a threat. 
Canadian businesses can compete with anyone in the world. All 
we want is a fair and open international system with a level 
playing field. The WTO goes a long way toward accomplishing 
this.
<P>
	When this agreement comes into effect next year it will 
commit some 120 countries to gradually reducing trade barriers. 
This will have the long term effect of increasing world trade 
dramatically. As we know, any increase in world trade means 
more exports for Canadian businesses and more jobs for 
Canadian workers: over 11,000 for every $1 billion in new 
exports. This means greater prosperity for Canadian families 
and this is what government should be all about.
<P>
	We could talk about things like culture. When the Montreal 
Symphony and the Winnipeg Ballet go somewhere they are 
promoting the country. That is good for Canada and good for 
trade. We have to stop having an inferiority complex about 
ourselves. We are as good or better. We can compete and the 
WTO will help us do that.
<P>
	Tourism, about which I know a fair amount, is a major 
industry of the world. Canada can do so much. We can be a 
leader. Everyone agrees that we have the most beautiful country 
in the world. Yet we have only barely touched the surface 
possibilities. As we deal with the world and as we communicate 
with the world we are going to do much more in the area of 
promoting ourselves.
<P>
	The threat to Canada does not exist in the world. We must 
open our eyes and get out there and trade. The new forum does 
that for us. That is why I strongly support it. We must go further, 
however. We must liberalize our financial service institutions 
and our telecommunications; harmonize our professional, 
technical and licensing standards; and the list goes on. We must 
co-operate on environment because, as I said in the House 
yesterday, the environment is a world issue. It is not isolated to 
one country.
<P>
	To conclude, Canada must aggressively promote free trade 
throughout the world. This means eliminating provincial trade 
barriers at home and becoming a leader in the WTO. I express 
my support for Bill C-57 which will go a long way toward 
creating prosperity for our generation and that of our children. 
Therefore I ask all members of the House to join me in 
supporting the bill.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="YUKONSURFACERIGHTSBOARDACT">YUKON SURFACE RIGHTS BOARD ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 21 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-55, an act to establish a board having 
jurisdiction concerning disputes respecting surface rights in 
respect of land in the Yukon territory and to amend other acts in 
relation thereto, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the House on 
Bill C-55, the Yukon Surface Rights Board Act. I join with the 
government speakers who have spoken before me today, 
including the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, in urging support for the bill. It is time to 
conclude the debate by giving our unanimous support for Bill 
C-55.
<P>
<B>(1610) </B>
<P>
	As hon. members have noted, it is a complex and technical bill 
and there is a good reason for it. The objective of Bill C-55 is to 
put in place a comprehensive surface rights regime that will 
apply throughout Yukon. This is not something that can be 
achieved without a detailed setting out of rights, obligations and 
responsibilities. However the impact of Bill C-55 will be far 
more significant than the creation of a new institution of public 
government, as important as it is.
<P>
	Essentially the bill is saying that economic growth and job 
creation in Yukon will now become real priorities. Often when 
we come from urban ridings we tend to forget about Yukon and 
the Northwest Territories; we tend to be so focused on our own 
activities.
<P>
	During my experience as an opposition member it seemed as 
though I had a little more time to see parts of the country. I had 
the privilege in my first term as a member of Parliament of 
visiting parts of our north. As many members would know, it is 
an area of the country that most Canadians know very little 
about other than looking on a map. That is about the only time 
we focus on the north. During my first term in office our leader 
organized a caucus in Iqaluit in the eastern Arctic. Our colleague 
from western Arctic took some of us to James Bay. Later in our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7521"> 7521 </A></B>
<P>
term in opposition we went to the western Arctic where we 
visited the various local communities.
<P>
	Until one goes there one cannot imagine what is going on. 
Because they are out of sight they are out of mind in our agenda 
in the House. The issues and concerns are as important to them 
as our concerns in our communities, in our big cities or in our 
rural areas.
<P>
	The bill is about giving Yukon the ability or the instrument to 
start generating some of its own economic activity. Members 
know that everyone in the north supports the bill. It is not as if 
the bill will put in the hands of people in the north, whether they 
be governments or businesses, the ability to do whatever they 
want. As I read the bill there are a couple of very specific points 
I want to mention. They have to do with the environment and are 
found in clause 47 which talks about terms and conditions. I 
would like to read it into the record:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>On application made by a Yukon First Nation that does not reach an agreement 
with the minister in respect of terms and conditions for the exercise by any 
person, on the settlement land of the Yukon First Nation, of a right of access 
described in section 2 of schedule II that are additional to any application, terms 
and conditions-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There are conditions. Clause 48 reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Unless the Yukon First Nation and the minister agree otherwise, terms and 
conditions may not be established pursuant to an order made under section 47 
for a purpose other than</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) protecting the environment;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) protecting fish or wildlife or their habitat;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) reducing conflicts between the exercise of that right and the traditional or 
cultural uses of settlement land by the Yukon First Nation or a Yukon Indian 
person; or,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(d) protecting the use and peaceful enjoyment of land used for communities or 
residences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	This bill has very specific reference to ensuring that the 
environmental concerns in the north which we all care about are 
addressed. Any transactions taking place there have to fall 
within the concerns specified in the act.
<P>
	I hope all members will support this bill. As we focus on our 
own economic activity and our own cities, let us not forget there 
are many Canadians in the north who are hoping that with this 
bill we can give them the instrument to develop their own 
economic activity in a whole range of sectors, from mining to 
tourism. With this bill we will give them the stability to make 
those decisions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Broadview-Greenwood talked about 
many different issues.
<P>
	With regard to the surface rights board although it is designed 
to operate solely within the Yukon with two sets of 
representatives designated by the Yukon Indians as well as by 
the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, the 
whole concept of the board is that it will be paid for from federal 
funds. This is a particularly obnoxious part of the bill.
<P>
	If we want to give this board long term stability and 
something that is locally responsive, then I firmly believe we 
need to ensure those groups that are benefiting from the 
existence of the board are the ones who are paying for it. I would 
not mind having a response to that comment.
<P>
	Additionally, when we talk about northern communities, it is 
very important to recognize that Whitehorse is a very modern 
community. It contains 90 per cent of the population of the 
Yukon. There are 25,000 people, a modern airport, modern 
highways, modern housing. It has many more facilities than 
equivalent or smaller sized communities in my province of 
British Columbia. When I was in Whitehorse this summer I had 
a tremendous golf game. We cannot treat these communities and 
these areas as somehow being subject to a whole different set of 
rules than communities south of 60, certainly not in the case of 
the Yukon. That is my belief.
<P>
	There was also a statement that everybody in the Yukon 
supports this bill. As we know, this bill flows from Bill C-33 
and Bill C-34 that went through the House earlier this year. The 
member for Broadview-Greenwood knows very well how the 
Reform caucus felt about those bills. Bill C-55 is required as 
companion legislation in order to implement Bills C-33 and 34, 
even though they have already received royal assent.
<P>
	At the time of considering Bills C-33 and C-34 we were given 
that very same statement that everybody in the Yukon supported 
those two bills. As a matter of fact everybody in the Yukon did 
not support those bills but certainly the filtered message we 
received in Ottawa was that everybody in the Yukon supported 
those two bills.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Given that Bills C-33 and C-34 have already received royal 
assent and we are currently looking only at Bill C-55, the degree 
of support in the Yukon is to just get on with business. It is a 
much higher degree of support. I am the first one to admit that is 
the case, but I did not want to holus-bolus let that remark slip by 
without making a comment on it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
begin by addressing the remarks about the support for the bill. I 
did not mean to suggest that every single person was behind the 
bill holus-bolus but generally  speaking I think people are in 
favour of it. That is what I was trying to communicate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7522"> 7522 </A></B>
<P>
	As far as the board being funded by the federal government, 
the member mentioned he had some problems with that. I do not 
have any problem with that. I happen to be a member of 
Parliament who believes passionately in making sure that the 
Government of Canada presence is alive and well in every 
region of this country. In fact there are times when I think we 
devolve things too quickly around here. The fact that we are 
paying for this board would certainly give us some relationship 
with it which in the long run could be very important for all 
members of this House.
<P>
	What is more important are the fiscal concerns that all 
members of this House have. Quite frankly the Reform Party has 
done a very good job in focusing our attention on grinding every 
ounce of fat out of the system. What we have to look at in this 
bill is the fact that we are going to set up a framework for 
generating real economic activity. It will turn this community 
into a more vibrant economic unit with more jobs, more 
taxpayers and less cost on the social security system.
<P>
	We have to look at the total economic equation. The fact that 
we have to fund some administrative costs and board members 
to get the rest of the economic engine going in the north, in the 
long haul this bill will create a more fiscally responsible and 
productive environment for all of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to 
speak on Bill C-55 today. Before I start my remarks I must 
address a couple of points made by the hon. member from across 
the way.
<P>
	The business community in the Yukon and northern British 
Columbia of course is supportive of this bill, but it really has no 
choice. What this bill is doing is mitigating some very bad 
legislation that was passed through the House in the spring of 
this year. The mining industry felt this would be the only way it 
would have an opportunity to stay in the mining business in the 
Yukon after that legislation was passed. I had to bring that up 
right off the top and say that is the reason there is some support 
for this bill. It is not because the business community loves it, it 
just feels it has no choice.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	What is this bill? It is an act to establish a board having 
jurisdiction concerning disputes respecting surface rights in 
respect of land in the Yukon territory and to amend other acts in 
relation thereto. It sounds like something out of the Income Tax 
Act.
<P>
	What it really means is that there will be a board made up of a 
chairperson and not less than two or more than ten other 
members to be appointed by the minister of Indian affairs. Half 
of the members other than the chairperson will be selected from 
nominations by the Council of Yukon Indians and the other half 
and the chairperson will be appointed by the minister. The only  
qualification is that every member must be a resident of the 
Yukon.
<P>
	This bill relates to Bills C-33 and C-34. The passage of this 
legislation is needed as a last step to fully enact the Yukon 
self-government and land claims umbrella final agreements 
which were rammed through Parliament in June and given royal 
assent on July 7 of this year. Bill C-55 will establish a Yukon 
surface rights board which is deemed to be needed for the 
implementation of Bills C-33 and C-34 as an arbitration panel.
<P>
	I would like to talk for a minute about Bills C-33 and C-34 
and the land claim agreements that have been reached up in the 
north in general in the Northwest Territories and in the Yukon. In 
the last three or four years we have had four agreements: the 
Gwich'in; the Sahtu, Dene and Metis agreement which was 
passed this spring; Nunavut; and the latest is the Yukon land 
claim agreement.
<P>
	Those land claim agreements encompass 560,000 square 
kilometres of land in the Northwest Territories and in the Yukon. 
The four land claims will cost the taxpayers of Canada $1.5 
billion. The existing aboriginal programs that are in force today 
in Canada are guaranteed in perpetuity under the agreements 
that have been reached. There are 46,932 natives affected by 
these four agreements for a land mass of 560,000 square 
kilometres, a land mass roughly equivalent to the size of France, 
and a cost of $1.5 billion.
<P>
	Of course the Reform Party took exception and takes 
exception to these land claim settlements because we feel they 
are too generous. Also the ongoing obligations of the federal 
government with respect to aboriginal programs is in no way 
affected by these agreements. They go on in perpetuity. Further, 
new bureaucracies are created as a result of these agreements. 
This is what we were saying in June and now we are seeing the 
realization of that in this Yukon surface rights board.
<P>
	We recognize that land claim settlements have to be dealt with 
and we recognize there will be a land component as well as a 
cash component. I do not think any thinking Canadian doubts 
that. However, we do have a problem with the size of the land 
transfers and the amount of money involved. We think that for 
the population involved it is extraordinarily high and will affect 
Canadians in the future. Right now there is not a hue and cry 
because there are not very many non-aboriginals living the area. 
However, it is the future we are thinking of. It is the future 
opportunities in mining, forestry and other resource uses that we 
have concerns about when we are in opposition to these bills.
<P>
	Going on to the bill itself because half of the members other 
than the chairperson will be appointed from nominations by the 
Council of Yukon Indians and the other half will be appointed 
directly by the minister of Indian affairs, patronage 
appointments will be rampant.

<P>
	We all know what happens historically after every election 
when we get a change in government from the Liberals to the 
Conservatives. It will be the Reform the next time around. When 
we get a change in government, we see harbour boards and 
transportation boards, all kinds of boards that are stacked with 
political appointments automatically, mysteriously overnight 
all the faces change. We saw it after the last election in October 
of last year.
<P>
	A great deal of partisan political manoeuvring goes on with 
these appointments. As much as our friends on the other side of 
the House will hasten to say there will be no partisanship here, 
of course there will be. That is the way it works.
<P>
	We would like to see local business people submit a list of 
names to the minister. From that list of names the minister could 
make his appointments. At least that would remove some of the 
partisan opportunities or the partisan influence that this board 
might have in the future. It is very important for the mining 
industry and it is very important for people to believe that this 
board is going to be impartial.
<P>
	It is a requirement that three people sit in judgment of each 
individual case that is arbitrated by the board. One of these 
people must be from the Council of Yukon Indians. However it is 
not a requirement that one individual be from the business 
industry or from the mining industry.
<P>
	This board has the potential to be skewed and could give 
decisions that are not based on the proper representation that we 
think should be required.
<P>
	The board will mediate disputes as to who may cross land. 
What will happen on undeveloped settlement land is something 
that is also a concern of ours. What will happen to 
non-settlement lands? The board has a fair bit of influence over 
lands which are not directly included in the land claims 
agreement. This is something that we are concerned about and I 
am sure the mining industry is as well.
<P>
	This board parallels the work of other boards that are already 
in place. We say therefore that it is duplication. Each board 
member is allowed to use contract workers such as advisers who 
are also paid on a per diem basis. Board members are paid on a 
per diem basis. A multiple array of experts at DIAND are sitting 
around fully capable of acting as contract workers, already 
being paid by the taxpayers.
<P>
	Why not select from these people who are already employed 
rather than hiring contract workers at an additional expense to 
the taxpayers?
<P>
	Furthermore, because the work of the board is going to be on a 
per diem basis, there is a possibility that the board's 
deliberations will drag out far longer than they need to, 
especially when the board members are being paid between 
$200 and $300 a day.
<P>
	We would like to see some kind of a mechanism to make the 
board accountable for the length of time that it engages in 
deliberations and to make sure that its actions are kept at an 
absolute minimum.
<P>
	The potential for conflict of interest is also there because 
claims are not assumed to be reviewed by the entire board but by 
a panel of three. At least one must be a member appointed to the 
board from the Council of Yukon Indians and two others are to 
be chosen by the chairperson. Could this not end with a blatant 
bias or conflict if all were from the Council of Yukon Indians? 
There are no rules to the contrary.
<P>
	If the government is so concerned about allowing aboriginal 
peoples to have a say in surface and subsurface rights or 
subsurface uses of the land-I believe there is room for that-I 
have to question the government's concern over the ability of 
aboriginals in the Yukon to have a say in land use decisions. This 
concern apparently does not apply to the Champagne and 
Aishihik peoples whose traditional territories include the 
Tatshenshini-Alsek area of northwest British Columbia.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	The Champagne-Aishihik people live primarily in the Yukon, 
but their traditional territories are the Tatshenshini-Alsek area 
and what is now the Kluane park. Economic opportunities were 
lost to these peoples when the Kluane national park, also a part 
of their traditional territories, was created in 1943.
<P>
	They are now facing the prospect of seeing the 
Tatshenshini-Alsek designated a world heritage site by the 
United Nations. This proposal has been submitted to the United 
Nations, and is supported by the B.C. and federal governments. 
Our information is that the vote will be on December 14 of this 
year. If it is adopted by the United Nations it is going to take 
away Canada's sovereignty and ability to make decisions or 
reverse decisions on this land for all time.
<P>
	I recently came into the possession of a letter written by Chief 
Paul Birckel who represents the Champagne-Aishihik First 
Nations. He writes to the premier of British Columbia 
expressing his concern, disappointment and frustration over the 
fact that the province of British Columbia has designated this 
area as a class A provincial park, without any consultation 
whatsoever with the Champagne-Aishihik people.
<P>
	Now the federal government has come on board by agreeing to 
support the province of British Columbia having the area 
designated as a world heritage site. I would like to read a small 
bit from the letter that Chief Birckel has written to Premier 
Harcourt:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7524"> 7524 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, I am requesting that you withdraw the support of your government to 
the establishment of a world heritage site nomination for the Tatshenshini-Alsek 
wilderness park area in British Columbia. Until some mutually satisfactory 
resolution of Champagne and Aishihik First Nations aboriginal rights, titles and 
interests in the area are dealt with. This area was initially established as a class A 
provincial park in June 1993. This was done without any consultation with our First 
Nations. This is a breach of the fiduciary responsibility that is owed by your 
government and by Canada to our First Nations. Therefore I am appealing to you to 
withdraw your support for the world heritage site nomination in our traditional area 
in northern British Columbia.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe these people should have as much opportunity to be 
involved in land use decisions in northern British Columbia as 
the Council of Yukon Indians is in the Yukon territory. This does 
not seem to be the case. I urge members on the other side of the 
House to talk to their heritage minister and the Prime Minister, 
and get them to agree to withdraw the nomination for the 
Tatshenshini as a world heritage site at this time. There is no 
support for it.
<P>
	In conclusion, this bill is vague in its rules and regulations 
concerning its principal responsibilities. It mentions minimum 
requirements for Council for Yukon Indians involvement, but 
none regarding its maximum. The notion of sufficient 
negotiation as a pre-requisite for mediation is misleading and 
has a great potential for favouritism and unfair treatment of 
some cases and not for others.
<P>
	The idea of a per diem rate of pay for board members and their 
contracted staff, while mediating a case, may mask the reality of 
the formation of another level of bureaucracy for some, but it is 
the same old game from where I stand.
<P>
	Nothing is stopping members from dragging out mediations 
for the benefit of more pay. As well, I am appalled that the 
government, which preaches democracy, is willing to let the 
minister of Indian affairs appoint half of the board members 
from a list of nominees submitted by the Council of Yukon 
Indians, but not let a similar list of nominees be submitted by the 
business industry. After all, is this board not meant to fairly 
mediate the claims of both aboriginals and non-aboriginals? 
Why then should the business community not be included on the 
same basis? Why was the business community not consulted on 
this bill and allowed to state their feelings on it before it is 
implemented? As I said earlier, they are forced to agree. They 
have no choice.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The government seems to be finally waking up to the reality 
that the national debt must be dealt with. We hear more and more 
talk about it all the time, particularly from the finance minister, 
but not from everybody else I might add. Since the board adds 
another level of bureaucracy to the already top heavy 
government, why  then should not the now duplicated positions 
be abolished?
<P>
	This is what the Reform Party has been asking of the 
government since day one, since we first came here last October. 
Stop duplication. We cannot afford it. Be responsible with the 
taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Since the Yukon aboriginals want-and with closure invoked 
on Bills C-33 and C-34-and have now attained a certain level 
of self-government, why then do they not assist with the 
payment for this board which will be mostly made up of and 
hence representative of their interests? This would be too 
logical for the government to understand.
<P>
	I would like to end by urging members who believe in 
fairness, honesty and accountability to oppose this bill as it 
portrays the epitome of patronage and racial bias for which 
Canadians should never be known.
<P>
	I would like to remind the House that such land claims, 
self-government and racially segregated mediation boards will 
set a precedent for future negotiations with aboriginals which 
Canadian taxpayers will be hard pressed to pay for.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak on this very important legislation, Bill C-55, 
the Yukon Surface Rights Board Act.
<P>
	I would like to clarify, since there might be some 
misunderstanding, particularly with regard to the previous 
speaker's comments, that this is companion legislation to Bill 
C-33, the Yukon First Nations Final Land Claims Settlement 
Act and Bill C-34, the Yukon First Nations Self-Government 
Agreement Act. Both of these bills were passed in Parliament in 
the spring session but will not come into force until Bill C-55 is 
passed in the House of Commons.
<P>
	As someone who has represented Yukon for seven years and 
who previously has been very involved in land claims settlement 
in the Yukon, I urge all members to speedily pass Bill C-55 to 
ensure that all Yukoners, aboriginal and non-aboriginal, have 
the tools to move forward with the certainty that is necessary for 
business, the respect and dignity accorded to First Nations in the 
Yukon and that will lead toward self-sufficiency of the Yukon 
territory.
<P>
	This is a technical bill establishing a Yukon surface rights 
board which will resolve dispute between parties, guaranteeing 
access to holdings of private lands. That is an important and key 
factor here. This board only comes into effect if there are 
disputes that cannot be reconciled other than through this 
process. However, there must be a process in place prior to that 
which will attempt to settle disputes.
<P>
	This legislation will settle disputes between persons holding 
surface rights and those holding subsurface rights. It is 
obviously very important in an area where mining is an 
extremely important part of the economy.  The board will also 
deal with the amount of compensation for the expropriation of 
settlement lands and the amount of compensation for pockets of 
government lands retained within settlement lands.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7525"> 7525 </A></B>
<P>
	A number of comments were made previously about the 
composition of the board. If I recall, the previous speaker said: 
``it is a racially segregated board''.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	The previous speaker from the Reform Party is quite wrong. 
This is a board which attempts to reconcile and to bring together, 
not to divide as I believe the previous speaker would do, peoples 
in the territory.
<P>
	The composition of this board as of many other boards under 
the land claims legislation passed last spring in this Parliament 
will include representation by First Nation's people.
<P>
	Both in consultation on the land claims and self-government 
legislation and on this legislation, many groups have been 
consulted and approved of this legislation: the Yukon Chamber 
of Mines, the Klondike Placer Miners Association, the Mining 
Association of Canada, the Canadian Association of Petroleum 
Producers, Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada, 
the Yukon Territorial Government, all political parties within 
the Yukon Territory, the Council for Yukon Indians and the 
Gwich'in Tribal Council.
<P>
	There have been a number of consultations with a wide 
variety of business interests, private interests and with the 
aboriginal people of Yukon.
<P>
	As with the self-government and land claims legislation, this 
piece of legislation, Bill C-55, is supported by a number of 
groups in Yukon that want to see us move forward, that want to 
see Yukon have the respect and dignity that we should be 
accorded and to do something very significant not just for Yukon 
but for Canada.
<P>
	What we are showing can be done within Canada is that we 
can respect the languages, the cultures and the historic traditions 
of all peoples within a certain territory, and we can do it under 
the flag of Canada.
<P>
	In this time when there is discussion about the future and 
integrity of this country surely it should be a source of pride to 
all members of this House to have participated in this historic 
piece of legislation, of which this forms the third piece, to 
resolve these differences, to accommodate, to respect-let me 
underline respect-all of these factors and do it within a united 
Canada. This is historic.
<P>
	I must address an issue raised by the previous speaker I 
believe from Skeena who made the point and came to the 
defence of Chief Paul Birckel from the Champagne Aishihik 
Band. The Champagne Aishihik Band is one of the bands noted 
in the land claims and self-government legislation. I must 
assure the member for Skeena that I am aware of a number of 
meetings that have taken place between the Champagne 
Aishihik and the Government  of British Columbia. He can rest 
assured that the Government of British Columbia is taking very 
seriously the issues raised by the band of the Champagne 
Aishihik.
<P>
	Where was the member for Skeena when his colleague in the 
Reform Party stood in this House last spring and called the 
people of the Champagne Aishihik Band lazy children and 
called the people of Yukon and aboriginal people peoples who 
were living in the south sea islands and conditions similar to 
that? Where was the member from the Reform Party in 
defending Chief Paul Birckel and the people of that band at that 
time?
<P>
	It really is ironic that the member stands in this House today 
supposedly defending the people of the Champagne Aishihik 
Band yet last spring stood in this House voting against this very 
legislation that would enable the people of the Champagne 
Aishihik Band and other First Nation bands in Yukon to become 
more self-sufficient and to recognize their historic and 
traditional rights.
<P>
	This kind of double talk certainly does not foster the future of 
our country. We are talking here about how we as a country from 
diverse regions with diverse languages, cultures and traditions 
live together. The United Nations has said in the past that we are 
one of the best countries in the world in which to live. Some in 
this House would dispute that. Most would not.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	This particular piece of legislation completing the land claims 
and self-government legislation for Yukon respects and fosters 
the future of Canada, a united Canada and one that respects all 
peoples.
<P>
	Pursuant to this legislation there have been some concerns 
raised, I mentioned earlier the one by the member for Skeena, in 
implicating that this piece of legislation contains an area of bias. 
That illustrates the profound difference between the philosophy 
of the New Democratic Party and the philosophy of the Reform 
Party. We feel as New Democrats that it is our job as elected 
representatives in this House, representing Canada as well as 
our own ridings, to bring people together in a positive way rather 
than find ways to divide people.
<P>
	If our country is to move forward in the 21st century the 
responsibility we as legislators hold in this crucial time leading 
up to that period we must find ways for provinces, territories, 
different groups in this country to come together. It is shocking 
to me that there are people in this House who would undermine 
that objective.
<P>
	I believe that the consensus that has been developed in Yukon 
around this piece of legislation and the companion pieces, Bills 
C-33 and C-34, illustrates that it is possible to achieve great 
things in this country. It does not come easily. This has been 21 
years in negotiation. There have been many changes. There have 
been many people from all parts of the community who have 
been involved, some sadly who are even no longer with us.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7526"> 7526 </A></B>

	With the passing of this legislation and the support of this 
House we will see a real step forward for Yukon and I believe for 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would ask the hon. member representing Yukon, and I 
know that her discourse was passionate and heartfelt, is it better 
in her estimation to pretend problems do not exist, to consider 
everything that is done in this House on behalf of the Indians of 
Canada since the beginning of our recorded history, if the 
perpetuation of that and the situation that the aboriginals in our 
country live in today is representative of the kind of compassion 
that this House has afforded them, if this is worthy of 
continuing, or perhaps some of the foundations and some of the 
ideas that this House taken as a self-righteous mantra should be 
questioned.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, if I understand the member's 
question correctly I think it is an appropriate question. It is true 
that this Parliament historically has not respected the First 
Nations people of this country, historically has implemented 
legislation which resulted for example in Indians not having the 
vote until the 1960s. It has passed legislation in the past that has 
made a distinction between who and who is not an Indian 
through defining status Indians.
<P>
	Historic wrongs can be righted. What is being acknowledged 
in this legislation is the right of First Nations people who were 
not defeated in a war, who were not a conquered people, to the 
lands which they occupied before both the hon. member's and 
my ancestors came here.
<P>
	The honour in this form of legislation and the honour that 
comes to this Parliament with this legislation is that we can 
acknowledge that those were historically wrong decisions made 
in the cultural context of the time and that it is possible to 
address those in a way that benefits First Nations people, 
acknowledges their rights and responsibilities, but also, as do 
this legislation and the companion pieces, Bills C-33 and C-34, 
serve to enhance the rights and responsibilities of all Yukoners.
<P>
<B>(1655 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
make a couple of comments and then I ask a question of the hon. 
member for Yukon.
<P>
	I would like to say that because the Reform Party and I in 
particular was against the legislation that was in front of the 
House, it does not mean that we are against resolving land 
claims. We are against the kind of land claims that have been 
brought in front of this House today for the reasons that I 
outlined: the generosity of the agreements, the fact that it 
created more bureaucracy and the fact that entitlement to 
existing programs was guaranteed in perpetuity under those 
agreements.
<P>
	If the hon. member is as concerned as she appears to be for the 
welfare of native people, maybe she will join with me and go and 
talk to her friends in Victoria who have designated the 
Tatshenshini-Alsek area a world class park, a class A provincial 
park. Then maybe she will join with me in trying to convince our 
friends across the way that we will withdraw the nomination to 
declare that area a world class heritage site.
<P>
	I ask the hon. member will she join with me in those efforts?
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly I again think it 
ironic that the member for Skeena has suddenly discovered the 
interests of the First Nations people of Yukon. I can assure the 
member that as the representative for Yukon, representing all of 
the people of Yukon, Chief Paul Birckel has been very effective 
in making his views known to the British Columbia government. 
The British Columbia government has responded.
<P>
	While I am the representative of the Champagne Aishihik 
band in this House, I have always been extremely impressed and 
respectful of the ability of Chief Paul Birckel and the 
Champagne Aishihik band to very effectively represent 
themselves. Again I underline this is one of the four bands in the 
legislation that came before this House in the spring. I think it 
would have made the argument of the hon. member for Skeena 
much stronger had he supported the Champagne Aishihik band 
at that time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, last week in this House the minister of Indian affairs 
indicated that the Reform caucus had never supported an 
aboriginal bill in this House. Last week we had already 
supported Bill C-36, the Split Lake Cree agreement in northern 
Manitoba. That went through third reading and we supported it 
at third reading last Friday.
<P>
	The member for Yukon stereotyped our caucus in her speech 
and the member for Yukon would be the first one to complain if 
anyone else were to do any stereotyping. I would like the 
member for Yukon to answer to that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the people who were 
stereotyped here were the First Nations by the member who 
called them lazy children and their treatment being like a south 
sea island. I am greatly disappointed in the leader of the Reform 
Party who then promoted that member to the front benches.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a privilege and an honour, maybe with a bit of 
hesitation, to speak to this bill today.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	As I was listening to the hon. member from Yukon, I threw a 
few pages from my speech away. I thought I probably did not 
have the insight into native land settlements or land agreements, 
but I do have some insight into what division means and I do 
have some insight into what co-operation means.
<P>
	As a farmer I must say I have never seen any farm operations 
succeed when they started dividing and becoming independent. 
When a father owned all the property and all the machinery and 
had control of the situation, the family usually worked together 
very well. There was very little infighting. However when some 
of the members felt that their wisdom was probably greater than 
that of the founder who had built the corporation or the company 
and they wanted to divide and become separate little nations, it 
seemed to run into problems.
<P>
	Sooner or later the governor was neglected. They were setting 
up boards which consisted of neighbours trying to settle 
disputes in the farming operation. Generally there was conflict. 
There was hurt. Usually it wound up that family members did 
not even want to see each other or recognize each other as being 
in the same family.
<P>
	It really worries me when we start addressing our problems by 
creating separate little nations. We have talked so much about 
the Quebec issue. I have explained very often in this House that 
unity cannot be created by division. That seems to be so 
contradictory. That is one thing we are missing with these bills.
<P>
	I was very much opposed to Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 for one 
very simple reason. I did have those bills analyzed by some of 
my native friends. I asked them to give me direction on how I 
should vote on those two bills. The feedback I got was: ``If you 
vote for Bill C-33 and Bill C-34, I will lose my hunting rights. I 
will lose my fishing rights that I had in this great country of 
ours. From now on I will have to go and ask each individual 
nation to have those privileges''. That really hit home to me. 
How is that type of feeling going to solve the problems of what 
happened probably a century or so ago?
<P>
	The other problem I had with these bills was the way they 
were debated and the way they were rammed through this 
House. When true democracy is neglected it generally is the 
beginning of human rights violations and the beginning of 
unrest and civil disobedience which in a lot of cases ends in 
revolt or revolution. That is happening now in eastern bloc 
countries.
<P>
	After being in the Soviet Union in 1990-91 and looking at the 
conditions some of the native people enjoy today, I wonder what 
we are grumbling about in this country. No matter where we live 
in this great country of ours today, we have nothing to complain 
about. We have not got people starving. We have not got people 
freezing to death for lack of clothing. We have not got people 
killing each other just so they can get to the food supply.
<P>
	We have a federal government today that has a great desire to 
treat everybody equally. The government in previous years has 
not only passed laws that are supposed to work against 
discrimination, it has passed laws that are going to be 
guaranteed under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. When I 
see that now we are creating separate nations and these laws that 
work so well are not going to be applicable, what are we getting 
into?
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	When I look at this bill that is setting up a board with 50 per 
cent of the people appointed by the Yukon natives council and 50 
per cent by the federal government, I wonder why. I own 
property and there are all kinds of acts that protect my rights 
should the mining companies or oil drilling companies want 
access to that land. If I am not happy with the decision these acts 
force upon me I have the full right to go to the Supreme Court of 
Canada but I am also liable for the costs that are incurred 
through that. That is one deterrent I think is very effective in 
avoiding a lot of disputes we would probably otherwise have.
<P>
	It seems to me that this board will have the power to make 
some decisions. If the First Nations do not feel the decision is 
right, they can appeal to the Yukon courts. If the First Nations 
feel that ruling has gone against them, what happens then? Do 
they go to the Supreme Court of Canada? Are the laws enforced 
by the native law enforcement agency or the Canadian law 
enforcement agency? This is something that really bothers me 
because I am sure there will be disputes where the resolution 
will not be acceptable to either side and law enforcement will 
have to be used.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member for Churchill the other day when 
he said: ``My people have made a commitment that we want to 
live in peace and enjoyment of the land and the resources with 
generations in the future''. How does that pertain to these land 
settlement claims or independent nations? ``We want to live 
with each other, we want to co-operate but we want to 
separate''. To me that is a recipe for disaster.
<P>
	When I try to analyze these bills in light of my own 
experiences with other situations, I must say we are binding our 
future generations to dispute after dispute after dispute. It does 
not seem possible that these boards under the conditions in 
which they are set up will ever be able to be disbanded. We will 
continually have problems in developing these huge tracts of 
land.
<P>

<P>
	We in the Reform Party are so often classified or stereotyped 
as not being beneficial to other people. Personally I would rather 
donate half of my resources to the next generation than to find 
out in later years that my children or their children are fighting 
and forcing a settlement on each other.
<P>
	We see that happening today in the former Yugoslavia. All of 
a sudden they have decided they can live better as separate little 
nations. It takes foreign countries to come in and try to solve the 
disputes.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	I would never be able to rest in my grave if I were party to 
some agreements that in the future should have to be resolved by 
military force or by some other type of unlawful activity as I 
would call it.
<P>
	I think back to the 1940s. I can remember the situation right 
after the 1930s and how the white people in our community and 
the native people shared their assets and their food because 
everybody was in a tough situation. If we could get back that 
type of concern I do not think we would be talking about these 
huge land settlement deals.
<P>
	It worries me when I see $8 billion to $10 billion being paid to 
our native brothers every year and we are not being given one 
little bit of recognition for that.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> We have sisters.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Well sisters, brothers, whoever it is. I would 
think that the government has never been able to print money. 
The government's money comes from the taxpayers and it only 
comes from taxpayers who are working and sharing it with other 
people. If that $8 billion to $10 billion is not sharing I would like 
to know how much it would take before it was called sharing.
<P>
	Right now with the attitude of the sharing that our government 
has had, we are in debt to the tune of $550 billion which some 
day either the native children or my children will have to repay. 
How this is going to be accomplished I do not know, but I wish 
the hon. member for Yukon could give me some suggestions. I 
would surely support her in any way that we could resolve that 
issue so that it could be settled in some better way.
<P>
	Eventually when financial disaster does come upon a nation it 
creates a lot of other problems. That is one thing we have to 
realize with all these settlements. If we are going to be fair to 
future generations we had better be fair to the generations here 
today. We will be forcing them to pay something we were not 
willing to pay.
<P>
	With that I will close my remarks. I wish this House would 
make some decision that would not just benefit us today but that 
would also benefit future generations.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Audrey McLaughlin (Yukon, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member talked about ``laws that worked so well over the 
years''. I wonder if the member was talking about the laws that 
established residential schools, or the laws that resulted in 
aboriginal children being taken away from their parents. Would 
it be the laws that prevented aboriginal people from voting? 
Would it be those laws that took away the right of aboriginal 
people who fought for their country or became a doctor or a 
lawyer to be identified as a status Indian?
<P>
	The member is so much against this bill and its dispute 
settlement capabilities. As a member of the Reform Party that 
supported, ill advised I would suggest, the U.S.-Canada trade 
deal and NAFTA, does he think we should do away with the 
dispute settlement mechanism in that trade deal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am quite convinced there were 
laws and institutions that abused our native brothers and sisters. 
It makes me very sad that I lived to pay testimony to that.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	I think through some of the law reform that we have had we 
are at a stage now where that should not happen, not nearly as 
easily.
<P>
	I would also like to remind the hon. member for Yukon that 
the white people were not always here. I read in history where 
there was self-government by these native people. They did also 
have problems. They had a right at that time to live very 
peacefully. They had a right to live without starvation. When we 
read the history books it did happen.
<P>
	I am not blaming them for that but we have to realize that 
through history there have been problems. As we have learned 
from these problems I think we have become wiser. That is what 
we have experienced through the thirties and the forties 
probably where a lot of abuse was happening to these First 
Nations and it makes me very sad that it did.
<P>
	I also note that if we are going to pass laws and make 
commitments which we have to honour with future generations' 
wealth we are asking for severe problems and a lot worse 
conditions in this country than we have today.
<P>
	<B>Ms. McLaughlin:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member is against this 
bill which has a dispute settlement mechanism. Would he also 
say that because the trade deal between Canada and the U.S. has 
a dispute settlement mechanism it should be done away with as 
well?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hoeppner:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would say if we had one 
government and the same laws we would not need that trade 
dispute settlement mechanism. Here we are creating more 
governments, more laws and we are forcing more dispute 
settling mechanisms on our society.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7529"> 7529 </A></B>
<P>
	If we were one nation with the United States we would not 
even have trade laws. This is a very good example. If we were a 
North American community we would probably have some of 
these problems resolved before they ever happened. Because we 
are different nations we fight for each right. It is only natural.
<P>
	That is why I tried to explain that when a father allows his son 
to go into different operations usually it brings problems with it. 
That is what I have been trying to point out. Division does not 
create unity and unity does not create division.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the debate on this bill. Considering that 
we supported Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 on self-government and 
land claims in the Yukon, it will come as no surprise that we will 
also support Bill C-55.
<P>
	I want to use a different approach regarding this issue. I have 
my own way of dealing with native issues. I do not claim to have 
a new approach, but I do think it is important to go and meet 
those who have been the victims of injustices for a long time.
<P>
	Consequently, I have been to the Yukon and I would like to tell 
you about the attitude and the atmosphere which prevail there 
following, among other changes, the passing of the two 
aforementioned bills in the previous session, as well as the 
anticipated passing of Bill C-55.
<P>
	It was my first visit in the Yukon, and I was accompanied by 
my 13-year-old daughter, who was discovering the western and 
north-western regions of the country. We were both amazed at 
the beauty of this place and astonished to see how people had 
settled here well before we came and shared such a lovely 
country. The Yukon River, for instance, is extraordinarily 
beautiful. When I went there, during the summer, the glaciers 
were melting, and this produced a kind of blue I have never seen 
in our rivers here in Quebec. It was fascinating to see the beauty 
of the countryside and also the wonderful atmosphere of the way 
of life in the Yukon.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	I had read about the gold rush in the Klondike, and about what 
today is called Dawson City, and I had a chance to go there and 
see how mining operations destroyed some of this lovely 
countryside when they ruthlessly extracted the riches that were 
there, riches that did not necessarily benefit the First Nations.
<P>
	I also discovered what was for instance the midnight sun, 
something we do not have here, but they do over there. The 
native people took me to the top of a mountain, The Dome, and 
at 11.30 p.m., I saw the sunset. I was both impressed by the sight 
and touched by the people's gesture.
<P>
	Another surprise was the warm welcome I received. We saw 
this tremendous capacity of Canadian native people and 
aboriginal people throughout the world to share what they have. 
These people do not feel they have  been conquered. They see 
themselves as the first occupants and consider that the arrival of 
the Europeans was an opportunity for them to share their 
territory and their wealth.
<P>
	Unfortunately, as a result of the greed of the Europeans, 
because that is what it was, what we did at the time was to 
establish a kind of social contract with these people: We will 
take care of you, we will take 95 per cent of your wealth and 
confine you to reserves and we will pay for whatever you need. 
This caused a lot of problems, and I will get back to this later on, 
but in any case, we can say that this was a case of blatant 
injustice which we are now trying to remedy here in the Yukon, 
to some small extent.
<P>
	We started with the two bills I mentioned earlier, and now Bill 
C-55, which will make the two other bills operational, so that 
we are now waiting to pass Bill C-55. As I said before, C-55 
makes the two other bills operational and also brings a measure 
of justice to these people.
<P>
	In fact, people have recognized for decades, for centuries 
even, that there was an injustice. The native peoples realized 
that there was an injustice, and 21 years ago they began a 
process of negotiation leading to the adoption of two bills prior 
to this session and to the consideration of the bill before us, Bill 
C-55, which as I have said will make the two earlier bills 
operational.
<P>
	I think it worth reflecting for a few moments on the first two 
bills. What exactly is self-government? Many are seeking a 
definition, but is an exact definition important, when it can 
mean different things to different people? I turned to the 
dictionary and found that self-government has to do with the 
importance of being politically independent to direct one's own 
destiny.
<P>
	We have several examples, at the present time, of the 
non-performance of the Indian Act. Lengthy speeches are not 
necessary. In terms of socio-economic development, native 
peoples are probably the most disadvantaged group of people in 
Canada. And this morning I was present when the health 
committee noted the seriousness of the health and social 
problems they face.
<P>
	The simple fact is that the social contract that existed at the 
time to take responsibility for native peoples and their wealth is 
no longer tenable and never was, and we are correcting the 
situation. Do aboriginal peoples want to take part in this 
process? I believe they do. If we are speaking about Yukon, there 
is a desire to take responsibility for their own lives, and I would 
say this is the case in most of Canada. Native peoples are 
themselves realizing that the government can no longer 
effectively pay for them and provide paternalistic protection, 
while at the same time respecting their particular conditions and 
values.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7530"> 7530 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that in the Yukon, as elsewhere, native peoples are 
realizing that the solution to their problems is through 
self-government.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	The will of the natives to assume responsibility for 
themselves is there. The feeling I get from the government of 
Canada is one of wanting to withdraw from the Indian Act. I 
think the minister did make announcement to that effect also. Of 
course, this is not going to happen overnight. Pilot projects are 
under way, in Manitoba for example, to examine the possibility 
for First Nations to withdraw from the Indian Act.
<P>
	But resolving the self-government issue would go a long way 
toward solving the problem of withdrawing from the Indian Act, 
so that the government can go ahead with the dismantling as 
soon as possible. On this subject, the minister and the 
government have referred to their intention to put an end to their 
trusteeship over Indians. The Bloc Quebecois will keep a close 
eye on this. The government has ventured to say that it should be 
abolished. Now, we in the Official Opposition will make sure 
that this is done properly.
<P>
	It has to be done with respect for the cultures involved. On our 
side, we are from a European background originally. The 
aboriginal peoples were the first inhabitants of this land. How 
do we reconcile all of this? Our self-government negotiation 
process actually leads to this. It leads us to say: ``What can be 
devolved in terms of autonomy, level of activity, legislation?'' 
Such choices should allow them to live in harmony with us and 
be in keeping with our legislation.
<P>
	I think that the kind of agreement we have before us indeed 
provides a middle ground that enables the First Nations to steer 
away from the Indian Act, to assume responsibility for 
themselves and to live in perfect harmony with our laws. They 
also attach a great deal of importance to gaining control over 
their own administration because their health system, for 
example, is not the same as ours. They have a much more 
holistic approach to health. They are more prone to using 
healing circles, a much more gregarious approach than the 
curative approach we currently have in Canadian society.
<P>
	The same with justice. We note that, in extremely remote 
communities, they often have their own law enforcement 
system. Healing circles take charge of young offenders or 
individuals with adjustment difficulties. They solve the 
problems they encounter themselves. We are not even aware that 
when we barge in with our way of looking at the situation it often 
is inappropriate and just makes the problem worse.
<P>
	All this to say that, to deal with self-government, we have this 
bill and it is important to have such a bill. It will also be 
important to implement it.
<P>
	How do we go about it? The hon. member who spoke before 
me said, ``We give them $8 billion a year''. It is not quite $8 
billion; I think it is around $6 billion. But if we want this to end, 
we must help them take control of their own destiny.
<P>
	We need a territory that is large enough and contains enough 
resources so that we can stop spending millions of dollars on 
education, health care, etc., and let them take control of their 
own destiny. That is why we will allow them to tax or collect 
royalties from all their lands. Giving them land in the Yukon is a 
solution which, I think, will allow them to develop their own 
territory to compensate for the shortfall due to the withdrawal of 
our financial assistance.
<P>
	Compensation in the order of $242 million will enable these 
people to make their decisions now. These people will no longer 
have to deal with federal officials trying to impose their 
programs. They will create their own programs, which I think is 
something worth mentioning.
<P>
	We must, of course, have confidence in these people. I have 
confidence in them because I have seen them in action. I have 
seen how serious they are about taking control of their own 
destiny. I think that we must simply recognize that the First 
Nations will be in a much better position than federal officials in 
Ottawa to implement programs and that we must trust them.
<P>
	Quebec is in a good position to help in this regard. The James 
Bay Agreement and the motion passed by the National 
Assembly show that Quebec can be proud of being a pioneer in 
the transfer of powers to aboriginal nations. I see Quebec's 
James Bay Agreement as a model which, in my opinion, has 
been used for many existing agreements on self-government.
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	I remind you that this model was entirely financed by the 
Quebec government. The takeover and the relationship between 
the native community and the Quebec government are getting 
closer. This is demonstrated by the way Quebec's current 
government is handling joint management with the natives. 
Important and judicious negotiations are continuing in this 
regard.
<P>
	Before moving on to the content and clauses of Bill C-55, I 
must mention a few things that I find regrettable. I do not want to 
appear overly critical to my friends from the Reform Party, but it 
must be noted that immigrants, in my opinion, are not very 
respectful of Natives. I am willing to give them the benefit of the 
doubt and say that there are financial and territorial implications 
to be looked at, as we are doing in committee and right here, but 
we know at the outset that they have no respect for natives taking 
control of their own destiny or for their ability to do so.
<P>
	I listened to the speeches made by some members, including 
the hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap, who does not think 
that any native group should be given self-government rights 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7531"> 7531 </A></B>
<P>
exceeding those of municipal  governments. I am sorry, but they 
were here first. They are more than municipal governments.
<P>
	In our parliamentary guide, we in the Bloc Quebecois say that 
these people are entitled to self-government. They are nations, 
just as there is a Quebec nation, an Anglo-Saxon nation, an 
Acadian nation; there are native nations and it is important to 
point that out.
<P>
	The previous speaker said that he was afraid for his fishing 
and hunting rights. We can all say that the arrival of Europeans 
here upset their hunting and fishing rights as well. It is the 
wrong approach to say that reviewing the rules of the game will 
prevent us from hunting and fishing in the Yukon. I myself have 
gone there and I invite the hon. member to go there too.
<P>
	I was taken fishing. It did not prevent me from being very well 
received on native territory. I could well have been told that 
those resources belong to the native people and that I was not 
welcome. On the contrary. As we have seen over the centuries, 
native people know how to share and I was glad to be invited to 
go and fish there. I think that fishing and hunting rights will be 
maintained.
<P>
	I also heard Reformers call them spoiled children. I heard the 
Reform Party compare them to people on southern islands. I 
gave you some statistics and opinions a while ago: that is false. 
People who live near the 60th parallel are not vacationers. They 
are not on a holiday, when you realize that unemployment is 50 
per cent. People on holiday do not care about the unemployment 
rate, they can afford a trip south.
<P>
	Many of these people cannot afford as much and I think that 
the kind of example put forward by the Reform Party does not 
help the debate. I admit that there may be reasons or financial 
arguments but it is harder for me to accept arguments based on 
mistrust of native people.
<P>
	On Bill C-55 as such, what is interesting in this bill is that a 
board is created to settle disputes. Settling disputes is important 
because there are issues involving trappers and mining and 
forestry companies. These people will certainly have disputes at 
some point. Bill C-55 will give the native people, who will be 
well represented on the board, a means to settle such disputes. It 
is much better than what we have in the rest of Canada. I think 
that the failures elsewhere in Canada must have inspired the bill 
now before us.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	The example of Split Lake comes to mind. Indeed, even if an 
agreement was reached with one of the nations, the whole water 
system of that part of the country was affected and these people 
have practically no recourse, except arbitration. If there was a 
board located closer to them, such disputes would be solved 
much more quickly.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois will pursue its work in committee. 
Obviously, we support Bill C-55, although there may be room 
for improvement regarding certain provisions. We will do our 
work seriously. We will review the bill and we will examine it 
more in detail at the committee level. At this stage, the Bloc 
Quebecois can only support that legislation. After all, we made 
speeches to support these people in Yukon who, for generations, 
put all their hopes in a successful negotiation process, before 
finally seeing their dream come true in the last session of this 
Parliament. Under the circumstances, it would be very 
inconsistent to now oppose Bill C-55.
<P>
	I want to say that both myself and my Bloc colleagues have 
confidence in native people. We do recognize, for example, that 
they were the first ones here, that they deserve more respect, and 
that they should have full control of their destiny. And to 
recognize those things implies a great deal of confidence. But 
we do have total confidence in native people.
<P>
	Programs which, until now, were run in Ottawa will now be 
administered much closer to native communities, and I hope to 
never again hear negative, if not nasty, comments about natives. 
These people follow the debates of the House of Commons and I 
think that they sometimes have a wrong impression of 
parliamentary democracy. Their own approach is based on 
reaching a consensus but, more importantly, they are guided by a 
profound need for respect.
<P>
	I am among those who have the greatest respect for native 
people. I do recognize that they were subjected to many 
injustices and these have to be corrected. The previous bills 
corrected those injustices, and Bill C-55 will confirm the 
autonomy of 14 First Nations in Yukon. Four of them have 
reached agreements, while ten others are in the process of doing 
so. They will be heading for self-government and I know they 
will take care of their communities, because I trust them on this 
issue.
<P>
	I think the federal government will be able to save some 
money by granting the native people a land base that will help 
them grow and become much more self-sufficient.
<P>
	Of course, since I am from Quebec and well-versed in 
independence issues, I fully understand why a First Nation or 
some First Nations would want their independence, and this is 
why we are extremely pleased to support Bill C-55, although we 
will want to clean up the legislation to ensure that the bill 
reflects our vision. As far as the substance of the bill is 
concerned, we think that self-government for the people in 
Yukon and elsewhere is very important and we are pleased to tell 
the Yukon residents who are watching us, the native peoples in 
Yukon, that the Bloc Quebecois will support Bill C-55.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my Bloc colleague from Saint-Jean who just spoke in 
my view painted some scenarios essentially that do not exist and 
painted scenes of conflict where it does not exist.
<P>
	We have talked on many occasions about a municipal style of 
self-government in committee and in this House. I also talk 
about it quite publicly.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	We have a living example in the province of British Columbia 
with the Sechelt band. That form of self-government has proven 
for that particular band to be very progressive. It is what the 
people want and they are thriving under that form of 
self-government.
<P>
	There is no reason to suggest that form of self-government 
would not be a very appropriate form of self-government in 
many other jurisdictions. I want to set the record straight in that 
area.
<P>
	What we have heard here is the Quebec provincial agenda 
being promoted on the rest of Canada. The Bloc is not proving to 
be the steward of federal or other provincial resources. When I 
heard the member talking about James Bay what I heard was a 
promotion of 100 per cent provincial involvement in these 
issues. I find that to be a contradiction in terms as to what we are 
talking about today. Perhaps my colleague could offer some 
clarification in that area.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to tell my colleague who 
also sits on the aboriginal affairs committee that what I quoted 
the hon. member for Okanagan-Shuswap as saying is not 
intended to indicate that there is no possible application of the 
municipal model. I merely quoted the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap as saying that no aboriginal group should 
be given rights to self-government exceeding those of 
municipal governments.
<P>
	If a municipal government model applies, as it seems to be the 
case with Sechelts, then it is fine. But I do not think it is 
appropriate to put First Nations on the same level as municipal 
governments. That is all. I did not reject the municipal model. I 
only rejected the terms used by the hon. member for 
Okanagan-Shuswap.
<P>
	As for the James Bay case, I must reiterate that it continues to 
be a model according to me and to the Bloc Quebecois. The 
Canadian government did not invest any money in it. This was 
promoted directly by the Quebec government and I do not think 
we have some secret agenda that we would want to hide from the 
Reform Party. As we know, the Quebec government has close 
ties with them. They have their own way to deal with issues. 
Here, at the federal level, we do things differently.
<P>
	We examine all proposals and legislation before us on their 
merit and, of course, sometimes we suggest amendments and 
sometimes we support some bills. We even sometimes reject 
legislation. But this does not mean that we have a secret agenda. 
We only want to work with the aboriginal people and to get the 
best results possible, based on mutual trust.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on debate rather than questions and comments, I would 
forego a moment of my time and ask the member for Saint-Jean, 
who was so effusive in his praise for the settlement in C-33 and 
C-34 I believe it was, that this legislation enables, if he would 
then use this as a model for a land settlement with the northern 
Quebec Cree on exactly the same terms, exactly the same 
conditions, exactly the same land base, exactly the same surface 
and subsurface rights and exactly the same money.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since a question was asked before the 
hon. member began his speech, I will authorize the hon. member 
for Saint-Jean to answer.
<P>
<B>(1745) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I must admit that James Bay is 
indeed a model, but self-government cannot be applied 
everywhere from Halifax to Vancouver. We can see that a form 
of self-government respecting their past and their traditions is 
working for the Sechelt Band. Another formula was applied to 
the James Bay Crees and we can come up with yet another 
formula for Northern Quebec.
<P>
	So, when we negotiate with the Northern Inuit, we will see 
how to apply self-government to their case by listening to what 
they have to say and what proposals they put forward during 
negotiations. Thus we will be in a position to react. I simply 
want to say to my colleague that there is no single way to 
implement self-government, there is no predetermined 
framework. Self-government is function of the tradition of the 
First Nations to whom it applies as well as of the climate that 
prevails in their negotiations with the governments.

<P>
	<B>Mr. McClelland:</B> Members of the Bloc are always quick to 
say what we should do, how we should do it and with whose 
money we should do it. However when it comes around to 
whether or not it is good for them, all of a sudden we see people 
slip and slide. It is absolutely amazing. We certainly cannot nail 
them down in the House on anything they would do. I 
congratulate them on their ability to tap dance around issues that 
have to be talked about, that have to be addressed. In fairness, 
when  all 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7533"> 7533 </A></B>
<P>
is said and done it is my hope and desire that members of the 
Bloc will be living with it because we will continue to be 
Canadians one and all together. That is my greatest hope.
<P>
	I also thank the hon. member for Yukon for participating in 
the debate. She brought another perspective to the issue. We sit 
through these prepared speeches and we listen to what each 
other has to say about various issues. However when someone 
can inject a little emotion into the debate it tends to make the 
debate much more interesting. The member injected some 
emotion into the debate. She called into question the motivation 
of specific members of my party as individuals and the party as a 
whole. I think she cast unfair aspersions on what our role or our 
function is in Parliament.
<P>
	I would ask if there is anyone in the whole country, including 
members of the Bloc, who could think for even one second that 
what we as Canadians have done to our native brothers and 
sisters is something we should be proud of. I am wondering if 
anybody here thinks it is something worthy of repeating.
<P>
	When a party comes into the House and questions the wisdom 
of legislation brought forward by the government, first that is its 
job. Second, maybe there is something to be learned from it.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that as an individual I did not become 
sensitized to the situation of Indians in our country yesterday or 
when I was elected. I live in western Canada. I was brought up 
and lived among Indians and with Indians going to school with 
me who lived in residential schools. We played together. We had 
fun together. We have relations together through marriage and 
adoption. We are in a much closer relationship with Indians in 
western Canada than exists in other parts of the country. It is 
very much part and parcel of our daily lives in many instances. It 
is absurd to suggest that somehow it is anti-Indian or racist 
because our views do not match government legislation or the 
views of an interest group or someone who is going to benefit 
and we question it. It is our function. It is our job. It is our duty 
to question legislation. It is what all of us are supposed to be 
doing.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	If we did that more often, members on the government side 
and members on the opposition side, and not just automatically 
salute the flag because it is on the pole, maybe we would not be 
in the miserable condition we are as a country with debt that we 
cannot possibly pay in our generation. Our generation and the 
generation before us got us into this mess.
<P>
	If we are bankrupt as a nation for our boneheaded decisions, 
does it matter whether we are bankrupt Indians or bankrupt 
non-Indians? Does it matter if we are bankrupt immigrants? If 
our country does not have the funds to pay our commitments, 
does it matter where we came from? It does not. We have to start 
thinking in  terms of our responsibilities to future generations, 
not to the next election.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, I received a letter from a constituent 
the other day which said that the difference between a statesman 
and a politician is that a politician looks to the next election and 
a statesman to the next generation. Maybe we should be 
spending more time thinking about the next generation, less 
time about the next election, and a whole lot less time trying to 
make political points or political hay out of misrepresentation 
just so we can win another election. It is demeaning and it is 
below the dignity of the House.
<P>
	Another question in the debate is our relationship with 
Indians in Canada. We have to go from this father knows best 
Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development 
making all the decisions and put the responsibility for decision 
making with the people affected by it. There is nothing, at least 
in my opinion, that will do more to create self-sufficiency and 
self-respect, the cornerstone of advancement, than 
responsibility.
<P>
	We cannot give people vast or even small sums of money and 
say: ``There is more where this comes from. Don't worry about 
being responsible about spending it and looking after it. It is a 
bottomless pit''. We have to give with the opportunity to 
generate wealth and income the responsibility for doing it. If we 
are not prepared to do that we are not going to achieve anything.
<P>
	Before we start doing all this, let us start figuring out a way to 
dismantle the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs and 
pass off the responsibility to the people to whom it should be 
given, that is the Indians themselves. The cornerstone upon 
which success will be built is self-respect and pride.
<P>
	I would like to spend a couple of minutes talking about 
another situaion, the whole notion of two row wampum. Last 
winter a group of Indians were demonstrating in front of the 
West Block and around Parliament Hill. Last winter in Ottawa 
was brutally cold. After about three days of these people 
standing around trying to get attention I looked at them and 
thought they really had to care about what they are doing to 
stand around in the cold and not hire somebody to do it for them.
<P>
	I talked with them for a while and got to know a couple of the 
people involved. One fellow in particular, Stuart Myiow, was 
from Akwasasne. He is the publisher of a small newspaper, <I>The 
Eagle's Cry</I>. He wanted to get the attention of parliamentarians 
because he said we had broken the two row wampum, which 
means equal but separate. It means that they cannot have their 
feet in two different canoes at the same time: when Indians take 
on the mantle of the white man they are no longer Indians. How 
can they be both? According to him it brings out a whole host of 
social problems, identity problems, and problems in how they 
are going to go forward into the future.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7534"> 7534 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	It caused me to think about the difference between collective 
rights and individual rights. Perhaps we basically have grown up 
understanding and valuing individual initiative and individual 
rights.
<P>
	It is my experience that not all but many Indian bands and 
many Indians are far more collective in the way they relate to 
each other and to society as a whole. If we are ever to bridge this 
chasm and get on to the future, in my opinion we are going to 
have to respect the tradition of the Indian people to the sense of 
collective responsibilities.
<P>
	This means, as the hon. member for Saint-Jean mentioned 
earlier, that perhaps the justice system we have brought to North 
America is not suitable to the Indians. The recidivism rate 
among Indians is far higher than that in the general population. 
Indians in Canada comprise something like 5 per cent of the 
population, yet they are something like 25 per cent to 30 per cent 
or even more of incarcerated people. It is vastly 
disproportionate. In that case we should be looking at 
non-traditional means of changing the habit through what is 
being attempted now in the west: sweat lodges and the belief in 
the collective meting out of justice.
<P>
	We certainly are in opposition to the particular bill, not 
because of the fact that it sets up a dispute settling board. 
Obviously that is needed and it is patterned after the one in 
Alberta anyway. We are in opposition because we are in 
opposition to Bill C-33 and Bill C-34 which this bill enables. 
We are in opposition not to create problems for the Indians but 
because we want some real solutions. In this debate we want to 
talk about real issues and to deal with things as they are, not as 
we would wish them to be.
<P>
	We have to understand that there are all kinds of vested 
interests in the debate, not just the vested interests of the 
department of Indian affairs, people in Parliament, Indian bands 
or leaders of various Indian bands. We did not get into this 
situation by accident. We got into this situation because we were 
cross-threaded in everything we have done as far as the Indians 
are concerned ever since day one.
<P>
	More of the same is not going to get us out of the mess we are 
in. We need fresh thinking. We need new vision and, above all, 
we need to question every move and every word that comes out 
of the Liberal government which got us into this mess in the first 
place.

that one member may rise to indicate that the NDP members

CANADA AND THE REFORMERS OF UPPER CANADA</A></H3>
	The House resumed from June 20 consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is with great pleasure that I rise tonight to speak to the motion 
put forward by my hon. colleague from Verchères.
<P>
	In his motion my colleague recommends that the House 
should officially recognize the historical contribution of the 
Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper Canada 
to the establishment of a system of responsible, democratic 
government in Canada and in Quebec.
<P>
	Before I start I would like to quote briefly from an article 
written by S. W. Wallace, which was published in the first issue 
of the <I>Canadian Historical Review</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The real significance of Canadian history lies in the fact that in the evolution 
of the new and unprecedented phenomenon, the British Commonwealth of 
Nations, Canada has played a leading part. It was in Canada that responsible 
government was first worked out in the colonial sphere.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1855 ) </B>
<P>
	Responsible government is undoubtedly a Canadian concept. 
It is part of our rich sociopolitical history. Question period, for 
example, is one of the ways in which the government can be 
challenged to remain accountable for its actions.
<P>
	In any event, I am not here tonight to debate who fought 
harder for the concept of responsible government in the British 
North American colonies, Joseph Howe or the duo of Louis 
Joseph Papineau and William Lyon Mackenzie. Each 
contributed in his own way to the establishment of responsible 
government in Canada.
<P>
	What I am concerned with is the fact that we are seeking to 
recognize a holiday based on a history which focuses on 
ordinary citizens taking up arms against the government of the 
day. Even if the motion of our colleague from Verchères should 
pass the House when would he suggest that the Patriotes and the 
Reformers be commemorated? The closest Sunday to November 
23, just like the Parti Quebecois declared in 1982?
<P>
	I am aware that my colleague is not demanding a national 
holiday. However, we already set aside two days when 
Canadians can pause and reflect on this great country of ours. 
These two days are Heritage Day and Canada Day.
<P>
	On these days Canadians reflect and celebrate their country. 
What prevents us from commemorating on the third Monday of 
February or on July 1 the contributions of the patriots and the 
reformers to the establishment of responsible government?
<P>
	For example, in Liverpool, Nova Scotia, and all around the 
south shore area, the Canada Day weekend is the beginning of a 
local heritage celebration called Privateer Day. Privateers were 
men who smuggled supplies instead of serving in the Royal 
Navy during the American revolution, the Napoleonic wars and 
the war of 1812.
<P>
	During these commemorative festivities fireworks are lit on 
Friday night over the Liverpool harbour in memory of the 
privateers. On Saturday there are two parades which recreate the 
events of days gone by. To my knowledge, the privateers of 
Nova Scotia have never been officially recognized by the House 
of Commons for their contribution to the economic prosperity of 
the south shore of Nova Scotia, yet every year during the Canada 
Day weekend the entire community remembers the privateers.
<P>
	What is preventing our hon. colleague from Verchères from 
encouraging community leaders to organize events 
commemorating Louis Joseph Papineau and his followers? He 
certainly does not need the federal government's approval to 
organize such festivities.
<P>
	My real opposition to this motion stems from the unique place 
in history given to the Patriotes by the Quebec sovereignists. I 
think it would further fan the flames of nationalism and 
separatism if this motion was adopted by the House.
<P>
	I would like to quote from an article that appeared in <I>L'action 
nationale</I> which is without a doubt a propaganda tool for the 
Quebecois nationalists. The article was penned by Gilles 
Rhéaume who at the time was director of the Ligue d'action 
nationale as well as president of the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal which is one of the most 
radical nationalist groups in Quebec. In his short article, Mr. 
Rhéaume stated:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	``Admiring the Patriotes of 1837-38 is fine, but being 
inspired by their example is better. Let us draw our inspiration 
from their devotion to freedom and sovereignty. But, in order to 
do so, we need special occasions. That is why the Société 
Saint-Jean-Baptiste of Montreal welcomed the order issued by 
the Quebec government declaring the Sunday nearest to 
November 23, the anniversary date of the victory at 
Saint-Denis, as National Patriots Day''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7540"> 7540 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Quebec sovereignists use the patriots of 1837-38 
rebellion as a weapon of legitimization in their fight for Quebec 
independence. The sovereignists of today try to demonstrate to 
their fellow Quebecois that Louis Joseph Papineau and his 
followers were rebelling against the intransigent tyranny of the 
British powers, much like the Bloc is doing in this Parliament 
against the federal powers.
<P>
	Granted, conditions in Lower Canada during the 1830s were 
difficult and frustrating for the French Canadian majority, 
difficult because economic hardship seriously affected the 
francophone working class, frustrating because the francophone 
petite bourgeoisie constituted the majority of members in the 
lower House. Yet these same members had very little say in the 
financial management of the colony.
<P>
<B>(1900) </B>
<P>
	What concerns me if this House adopts Motion No. 257 is that 
we will be playing right into the hands of the Bloc Quebecois as 
well as those of the Parti Quebecois. Certain parallels can be 
drawn between the causes fought for in 1837-38 and the present 
day battle over Canadian unity.
<P>
	Once again, I will draw upon Mr. Rhéaume's comment to 
support my argument. Mr. Rhéaume states that economic 
conditions, especially the lack of control over the purse strings 
of the colonial treasury were one of the main causes for the 
1837-38 rebellion. Today Quebec nationalists complain that 
they have only partial control over their economy. The essential 
levers of power rest within the hands of the federal government 
where the Quebec representatives are a minority.
<P>
	The Patriotes believed that only full control of all economic 
levers could permit the French Canadians to survive as a people. 
The Quebecois nationalist elite uses the same argument today to 
preserve its language, culture and tradition.
<P>
	I clearly see comparisons being drawn by Quebecois 
nationalists between the events of 1837-38 and those unfolding 
in 1994-95. If this House is seriously fighting for a strong 
Canada it would be hypocritical for its members to vote in 
favour of this motion.
<P>
	Since our colleague for Verchères is very interested in history, 
as all Canadians should be, let us look back on some of the 
Patriote commemorative ceremonies which have taken place 
over the years. Since 1962, the 125th anniversary of the 
rebellion, commemorative ceremonies held in Montreal in 
honour of the Saint-Denis victory have taken on a nationalistic 
overtone. For example in 1970 at the height of the October crisis 
about 3,000 people rallied at the Patriotes monument. 
Representatives of the Chevaliers de l'indépendance, as well as 
those of the FLQ were on hand. Camille Laurin, leader of the 
national assembly of the Parti Quebecois, stated:
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The most insidious means are used to perpetuate colonialism 
in Quebec, but Quebec will achieve its independence through 
peaceful means.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	At a similar celebration in 1973 Francois Albert Angers, one 
of Quebec's most important proponents of economic 
sovereignty, asked French Canadians to stand behind the Parti 
Quebecois so that they could defeat more easily the anglophone 
political party. Links do exist between Quebec sovereignists and 
Patriotes commemoration.
<P>
	In 1977 the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste de Montréal awarded 
its Patriote de l'année award to Camille Laurin, the minister 
who steered Bill 101 through the national assembly. This is no 
coincidence. The nationalists use the term Patriote de l'année 
when giving an award to a Parti Quebecois minister who 
severely restricted, we could almost say outlawed, the use of 
English in his province. The Parti Quebecois during its last 
tenure in power also renamed a highway in honour of the 
Patriotes in addition to declaring the Sunday nearest November 
23 as the official day for commemorative ceremonies.
<P>
	The Parti Quebecois is using the battles of their forefathers 
during the 1837-38 rebellion to legitimize their struggles 
against Canadian federalism. Today the term patriote has taken 
on an almost anti-English anti-federalist connotation in 
Quebec. Whereas the original Patriotes fought in part to 
establish responsible government, today's patriots seem to be 
working toward the demise of this great country of ours.
<P>
	Louis Joseph Papineau, William Lyon Mackenzie and their 
followers certainly have enriched Canada's history as have 
thousands of other men and women. In opposing this motion I do 
not want to belittle their contribution in any way. However, I am 
concerned for the message we would be sending out to the 
Quebecois sovereignists if we legitimized the Patriotes' actions. 
I therefore urge all members of this House who want to preserve 
our country to vote against Motion No. 257.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
on a point of order. The hon. member who just spoke has insulted 
many Quebecers, unwittingly I am sure, by saying that the 
Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste is a radical or extremist movement. 
Several million of Quebecers have been members of that 
movement which has no ties whatsoever with political parties. I 
shall be brief, Mr. Speaker. Some Liberals are still members of 
the Société Saint-Jean-Baptiste, and other parties-

<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier: </B>Mr. Speaker, I am willing to speak now, but I

<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Trois-Rivières 
has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yves Rocheleau (Trois-Rivières, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
am very pleased to speak today in this debate about the 
contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the 
Reformers of Upper Canada to the democratic evolution of our 
representation mechanisms.
<P>
	I am all the more pleased to speak on this November 1, 1994, 
because exactly seven years ago today, on November 1, 1987, 
we lost a very great Quebec patriot, a great Quebec democrat, 
the former premier of Quebec, Mr. Lévesque, who invited 
Quebecers to believe in Quebec, who gave confidence and pride 
to Quebecers and invited them to describe themselves and to 
consider themselves as a people with the highest political status.
<P>
	I would hope that in the upcoming referendum campaign, 
Quebecers will remember and emulate that great man, René 
Lévesque.
<P>
	I am also very pleased to take part in this debate that was 
raised by my colleague from Verchères, whom I want to 
congratulate and who has moved the following motion, that I 
would like to read in order to put things in perspective:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should officially 
recognize the historical contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the 
Reformers of Upper Canada to the establishment of a system of responsible 
democratic government in Canada and in Quebec, as did the Government of 
Quebec in 1982 by proclaiming by order a national Patriots' Day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I am all the more proud, and even a bit moved, because I 
participated myself in the celebrations that, for thirty years now, 
have been held in commemoration of the 1837-1838 events that 
occurred in Saint-Denis sur Richelieu, in Quebec. I would like 
to take this  opportunity to thank and congratulate two residents 
of that village who, certainly for twelve years I think, have 
organized these celebrations with efficiency, skill, modesty and 
so much dignity. They are Mr. and Mrs. Onil Perrier from 
Saint-Denis and they deserve our most sincere gratitude.
<P>
	To understand fully the evolution of these so-called 
democratic mechanisms, we have to go back to 1791, about forty 
years before the 1837-1838 events, when the Quebec Act 
created two provinces, Lower Canada and Upper Canada, 
Quebec and Ontario as we know them today.
<P>
	From a political point of view, we must remember that this act 
established four precise levels of power which were the source 
of frictions that caused the events we all know about. The first 
level of power was the governor and his bureaucrats who formed 
an oligarchy named clique du château, or castle clan, in Quebec 
and Family Compact in Upper Canada or Ontario. Then there 
were the Executive Council and two other houses, the 
Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly.
<P>
<B>(1910) </B>
<P>
	Not only were the governor and the executive council not 
accountable to the people and the elected representatives, but 
they also had the power to revoke laws passed by Parliament. 
The legislative council was clearly a patronage heaven and 
became a kind of branch of the executive council where people 
would exchange friendly services, serve on one council and then 
on the other and even, at times, on both councils at once.
<P>
	During all those years, there was deep discontent with the 
legislative council within the population. When the 92 
resolutions were presented in 1834, 31 concerned the 
Legislative Council, and this discontent was prevalent among 
both francophones and anglophone progressive democrats.
<P>
	At the time, the legislative assembly, consisting of elected 
representatives and members, was just a debating society, like 
the National Forum on Health which the Prime Minister of 
Canada supports, a debating society without any real power, 
except the power to run its own activities, but when it appointed 
a speaker, Louis Joseph Papineau, his appointment was turned 
down by Mr. Dalhousie, the governor at the time.
<P>
	Throughout this period, the demands of both Patriotes and 
Reformers touched on a number of points, the most important 
one being responsible government, which would make the 
executive accountable to the people and their elected 
representatives.
<P>
	Another demand concerned the right of the members of the 
Legislative Assembly to control appropriations and how tax 
money was spent, and to have a say in the appointment of senior 
officials. Finally, another demand, still very relevant, was that 
the legislative council, more or less the equivalent of the other 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7542"> 7542 </A></B>
<P>
place today, be elected by the people instead of appointed by the 
governor.
<P>
	Throughout this period, these demands were the subject of 
intense and incessant debate and caused constant confrontation 
between the executive and the legislative bodies. Faced with the 
arbitrary behaviour and contempt of the governor and his clique, 
the people's representatives and all democratic individuals had 
the choice of either submitting or enlisting the means at their 
disposal and stand on their rights.
<P>
	That is what they did, but unfortunately, in 1837-38, both 
groups were defeated. They were defeated in the media, but only 
ten years later, in 1848, they won when responsible government 
was recognized. We still enjoy the benefits of that victory today 
in this House, and it means that as elected representatives, we 
can take part in the debate and we can ask questions.
<P>
	You will probably agree that the quality of the questions is 
more obvious than the quality of the answers, especially when 
the answers come from the official opposition, but it gives us the 
right today to put questions to the government. It gives us the 
right to demand, on occasion, the resignation of ministers. That 
is part of these new powers. At the time, these powers were 
acquired as a result of responsible government. This gives 
elected representatives the right to adopt budgets and 
appropriations, and it also allows them to question the 
government about the appointment of senior officials.
<P>
	Such is the contribution of the Patriotes and the Reformers. 
That is why we are asking the House to vote on this proposal to 
recognize the most valuable contribution that both Patriotes and 
Reformers made at that time to the evolution of our democracy. I 
will not try to conceal that there are in fact similarities between 
the background of this historic episode and the present situation.
<P>
<B>(1915) </B>
<P>
	We must not forget that at the time, as my friend mentioned a 
few moments ago, they were claiming their independence and 
there had been a declaration of independence. Today, the 
sovereignist movement is in office in Quebec and represents the 
official opposition here, in Ottawa. This shows how sovereignist 
thinking is deeply rooted in our people, how we genuinely aspire 
to sovereignty and how the vision of someday having a country 
that Quebecers will claim as their own is not the undertaking of a 
single man, but a truly collective endeavour very deeply rooted 
in the minds of our people.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am happy to take part today to the debate on the 
motion which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That [. . .]the government should officially recognize the historical 
contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper 
Canada to the establishment of a system of responsible democratic government in 
Canada and in Quebec-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I will come back to that proposal later.
<P>
	Let me say first of all that I am among those who will not be 
able to support that motion. However, I want to say that I share 
in no way, and I underline the words in no way, the arguments 
and reasons put forward by the member for Calgary Southeast 
against the motion. Her reasons are not mine and I thought it was 
important to stress this fact.
<P>
	It is with great interest that I rise today to speak about that 
important issue. Most Canadians do not have to go back to their 
history books to remember the contribution of Reformers and 
Patriotes during the last century. As we all know, the Patriotes 
caused the events known today as the Rebellion of 1837.
<P>
	Although I recognize it is important to stress the contribution 
of those individuals who, by their action, brought about the 
establishment of responsible government, I do not subscribe 
fully to the proposal of the hon. member. If the aim of the hon. 
member for Verchères is to commemorate important 
contributions to Canadian democracy, I believe his proposal is 
somewhat restrictive.
<P>
	First of all, Canada is a huge territory bordered by three 
oceans. This alone is sufficient to make us understand that a 
multitude of individuals must have worked together to build this 
great country. The motion of the hon. member stresses only the 
historical contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and of 
the Reformers of Upper Canada. Notwithstanding that fact, if 
the motion had been put differently, I could have given it my 
support. However, I oppose the motion because it does not take 
into account the fundamental contributions of Canadians in 
other regions.
<P>
	Montesquieu said that to love democracy is to love equality. If 
we recognize the contribution of some, this should be done 
equally for all.
<P>
	It would be important to highlight or, at least, not to forget the 
role played by Joseph Howe to whom we originally owe the 
principle of accountability in government. I am not saying this 
to gloss over or down-play what William Lyon Mackenzie did in 
Upper Canada and Louis Joseph Papineau in Lower Canada, but 
this does not change the fact that Joseph Howe was the 
originator of the concept of accountability in government. He 
was a journalist with the <I>Nova Scotian</I>, an influential paper at 
the time. He had campaigned in favour of accountability in 
government. When he entered politics, in 1836, he played an 
important role in the establishment, in Nova Scotia, of what was 
called a liberal reform government. He was the one who argued 
with the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7543"> 7543 </A></B>
<P>
British authorities of the day in favour of an executive power 
accountable to the elected members of the legislative assembly.
<P>
<B>(1920) </B>
<P>
	It was the beginning of responsible government. As the 
member who spoke before me mentioned, Louis Joseph 
Papineau and his committee had presented 92 resolutions 
advocating the control of revenues by the legislative assembly, 
but executive responsibility, the election of a council and their 
action were part of a larger movement which was related to a 
fight being fought elsewhere by Joseph Howe, in Nova Scotia, 
for example, or by William Lyon Mackenzie in Upper Canada.
<P>
	What we must point out when we talk about the history of 
Lower and Upper Canada, is that the provinces were created by 
the Constitutional Act of 1791 which drew a line west of the 
seigneury of Vaudreuil to create the new province of Upper 
Canada, a sort of distinct society for the English speakers of the 
time, a way to give them the common law and the right to own 
land under a system known as ``free hold land tenure''.
<P>
	A distinct colony was establish to protect these two 
principles. However, I should say that this new colony of Upper 
Canada was merely a narrow band of land just north of the St. 
Lawrence River, just like Lower Canada extended only along 
both shores of the river.
<P>
	Nevertheless, if we were to take the motion as it appears in 
today's order paper and to translate its content in 1994 parlance, 
we would talk about the responsible democratic government of 
Quebec, the former Lower Canada, and of Ontario, the former 
Upper Canada, and we would exclude all the other provinces of 
this big country of ours. As I said earlier, the initiatives of 
Joseph Howe preceded those of William Lyon Mackenzie who, 
with a group of friends, rebelled and took arms-a few guns, 
forks, shovels, whatever they had then-to show their 
discontent.
<P>
	Needless to say, they did not get very far. They were for the 
most part banished, jailed, etc. and they only surfaced years 
later. As for Lower Canada, we certainly all remember Louis 
Joseph Papineau and his friends, who were then called the 
Patriotes, and who played a role similar to that of William Lyon 
Mackenzie, the grandfather of another Liberal Prime Minister 
elected several years later, William Lyon Mackenzie King.
<P>
	We are all aware of these facts and I am not one to forget or 
diminish in any way the role played by the Patriotes. In closing, 
I will repeat what I said at the beginning, that I totally dissociate 
myself from some comments made today. I declare that, if this 
motion was intended to recognize in Ontario and in Quebec, 
which are both provinces, the contribution of these groups, I 
would gladly support the motion, and I must say that if the 
member opposite was willing to request unanimous consent of 
the House to change the word, I would immediately give my 
support.
<P>
	I suspect, however, that there is another, different objective in 
that motion. At the end, it says ``in Canada and in Quebec'', as if 
they were really two distinct and equal entities.
<P>
<B>(1925) </B>
<P>
	Of course, Ontario and Quebec are both provinces. Quebec is 
a province within this great country which is Canada, this great 
country which, I hope, will always remain strong and united.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in this House to speak to the proposal put forth by my 
colleague, the hon. member for Verchères. The motion reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should officially 
recognize the historical contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the 
Reformers of Upper Canada to the establishment of a system of responsible 
democratic government in Canada and in Quebec, as did the government of 
Quebec in 1982 by proclaiming by order a national Patriots' day.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I want to point out right away that this proposal is in no way 
designed to add a statutory holiday to the calendar. The thought 
of adding such a holiday never crossed the mind of the sponsor 
of this motion.
<P>
	The purpose of this motion is however to recognize the 
contribution of the Patriotes of Lower Canada and the 
Reformers of Upper Canada by an order of this House to that 
effect.
<P>
	The point was made that the violence of the 1837 and 1838 
rebellions should not be condoned. Of course not, but let us not 
forget however that Patriotes and Reformers voiced their 
grievances and complaints in pamphlets, in newspapers articles, 
at rallies, through petitions and presentations at the House of 
Assembly they had in those days, before some of them finally 
decided to rise up in arms.
<P>
	The sole purpose of the motion before us now is to pay tribute, 
regardless of these unfortunately violent events, to these men 
and women who believed in the need to have a responsible and 
truly democratic government. Among those who took part in 
that movement, some became well-respected public figures 
because of their convictions and their major contribution to our 
society.
<P>
	I can think of people like Louis Joseph Papineau, Louis 
Hippolyte Lafontaine, Robert Baldwin or George Étienne 
Cartier. Of course, the Patriotes and the Reformers were not the 
only ones who contributed to the establishment of responsible 
government in this country. Others also made a historical 
contribution to the building of Canada. I imagine that some 
measure will eventually be proposed to also honour these 
people.
<P>
	Certain Patriotes are better known than others, as well as 
some places. I am honoured by the fact that a meeting of 
Patriotes took place on July 16, 1837, in Deschambault, in my 
riding of Portneuf.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7544"> 7544 </A></B>
<P>
	Deschambault is one of many small communities in my riding 
which are located right on the shore of the St. Lawrence River. It 
has a pier, a promontory called Cap Lauzon, as well as a church 
which was already there at the time. There is also a general 
store, the Magasin général Paré, which dates back to that period.
<P>
	Let us go back 157 years, to July 16, 1837, in front of the 
general store which is located next to the old church, and let us 
listen to what the Patriotes of the time were saying:
<P>
	Resolution No. 1. ``That this assembly solemnly condemns 
the resolutions concerning the affairs of this province which 
were recently introduced by the minister in the British 
Parliament, which overwhelmingly approved them, hence 
sanctioning a principle which sooner or later will be used as a 
precedent to attack and destroy not only the rights and liberties 
of other British colonies, but even those of the English people''.
<P>
<B>(1930) </B>
<P>
	There are in these historical statements some valuable lessons 
that might enlighten us about our current situation.
<P>
	Resolution No. 2 is as follows: ``That the resolutions 
introduced by Lord John Russell in the House of Commons in 
England on March 6, on behalf of all ministers, to authorize the 
Imperial Parliament to seize in the provincial coffers the monies 
from the labour of the people to pay public servants, most of 
whom have shown themselves unworthy of this country, and 
since passed by the Commons and the Lords, are a violation of 
the Constitutional rights and privileges of the people of this 
province''.
<P>
	Resolution No. 3: ``That the adoption of these resolutions is in 
complete defiance of the just demands of the inhabitants of this 
province; that it destroys our confidence in the British 
Parliament, and that it should convince French Canadians that, 
in the future, they should expect from the United Kingdom no 
reparation for their grievances and no respect for their political 
rights.'' Unfortunately, you will agree, there is nothing new 
under the sun.
<P>
	Resolution No. 4: ``That the people of this country would bear 
the mark of degradation and would be enslaved if they agreed to 
be taxed, to be violently deprived by the public authorities of 
their money, which would then be distributed to perverse 
servants, without the sanction of their representatives who are 
the only ones to have the right to make appropriation of it''. In 
those days, there was no deficit, no public debt. Still, very 
serious statements were already being made. What would these 
Patriotes of 157 years ago say today if they saw our current 
taxation levels and our use of public funds? Then, 157 years ago, 
people had good horse sense and I think we still have it today.
<P>
	Resolution No. 5: ``That the British Parliament, by passing a 
resolution to seize this province's revenues, was guilty of an 
outrageous violation of our most accepted  rights, that it is our 
people's most pressing duty to resist this violation with all the 
legal means-that is what was said-at our disposal, and that we 
should henceforth have the steadfastness to appeal no more to a 
body which has declared itself so resolutely hostile to our 
freedoms''.
<P>
	Resolution No. 6: ``That for the preservation of these 
freedoms, it would be prudent to prepare ourselves for the 
difficulties that we may encounter by limiting our personal 
expenses and by promoting education, agriculture, industry, 
manufacturing and trade in this province.'' This certainly 
sounds very contemporary.
<P>
	Resolution No. 7: ``That when the revenues of this province 
are squandered to satisfy the greed of those who are always 
opposed to the wishes and the needs of the people, it is our duty 
to improve our domestic manufactures and to recommend their 
increasing use to our fellow citizens, just as it is our duty to 
avoid in so far as possible the products of those who pay duties''.
<P>
	Quebec's Patriotes were already showing us the way 157 
years ago. There are many more resolutions, but it was a 
privilege for me to read in this House tonight these words so full 
of common sense that our ancestors wrote in difficult times and 
that can still guide us today.
<P>
	In closing, Mr. Speaker, I would like to mention that the words 
I read tonight were written by Mr. Louis Gariépy, president, and 
Mr. N.G. Gauthier, secretary, and were published in <I>La Minerve</I>, 
on July 24, 1837.
<P>
<B>(1935 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak on Motion No. 257, the purpose 
of which is to recognize the historic contributions made by the 
Patriotes of Lower Canada and the Reformers of Upper Canada 
to establish a system of responsible democratic government in 
Canada.
<P>
	I should like to begin by informing my hon. colleague from 
Verchères that the Government of Canada is by no means remiss 
in celebrating our historic heritage and encouraging all 
Canadians to do so. The government has already established a 
national day of celebration on which we mark the contribution 
made to the country by all Canadian patriots, be they 
anglophone, francophone, aboriginal or allophone. I am 
speaking of course of Canada Day.
<P>
	Canada Day is a unique and appropriate opportunity to 
celebrate the contributions of all Canadians, including those 
who work for the establishment and continued evolution of our 
democratic system of government.
<P>
	Thousands of Canadians also have the opportunity to 
celebrate Heritage Day in February and organize activities 
marking the richness and diversity of our common heritage. It is 
the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7545"> 7545 </A></B>
<P>
perfect opportunity to commemorate the contribution that all 
great Canadians have made to our history.
<P>
	Permit me to mention that heritage is a vast concept that 
includes, as George Kapelos wrote, the understanding, 
appreciation and preservation of significant elements of our 
culture and historic heritage. It goes without saying that one of 
those significant elements is the important role played by the 
Patriotes and the Reformers of 1837.
<P>
	It must also be said that the federal government's more 
traditional role in heritage matters has been to protect national, 
historic or architectural sites and to establish research programs 
to increase awareness of our past.
<P>
	Yet there is ongoing co-operation among the federal, 
provincial and territorial governments in numerous areas of 
heritage preservation and appreciation. That is why as an 
Ontarian and as a Canadian I am pleased to see the Government 
of Quebec has officially marked the contribution that the 
Patriotes made to the establishment of more democratic 
structures by instituting the journée des Patriotes celebrated in 
November of each year.
<P>
	It is certainly not my intention to discourage the groups of 
citizens in Quebec and Ontario that are working to ensure the 
Patriotes and the Reformers are given their rightful place in our 
collective history. Indeed a familiarity with Canada's history 
gives us a more balanced vision of the country that allows us to 
make well advised decisions in managing the present and 
preparing for the future.
<P>
	The reason I oppose the adoption of such a bill is that the 
proposal by the member for Verchères puts the emphasis on the 
role of only certain individuals in the process that led to the 
establishment of responsible government. I do not agree with 
the thinking that the Government of Canada should give all the 
credit for the progress of democracy in Canada to the Patriotes 
of the rebellion of 1837. This would be unacceptable given that 
it would ignore the contributions of thousands of Canadians in 
every region of the country who played an integral role in 
establishing a more genuine democracy in Canada.
<P>
	I must therefore point out, as did my colleague from 
Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle a few months ago, that the 
proposal by the member for Verchères does not take into account 
the contribution that a great number of Canadians made to the 
institution of responsible government in Canada. I am speaking 
of Joseph Howe, Nellie McClung, Thérèse Casgrain and many 
others who over the course of our history were involved in the 
process of establishing responsible government and in the 
ongoing evolution of our democratic system of government.
<P>
	Recalling Joseph Howe, I cannot but question the link that 
this proposal tries to make between the actions of the Patriotes 
and the Reformers in the last century and the institution of 
responsible government. Was it not in fact Lord Durham who in 
a the rebellion of 1837 first recommended responsible 
government and the union of the two Canadas? I will be told that 
Lord Durham's  intention was to assimilate the French 
Canadians and that is undeniable.
<P>
<B>(1940 ) </B>
<P>
	I would point out, however, that it was the moderate 
Reformers who deserve the credit for putting forward the idea of 
responsible government. That is why Joseph Howe of Nova 
Scotia played such a pivotal role. He was the first to establish 
responsible government overseas in the British Empire, in one 
of the colonies that was to become Canada, at a time when the 
Patriot Louis Joseph Papineau was advocating American style 
elections.
<P>
	Joseph Howe, Robert Baldwin and Louis Lafontaine then 
built solid, moderate parties which in 1848 led Great Britain to 
accept the institution of a fully functional, responsible 
government. I would also point out that although responsible 
government did represent progress in Canada's parliamentary 
system, it was not in the beginning fully democratic.
<P>
	It would take contributions of such great women as Nellie 
McClung and Thérèse Casgrain to win the right for women to 
vote that they were denied until the 20th century. Thus it was 
Nellie McClung who deserves the credit for Manitoba becoming 
the first Canadian province to give women the right to vote in 
1916. Quebec had to wait for Thérèse Casgrain before it 
recognized women's right to vote in provincial elections. 
Furthermore it was not until 1960 that status Indians were 
allowed to vote in federal elections.
<P>
	If Canada were to mark the contribution its citizens have 
made to the institution of genuine responsible government, it 
would do so by including all Canadians rather than singling out 
the Patriotes. I find it difficult to see how Canadians as a whole 
would welcome the idea of granting national recognition to only 
one of the elements that contributed to an immense collection of 
movement leading to the creation of real democracy.
<P>
	I find it difficult to see how women would once again endorse 
a version of history that denies them their rightful place. I found 
it difficult to see how Canadians in provinces other than Ontario 
and Quebec would accept the government's decision to 
celebrate the contribution of only certain patriots. I find it 
difficult to see how the First Nations would welcome such a 
denial of their role in the creation of Canadian democracy.
<P>
	In as much as adoption of the bill might incur additional 
expenses, I feel it must not proceed. The Canadian government 
is a responsible government because of the historical events that 
created it. As a result it has priorities to which it must devote all 
its efforts and its human and financial resources.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7546"> 7546 </A></B>
<P>
	We promised Canadians jobs. In other words bread, not smoke 
and mirrors. Having said this, I would not want people to 
misinterpret the importance I attach to the action of our national 
patriots. I recognize that Papineau and Mackenzie played a 
significant role in our country's development by precipitating 
events with their radical position, but I also recognize that 
Baldwin and Lafontaine together contributed to the progress of 
democracy with their more moderate position.
<P>
	That is the great lesson that Canada teaches us. There are 
sometimes contradictory individual interests and positions. 
Then transcending everything else there is a peaceful Canada 
which forms and transforms itself without armed conflict.
<P>
	I for one am proud to live in a country that adopted 
responsible government, making the pitchforks and rifles of the 
past unnecessary. I therefore encourage all Canadians to 
celebrate in their own way the tradition of democracy they have 
inherited. As they have shown so often in the past, Canadians do 
not lack inventiveness.
<P>
	They can if they wish organize historical re-enactments of the 
events on the road to responsible government. They can, with 
the help of local historical societies or heritage conservation 
groups, organize commemorative or celebratory events. In 
closing I hope that my comments on opposing this motion have 
not in any way diminished the events of our history that allow us 
to speak here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the motion of my colleague from Verchères is of 
particular interest for me because many events of the 1837 
Rebellion occurred in my riding, in the town of Saint-Eustache, 
which became historic, and in neighbouring villages.
<P>
<B>(1945) </B>
<P>
	It is impossible to visit this region without seeing traces of 
these events mile after mile. Some of the villages and localities 
have evocative and significant names. One village was razed 
and others were burned to a greater of lesser extent. The English 
burned these villages in reprisal.
<P>
	The facade of the main church in Saint-Eustache still bears 
the marks made by English cannonballs. Many streets in the 
town are named after participants in these events. The 
Jean-Olivier Chénier Local Community Service Centre recalls 
the leader of the Patriotes in this region. These are all visible 
remnants of the 1837 Rebellion which brought the Patriotes face 
to face with the British army. We who live in that region cannot 
forget those events even if we wanted to. The signs are there 
right before us.
<P>
	Before anything else, I have to dispel a myth which has to do 
with the confrontation that did not occur because the Patriotes 
wanted sovereignty. The motion does not mention only the 
Patriotes of Lower Canada but also the  Reformers of Upper 
Canada. Let me quote my colleague, the hon. member for 
Verchères, who presented this motion. He said on June 20, 1994: 
``The aim of the motion I have just respectfully submitted for 
the consideration of this House today is to rectify this perception 
[that they were criminals] and to achieve, at long last, 
recognition of the historic contribution of the Patriotes of Lower 
Canada and the Reformers of Upper Canada to the establishment 
of a truly responsible and truly democratic government in 
Canada and in Quebec''.
<P>
	At the time, the Patriotes and the Reformers were fighting for 
a cause that is still dear to our hearts, quite simply democracy.
<P>
	Therefore, whether they were from Upper or Lower Canada, 
the insurrectionists were fighting to have the colonial assembly, 
which represented in the people, take a more active part in the 
exercise of power and gradually take over the internal 
management of the colony. As we know, the management of the 
colony's affairs was, at the time, conducted by London, through 
the governor and councils.
<P>
	In short, what the insurrectionists wanted, and the reason why 
I think the whole country has the duty to recognize them, was, 
and I repeat, the democratization of the institutions of their 
country.
<P>
	Whether it was in the field or at the end of a rope, will we say 
that the sacrifice of those who lost their lives was in vain? No, 
because in spite of their defeat, their uprising had the result of 
drawing the attention of London to the people's aspirations that 
it had consistently ignored until then. It was as a result of the 
1837-38 events that London asked Lord Durham to conduct an 
inquiry and to propose some solutions to the problems raised by 
these aspirations from colonies in the north of the United States 
of America.
<P>
<B>(1950) </B>
<P>
	The Durham report, which was of course open to criticism in 
many respects, particularly for us, Quebecers, nevertheless 
proved the Reformers and the Patriotes right, in the sense that 
the report ridiculed and criticized the Constitution Act of 1791, 
which, while giving a representative government, did not accept 
the principle of responsible government. That was exactly what 
the insurrectionists had been demanding and, on that point, Lord 
Durham was in agreement with them.
<P>
	It would be an overstatement to say that, in and of themselves, 
the actions of the Patriotes and the Reformers resulted in the 
Durham mission, the awareness that this mission raised in 
London and, consequently, the recognition in 1848 of 
responsible government. It would be unfair to others who helped 
make our institutions more democratic. The fact remains, 
however, that this action led to the decision to send Lord 
Durham on his mission and that the conclusions of this mission 
strongly influenced London's decision in 1848.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7547"> 7547 </A></B>
<P>
	I repeat, the Patriotes and the Reformers were not the sole 
instigators of the movement towards democracy that started in 
1848, but it is important to recognize the part they played, and I 
will get back to this. We want to give everyone his due.
<P>
	The causes that in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries 
moved first the Americans, then the French and then the 
Canadians to rebel violently against authority must be seen in 
context, and the context was, of course, different for each group. 
However, the main theme was the same: the will of a mature 
people to manage its own affairs. This phenomenon was to 
spread to a number of western countries.
<P>
	Without going so far as to defend violence, we cannot afford 
to ignore, for the sake of being politically correct, the important 
and in some cases unique role played by popular uprisings in the 
history of democracy.
<P>
	In Canada as well, history has shown that acts of violence 
occur only as a last resort, when people try to make themselves 
heard and all peaceful methods have failed. Perhaps I may recall 
what was said by the hon. member for Portneuf and emphasize 
the respectful tone of the resolutions he read to us and the fact 
that they included the desire to achieve their purpose through 
legal means. It is only when they realized that legal means were 
ineffective that they resolved to take arms.
<P>
	All attempts had failed. There were speeches in the House, 
demonstrations in the streets, editorials in the newspapers. The 
Patriotes and the Reformers finally decided to resort to armed 
rebellion because they had failed to obtain that London limit the 
discretionary powers of the Governor.
<P>
	In Canada as everywhere else, violent action, even when 
defeated, usually brings some movement, even on the part of a 
previously inflexible government.
<P>
	It is in this light that the motion seeks recognition of the 
historic contribution of the rebels of 1837-38, who fought for 
the democratization of the institutions of the time.
<P>
<B>(1955) </B>
<P>
	We should not be surprised by the fact that it took so long to 
realize the significance of the events of 1837-38. By the way, we 
should remember that the Church took 130 or 140 years before 
allowing-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry. If there is unanimous 
consent, the member can go on, but his time has expired. One 
minute.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mercier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out, just for 
the sake of comparison, that although the Bastille was taken on 
July 14, 1789, it was only 100 years later that the storming of the 
Bastille became France's national day. The Bastille was taken 
by Parisians, but, to go back to what my colleague opposite 
mentioned earlier, in spite of the fact that this was the doing of 
Parisians alone, the whole country now commemorates this 
local  event as its national day. This example illustrates why we 
are asking that these events be recognized.
<P>
	No matter what the members of this House think of the future 
of Canada, it seems legitimate for us to look at our past with 
respect and emotion, to honour this handful of men who, more 
than a century and a half ago, helped shape our democratic 
institutions, and sometimes paid for it with their lives.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hour provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 93, the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANRIGHTS">HUMAN RIGHTS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently I asked a question of the government, in 
particular the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific, concerning 
the upcoming visit of the Prime Minister and Team Canada, 
together with nine provincial premiers on a trade delegation to 
Asia. In particular I focused on the issue of human rights and 
democracy in Asian countries being visited by the Prime 
Minister and by the premiers.
<P>
	In urging the Prime Minister to speak out forcefully with 
respect to human rights and democracy in China, Tibet, 
Indonesia and East Timor in particular I want to remind the 
Prime Minister of his own words in a letter written in December 
1991: ``Progress toward respecting human rights in much of the 
world is the direct result of pressure from western 
democracies''.
<P>
	I think it is rather ironic that the Secretary of State for 
Asia-Pacific was one of the very eloquent spokespeople for the 
pro-democracy movement in Canada, calling for democracy 
and human rights in China. He had a number of confrontations 
with that government and was one of the key organizers of a 
human rights delegation in which I had the honour of 
participating together with two other members of Parliament, 
including his colleague, the Liberal member for Nepean.
<P>
	The plea I would make today, reiterating a plea I made earlier, 
is for the Prime Minister, for the Secretary of State for 
Asia-Pacific, for the Minister of Foreign Affairs to recognize 
that the concerns which drove that plea for human rights in 1991 
which 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7548"> 7548 </A></B>
<P>
motivated the Secretary of State for Asia-Pacific in subsequent 
years and before then are alive and well today.
<P>
	With respect to the situation in China it was on June 4 of this 
year that Premier Li Peng, on the 5th anniversary of the killings 
in Tiananmen Square, chose to implement harsh new regulations 
clamping down even further with respect to human rights.
<P>
	There has been a crackdown on labour dissidents. The 
situation in Tibet is very serious. We know for example that 
China has recently banned the display of pictures of the Dalai 
Lama, continued its nuclear testing, continued its arms sales to 
repressive regimes and, most seriously, continued its inhumane 
policy of population transfer. There continues to be brutal 
repression of Buddhist nuns and monks in Tibet.
<P>
<B>(2000) </B>
<P>
	With respect to the issue in East Timor, the human rights 
abuses there are also very serious. I would urge the government 
to call for an end to government funding for promotion of trade 
with Indonesia, to support the international arms embargo, to 
call for the release of Xanana Gusmao and all East Timorese 
political prisoners, to support self-determination for East Timor 
as the Prime Minister did in his letter of December 1991.
<P>
	In closing I hope as well that the government will reiterate our 
concern to the Chinese government about the importance of 
democracy, freedom of expression and the rule of law for Hong 
Kong as well, as the transition on July 1, 1997 is coming up in 
the very near future.
<P>
	There will be a large banquet in Beijing in the near future. I 
hope that our government will recognize that in addition to 
promoting trade we must speak out forcefully for human rights 
and democracy. We must call for the immediate release of Wei 
Jingsheng. Certainly we must do everything we can to promote 
those values of human rights and democracy that are so 
important and so profound both in Canada and in Asia.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Raymond Chan (Secretary of State (Asia-Pacific), 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the respect for human rights in China 
remains an important objective of our bilateral and multilateral 
agenda. Bilaterally we capitalize on every opportunity to remind 
the Chinese government at high levels of our concerns. We are 
pursuing the development of a serious dialogue about these 
concerns through diplomatic channels.
<P>
	We will continue to pursue human rights issues in multilateral 
organizations, including a dialogue on these concerns with 
Chinese representatives. At the Commission on Human Rights 
in Geneva, which took place from January to March of this year, 
Canada co-sponsored a draft resolution on human rights in 
China.
<P>
	The resolution expressed concern over continuing reports of 
violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, including 
torture, severe restrictions on the rights of freedom of 
expression, religion, assembly, association and to a fair trial. It 
called on China to take further measures to ensure the full 
observance of all human rights, including the rights of women.
<P>
	Also, we have to recognize that there are fundamental 
elements that need to be strengthened in China for it to develop 
into an open, modern state that respects human rights. Therefore 
at a time when China is going through an extensive 
liberalization period, we support innovative means to bring 
about change to the Chinese system.
<P>
	We will accomplish this goal by supporting activities in areas 
where we believe China is susceptible to influence. We will be 
undertaking a number of new co-operative projects to assist the 
People's Republic of China in its efforts to reform its legal and 
judicial structure, and in its efforts to build up its human 
resource development sector.
<P>
	Trade, economic development and human rights are mutually 
reinforcing. A China open to the world can only be good for its 
people, both economically and politically, and will further the 
cause of respect for human rights.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CustomsBrokers">Customs Brokers</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I recently 
asked the revenue minister in this House two questions 
concerning the new regulations on the collection of import 
duties and taxes that will come into effect on January 16, 1995.
<P>
	In a document signed by the Deputy Minister of Revenue 
Canada, Customs, Excise and Taxation, after a long preamble 
trying to justify the measure and make importers feel safer, the 
department unilaterally decides to increase the bond required of 
importers to 100 per cent of their monthly instalments, up to a 
maximum of $10 million. The reason behind this change is the 
losses sustained by the government because customs brokers or 
importers were no longer able to pay their instalments.
<P>
<B>(2005) </B>
<P>
	For now, but for a short time only, the requirement is 35 per 
cent of the first $200,000 and 17.5 per cent of the next $1.8 
million, up to a maximum bond of $2 million.
<P>
	This bond can take the form of cash, Treasury bills, a letter of 
endorsement from a bank or a bond issued by the government.
<P>
	Under the Customs Act, the importer is ultimately responsible 
for paying the duties and taxes. In Canada, these duties and taxes 
amount to about $11.5 billion a year, most of which is collected 
by customs brokers at no cost to the government.
<P>
	A manufacturer who wants to import a given quantity of 
materials or products can import them himself. Use of a customs 
broker is optional, not required.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7549"> 7549 </A></B>
<P>
	In the Canadian importers' magazine for October 5, they raise 
real objections to the increase in security demanded. This 
increase would force them to freeze assets, most of which are 
used to secure their working capital.
<P>
	The conclusion of the industry committee's report on 
financing small business is that the lack of financing for small 
business is the fault of everyone except the government. It 
makes no sense.
<P>
	Furthermore, I learned today that some very big importers 
like GM, Chrysler and Honda strongly refuse to provide such 
security and that they are negotiating with the Department of 
National Revenue to obtain a review of this policy. They are 
negotiating with the big ones, but crushing the little guys.
<P>
	Is an importer or a very large customs broker with remittances 
of $250 million a month, who secures only $10 million of that, 
not favoured by this measure compared to a very small broker 
who must secure 100 per cent of his monthly remittances? Is 
favoritism not being shown, at the expense of the smaller 
operators? The government says that it is ready to encourage 
small business, but when the time comes to keep its word, it 
backs down.
<P>
	I would like to have an explanation of this.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the department has experienced a 
significant number of defaults by customs brokers in the past 
two years where security was inadequate to cover the defaults. 
Therefore, to protect the Crown and importers a security 
increase was deemed essential.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Importers remain fully liable for payment of duties and taxes 
under the Customs Act regardless of any arrangement with the 
customs broker to act on their behalf. In the case of defaults by 
customs brokers, importers who have already delivered 
payment of their duties and taxes to the customs brokers are 
required to pay the unsecured portion of the total amount a 
second time directly to the department.
<P>
	On the basis of consultations, it was decided that the new 
security level would be equal to 100 per cent of the average 
monthly K84 invoice up to a maximum of $10 million.
<P>
	The $10 million ceiling applies regardless of whether the 
security is posted by importers or by customs brokers on behalf 
of its clients.
<P>
	The ceiling was established because the surety industry 
advised that there is not sufficient security available in Canada 
to guarantee the total liability that the brokerage community 
carries in any given month.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	History has shown that most of the difficulties have arisen 
from the small to medium sized brokers whereas larger brokers 
have not shown any evidence of being a risk. Therefore, it is 
essential that the higher risk group be covered to 100 per cent.
<P>
	I should also mention that the Canadian Society of Customs 
Brokers has negotiated a master bond with a surety company 
which will be available to its members. This should greatly 
facilitate companies being able to acquire the necessary 
security.
<P>
	The surety company underwriting the Canadian Society of 
Customs Brokers' master bond has indicated that, under the new 
security regime, it will cover the 80 companies which they 
currently secure.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ETHICS">ETHICS</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I recently asked the Prime Minister a question 
concerning ethics and the role of his private ethics counsellor. 
His answer was both evasive and unsatisfactory. His answer and 
his attitude to the whole integrity and accountability issue 
contravene what was said in the Liberal red book.
<P>
	The government seems to have a very selective memory when 
it concerns the contents of its red book and its election promises. 
If the government's promises happen to coincide with what it is 
doing today, then government members quote from it. If they 
have changed their minds or if the promises are inconvenient, 
then the government forgets what it said one year ago.
<P>
	Let me refresh their memories about what they said about 
integrity and ethics. On page 92 of the red document, it says: 
``Open government will be the watchword of the Liberal 
program''. Why then are they so secretive about the actions, 
responsibilities and activities of the ethics counsellor? Page 95 
of the red book continues: ``A Liberal government will appoint 
an independent ethics counsellor. The ethics counsellor will be 
appointed after consultation with the leaders of all parties in the 
House of Commons and will report directly to Parliament''.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has tried to make a virtue of the fact that 
the ethics counsellor reports directly to him and not to 
Parliament. He has said repeatedly that the counsellor's role is 
to be the private advisor to the Prime Minister. This represents a 
clear break of a very specific election promise. This should not 
be the action of a government that is trying to restore integrity 
and reassure cynical Canadians.
<P>
	If the ethics counsellor is not made accountable to the House 
of Commons, then he is nothing more than a lapdog and a 
government yes man. It is clear that the role of Mr. Wilson is not 
to ensure any sort of ethical standard for the government. It is 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7550"> 7550 </A></B>
<P>
obvious to all  Canadians that the position of an ethics 
counsellor was created to give the impression of ethics to the 
public. This is old style politics and it is a shameful facade.
<P>
	Canadians are asking: What about integrity and ethics? The 
government's answer is to point to the ethics counsellor who it 
keeps locked away in a box until needed in the hopes that this 
will fool the public. A more appropriate title for Mr. Wilson 
would be the government's ethics spin doctor.
<P>
	Throughout this whole affair concerning the inappropriate 
actions of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, the Prime Minister 
has been evasive and inconstant. Parliament is still unaware of 
when the ethics counsellor was contacted, by whom, what his 
advice was and whether or not it was followed.
<P>
	I challenge the government to do the honourable thing and 
publicize the correspondence with the ethics counsellor as it 
concerns the scandal with the Minister of Canadian Heritage. If 
there has been no formal correspondence between the Prime 
Minister and Mr. Wilson, then that too is unacceptable.
<P>
	The Prime Minister seems unclear whether he considers the 
minister's actions unacceptable. This is understandable since he 
had problems with ministerial conduct in the past. In 1971 when 
the Prime Minister was Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development he created quite a bit of controversy by contacting 
a superior court judge about a case being ruled upon.
<P>
	In closing, this government is no stranger to unethical 
behaviour and inappropriate actions. In their own red book the 
Liberals compared their actions to those of the previous 
Conservative government.
<P>
	Does this government realize it is setting a very low standard 
for ethical conduct and is failing to even meet that?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very surprised that the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminister would use expressions such as 
scandal and so on to describe the situation that has occurred.
<P>
	He knows perfectly well that his comments are inappropriate 
and grossly exaggerated. But of course he is trying to appeal to 
an audience that the Reform Party traditionally appeals to, 
claiming the usual virtue that the NDP used to claim in this 
House but even they have abandoned this pretence.
<P>
	The hon. member knows perfectly well that what the 
government has done in this case is entirely in conformity with 
the red book. When he quoted from the red book he omitted to 
mention the fact that the references he made and the quotations 
he cited from the book were taken from a section dealing with 
the obligation of lobbyists to disclose certain facts to 
Parliament.
<P>
	We talked about openness in government in connection with 
lobbyists because we were concerned that in the case of the 
previous government there were dealings going on between 
lobbyists and members of Parliament and members of cabinet 
that were not open to public scrutiny. We decided that should be 
opened up and to that end we have introduced Bill C-43 to 
amend the Lobbyists Registration Act, which bill is currently 
before a committee as the hon. member knows perfectly well.
<P>
	Under Bill C-43 the ethics counsellor is available to advise 
not just the Prime Minister but also to make certain statements 
to Parliament. He is given independent powers with respect to 
the lobbying industry. If there are grounds to believe there has 
been a breach of the lobbyists' code of conduct the ethics 
counsellor could decide to investigate and the report on the 
investigation would then be reported to Parliament.
<P>
	Also under Bill C-43 the ethics counsellor must report to 
Parliament annually on the administration of the legislation 
regarding lobbying.
<P>
	The hon. member knows perfectly well that is all contained in 
the draft bill. If the member had been responsible in making his 
comments he would have pointed that out. He knows that is the 
situation.
<P>
	In fact the Prime Minister has accepted full responsibility for 
the actions of the Minister of Canadian Heritage in this case and 
quite properly so. He described the minister's actions as an 
honest mistake that was corrected by the minister at the earliest 
opportunity.
<P>
	I do not understand why the hon. member will not accept that 
explanation. To me it is a reasonable one. As the Prime Minister 
said in the House in question period yesterday, the buck stops 
here. He is taking responsibility and no ethics counsellor can 
take that responsibility away from the Prime Minister of Canada 
who is ultimately responsible to this House.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Under Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly the House now stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 2 p.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 8.16 p.m.)
