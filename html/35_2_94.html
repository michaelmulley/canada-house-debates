	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Treasury Board and 
Minister responsible for Infrastructure, Lib.): </B>Madam Speaker, 
honourable members, ladies and gentlemen, I have the honour 
today of tabling ``Getting Government Right: Improving Results 
Measurement and Accountability''. This is the second annual 
report of the President of the Treasury Board, a report that focuses 
on results, performance and accountability.
<P>
	My report does not stop at listing the key reviews and their 
objectives, but also shows what Canadians have a right to expect 
for their tax dollars.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This report states what 16 government departments and agencies 
expect from their activities. We have devised a new format that 
makes this report easy to read. Our new approach is based squarely 
on program review decisions and departments' business plans. This 
is the first time the government has compiled this information in 
one document.
<P>
	I am also tabling today 16 departmental performance reports. 
These pilot documents demonstrate our new results based way of 
managing in the public sector. They will help Canadians 
understand the objectives of each department and agency as well as 
the progress made in meeting those objectives.
<P>
	Federal departments and agencies must from now on meet three 
requirements: first, identify and communicate the results expected; 
second, improve the measurement of these results; and, third, 
improve the way they report to Parliament.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The documents I am tabling today show that we are honouring 
our commitment to constantly improve the information we give to 
Parliament and to Canadians, in a way that is open and transparent. 
Having the right information at the right time will allow Parliament 
to perform its work better. Improving the quality of information 
will ensure better informed discussions and debates within 
government, in this House, and among Canadians. The quality of 
these debates will, in turn, lead to better decisions, improved 
accountability and, ultimately, better government.
<P>
	I would like at this point to draw attention to the untiring work of 
the hon. member for St. Boniface, who has led parliamentarians in 
defining their needs for information on expenditure management. 
With his help, we have developed documents that are more concise, 
more clear, and focused on results.
<P>
	These reports are an important step in the process of planning for 
the next fiscal year.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	If the pilot documents meet our expectations, we plan to seek the 
permission of the House to require all departments and agencies to 
table separate reports on planning in the spring and on performance 
in the fall.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5918"> 5918 </A></B>
<P>
	I think that the efforts of members of the government to 
objectively assess how well they met their commitments will be 
encouraging to everyone.
<P>
	Focusing our attention on results and demonstrating our 
achievements are an important step in our efforts to get government 
right.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would invite the minister to continue along the path he 
has begun toward more accountability and greater transparency in 
public administration. In particular, I would invite him to ensure 
that members of Parliament and ministers also have an obligation 
of accountability and transparency.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	I would also invite him to keep the promises made by the Liberal 
government about revitalizing democracy. Too often in the past 
three years the impression has been that the public service and the 
federal administration are often being led by the mandarins, that 
the mandarins are often telling the ministers what to do, and the 
ministers are letting themselves be pushed around by these 
mandarins.
<P>
	Revitalizing democracy, as the Liberals so well presented it 
during the last electoral campaign, means more transparency in the 
work of committees. This was not been the case in connection with 
the family trusts, particularly the transfer to the United States of 
two billion dollars, in which there was no transparency whatsoever, 
but rather a systematic camouflage operation. I think there is a 
good deal to be done in this area.
<P>
	The question of revitalization of democracy, accountability and 
transparency raises the whole question of political party funding. 
We can boast of having a grassroots funding structure, but the 
major federal parties do not have that.
<P>
	I would therefore invite the minister to continue along the path 
on which he has begun, so that accountability, transparency and 
revitalization of democracy will be made concrete, rather than 
remaining mere empty promises.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, the work described by the minister stems from the 
recommendations of the sixth report of the public accounts 
committee tabled in March 1994.
<P>
	There is no doubt that the President of the Treasury Board has 
taken his responsibility to report to Parliament very seriously. We 
now have several detailed documents from Treasury Board which 
include the main estimates, the annual report on review and these 
new performance reports.
<P>
	It is now up to parliamentarians to do their job and review these 
documents to see what is missing and what can be improved. The 
Treasury Board Secretariat, along with the public accounts and the 
auditor general, have also recognized the need to improve 
measurement of results and to improve accountability in the public 
sector.
<P>
	I applaud the recognition but in reviewing these documents I 
note that we still have a long way to go. There is one question to 
ask at the end of the day after reading these reports. Has the system 
been improved and will these reports assist in reviewing and 
improving government policy? I do not feel this question has been 
answered.
<P>
	Last year Treasury Board reviewed 19 priorities or key 
government programs. I do not dispute the fact that all 19 programs 
were reviewed. Many of them were reviewed by standing or special 
committees. After the review, have the necessary steps been taken 
to improve the programs or to change the way the services are 
delivered? Let me offer four examples.
<P>
	Last year Treasury Board said that the government reviewed the 
GST, family trusts, the infrastructure program and TAGS, the 
Atlantic groundfish strategy. What has happened as a result of the 
review? With the GST we note that the government has initiated 
harmonization which includes four provinces, but not abolition. 
The answer is to hide the GST in the sticker price which is not a 
very creative solution.
<P>
	The review has taken place on family trusts but the loophole is 
still open. Infrastructure: $85,000 per job has been spent and the 
unemployment rate is still 9.9 per cent. The youth unemployment 
rate is still double that. There has not been a very creative response.
<P>
	What have we learned about the TAGS program? It is in as bad if 
not worse shape. Even those who have received the benefits of this 
program are extremely unhappy and the Pacific fishery is still in a 
terrible situation.
<P>
	I do not believe we have made progress in these programs. The 
review has been interesting but the outcomes have not illustrated 
any improvements in the government's decision making process. 
Please do not get me wrong. I can understand that quantum leaps 
are virtually impossible. However, one critical attribute of a well 
performing government organization is that it seeks optimum 
performance. It will not settle for second best.
<P>
	In the review of the GST, family trusts, infrastructure and TAGS 
there are no descriptions of optimum performance. We have no 
benchmarks to tell us whether or not the programs are performing 
well or meeting the needs they were created to meet. Let me 
illustrate my concerns with something more concrete.
<P>
	One of the so-called faults of a public institution is that there is 
no bottom line, no hard data, but in some cases this is not true. Last 
month the auditor general reported on the quality of service in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5919"> 5919 </A></B>
<P>
public sector. He found that 30 million phone calls to government 
departments went unanswered, 20 million in Revenue Canada 
alone. This figure seems like a concrete starting point. Revenue 
Canada is largely a service department. Finance sets most of our 
tax policy.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	In looking at the performance report submitted by Revenue 
Canada, the problem is mentioned which is a start. However, no 
concrete plans are put forward to solve the problem. No 
benchmarks are given to Parliament to help us eventually measure 
the success or failure to deal with the problem.
<P>
	The department says that Revenue Canada is aware that some 
clients have had difficulty getting through by telephone. The first 
step is to address the problem, which has been done. But where is 
the progress? Where is the improvement? Meanwhile the 
department continues to explore further opportunities for 
redesigning and improving telephone systems.
<P>
	This explanation would not fly at a board of directors meeting. 
The CEO would ask for goals, plans and back-up plans. Once again 
the Reform Party has asked the government to clarify its goals. Are 
we trying to improve our programs or are we trying to explain away 
our problems?

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGRICULTURALMARKETINGPROGRAMSACT">AGRICULTURAL MARKETING PROGRAMS ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 30, consideration of Bill C-34, 
an act to establish programs for the marketing of agricultural 
products, to repeal the Agricultural Products Board Act, the 
Agricultural Products Cooperative Marketing Act, the Advance 
Payments for Crops Act and the Prairie Grain Advance Payments 
Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, as 
reported (with amendment) from the committee; and of motions in 
Group No. 1.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak to Bill C-34 and to have the 
opportunity to briefly discuss the state of this country's agricultural 
sector.
<P>
	First let me address the matter of Bill C-34. Its basic objectives 
are fairly admirable. It is supposed to streamline, to clarify, to 
modernize, to incorporate. These modern day management 
terminologies are rather appealing as debt and taxes rise and 
services degenerate.
<P>
	This bill seeks to combine four separate acts and an agricultural 
program into one more concise piece of legislation. I am very much 
in favour of reducing administration costs and bureaucratic 
entanglements. The reduction of bureaucracy at any level is 
something that the Reform Party has been strongly advocating ever 
since the party's inception.
<P>
	I am also in favour of making this Parliament more democratic. 
Bill C-34 exemplifies how the Liberals,  despite red book promises 
to allow all MPs a greater role in drafting legislation, are 
continuing to ram through legislation without proper consultation 
from Canadians and their elected representatives in this House.
<P>
	Each and every amendment to Bill C-34 proposed by the Reform 
Party was turned down by the Liberal dominated agriculture 
committee. It is my hope that we will have better luck with these 
amendments now that they are in the House, but I will not hold my 
breath.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	The point I want to make today is that I do not believe the 
farmers who might be watching the debate are really all that 
concerned about Bill C-34. The farmers in my riding of Prince 
George-Peace River are struggling to bring in their crops. It is 
winter up there now. I was home last weekend and saw that things 
are disastrous, to say the least.
<P>
	I spoke with the crop insurance people in Fort St. John which is 
my hometown. They were telling me that in the B.C. Peace region 
probably around 25 per cent of the crops on average have been 
harvested. That would vary in some areas.
<P>
	Last weekend I travelled to the small farming community of 
Buick Creek which is north of Fort St. John. The farmers up there 
were telling me that they have hardly turned a wheel. The land is 
just a quagmire and they are lucky if they can get a load or two. 
Obviously, less than 10 per cent has been harvested in that area. 
Things do not look good.
<P>
	As well, when I was speaking with the department of agriculture 
representatives, specifically Bill Greenhalgh of the provincial crop 
insurance branch, he informed me that only about 21 per cent of 
this year's crop is covered by crop insurance. That is about 80,000 
acres out of roughly 384,000 acres.
<P>
	I urge the federal minister of agriculture to join with his 
counterpart in British Columbia and tour the B.C. Peace region. He 
should see the state that the crop is in himself. I cannot emphasize 
this too strongly. He should go there to meet with farm groups and 
talk to the individuals involved.
<P>
	In consultation with my colleague from the Alberta riding of 
Peace River I know that things are bad there as well. When it comes 
to weather, the border between the provinces does not make a 
difference. Although they are a little more advanced in the amount 
of crop they have harvested in the Grand Prairie and Peace River 
regions, there are pockets throughout the Peace River region which 
have virtually harvested no crop. It will indeed be a very sad 
Christmas for a lot of farm families in the Peace River country this 
year.
<P>
	The farmers were hopeful because of the improvement in grain 
prices over the last few years and the amount of rainfall they had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5921"> 5921 </A></B>
<P>
this summer. It looked like it was going to be a good crop. 
However, when the rains continued into the harvest season, the 
fields turned into quagmires. The farmers could not get their 
equipment on the land in some areas. Harvest conditions were 
non-existent. They would be lucky to have one day out of 10 when 
they could go out in the fields with their combines.
<P>
	Farmers have paid a horrific price to try to get the little bit of 
crop off that they have. It will be years before they will see the true 
cost in damage to equipment and land. I want to re-emphasize that 
government representatives should be travelling to the Peace River 
country to see firsthand what the situation is.
<P>
	The second issue I want to raise on behalf of the farmers of our 
area is that I wrote to the former Minister of Transport almost a 
year ago raising the issue of rail shipping costs. There are two port 
destinations to which Peace region farmers can ship their product 
by rail, either Vancouver or Prince Rupert.
<P>
	The port of Prince Rupert is severely underutilized, even though 
it has facilities superior to the port of Vancouver in many respects. 
It is ice free 12 months of the year and has a better berthing 
capacity. That means a ship can be completely loaded at the 
terminal, whereas in Vancouver because of water depth, a ship can 
only be partially loaded at one terminal and then it must be moved 
to another to be topped up. More important, Prince Rupert is a day 
and a half shorter to grain export markets on the Pacific rim.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Finally, I received a reply last spring from the present Minister 
of Transport concerning the difference in the cost of rail transport 
between the port of Prince Rupert and the port of Vancouver. In that 
letter he stated that the problem of rail rates is a commercial matter 
between the affected parties, namely the shippers and the two 
railways and that it is government policy not to intervene in such 
business decisions.
<P>
	A month later, following continued protest, the transport 
minister finally acknowledged the gravity of the situation and 
initiated the northwest transportation corridor task force. 
Ironically, this task force was not going to hold any hearings in the 
Peace River country until the mayor of Dawson Creek and I made 
our concerns known. Two meetings have now been scheduled for 
early next month in Fort St. John and Dawson Creek so the farmers 
in the area can make their concerns known to the northwest 
transportation corridor task force.
<P>
	It really comes down to the issue of the difference between the 
rail rates. I am told that even with some recent changes, it still costs 
$3.81 more per tonne to ship grain to Prince Rupert than to 
Vancouver even though the distances are virtually the same. It used 
to cost $8.08 more because of the switching charges B.C. Rail is  
charged in Prince George to go on to CN track. I hope that issue 
will be properly addressed.
<P>
	In the time I have left, I would like to briefly touch on one other 
issue, the shortage of rail cars in the Peace River country. Despite 
the fact that we do not have much crop off, ironically we cannot get 
enough rail cars to ship the crop that is there. My office spoke with 
Mr. Mike Burton, an elevator agent in Fort St. John for Cargill, who 
said that he had orders for 70 cars and could only get 17 the other 
day.
<P>
	I would suggest that Peace River farmers have been well 
accustomed, to use an old farm saying, to sucking the hind teat, 
when it comes to agricultural services and attention by the 
government. We really do not believe it is the right way to go and 
we would like to see the government pay more attention to the 
Peace River country and our farming needs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Guy Chrétien (Frontenac, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, 
before speaking on the motion put forward by my hon. colleague 
from Kindersley-Lloydminster, I would like to comment on the 
confusion that seemed to exist among the hon. member's 
colleagues in the Reform Party reflecting in essence his party's 
view of the thrust to be given the many legislative changes on 
agriculture.
<P>
	It is disappointing to see the reluctance of the Reform Party and 
especially the ideological barriers colouring its rather limited 
contribution to the ongoing debate in the Quebec and Canadian 
agricultural sector.
<P>
	Now, moving to serious matters, to Bill C-34. While the motion 
before us today was amended a number of times in the past few 
days, it still contains elements that run counter to the concern the 
government must have for farm producers.
<P>
	We are aware of the fact that Bill C-34 involves developing 
programs for the marketing of agricultural products, which means 
having products to market, which provide a profit for producers, at 
a fair price to consumers. This means, for the producers, having 
more effective tools to recover the costs associated with operating a 
farm.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	The amendment put forward by my hon. colleague from the third 
party removes two of the elements that form the very basis for this 
bill. It would eliminate the government's role as regulator of the 
agricultural market as set in clause 31 of the bill and ensure 
impunity in the case of refusal to provide information leading to a 
better analysis process in order to properly define the principles 
underlying clause 31.
<P>
	I get the impression that, through Bill C-34, my hon. colleague is 
trying set a kind of precedent in order to apply the principle in the 
debate on restructuring the Canadian Wheat Board. I must tell my 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5922"> 5922 </A></B>
<P>
hon. colleague from the Reform Party, however, that any such 
legislative change can in no way apply to the Canadian Wheat 
Board because of its status and prerogatives. In this context, what 
the hon. member is asking in his motion is to limit the important 
contribution of the government in stabilizing costs in the agri-food 
sector.
<P>
	Concretely, this enables the government to maintain the price of 
a given product at a certain level in the event of crop failure or, 
conversely, when harvest is too good and plentiful.
<P>
	To illustrate the problem, we could take the example of the 1988 
maple syrup production. You may recall that, in 1988, record 
amounts of maple syrup were produced. Consequently, maple 
syrup producers found themselves with barrels of grade A1 and 
even AA syrup that they could not sell even for less than a basic 
price, to at least cover their operation costs. In the case of maple 
syrup, the government had decided to support prices by buying up 
maple syrup surpluses from producers, and thus avoid a price drop. 
Stocks were stored, to be put on the market later, at a time of 
relative shortage, or in a year when production would be much 
more limited. This is why the price of maple syrup fluctuates very 
little from year to year. The Reform member seems not to know 
this basic economic rule.
<P>
	Based on the same approach, the second motion of the Reform 
member seeks to ensure impunity for an action preventing the 
government from obtaining information that might be necessary to 
fulfil its role of price stabilizer. Obviously, and you will agree with 
me, this way of thinking is totally unacceptable, since it defeats 
government efforts to make things better for farmers.
<P>
	The member's logic is even more flawed when you consider the 
high level of confidentiality governing this type of government 
intervention. From an administrative point of view, no one has any 
business knowing someone's personal situation, since the 
substance of this bill is to take action for the good of farm 
operators, based on a global and collective vision.
<P>
	Before concluding, I remind the House that Bloc Quebecois 
members were and continue to be in agreement with the general 
principle of Bill C-34. However, we strongly oppose the 
amendment proposed by the hon. member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. We care too much about farmers, given 
their role, to risk a lowering of their industry's standards of 
operation.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I ask Reformers to reconsider their opinion and 
their position, for the good of consumers and farm producers.
<P>
	Should there be a very bad crop, prices could increase unduly 
and eliminate a number of farmers. In three, four or five years, 
there could be a shortage of farmers, or else prices could remain 
unusually high.
<P>
	For the good of the general public and of farmers, consumers and 
processors, it is important to support the substance of Bill C-34 and 
to oppose the two amendments proposed by the Reform member.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, you have 
played a little trick on me, because you told me there would be a 
Reform Party member going ahead of me. I therefore had 10 
minutes to prepare, but no matter, I will give my speech anyway.
<P>
	As you know, the riding of Lotbinière, which I have the great 
honour to represent, is one of the largest agricultural ridings in 
Quebec. It is therefore with great interest and a sense of duty, 
Madam Speaker and dear colleagues, that I rise today to speak to 
Bill C-34, the Agricultural Marketing Programs Act.
<P>
	First of all, I am pleased to note that the bill tabled is intended to 
combine four acts into a single act that provides support for the 
marketing of agricultural products.
<P>
	This bill affects the Advance Payments for Crops Act, the Prairie 
Grain Advance Payments Act, the Agricultural Products 
Cooperative Marketing Act and the Agricultural Products Board 
Act. It also takes in the Cash Flow Enhancement Program.
<P>
	My party, the Bloc Quebecois, is generally in favour of the 
objectives of Bill C-34, because it is essentially consistent with 
what the industry is calling for and seems more in line with our 
values and agricultural development models in the province of 
Quebec.
<P>
	Nonetheless, I would point out an important budgeting 
inconsistency. If clauses 25 and 30 are financial in nature, the 
government hopes to be able to pay farmers under the advance 
payments program and the price pooling program.
<P>
	We have learned that $40 million a year for three years have 
been set aside under the advance payments program. In other 
words, there should be $120 million after three years. Where it all 
goes badly wrong is when Agriculture and Agri-Food starts to take 
money for marketing programs out of the envelope reserved for the 
income protection program.
<P>
	This transfer, this misappropriation frankly, of envelope funds 
means an equivalent reduction in the money available for 
protecting the incomes of farmers. By acting in this manner, the 
federal government is unfortunately once again cutting into 
Quebec's share.
<P>
	Like it or not, Quebec's share of income protection programs for 
farmers is already, yes already, lower than what it is entitled to, 
given the relative weight of agriculture for Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	There is a distinct feeling that once again, Quebec gets the short 
end of the stick. It is the same old story: Quebec does not get its fair 
share, on a per capita basis.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5923"> 5923 </A></B>
<P>
	You will remember what my colleague, the hon. member for 
Laurier-Sainte-Marie, said in the House last week when he 
named various sectors in which Quebec did not receive its fair 
share.
<P>
	Remember the case of raw milk cheese, where more than 50 per 
cent of the producers were from Quebec. A ban on this product can 
have a very serious impact on Quebec producers. My point is that 
when the government introduces measures, as in the case of raw 
milk cheese, it often does so at the expense of Quebecers.
<P>
	To get back to the bill on agricultural marketing, we should insist 
that the budget for advance payments programs not be taken out of 
the budget for income protection programs. I think that is a major 
irritant for farmers in Quebec.
<P>
	When that happens, the farms in my riding and throughout 
Quebec will at least be treated fairly under this program.
<P>
	The budget envelope for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 
income protection programs in 1997-98 is $600 million. This 
represents a drop of $250 million or 30 per cent from the prebudget 
level of $850 million. If the federal government goes ahead and 
siphons off funds from the budget for income protection programs, 
$120 million will have been taken out of this envelope over a 
period of three years.
<P>
	To be perfectly frank, it is unconscionable to use part of the 
budget for protection of farm incomes to finance the advance 
payments program which, I may remind the House, is a program 
for the marketing of agricultural products. What connection is 
there between the advance payments program and income 
protection programs? None at all.
<P>
	When the Minister of Finance tables his budget, does he do so 
fully intending to deceive taxpayers in Canada and Quebec? Should 
the budget not do what it is supposed to do? That would make 
sense. However, if we follow the logic of this government, should 
we infer that the existing figures do not mean a thing since they no 
longer correspond to the envelope they were supposed to cover? I 
am sorry but this is outrageous.
<P>
	The budget for the income protection program is already 
inadequate, so there is certainly no reason to take money out of this 
budget, unless the government wants to penalize Quebec farmers. 
If the federal government, through the Department of Agriculture 
and Agri-Food, takes money set aside for income protection 
programs to finance the advance payments program, which is a 
program for marketing agricultural products, why did it not make 
those changes right now?
<P>
	First of all, it would take real political will to change the 
situation and ensure that the money used for advance payments 
comes directly out of the funds set aside for the agricultural 
products marketing programs. I think the government should invest 
more money in the budget for  marketing programs and stop cutting 
and siphoning off funds from one budget envelope to another. The 
solution is simple, but it is also vitally important.
<P>
	As a result, in the future, the incomes of farmers in Lotbinière 
and throughout Quebec would be better protected. They could also 
take $120 million from the budget allocated to income protection 
plans, but we would not be any better off than today in that there 
would be less money for Quebec farmers in this area and 
distribution would be even more inequitable for the other nine 
provinces in the Canadian federation.
<P>
	Another possibility mentioned by some would be for the 
government to inject new money into programs aimed at marketing 
agricultural products and transfer money from the budget 
earmarked for income protection programs.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	In my opinion, this is a partly acceptable solution. That is why 
my party, the Bloc Quebecois, is asking the federal government to 
make the changes required to correct the situation and ensure that 
Quebec farmers are treated fairly.
<P>
	In clear, simple terms, we are asking the government to take the 
money for the advance payments from the budget set aside for 
income protection programs. This is a major irritant for 
agricultural producers in Quebec, including, of course, those in my 
riding of Lotbinière.
<P>
	The government tells us this bill will have no impact on Quebec 
producers receiving advance payments, except that it would be 
much harsher on those who do not repay their advance payments. 
We can only conclude that this bill will have a much bigger impact 
on Quebec producers.
<P>
	Furthermore, with its new eligibility rules, Bill C-34 would 
exclude any kind of co-operative marketing. In fact, one of the 
eligibility requirements for producers must be rejected, especially 
the one about their being able to decide when to sell their crops. 
This requirement would exclude crops marketed co-operatively. 
One of those most affected would be the VEGCO Group of Quebec.
<P>
	In closing, I agree that the federal government should use 
taxpayers' money efficiently by rationalizing its programs so that 
farmers receive the same benefits and meet the same obligations. 
But there is a major inconsistency in the way the budget is 
allocated and, if the government were left to itself, it would reduce 
Quebec's share of income protection programs even further.
<P>
	I feel I have a duty to defend the interests of the farmers in my 
riding of Lotbinière and those of Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I find it interesting to have the  opportunity to 
speak on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5924"> 5924 </A></B>
<P>
the act to establish programs for the marketing of agricultural 
products. First of all, I think it is important, especially in light of 
the amendments proposed by the Reform Party, to realize that the 
basic principle that matters here is that agriculture is a unique and 
very different industry, and that it has to be dealt with as such.
<P>
	A well targeted approach must be used so as to not do this 
industry a disservice in trying to put it on the same playing field as 
other industries. Agriculture, as you know, is dependent on the 
weather, markets, all kinds of factors that are intangible and 
difficult to predict.
<P>
	The Reform motion seeks to delete the clause enabling the 
minister to buy, sell or import agricultural products so that prices 
will be more stable, thereby improving marketing conditions. My 
reaction, after meeting with farm producers in my riding over the 
summer, is that the Reform Party is displaying a rather blatant 
ignorance of several industrial sectors. There are many areas of the 
agricultural industry where such measures are required.
<P>
	There are indeed many areas, be it maple syrup, potato or milk 
production, where the government must have a handle to regulate 
the market. Otherwise, the situation will revert to what it was 15 or 
20 years ago. One year, producers make good money, but the next 
year their profits drop and the operation has to close down. This is 
not good for anyone involved, neither for the family business nor 
for the economy at large.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	It is imperative that this amendment be defeated so that the 
minister may continue to exercise a regulating role, ensuring some 
stability for our economy and our agricultural industry. Just 
compare the typical farm producer, in Quebec and Canada to their 
counterpart in the U.S., where they practice this kind of extreme 
competition without any government involvement, and you will 
see that the economic situation of American producers is definitely 
not as good.
<P>
	American farmers are much more dependent on economic 
cycles. By comparison, in Quebec and in Canada, we have 
managed to develop an agriculture which, although it is not easy 
and requires a lot of effort and sacrifices on the part of farmers, 
allows them, through stabilization policies, to carry on their 
operations. Quebec was a pioneer in this regard. It has been 
periodically and systematically involved, to provide good 
conditions to its farmers and make sure that succeeding generations 
would take over farming operations.
<P>
	Amendments such as the one proposed today by the Reform 
Party would also have the effect, in the medium term, of creating a 
great deal of uncertainty about agriculture. This is an industry in 
which a bad year, or a surplus that cannot be disposed of, creates a 
serious  problem. People simply cannot invest their life in such an 
industry.
<P>
	The Reform Party should go back into the field. It may not 
represent the same type of farmers as we have in Quebec, but its 
amendment is certainly not very appealing.
<P>
	The other aspect is one that does not necessarily concern our 
farmers, but is nevertheless important from a moral point of view. 
An amendment such as the one proposed by the Reform Party 
would impede international assistance, in that the Canadian 
government would no longer have the means to take action in 
emergency situations around the world, when it is necessary to 
ensure that populations have food in situations of crisis.
<P>
	We have to maintain the image developed over the years by our 
country. It is generally agreed that Canada does a lot at the 
international level. There are many flaws to work on, but the 
general principle must be maintained. Unfortunately, the 
amendment proposed by the Reform Party would not allow us to 
meet that objective.
<P>
	I also want to stress the fact that we must give particular 
attention to small producers. This summer, I met with producers, 
including some from the maple syrup industry. Maple syrup 
production is an industry with big and well-organized chains that 
offer interesting product lines. However, we should promote 
home-made products that could be exported.
<P>
	Obviously, maple syrup is one such product, but if we wanted to 
set up a guaranteed vintage program, for example, like the ones for 
wine and other products, if we wanted to single out our product and 
obtain a higher price because of the quality or special 
characteristics of maple syrup from a particular area, for instance, 
we still have quite a long way to go.
<P>
	Governments are very sensitive to lobbying from groups of well 
organized stakeholders, but the people who can help small rural 
companies to grow must still make a major effort. They must be 
given access to foreign markets, and I hope that a bill such as the 
one we are about to pass will be a help and not a hindrance.
<P>
	In summary, the government must be able to maintain its role of 
protecting the income of farmers. The government must not be 
prevented from buying up surpluses, from taking the necessary 
time. In this connection, we have a very interesting example. A few 
years back, there was a surplus of apples. The federal government 
bought up a large quantity of them and was then able to resell them 
to a company that makes juice. In this case, the producer got his 
price, the government was able to cover its expenses and, in 
addition, the juice was produced in Quebec, in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	This allowance for a regulatory role meant that jobs were 
maintained, production kept up and the link between the person 
doing the processing, producing the apple juice, and his market was 
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5925"> 5925 </A></B>
<P>
also maintained. The market is therefore not disrupted, resulting in 
greater stability for the agricultural economy.
<P>
	This is perhaps what agriculture needs the most. Yes, we have 
good producers, yes, we must adjust in terms of research and 
development. The government has done some things that we did 
not like. We must not, however, lose sight of the important fact that 
if we compare agriculture in our country to that in other countries, 
there are certain advantages that we want to keep. We will not 
improve the situation by creating uncertainty for producers.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois will be voting against the 
Reform Party's amendment.

	The House resumed from October 29 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-49, an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary 
measures in relation to members of certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize and dissolve certain administrative 
tribunals, to reorganize  and dissolve certain federal agencies and 
to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the

<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in the debate today on Bill 
C-49, the Administrative Tribunals (Remedial and Disciplinary 
Measures) Act.
<P>
	Wherever I travel in my constituency or throughout the country I 
speak to people who are terribly cynical. They are not cynical about 
life necessarily, but they are definitely cynical about the political 
process.
<P>
	For example, a couple of weeks ago I met a lady who told me in 
very plain language her estimation of politicians. I was a bit 
surprised at the vociferous nature of her attacks. She said: ``They 
say one thing and do another''. We all know this is not necessarily 
true, or it is not altogether true, but it gives an idea of the cynical 
attitude that exists in our country.
<P>
	The pervasiveness of the cynical attitude begs a major question: 
Why is this so? Why are so many Canadians so cynical about their 
political leaders and the political system? Why are they so angry?
<P>
	One of the biggest reasons I have heard why politicians have 
such a bad reputation is the lavish patronage this government, like 
governments before it, has dished out and still dishes out to its 
party friends.
<P>
	As members of Parliament we want Canadians to have faith in 
their leaders, to feel confident that politicians will do what they say 
they will do fairly and honestly. We need a measure of this trust to 
do our jobs properly in representing our constituents and the 
nation. As legislators we have a role in establishing this positive 
reputation for ourselves simply by doing our jobs well.
<P>
<B>(1105 )</B>
<P>
	For example, we could pass legislation which would eliminate 
partisan appointments to key government positions. That would 
ensure that key appointments would be ratified by an appropriate 
body.
<P>
	Unfortunately Bill C-49 is not that kind of legislation. For that 
reason it should not pass the House of Commons. Bill C-49 allows 
the shameless abuse of patronage to continue. This bill will only 
perpetuate and reinforce the cynical attitude that Canadians already 
have toward their leaders.
<P>
	How does patronage relate to Bill C-49? This bill is supposed to 
be the second legislative step in the government's program to 
streamline the operations of federal agencies, boards and 
commissions. It is also supposed to change the appointment 
process, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5926"> 5926 </A></B>
<P>
reduce the number of governor in council or cabinet appointments, 
more closely manage some agencies and eliminate redundant 
bodies.
<P>
	This bill has an enormous flaw. It does not ensure that 
employment positions to government agencies, tribunals and 
boards are awarded strictly on the merit principle. It allows the 
government to continue to build its legacy of patronage abuse.
<P>
	A moment ago I mentioned that partisan appointments made by 
this government and former governments helped to create the 
cynical attitude Canadians have toward politicians. Patronage 
causes people to think this way for two distinct reasons. First, the 
government broke its word to Canadians regarding patronage 
appointments. The Liberal red book, now called by many 
Canadians the Liberal dead book, promised that a Liberal 
government would make appointments to boards, commissions and 
agencies on the basis of competence, but that has not happened. 
These positions are still granted to the Liberal Party faithful.
<P>
	When Canadians are not told the truth, who can blame them for 
being cynical? Just to give an idea of how blatant the Liberals have 
been in breaking their word, let me read a bit of their patronage 
record.
<P>
	First, there have been 18 partisan appointments to the Senate, the 
institution the Prime Minister said in 1991 should be elected, equal 
and effective. Second, Richard Campbell, a former campaign 
manager, was appointed a director of Marine Atlantic. Third, 
Richard Cashin, a longstanding member of the Liberal Party and 
MP from 1962 to 1965, was appointed a member of the Canadian 
Transport Harvesting Adjustment Board. Fourth, Dorothy Davey, 
wife of former Liberal Senator Keith Davey, was appointed to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. Fifth, Fred Drummie, the 
executive assistant to the Minister of National Defence, was 
appointed to the International Park Commission Board. Sixth, 
Raymond Guay, Liberal MP from 1963 to 1980, was appointed to 
the International Trade Tribunal. Seventh, Roy Heenan, partner in 
former Prime Minister Trudeau's law firm, was appointed to the 
CBC board of directors. Eighth, Ethel Teitelbaum, Pierre Trudeau's 
former executive assistant, was appointed to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. It goes on and on.
<P>
	This Liberal government, after saying it was going to be above 
board with Canadians, after saying it was not going to be like the 
Tories and after saying it was going to make appointments to 
boards and commissions based on merit, not based on loyalty to the 
Liberal Party, has made over 200 patronage appointments. What a 
shame.
<P>
	What is even more shameful is that some Liberal members, point 
blank, support these practices. Last week the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood said: ``I believe in patronage. I have 
always believed in patronage. I am not going to change''. It is no 
wonder Canadians are cynical when there are members of 
Parliament who have this kind of attitude.
<P>
	Patronage appointments create cynical attitudes for a second 
reason. It says to people that the government is  more interested in 
scratching its friends' backs than in protecting the interests of our 
nation and treating every Canadian fairly.
<P>
	For example, there is a serious problem in our justice system. 
Since coming to power the Liberals have appointed lawyers who 
are not competent crown prosecutors. When a judge must depend 
only on the evidence brought to the courtroom by the lawyers and 
the prosecution's presentation of evidence is lacking or faulty, the 
judge still must adjudicate on the basis of the evidence and the law. 
No wonder justice is not done. No wonder the justice system is not 
protecting our citizens from criminals. No wonder people are 
cynical, when the evidence is not properly presented and the judge 
is forced to let people go free without facing the consequences of 
serious criminal activity.
<P>
<B>(1110 )</B>
<P>
	Patronage jeopardizes the interests of Canadians when political 
appointments are made to governing bodies like the National 
Parole Board and the Immigration and Refugee Board. Now even 
these boards are left without the credibility they need to properly 
serve their purposes.
<P>
	By all the criminals released from jail on some form of early 
release in 1995-96, a total of 165 serious crimes were committed. 
These included 15 murders, 15 attempted murders, 22 sexual 
assaults, 21 major assaults and 71 armed robberies.
<P>
	We were told when the National Parole Board released these 
individuals they were not considered risks. Boy, was it wrong. 
Historically people who sit on parole boards have been well paid 
patronage appointees with little or no knowledge of criminal 
justice. Parole board members now must have some background in 
criminology or corrections. But the point is still the same. When 
Liberal cronies with very limited knowledge of the criminal justice 
system are appointed to the National Parole Board, the chance of 
poor decision making increases. Canadians need and deserve 
certainty of safety before the Liberal government looks after its 
party needs.
<P>
	The same case can be made for the Immigration and Refugee 
Board. Many of the 215 appointees to this board are political 
appointees. For example, I found a list printed in the Vancouver 
<I>Sun</I>, October 5, 1995. The list outlines the British Columbia 
Immigration and Refugee Board members and when they were 
appointed. Only nine of the nineteen appointees have any formal 
training or education in immigration law. Immigration and Refugee 
Board members are responsible for hearing the oral testimony of a 
asylum seekers and for determining whether claimants qualify for 
refugee status. When the government appoints its cynical buddies 
and bagmen to the IRB, incompetent decisions are a certainty.
<P>
	In March last year the citizenship and immigration committee 
heard from two former members of the IRB. These men stated that
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5927"> 5927 </A></B>
<P>
at least half their former colleagues did not have the educational 
expertise needed to do their jobs. Let me quote from the testimony 
of one of those witnesses, Mr. Bauer. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I would say, and I think most of my colleagues would have agreed with me, that 
about a quarter of the members of the IRB are incapable of even properly conducting 
a meeting. Even as second members, some of them are a bit embarrassing. I say that 
rather reluctantly, and I do not say it lightly, but I can assure you that it is true. 
Approximately another quarter, with a tremendous amount of training, education, 
coaching and monitoring, might be able to barely get through the process 
single-handedly, although I would think there would be a number of legal and 
procedural problems arising that would cause a great deal of difficulty with the 
board.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We have seen the incompetence described by Mr. Bauer in 
action. For example, on November 12, 1995 the Federal Court of 
Canada had to throw out a refugee board decision that denied a 
woman asylum. This woman was first ordered by her boss to 
submit to sexual assault and then convicted of prostitution. Mr. 
Justice Frederick Gibson who overturned the decision said ``there 
should be a new hearing because the board made legal mistakes and 
overlooked key evidences''.
<P>
	This is a classic example of what happens when patronage 
appointments are made to government boards. We cannot blame 
people for being cynical when we have a government that takes 
care of its friends better than it takes care of the people of our 
refugee and immigration process and those seeking safety of 
Canadians.
<P>
	Patronage not only endangers the safety and interests of 
Canadians, but it treats people unfairly. For example, the electoral 
returning officer in my riding is now a Liberal appointee. The 
person may be able to do the job competently but that is not the 
point. The person who had the job was competent, had done it 
through two elections but was fired to make room for this person. 
The job was not advertised. There was no open competition. How 
do the people in Cariboo-Chilcotin know that the most qualified 
person got this job? In fact, they do not know. What they know for 
sure, however, is that the Liberal government is more interested in 
doing favours for its friends than in treating Canadians fairly.
<P>
<B>(1115 )</B>
<P>
	A moment ago I mentioned that the Canadian public is cynical 
toward politicians. The main reason for this cynicism is the 
patronage appointments that this government and the Tory 
government before it dished out and still dish out to their party 
friends. Just as the government is to blame for the problem, it could 
be part of the solution if it chose to do so.
<P>
	The way for the government to give Canadians confidence and 
earn their trust is by giving them a fresh start. This means taking 
the Reform platform and putting it into action. We have an entire 
section on how to make politicians accountable.
<P>
	Reform's fresh start to Canadians, guaranteed, will do the 
following. First, it will give Canadians the tools to ensure 
politicians keep their promises by bringing in the means to recall 
MPs who do not keep their word. Second, it will provide Canadians 
with a better representation, more direct input into the democratic 
process, and the ability to hold politicians accountable for their 
decisions. Third, it will allow freer voting in the House of 
Commons. Fourth, it will replace the current undemocratic, 
unrepresentative Senate with a Senate that is elected, equal and 
effective. Fifth, it will give voters direct input into the decision 
making process through referendums and citizens' initiatives on 
important issues. Sixth, it will involve citizens directly in 
amending our most basic law, the Constitution.
<P>
	Most important in relation to this debate, Reform's fresh start 
guarantee will end patronage appointments by ensuring that 
employment positions and contracts are awarded on the merit 
principle and subject to open scrutiny by parliamentary 
committees.
<P>
	If the government amended Bill C-49 to include this kind of 
provision, it would be taking an important step toward earning the 
trust of Canadians and putting the needs and concerns of the 
Canadian people over the interests of its Liberal friends.
<P>
	In closing, I reiterate that a cynical mood exists in Canada 
toward politicians and their public institutions. Patronage is one of 
the root causes of this mindset. As members of Parliament we want 
Canadians to have faith in their leaders, to feel confident in their 
politicians, that their leaders will have the interests of the people 
first in mind and that we will act fairly and honestly in representing 
Canada and our constituents.
<P>
	As legislators we have a role in establishing this positive 
reputation for ourselves. For example, we could pass legislation 
that would eliminate partisan appointments to key government 
positions. Unfortunately Bill C-49 is not this kind of legislation. 
For this reason it should not pass the House of Commons. Bill C-49 
allows the shameless abuse of patronage to continue. It will only 
perpetuate and reinforce the cynical attitude Canadians already 
have toward their leaders.
<P>
	Patronage creates a cynical mindset for two reasons: first, the 
government broke its word to Canadians regarding patronage 
appointments and, second, patronage says to people that the 
government is more interested in scratching its friends' backs than 
in protecting the interests and needs of society and treating every 
Canadian fairly.
<P>
	Therefore I urge the government to pass legislation not only to 
end patronage appointments but to ensure that employment 
positions and contracts are awarded on the merit principle. This is 
one way we can earn the trust and confidence of people. It would 
also be the fresh start Canadians are asking of their political leaders 
and  political institutions. It would be a fresh start that Canadians 
truly deserve.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to 
make a few comments.
<P>
	The government's criterion is based on competence and merit. It 
is an open process. The jobs are advertised and appear in the 
official <I>Gazette</I>. Our selection process is transparent and is based 
on job descriptions.
<P>
	What the member said are his words and his imagination. The 
record will show that since we have taken office the government 
has appointed approximately 2,000 people to agencies, boards, 
commissions and crown corporations since November 4, 1993. Of 
this number 525 were reappointments. We do not know these 
people, but they were reappointed obviously because they did a 
good job. They knew what they were doing. They carried out their 
functions quite well. We had transfers and promotions of persons 
appointed by the previous government. The government then had a 
principal concern, that appointees should qualify for the jobs they 
do.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	It is meanspirited to make comments that cannot be backed. It is 
meanspirited to say the government is not here to work for the 
people. That is why I came here. I was one of the first to speak in 
the House and I said that integrity and competence were important 
to me. That is the way I operate. I am sure most members of the 
House would like to do that.
<P>
	The member talked about the member for 
Broadview-Greenwood. As I recall at the time the member said 
that bankers or industrialists appoint people they can work with, 
people they had confidence in and people with ability. These 
people are from right across the board. They may be Reformers, 
Conservatives or Liberals. Why would that exclude them from the 
job?
<P>
	When the hon. member makes these comments he should give 
examples. He should make them transparent and ask questions in 
the House. That would make the process better. He should not just 
rise to say that government is bad. I do not think so. We have play a 
significant and important role for the people of Canada. The people 
of Canada want us to be transparent. They want us to be honest. I 
think most of us are.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Madam Speaker, I am dismayed the hon. member 
paid so little attention to what I was saying. I backed up what I said 
with concrete illustrations.
<P>
	With regard to the matter of competency, I pointed out the 
serious problem in our justice system with the appointment of 
prosecuting attorneys who are not qualified and who are not doing 
their jobs well. Judges have problems dealing with evidence that is 
not properly presented and are unable to hold people to account for  
serious criminal activity. That is a very serious situation. It points 
directly to the patronage appointments of lawyers who are not 
qualified to do their jobs.
<P>
	I also mentioned the situation in my constituency where the job 
of electoral returning officer was not advertised. We only found out 
about the appointment by accident. I talked to the previous 
returning officer and learned he had been fired although he had 
done an admirable job through two previous elections.
<P>
	He was not a Reformer. He was not politically motivated but he 
was not a Liberal either. He does not have the job, which he regrets. 
He did the job very conscientiously. He took it very seriously. He 
entered into the program of witnessing elections in other parts of 
the world on behalf of the government. He did an outstanding job. I 
do not speak about him as a Reformer because he is not one. He 
was a credible returning officer who no longer has the job.
<P>
	I am sorry that in asking the question the member is not aware of 
what is happening within his own party. It is a serious situation in 
terms of the results of appointing people who are not qualified. It is 
also serious because it feeds the cynicism of people toward their 
political leaders. Many of us are trying to change this reputation 
but we cannot do so until the government with the power to change 
begins to act in that way.
<P>
<B>(1125 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, could the hon. member for Cariboo-Chilcotin advise the 
House if in his opinion there are circumstances upon which it is 
appropriate for the government of the day to make appointments 
based on the party or philosophical approach of a person in any 
circumstance? Is there an occasion when patronage is an 
appropriate consideration in government appointments?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Madam Speaker, the blatant patronage we see 
today that has no reference to the qualifications of the person 
involved but simply the loyalty of the person to the party is what I 
am speaking about.
<P>
	It would be unfortunate if the qualifications did not list the 
needs, the intention of the governing party and the direction it is 
going so that the person appointed can properly act out government 
policy.
<P>
	I am speaking against are people who are not qualified and are 
being appointed primarily, if not only, on the basis of their party 
relationship. That has to come second. The needs of the nation 
must come first.
<P>
	Just to emphasize what I have said to my hon. colleague, it 
would be unfortunate if the government selected or appointed a 
person who was not in tune with the direction the government had 
in mind in changing programs. It would be unfortunate if a person 
was appointed to maintain the status quo when change was needed.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5929"> 5929 </A></B>
<P>
	The government making the selections must do it very carefully. 
It must be open. The qualifications must be listed so that the 
general public knows what they are and can find out if they are 
interested. The appointment should be made with the 
government's needs in mind and ratified by the appropriate body.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, what does the hon. member feel should be added to the 
bill? What kind of an amendment could be made to make political 
patronage more or less vanish or disappear? That is something that 
must happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased my colleague 
asked this question. Perhaps the single most effective means of 
accomplishing that purpose would be to have appointments ratified 
in a public forum such as a parliamentary committee. If that were 
the case the public would know, scrutinize, understand and make 
its objections if it was not properly done.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I have a quick 
comment. In my previous role I spent 19 years in municipal 
politics. There is no easy way of finding people.
<P>
	At one time we had to hire a police chief. People said let the rest 
of the police chiefs select the person. If the person is not screened, 
in the culture of that organization they may hide all the facts. It is 
the minister's decision. There is no magic way of hiring people.
<P>
	Does the hon. member think that all people are perfect and his 
selection process is a perfect one?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mayfield:</B> Madam Speaker, I agree with the member that 
there is no magic in the process, but the process must be open. The 
Canadian people, the appropriate people, must be involved. It must 
be more than a political adventure in appointments. When 
openness is there, when people know what jobs are available, what 
they can apply for and when the applicant who is successful has the 
scrutiny of not only the government but of the public at large, the 
process will become much fairer and will much better serve the 
needs of the Canadian people.

DISCIPLINARY MEASURES) ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak today against Bill C-49, an act to authorize 
remedial and disciplinary measures in relation to members of 
certain administrative tribunals. We must particularly note the 
word ``disciplinary''. The minister wishes to have the power to 
smack his administrators around a bit. Our colleague and fellow 
member of the Bloc Quebecois has proposed an amendment stating 
that there ought to be a parliamentary mechanism governing the 
appointment or revocation of the appointment of members of 
administrative tribunals.
<P>
	As my introduction, I would like to offer a brief explanation of 
what administrative tribunals are, what their importance is. Bill 
C-49 makes major changes to the operation of administrative 
tribunals. Although these modifications have not attracted much 
media interest, they are nonetheless important.
<P>
	The administrative tribunals, while often less well known than 
the superior courts, nevertheless have major impacts on the daily 
lives of Canadians and Quebecers. Often they bring down far more 
decisions than do the superior courts. What is more, the 
consequences of their decisions are often very important to citizens 
and to the state, whether Canada or Quebec. Indeed, the 
significance the administrative tribunals have assumed in recent 
years is now an accepted fact. They have become the preferred 
decision-making venue, where citizens wishing to confront 
government regularly stand up for their rights.
<P>
	I will name a few of these tribunals to show how significant they 
are and the role they play in our society. The Veterans Review and 
Appeal Board, the agricultural products review board, the 
Canadian Grain Commission, the Immigration and Refugee Board, 
the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, the Competition 
Tribunal-this one is very important-the Copyright Board, the 
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission. 
These are commissions and tribunals that play a very important 
role in our society.
<P>
	The Liberals have decided to change the way these tribunals are 
administered. This will have serious consequences. I believe the 
main reason, and they have said so, is to cut positions and 
administrative spending. That seems legitimate. But if we take a 
really good look, it is not the real reason.
<P>
	The changes the government makes will infringe on the 
independence of these tribunals and will also further  centralize the 
powers of the federal government in Ottawa. The real reason for 
these changes in the constituent legislation of administrative 
tribunals is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5930"> 5930 </A></B>
<P>
mainly that the government wants to designate the presidents 
instead of appointing them.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	To designate is a very serious matter. When one designates, one 
can also revoke a decision very quickly, and as mentioned in the 
legislation, if the minister responsible feels that he has a role to 
play and the president of a tribunal does not exactly reflect the 
ideas of the minister or the government, he can be removed-in 
other words, fired-for reasons that are more or less substantiated. 
This is supposed to enhance administrative flexibility, but it is a 
very serious matter, and I will explain this in a few minutes.
<P>
	In the past when the president of a tribunal was appointed, it was 
for two, five or seven years. This created a certain stability and a 
certain independence in the way the president made his decisions. 
However, if the president is designated and can be removed at any 
time, this means he will always be at the beck and call of the 
government in power.
<P>
	I think the main reason behind this bill is to make it easier to 
appoint friends of the government. As you know, the Conservatives 
were in power for nine years. During that time they changed 
practically all the incumbents, all 2,000 of them, on these tribunals. 
These are very attractive appointments to positions that are very 
well paid.
<P>
	The Liberals have been in power since 1993. Three years later, 
they now realize they cannot hand out these positions fast enough 
to their friends. They are changing the act to be able to do so 
quickly, in other words, to have the power to fire most of the people 
who are sitting on these tribunals and put their friends in instead.
<P>
	To me this kind of bill is outrageous. That is why I am pleased to 
have this opportunity to criticize publicly the current government's 
conduct in this respect.
<P>
	We know that many of the people who will be appointed are 
friends of the government. In fact, during the last election 
campaign, one of the Liberal Party's officials came out and said 
publicly to the defeated candidates that they did not have to worry, 
that a job would be found for them, that there were plenty of jobs, 
and that those who so desired would be able to get a job from the 
federal government.
<P>
	I think that today, the government has realized it cannot appoint 
its friends fast enough. So they are changing the legislation to make 
it easier to remove incumbents and appoint their Liberal friends to 
these administrative tribunals.
<P>
	I believe that is the main reason for all these changes in the 
legislation. This is why they must be denounced,  and also why my 
friend, the hon. member for La Prairie, has presented his 
amendment calling for the House of Commons to have a say in the 
appointment of members of administrative tribunals.
<P>
	If we are to have responsible governments in future, we must not 
use this as a pretext for forcing people to back the winning horse. In 
recent years, we have noticed that often those involved in politics 
or political organizations are like weather vanes. Often, if the 
government is winning, if people or polls say that this or that party 
is on top, many people change sides at the last minute. In the final 
weeks, rapid changes can be seen taking place. Often one of the 
reasons they do so is to have a chance at an appointment to some 
commission or other.
<P>
	In this sense, this does not seem good either. People involved in 
politics must be prompted to do so by their ideals, their belief in a 
party's philosophy, not because they are angling for a job, that is to 
say serving their own interests. In my opinion, if we want to have 
governments that are responsible and capable of selling their 
ideals, the machinery must be cleaned up, and when it comes down 
to it, this bill does the opposite. It has people working with a view 
to a chance at job in future if their party wins the elections. These 
amendments on the appointment of members of administrative 
tribunals are, to my mind, quite shameful.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	What is unfortunate with this bill is that it will hamper the 
independence of the tribunals. Our judicial systems have always 
been world-renowned. Our judicial systems and our tribunals were 
truly stable. There was no interference between the legislative 
system and the justice system. What the minister and the 
government are doing now is providing the government with the 
power to interfere directly in tribunal decisions. A tribunal must be 
independent of the legislators.
<P>
	What the government is proposing is exactly the opposite. It 
wants to interfere, by equipping itself with means of discipline. 
That is what is written into the law, moreover. It will be able to take 
disciplinary measures in order to direct the administrative 
tribunals, which means direct government involvement in the 
decisions of the administrative tribunals. This strikes me as very, 
very serious.
<P>
	As we know, judges in the judicial system are appointed until the 
age of 75. These long appointments make it possible for the 
judicial system to be stable and totally independent. What the 
minister proposes is the exact opposite in that it would make 
administrative tribunals less stable.
<P>
	The president of the Quebec Bar Association was very clear 
about this when she said that ``the lack of job security may have an 
unexpected psychological impact on the decisions of a person who 
may be more concerned about pleasing the government than 
rendering a fair judgment''. As I pointed out earlier, these people 
will be more concerned about pleasing the government and meet-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5931"> 5931 </A></B>
<P>
ing its expectations from day to day than about making the 
decisions they must be free to make.
<P>
	This bill and these changes are a disgrace because they do the 
exact opposite. This goes against common sense. We want our 
society to move forward, but the government is taking us back to 
the 1920s, the 1930s, the Duplessis era, or the turn of the century. 
This kind of measure is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	We often criticize the United States for the way they do things. 
But I can tell you that in the U.S., for example, tribunal members 
are appointed by committees, which, I think, is a much more 
equitable approach. Committee chairs and members should not be 
appointed by the party in power alone, but by House of Commons 
committees.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	The government could propose names, but the appointments 
would be debated in committee so that these decisions can be made 
at arm's length from those in power and committee members 
chosen for their abilities and not their political ties. These people 
could then do their jobs with competence and great freedom of 
action. This, I think, is very important in order to clean up the 
system.
<P>
	We should follow the U.S. government's example in appointing 
our legal authorities.
<P>
	The government is giving itself enormous power over 
administrative tribunals. When the minister alone appoints all 
these people on behalf of the government, he does so unilaterally, 
without ever consulting the provinces, and yet these tribunals often 
need to make rulings in very important areas like the oil, uranium 
and electricity industries.
<P>
	The large corporations in the energy sector wield a great deal of 
influence. If the minister is not happy with the rulings made by a 
tribunal, he might simply appoint someone else. The minister's 
power to appoint someone else is considerable as it gives him 
direct control over decisions. That is the issue. The minister's 
power to appoint and dismiss tribunal members for all kinds of 
more or less valid reasons gives him direct control over decisions. 
It makes no sense for the minister to establish tribunals while 
keeping this great power to decide.
<P>
	We know full well that these people will have to meet 
government expectations and that decisions affecting major areas 
like those I mentioned earlier-the oil, uranium and electricity 
industries-could displease or penalize Quebec, especially when 
electricity is concerned. The government could take matters into its 
own hands instead of letting the tribunal decide, for the reasons I 
gave you earlier. It could make its own decision and hurt Quebec's 
interests. It is very important to mention this.
<P>
	As you know, it has been quite difficult in the past to get justice 
as far as Quebec's major economic sectors are concerned. And the 
government is about to give itself extraordinary powers. What this 
means is that the government will never consult with the provinces 
before making appointments, and that the person appointed to the 
chair will not make a decision without first notifying the minister 
because, if he displeases the minister, the minister can dismiss 
him-as the bill points out-without compensation. He could be 
dismissed just like that, because the government does not like the 
way he handles cases.
<P>
	This is a real case of judicial interference, which I condemn 
today, like several of my colleagues as well as some Reform 
members. We can never say it often enough. I hope the minister 
will reverse his decision, because this is really unfair and 
unacceptable. This is a step backward instead of forward.
<P>
	Bill C-49 will have serious consequences for our tribunals' 
independence. Instead of moving democracy forward, we are 
regressing. The government is giving itself way too much power. 
That is why I am in favour of the amendment put forward by my 
colleague from La Prairie and opposed to Bill C-49.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, a lot of the 
discussion we are having today has to do with change and people's 
imaginations. They are imagining hypothetical situations which 
may or may not occur.
<P>
	When I listen to question period in the House, the minister is 
accountable. When the minister does not do his or her job, 
opposition members want his or her head on a silver platter. The 
image I have in my mind is a cabinet minister in a ring with Mike 
Tyson with his or her hands tied behind their back, but the minister 
is supposed to win the fight.
<P>
	If we want good government, we must have competent managers 
responsible for a file. We can then hold them accountable with 
regard to their competence in running that file. Competence in that 
file does not mean that we put so many regulations in it that they 
cannot do their job.
<P>
	I ask the member: Who is responsible for the file? Who do they 
hold responsible when something happens in a department?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leblanc (Longueuil):</B> Madam Speaker, there is no doubt 
that the government is responsible. But being responsible is one 
thing and giving oneself excessive powers is quite another. Here, in 
Canada and Quebec, it was decided that the legislative power and 
the executive power, that is to say justice, should be separate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5932"> 5932 </A></B>
<P>
	If the government is linked directly to its courts, why bother 
creating any? The minister might as well make his own decisions 
and appoint administrators, but there is no point establishing a 
tribunal to settle disputes while giving himself the authority to 
settle disputes.
<P>
	Furthermore, the real reason for these tribunals, in my opinion, 
is that the government wants to appoint its friends. When this bill is 
passed, it will be able to make at least 1,000 appointments. I say at 
least 1,000; the fact is there are 2,000 positions to fill in various 
tribunals. With an election just around the corner, the government 
cannot wait to be able to appoint its friends. It has not been able to 
do so up to now, because the Conservatives had already done the 
same thing, but at least in their case, they did not appoint a friend 
just for a month. Now, the Liberal government will we able to 
designate friends for one, two, three or four months, then throw 
them out and designate another bunch, playing this little game over 
and over. This whole thing is scary and downright outrageous.
<P>
	At least, there were appointments for three, five or seven years in 
the past, but now this is all changing. Appointments are being 
replaced with designations and these will be for as long as the 
Liberals have left on their mandate. They have one year left, so 
designations will be for one year, and if they get re-elected, they 
will get to start over, appointing new people whom they can expect 
will work hard for them in the next election. This is what this 
means. This is outrageous. It is really taking us back 100 years. We 
are going backward instead of forward with this government, might 
I say a totalitarian government. Are we headed for a totalitarian 
regime or will democracy prevail?
<P>
	We want those who have responsibilities to be free to exercise 
them, without having to account directly to the government. There 
lies the big problem. Such an approach must be strongly 
condemned. This is serious, much more so than what the hon. 
member of the Liberal Party suggested, when he said that the 
government's role was to manage. The government is indeed 
elected to pass legislation and make regulations. Then, people are 
appointed to implement the legislation or regulations, but the 
government must not get involved directly in the implementation 
of the legislation and regulations it puts in place. The two must be 
kept separate to ensure that, after it has been passed by the 
government, the legislation is implemented by individuals 
operating at arm's length, without having the government on their 
backs.
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	What the government is doing on an interim basis, by 
designating the chairpersons of administrative tribunals, is giving 
itself the power to dismiss them at any time. That is the problem 
with the government's interfering with administrative tribunals. In 
many cases, this will  have serious implications for anyone who has 
to face the big machine often.
<P>
	In the judicial system, the little guy is often the winner. He has 
the advantage. It used to be that this was also the case in tribunals, 
but with the administrative changes the government is introducing, 
the tables will now be turned and the big guy will win. The little 
guy will always come out the looser. The government will interfere 
directly and indirectly with the decision making process. That is 
totally unacceptable. The Bloc Quebecois will vote no, a strong no.

	Before speaking on the bill, I want to quote from the Liberal red

responsibilities and promises the government made to the 
Canadian people. The red book promise on Liberal patronage and 
patronage in general appears on page 92:

<BLOCKQUOTE>A Liberal government will take a series of initiatives to restore confidence in the 
institutions of government-.and make competence and diversity the criteria for 
federal appointments. Open government will be the watchword of the Liberal 
program.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What have we found instead? We have found that patronage is 
alive and well in the Liberal government. No fewer than 1,800 
positions have been put forth. It is fairly wide ranging.
<P>
	For example, the National Transportation Agency, which was 
reorganized this summer, was appointed with well connected 
Liberals, such as former MPs Richard Cashin from St. John's, 
Newfoundland and Keith Penner from Kapuskasing, Ontario. Let 
us look at some recent appointments to the bench. One appointment 
with a salary of roughly $140,000 per year went to the minister's 
sister, a former Liberal Party president. Another appointment went 
to an ex-Ontario Liberal MPP. Defeated MP Gary McCauley, Pierre 
Trudeau's former executive assistant, received an appointment to 
the Immigration and Refugee Board with a salary of over $86,000 
per year.
<P>
	These are but some of the hundreds of appointments that have 
gone to people whose only claim to fame, or whose primary claim 
to fame, is that they are members of the Liberal Party. That flies in 
the face of the Liberal red book promise of decreasing patronage.
<P>
	Bill C-49 does not smack of the cavalier attitude that the former 
Conservative prime minister had. Rather it smacks of political 
hypocrisy.
<P>
	A number of important issues affect this. The budget for 
consulting contracts should have been cut by at least 15 per cent but 
this has not been done. No chopping has occurred at all in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5933"> 5933 </A></B>
<P>
consulting contracts by the government even though it promised to 
do that.
<P>
	Parliamentarians should have been given mechanisms to review 
senior cabinet appointments but have we seen that? Not at all and 
no excuse has been given as to why this important aspect of 
accountability has not entered into the process of ensuring that the 
best people are appointed to these important jobs. All appointments 
should have been made based on competence and merit and not 
because they hold a card to the Liberal Party in their back pocket. 
So far more than 1,800 appointments have been made, the vast 
majority of which have been longtime members in good standing 
of the Liberal Party, the party of the government in power.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	The government said that individuals should be appointed to 
positions on the basis of merit and on the basis of competence, that 
those were the primary reasons. We have not seen that. We believe 
the most important aspects upon which a person should be deemed 
appropriate for a job should be merit and competence. It should not 
be the sociodemographic groups they represent, nor their gender, 
nor the colour of their skin, nor their racial group, nor their 
language, nor the province they come from. It should be on the 
basis of merit.
<P>
	To judge anybody on a basis other than merit and competence is 
to be discriminatory. That is why affirmative action, in our view, is 
discriminatory. However, we must do all we can for 
underprivileged groups within our country, for those groups that 
have traditionally had a difficult time succeeding. We must do all 
we can to give them the tools and the opportunities to become the 
best that they can become.
<P>
	We are opposed to determining outcomes. We cannot say in this 
House that we want 25 per cent of a certain group and 15 per cent of 
another group represented. The determination of outcomes by its 
very nature is discriminatory and disturbing. The process insults 
the people intended to be put forward in these positions. They are 
being judged not on the basis of their competence and merit but on 
the basis of the colour of their skin or their gender or any other 
criteria which really has no bearing on their ability to do the job.
<P>
	It is one of the most disturbing issues for me as someone who is 
from a very mixed ethnic background. It is discriminatory for 
individual human beings to be judged by anything other than their 
merit and competence.
<P>
	When the time comes in Canada that we can all be judged on our 
merit and competence but primarily as human beings, then we will 
have created a society based on equality, mutual respect and 
understanding. To do anything else and to judge people on any 
other criteria is to do a disservice to them. It is discriminatory.
<P>
	I am sure the public would be very interested to find out that our 
charter of human rights, the document that is lauded as a tome for 
<P>
equality which preserves the rights of people, is actually a 
discriminatory document. Much to my shock when I read this 
document, it says specifically that it is acceptable to discriminate 
against a group of people who have previously been advantaged in 
our society.
<P>
	That has to be struck because it is a discriminatory statement by 
its very nature. It defeats the purpose of being Canadian. It defeats 
one of the many things that we are very proud of as Canadians; that 
we are for equality for all individuals regardless of their colour, 
their race, their nationality, their gender, or whatever other criteria 
we could define people by. At the end of the day those criteria do 
not matter at all. It matters what kind of a person one is and the 
merit and competency the person will bring to a job and all 
situations. This is not what the government has done.
<P>
	The bill does a number of other things, or I should say that it fails 
to do a number of things. It does not affect cabinet's power to make 
appointments. It removes the ability of this House or any 
overseeing body to look at the appointments that cabinet makes.
<P>
	The bill states that it will eliminate 271 jobs. Members should be 
interested to know that those 271 jobs are currently vacant. The 
government is being hypocritical in presenting legislation to the 
House, saying that it will eliminate jobs although those jobs are 
currently not in existence.
<P>
<B>(1205 )</B>
<P>
	The bill also makes very few changes to existing travel and per 
diem perks. It also does not add an element of accountability.
<P>
	The vast majority of people I know who work in this House or in 
the bureaucracy are honest individuals. They take their 
responsibility to the Canadian people very seriously. They are very 
concerned about the amount of money they spend because at the 
end of the day, that money comes out of the pockets of the hard 
working taxpayers.
<P>
	There are individuals who choose not to recognize this and have 
shown irresponsibility in the travel that they do. They have abused 
their power as elected individuals within Parliament or appointed 
individuals. These individuals must be brought to heel. There must 
be an element of accountability and transparency in the way in 
which spending takes place by these individuals. Bill C-49 does not 
do that even though it provided the government with a great 
opportunity to do so.
<P>
	Remedial and disciplinary measures also should have been 
standardized by the administrative tribunals. However, the power 
of the minister to interfere with disciplinary measures is not 
decreased but is increased. It is the minister who in all likelihood 
made the  appointment who is now responsible for disciplining the 
very person the minister put in the position. This is not what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5934"> 5934 </A></B>
<P>
Reform Party thinks should be done. Those responsibilities should 
be done in conjunction with other individuals. Increased 
transparency, reportability and accountability must be added into 
the system.
<P>
	There are many other plum patronage jobs I could speak about. 
The list as I said amounted to 1,800 in total. I remind the House 
again of the red book promise and I would like to compare it with 
the promise the Reform Party is putting forth.
<P>
	The Liberals promised to Canadians in 1993 that they would take 
a series of initiatives to restore confidence in the institutions of 
government and make competence and diversity the criteria for 
federal appointments. Open government would be the watchword.
<P>
	Our promise to the Canadian people is as follows. The Reform 
Party supports restrictions and limitations on the number and types 
of orders in council permitted by government during its term of 
office. We also want to add that element of accountability into the 
system.
<P>
	The government had an ideal opportunity when it came into 
power to restore the confidence of Canadians in this institution. We 
in this House and the Canadian public know very well that an 
extraordinary amount of apathy exists in the Canadian public about 
this House, about this institution and about the elected officials 
who are here. It is not without a great deal of truth historically.
<P>
	The government had an opportunity to democratize this House. 
The government had an opportunity to bring back into this House 
the power of the people through their elected officials. Instead, the 
government chose not to. Even when the Liberals themselves were 
in opposition, they brought forth good documents and good ideas 
on how to democratize this House. We have not seen anything of 
that in this House.
<P>
	With the new appointment to the Chair this week, we found that 
the government itself broke its promise. The government should 
have put forth a member from the opposition into the Chair, but it 
has put forth one of its own.
<P>
	We can still do some things regarding the committee structure. 
Committees were put in this House to keep members busy and to 
keep them running around in circles. The vast majority of work that 
a committee does is often done at great expense not only to the 
members themselves in terms of their time, but also to the House 
and the ancillary staff who work very hard and conscientiously to 
put forth documents that they hope will make a difference.
<P>
	What happens in committees? Committees sit and listen to the 
hard, earnest and learned opinions of members of the public. A 
committee document is put forth after many months of study and 
review. The  document gets about a day of play in the media and 
then it is shelved with numerous other documents.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	A poignant example of this took place in the health committee 
when the head of the Inuit Tapirisat society came before the 
committee. The House of Commons health committee was going to 
consider studying aboriginal health in Canada, which is a very 
serious problem that should have been dealt with decades ago, a 
profound tragedy in our midst.
<P>
	The head of the Inuit Tapirisat society came to us with an armful 
of dockets. She said: ``If you want to come up to Inuvik and study 
us, you are not welcome because these documents in my arms are 
just a small example of the dozens upon dozens of studies that I 
have on aboriginal health. We do not want any more studying. We 
need action''.
<P>
	It is action that the Canadian public wants to see come out of this 
House. But it is not action that we often see. The government could 
have taken it upon itself to give committees the power to introduce 
legislation, to give committees the power to put forth good 
solutions, to decrease the reins of the whip structure.
<P>
	The whip structure cowers members of Parliament and prevents 
them from representing the public in a way that is effective in this 
House. For government members to speak against the government 
of the day is to bring forth the wrath of the whip. Members of 
Parliament could have their rights and responsibilities to speak in 
this House removed. They could be ostracized by their colleagues 
and removed from committees.
<P>
	Two poignant examples occurred, one of which was on Bill 
C-68, the gun control bill. Members of Parliament, a half dozen or 
so from the government, courageously represented their 
constituents and spoke out against the bill, as they should have 
done, and were summarily hammered by their own government. 
They had their ability to speak in this House removed. They were 
removed from committees. They were ostracized and for a 
significant time were made defunct, superfluous and vestigial.
<P>
	When a government does that it is not doing it only for the 
member. Most important it is doing it to the members of the public 
who elected that individual to represent them in the House. We do 
not live in a democracy; we live in a fiefdom and that is part of the 
problem.
<P>
	On private members' bills, the government through Bill C-49 
could have brought forward good solutions in making sure that 
private members' bills could be put forth in the House and become 
votable. We are the only nation in the world that calls itself a 
democracy and has non-votable private members' bills. Why do we 
bother to go through the hoops to bring forth private members' bills 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5935"> 5935 </A></B>
<P>
that are going to be made non-votable and therefore can never 
become law? What a waste of the taxpayers' money.
<P>
	We could empower the public through their members by 
ensuring that all private members' bills could become votable and 
therefore could become law. It would maximize the great talent that 
we have in this House by members across party lines. It would 
bring those talents to bear and would bring the good ideas that are 
in the public domain to bear in this House for debate so that we 
could have effective legislation being brought forth for Canadians.
<P>
	If the public looked at the pea soup type of agenda that exists in 
the House, they would be appalled. They would be shocked to find 
that the legislation we have today does not affect by and large jobs, 
or the economy, or safety in the streets, or poverty in any 
meaningful way. It does not strengthen our social programs. It does 
not touch the hearts, souls and the lives of Canadians in any 
meaningful way.
<P>
<B>(1215)</B>
<P>
	The vast majority of legislation brought forward in the House is 
a pea soup agenda that will only affect a small number of people. 
The government should be ashamed. It should have brought forth 
good legislation to address the situation.
<P>
	In closing, we will vote against the legislation because it 
demonstrates the hypocrisy of the government. It had an 
opportunity to strengthen the democratic institution of the House 
and once again it has chosen not to do so. It is just another broken 
promise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was 
interested in the comments of the member. I am sorry the bill was 
not addressed fully because there are some important aspects to it.
<P>
	The member has taken the opportunity, as is his right, to make 
the debate a partisan one and to look for opportunities for partisan 
gain.
<P>
	The member began by making reference to the whole issue of 
patronage. It is a word that conjures up a lot of negative 
connotations. He did correctly quote from the red book with regard 
to the undertaking of the government to ensure that competency 
and diversity were the hallmarks of approving any appointment.
<P>
	The member suggested the only people who get appointments 
are well connected Liberals. I do not think the member would 
suggest to the House that Liberals need not apply. That has nothing 
to do with competency or diversity. He referred to some 
appointments as that their only claim to fame. I do not think he 
gave any examples or qualified whether competency or diversity 
was part of the appointment. He referred often to political 
hypocrisy. I do not see how appointing competent people who 
represent diverse interests to public bodies or boards has anything 
to do with political hypocrisy.
<P>
	Unfortunately when we get into partisan types of debate it tends 
to paint all members of Parliament with the same brush. It tends to 
degrade the position of member of Parliament. All members are 
working very hard to improve the credibility of the elected 
representatives of the people in the House.
<P>
	The member should know there is a risk in making an 
appointment to any board or body. They are subject to the scrutiny 
of the public at large.
<P>
	I have a specific question for the member and will conclude with 
this point. The credibility of an individual or body approving an 
appointment that is publicly announced is subject to the scrutiny 
and the criteria of the public at large.
<P>
	Notwithstanding his remarks, could the member give the House 
an example of any appointment that does not reflect competency or 
diversity?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my hon. colleague for the question.
<P>
	I will give some examples. As much as I respected the former 
Minister of Foreign Affairs in that capacity I wonder what he 
knows about Canada Post. This former MP received $160,000 in 
addition to his MP pension which, I might add, all members of the 
Reform Party but one gave up. He has received the top job of 
chairman of Canada Post and I fail to see the connection between 
foreign affairs and Canada Post.
<P>
	We could talk about defeated MP Gary McCauley, a former 
executive assistant of Pierre Trudeau, being appointed to the 
Immigration and Refugee Board. I wonder what knowledge and 
qualifications the individual had about the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. There is a list I would be happy to provide to the 
member. The list goes on and on and I will not bore the House with 
it.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	The fact remains-and this is not partisan; this is calling a spade 
a spade-that one of the prime criteria for receiving a plum 
patronage job quite simply is to be a member of the Liberal Party. 
That is wrong.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point has been well made. I clearly 
asked the member whether he could give any examples that would 
show there was not competency or diversity in an appointment. His 
example was a former minister who is now head of Canada Post. 
He asked what possible linkage there could be between foreign 
affairs and Canada Post. That is a good question, but he should also 
know that minister happened to have been responsible for Canada 
Post in a previous post and ran the post office. He is in error in that 
example.
<P>
	The second example he gave was the stipend a person received. 
The amount of dollars involved is subject to guidelines for certain 
jobs. Also in the second example the member did not give an 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5936"> 5936 </A></B>
<P>
example in which incompetency was demonstrated. It is not 
speculating whether someone has competence. It is showing that it 
was a bad appointment and they did not demonstrate competence in 
discharging their new responsibilities.
<P>
	Again I ask: Could the member give an example to the House of 
an appointment that demonstrated there was incompetency in the 
appointment?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did 
not really want to raise this because I did not want to disparage in 
any way, shape or form our honourable defence forces. The rank 
and file work hard in a courageous way to bring honour not only to 
Canada but to our international peacekeeping forces.
<P>
	However, one need not look any further than the former chief of 
defence staff, General Jean Boyle, who was appointed over and 
above other more highly competent and experienced individuals. 
That appointment was a disaster. It demonstrates what can happen 
when an individual who is in some way connected to this party is 
appointed to a position at their greatest level of incompetence.
<P>
	The hon. member could look at that as a prime example, if his 
memory goes back that far.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Parliamentary Secretary to President 
of the Treasury Board, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know what 
gives a politician the authority to denigrate any person. The hon. 
member should make that comment outside. I think that would be a 
more appropriate place to do it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, history 
bears out the level of incompetence of the individual. Otherwise 
the sorry state of affairs that took place at the highest levels of our 
military would not have occurred. The facts speak for themselves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to address Bill C-49. We have recently seen 
an increase in attention paid to Liberal patronage practices so it is 
appropriate to look at the bill at this time.
<P>
	The Reform Party opposes the bill because it does not go far 
enough to reduce patronage. It does not affect cabinet's power to 
make appointments. It can still appoint whomever it wants.
<P>
	There are still 2,225 appointments available to the cabinet. 
Considering the way the Liberal government does business, that is 
probably a guarantee that patronage will continue until the end of 
the session.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	The Liberals claim the bill will standardize remedial and 
disciplinary measures for administrative tribunals. The power of 
this minister to interfere with the measures is increased. The 
minister will decide whether or not a member should be 
disciplined. As a member of the  agriculture and agri-food 
committee I have seen the Liberals draft bills with provisions that 
allow them to continue patronage.
<P>
	Bill C-60, currently before the House, will create a new food 
inspection agency. Provisions in that bill create an environment for 
empire building and patronage. It states that the governor in 
council shall appoint a president and an executive vice-president to 
the new agency. These individuals will be responsible for the day to 
day operations of the agency and will provide advice to the 
minister on matters relating to the mandate of the agency. There is 
no mention of the qualifications required by these people. This type 
of situation opens itself up to more pork barrel politics.
<P>
	Bill C-60 states that the president and the executive 
vice-president shall be paid such remuneration as fixed by the 
governor in council. We do not even know the salaries of these two 
positions. I wonder why there is not an advertising program for 
positions like these. It requires expertise to take over these boards 
and tribunals.
<P>
	In the private sector usually advertisements go out and 
qualifications have to be presented. Not only that, usually the 
remuneration or wages are said to be negotiable. This seems to be 
the direction in which the government should go to get more 
accountability into these boards and tribunals.
<P>
	First, we could become more efficient by negotiating better 
wages or wages that represent the qualifications. Second, if we 
could by advertising encourage the expertise to come forward and 
run the boards, it would be more efficient and accountable in the 
long run.
<P>
	The bill also states that each member of the advisory board shall 
be paid such fees for his or her services as are required by the 
minister. Again we cannot tell Canadian taxpayers how much that 
will be because we have not seen the amount. This shows the 
Liberal way of doing business. There is no accountability and only 
Liberals need apply.
<P>
	The Liberals have had a busy summer filling patronage 
appointments. We have seen the reorganization of the National 
Transportation Agency with the appointments of several well 
connected Liberals. Recent appointments to the bench include a 
cabinet minister's sister, a former Liberal Party president and an 
ex-Ontario MPP. They must have been carrying Liberal cards. If 
they did not, they were very fortunate.
<P>
	The government has named Liberals to appointments within 
Petro-Canada, the Bank of Canada, the Federal Court of Canada 
and the Senate. The brand new Canada information office will be 
staffed with some Liberal cronies or political people and will be 
cranking out Liberal propaganda at taxpayers' expense.
<P>
	The main criterion these individuals must have is some sort of 
Liberal tie. No other factor seems to be important. Probably the 
most cited example of Liberal  patronage is the National Parole 
Board where incompetence and outright blunders have resulted in 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5937"> 5937 </A></B>
<P>
dangerous criminals going free to commit their horrible crimes all 
over again.
<P>
	I have spoken a number of times on the issue of crime. It is sad to 
see that political interference can have an effect on how the parole 
system or the justice system is working. The Liberals would rather 
put rewarding political friends ahead of ensuring the safety of 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	This is the party that promised to take steps to ensure that the 
confidence of Canadians in their government institutions would be 
restored. The last couple of days we have been involved in a debate 
concerning the appointment of a deputy chair. This was a promise 
that could have been kept so easily without any financial burden to 
the taxpayers. It would have improved the independence of the 
Chair and shown the country that we are determined to increase 
democracy on the Hill.
<P>
	The Liberal Party promised in the red book to take steps to 
ensure that Canadians' confidence in government institutions 
would be restored. The red book promise stated that open 
government would be the watchword of the Liberal program. These 
words ring very hollow now, contrary to the promise on the 
campaign trail.
<P>
	I vividly remember when the Conservatives defeated the 
Liberals in the 1984 election and Mr. Mulroney pointed a finger at 
the then prime minister, Mr. Turner, as he said: ``You did not have 
to make those appointments. You had an option. We will be 
different''.
<P>
	What happened once the Conservatives took over in 1984? 
Patronage appointments continued to escalate. It became even 
more important at that time. The Senate was stacked with 
Conservatives so the GST legislation could be passed. We know 
how controversial the GST legislation has become. It could not 
have passed if the Conservatives had not had the power to stack the 
Senate with eight extra Senators.
<P>
	It is important that this system be changed and that it be changed 
very shortly. This country cannot afford these appointments, 
programs or the decisions that have been made by this type of 
politics.
<P>
	When we look at the $600 billion debt it is easy to see some very 
unwise decisions have been made and future generations will have 
to absorb and correct them. I do not think it will be done by 
politicians. It will take men and women in this House with superb 
intelligence, character and honesty. The first place we can improve 
is with the disbandment of political patronage appointments.
<P>
	It scares me sometimes to think that we have come so close, not 
just to bankruptcy, but to splitting the country and dividing us to 
such an extent that we cannot co-exist.
<P>
	When I look at the news of the last day or two and I see what is 
happening in Zaire and Rwanda, it is scary to see brothers fighting 
brothers. That is something I do not think we ever want to see in 
this country. We would rather give up politics than become so 
divisive that we have to take stronger action than just at the voting 
box or the ballot.
<P>
	If we do not try to change the system within this Parliament how 
can we be sure that we can do it in the next one? Clearly the 
Liberals are trying to cash in on the disgust that Canadians had for 
the Mulroney Tories. I sure do not blame the government for 
addressing that issue with some vehemence. There was tremendous 
abuse heaped on this Parliament by that government.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	We know political appointments reached new heights during that 
period of government. We do not have to believe that two wrongs 
will make a right. We have to start addressing the issues that are 
facing us and that are-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt the hon. member 
but his 10 minutes have expired. After five hours, we are in 
10-minute speeches.

	<B>Mr. Jim Peterson (Willowdale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order. I believe if you ask, you will receive unanimous 
consent so that the finance committee might table its fourth report. 
This involves the examination of the legislation affecting Canada's 
financial institutions.
<P>
	In tabling this report, I would like to thank, first of all, the 
employees of the House of Commons, particularly our clerks, who 
have done such a fantastic job of getting this ready in such record 
time. They had very little time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I also want to thank all Mps, committee members and 
particularly, from the official opposition, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot. I did not give him much time to reply to 
the majority report, but his co-operation was greatly appreciated.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent to accept the 
motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the official opposition tabled a dissenting opinion, as an 
annex to the report of the Liberal majority. There are three basic 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5938"> 5938 </A></B>
<P>
arguments supporting this  dissenting opinion. The first one is that 
the official opposition refuses to let the federal government get 
involved in securities, an area that comes under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of provincial governments, including the Quebec 
government.
<P>
	The Liberal majority report proposes the establishment of a 
national securities commission. We absolutely oppose such a 
measure, because it contravenes the Canadian constitution, the 
1982 Constitution. The second argument is that it would deal a 
blow to Montreal's economy, since its most competent people in 
the fields of securities, management consulting, etc., would be 
transferred to Toronto, with all the financial consequences that 
could follow, particularly from an economic point of view.
<P>
	We also oppose the recommendation to the effect that foreign 
banks interested in getting involved in the area of securities would 
have to ask the federal Minister of Finance to do so, even though 
this area comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.
<P>
	Finally, we oppose the Liberal majority recommendation to the 
effect that a federal consumer protection office should be 
established. We are certainly not opposed to consumer protection, 
but the government would create more overlap, duplication and 
inefficient schemes, since consumer protection initiatives such as 
the consumer protection bureau, privacy legislation, the Insurance 
Act, trust companies in Quebec, etc., already fulfil the mandate that 
would be given to a federal consumer protection office.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the official opposition is asking the 
government to give up its project to create a national securities 
commission, to let the provinces look after consumer protection, 
since this area comes under their jurisdiction, and to let them 
decide whether to allow foreign broking subsidiaries to do business 
on their territory, since this also comes under their exclusive 
jurisdiction.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ADMINISTRATIVETRIBUNALS(REMEDIALANDDISCIPLINARYMEASURES)ACT">ADMINISTRATIVE TRIBUNALS (REMEDIAL AND 
DISCIPLINARY MEASURES) ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-49, 
an act to authorize remedial and disciplinary measures in relation 
to members of certain administrative tribunals, to reorganize and 
dissolve certain federal agencies and to make consequential 
amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee; and of the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-49, the 
administrative tribunals act. Bill C-49 seeks to make 
administrative changes to boards, agencies and tribunals. I join my 
colleagues in opposing this bill. It should be scrapped and rewritten 
with meaningful changes to patronage and improved 
accountability.
<P>
	Bill C-49 does not make substantive changes to public 
accountability. It does not go far enough to eliminate or reduce 
patronage. In fact Bill C-49 does practically nothing to change 
what is already going on today.
<P>
	Many Canadians will disagree with Bill C-49's proposal to 
eliminate the Canadian citizenship requirement for appointments 
to nine organizations which include CMHC, Canada Labour 
Relations Board, CRTC and the CBC. Bill C-49 also proposes to 
make changes to the Immigration and Refugee Board to allow for a 
one-person panel. It is doubtful whether this will make the board 
more accountable and in fact it may do the reverse.
<P>
	Bill C-49 proposes to increase, not decrease, the role of the 
governor in council and ministers in a number of appointments. 
This Liberal government can continue to appoint all its friends to 
high places with no regard to accountability, competence or quality 
in the appointees.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition they were very vocal in 
criticizing patronage appointments made during the Mulroney 
government. At that time they completely forgot their own party's 
overwhelming use of this political tool during the Trudeau 
administration.
<P>
	Page 92 of the Liberal red book says: ``The Conservatives made 
a practice of choosing political friends when making thousands of 
appointments to boards, commissions and agencies. A Liberal 
government will,'' take note across the way, ``take a series of 
initiatives to restore confidence in the institutions of government 
and make competence and diversity the criteria for federal 
appointments. Open government will be the watchword of the 
Liberal program''. I suggest that will be just after pigs start to fly.
<P>
	The list of patronage appointments is so large I could not read all 
the names of appointments during the limited time I have today but 
it is important that some of these appointments be read into the 
record, the Liberal record of shame.
<P>
	Patronage appointments go right to the very top with the 
appointment of Romeo LeBlanc, a lifetime servant of the Liberal 
Party to be Governor General of Canada. LeBlanc was a press 
secretary, speech writer, organizer, member of Parliament and 
senator for the federal Liberals.
<P>
	This summer the National Transportation Agency was 
reorganized to make room for several well-connected Liberals such 
as the former member of Parliament for St. John's, Newfoundland, 
Richard Cashin and the former member of Parliament for 
Kapuskasing, Ontario, Keith Penner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5939"> 5939 </A></B>
<P>
	Recently the Liberal cabinet appointed Roger Legare, the 
former director general of the Liberal Party of Canada and 
defeated 1993 candidate to the most senior management position 
at the National Capital Commission.
<P>
	The list of patronage appointments to the bench, paying about 
$140,000 a year, is long. Some of the recent appointments include 
the new minister of defence's sister, former Liberal Party president 
Michael Robert; ex-Ontario MPP Albert Roy; Thomas Lofchik, a 
Liberal organizer in Hamilton was appointed to the Court of 
Appeal of Ontario; John Richard, the former partner of the Prime 
Minister and son of the former Liberal MP Jean T. Richard was 
appointed to the bench; Bryan Williams, a long time Liberal 
supporter courted as a possible Liberal candidate appointed as 
judge to the B.C. Supreme Court; and Gerald Albright, another 
well know Liberal supporter was appointed judge to the 
Saskatchewan Court of Queen's Bench.
<P>
	A few of the patronage appointments to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board include Gary McCauley, the defeated Liberal 
member of Parliament and Pierre Trudeau's former executive 
assistant; Dorothy Davey, the wife of former senator Keith Davey; 
Elke Homsi, a campaign worker for the Minister of the 
Environment and long time aid to Ontario MPP Tony Ruprecht and 
assistant to various Ontario Liberal MPs.
<P>
	The list of patronage appoints to crown corporations such as 
Canada Post is also long. Patronage appointments to Canada Post 
have been so political that the recent Canada Post mandate review 
recommended that Canada Post board of directors be composed 
solely of individuals with expertise and ability to effectively make 
an optimal contribution to the governance of a corporation of that 
size. What does this say about the quality of appointments? Surely, 
competence should be a factor when making appointments, yet the 
Liberals do not seem to see that.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	Ironically, George Radwanski who was appointed to chair the 
Canada Post review himself was a former speech writer for the 
Prime Minister and an active participant in the 1990 Liberal 
leadership campaign. He obtained his position clearly through 
patronage.
<P>
	Former Minister Andre Ouellet was appointed chairman of 
Canada Post, to receive an additional $160,000 a year in addition to 
his already lucrative MP pension.
<P>
	More recently Gilles Champagne, a long term Liberal fundraiser 
for the Prime Minister, was appointed to the Canada Post 
Corporation board of directors.
<P>
	These kinds of patronage appointments have very negative 
implications regarding the ability of government to have the 
highest quality people serving it.  Unfortunately, this is only the 
very tip of the patronage list.
<P>
	Lawrence Freeman, a well-known Liberal and friend of the 
Minister of Health, was appointed to the Canada Communication 
Group advisory committee.
<P>
	Roy MacLaren, the former Liberal Minister for International 
Trade, stepped down from his seat in the House and took the cushy 
position of high commissioner in Britain.
<P>
	Some of the appointments to the Senate chosen by the Prime 
Minister include: Lorna Milne, a Liberal organizer in Ontario; 
Leonice Mercier, a longtime Quebec Liberal strategist and 
organizer; Celine Hervieux-Payette, a former junior minister in the 
Trudeau government; John Bryden, a former New Brunswick 
Liberal leader and New Brunswick campaign manager for the 
Prime Minister's 1990 leadership campaign; Sharon Carstairs, 
former provincial leader and MLA of the Manitoba Liberals and 
daughter of a former Liberal senator; and Landon Pearson, the 
daughter-in-law of Lester B. Pearson. William Rompkey, a former 
Liberal MP; Jean-Robert Gauthier, the former Liberal MP for 
Ottawa-Vanier; and Shirley Maheu, a Liberal MP, all resigned 
their seats in the House to take their turn at the trough. Nick Taylor, 
a Liberal who was elected to the Alberta legislature and who ran for 
the provincial Liberal leadership also found his reward in Senate 
heaven.
<P>
	The patronage list seems to be endless. This does not sound like 
the government which pledged in the red book that it would do 
things differently. The Liberals have favoured their friends when 
making appointments to the courts, to the Immigration and 
Refugee Board, to corporations, to the Bank of Canada's board of 
directors, from one end to the other, large and small. And the media 
has allowed most of these appointments to go by without so much 
as raising an eyebrow. Perhaps they are a bit tainted as well.
<P>
	The government defends its record saying that everyone 
appointed is qualified. What does that mean, given the fact that 
there are no qualifications for these positions other than of course 
being a member of the Liberal Party?
<P>
	Before the last election the Liberal member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River told Canadians that there are two 
bottom lines in the way appointments should be made. The first is 
that we demand quality; the second is that we require 
accountability in the appointment process. We need to ensure that 
when appointments are made, they are reviewed by the House of 
Commons or a House of Commons committee, or some other 
mechanism.
<P>
	What happened to that promise? Who reviews Liberal 
appointments? Not a committee, as suggested by the Liberals 
before the election, but the wife of the former minister of defence, 
Penny Collenette, a patronage  appointment herself. This speaks 
volumes for the Liberal act of accountability.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5940"> 5940 </A></B>
<P>
	The patronage list speaks for itself. The Liberals have 
demonstrated their flagrant lack of accountability to Canadians by 
bringing all their friends to the trough once again. Canadians 
deserve more than what they are getting. It is time for Canadians to 
get what they deserve: competence and quality in these 
appointments. The government for the first time must become a 
leader, one that can set an example with its appointments to these 
very important posts. The faith of Canadians in our government 
and the integrity of our institutions clearly must be restored.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The Reform Party supports restrictions and limitations on the 
number and types of order in council appointments permitted by a 
government during its term of office. Individuals should be 
appointed on the basis of their qualifications. We must have strong, 
independent and effective people in these positions of leadership 
and influence, not political hacks tied to the purse strings of the 
governing party.
<P>
	Rather than giving ministers more discretion and more power, it 
is time to make appointments accountable not to the governing 
party but to the people of Canada. If the government is not willing 
to make the necessary changes, a Reform government will.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough-Rouge River, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in listening to the hon. member's remarks, I do not think I 
heard once any attempt by him to address the number one issue of 
competence for any of the individuals in his long list of 
appointments. I will leave one on the floor for his consideration. If 
he is prepared to say that His Excellency the Governor General is 
not qualified or competent, I dare him to put that to us today. I do 
not think he is prepared to say that.
<P>
	I am going to suggest three reasons that the hon. member should 
support this legislation.
<P>
	First, the legislation in partnership with another bill before the 
House will eliminate 88 organizations which were in existence 
before the last election. That involves 868 positions; 868 
appointments are gone. It entails a savings of approximately $10 
million per year. That is a change and I hope the member will 
acknowledge it.
<P>
	Second, he said that there is not a credible mechanism to review 
the appointments. I am sure he is aware that there has been put in 
place an advisory committee for all federal judicial appointments 
which is operating well. There has also been put in place an 
advisory committee for Immigration and Refugee Board 
appointments which is operating well.
<P>
	Just by way of an anecdote, within the last month a Liberal said 
to me: ``I just got a letter from the advisory committee that said I 
was not qualified to serve on the  IRB. How can this be?'' I said: 
``Just because you are a Liberal does not mean you are competent 
to serve on the board''. That person was disappointed. That is what 
the advisory committee is doing. It is telling people of all 
backgrounds if it believes they are not capable of doing the job and 
those people are not recommended to the minister.
<P>
	Those are two examples, the federal judiciary and the IRB, 
where there are non-political people making recommendations for 
appointments.
<P>
	Third, with respect to reviewing appointments, having served on 
the justice committee, I know that every judicial appointment 
stands referred to that committee. If that is not an accountability 
mechanism for judicial appointments I do not know what would be.
<P>
	I also know that every appointment in every area of the federal 
government's jurisdiction can be taken up under the standing 
orders by any of the standing committees dealing with those 
departments. All that is necessary is for the members of the 
committee to decide at some point in time to review the 
appointment.
<P>
	I have sat on committees when that particular agenda item has 
been considered. I have seen it happen with respect to the 
Correctional Service of Canada. I have seen it happen with respect 
to the National Parole Board and in numerous other areas, 
including the referral of judicial appointments, which because of a 
standing order are not agenda items for the committee, but the 
resumes of every judicial appointment are referred to the standing 
committee.
<P>
<B>(1255 )</B>
<P>
	I hope the member will accept that there are mechanisms in 
place. Maybe they are not comprehensive, but mechanisms have 
been put in place. Changes have been made since the last election 
and 88 separate organizations have been liquidated. The volume of 
appointments has decreased by 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 25 per 
cent under program review. There is a provision to ensure 
competence, not comprehensively across the board but we are 
making great headway in that regard. I hope he will acknowledge at 
least some of what I have put to him now.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River may not have realized it, but we are 
not into questions and comments. In any event, that will be taken as 
an intervention on behalf of the hon. member for 
Scarborough-Rouge River.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Cliff Breitkreuz (Yellowhead, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel it 
is incumbent upon me to rise in this House to address Bill C-49, an 
act dealing with appointments and designations or in short, 
patronage.
<P>
	I was happy to hear the member from the government side who 
just spoke say that there are steps being taken, even though they are 
small and hesitant, to change this  abuse of power. Everyone knows 
that there is an over-abundance of patronage promoted by this 
government. Perhaps no greater example of patronage or abuse of 
power exists than what can be found in the other chamber, the 
Senate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5941"> 5941 </A></B>
<P>
	Yesterday a motion to abolish the Senate was voted down by this 
Liberal government. Reform does not want to abolish the red 
chamber. We want to change it and reform it. What this country 
really needs is a Senate that reflects the views of Canadians right 
across the country and a chamber that provides a balance in 
Parliament.
<P>
	The model we are advocating is the triple E model: a Senate that 
is elected, effective and equal. That is the model of the upper house 
which is the cornerstone of Reform's parliamentary reforms.
<P>
	I think most Canadians would agree with me that in its present 
form the sleepy Senate is pretty much a rubber stamp for the ruling 
government. However, after the next election a Reform 
government will initiate change to the slumbering chamber of 
sober second thought which would provide for a measure of much 
needed accountability.
<P>
	Having senators elected rather than appointed would be our first 
step in reforming the Senate. That can be done and it can be done 
without cracking the Constitution wide open. Recent history proves 
that Senate reform can be done without full-blown constitutional 
change, debate and negotiation.
<P>
	My home province of Alberta, which leads the way in a number 
of ways in this country, has already paved the way for Senate 
reform. In 1989 the provincial government passed the senatorial 
election act. In the fall of that year Albertans voted on the first 
elected senator in this country. They overwhelmingly elected Stan 
Waters, a Reformer. He was the first elected senator in the history 
of Canada.
<P>
	Do Albertans still want to elect their senator? I will read a letter 
dated May 9, 1996 addressed to my colleague from Kootenay East:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This is to confirm I intend to write to the Prime Minister asking him for a 
commitment to appoint a senator from Alberta to replace the late Senator Earl 
Hastings. Such an appointment is to be given to the successful candidate in a 
senatorial election in accordance with the Senatorial Elections Act of Alberta, 1989.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Yours truly,</BLOCKQUOTE>
Ralph Klein,<BR>
 Premier of the Province of Alberta.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	Of course, Albertans still want to elect their senators.
<P>
	It is a sad commentary that during the dying days of the 
Mulroney government and during this current administration, no 
elected senator has been appointed to the upper House. This 
government, in fact this Prime Minister, chooses to appoint 
non-elected people to the Senate in spite of the fact that the Prime 
Minister stated  that the Senate is in need of reform, that it needs to 
undergo a major transformation.
<P>
	Here is what the Prime Minister said when in opposition on 
September 24, 1991: ``A reformed Senate is essential. It must be a 
Senate which is elected, effective and equitable''. A logical 
subsequent observation would be: What action has the Prime 
Minister taken? Has he acted on his own recommendation, on his 
own advice? What has the Prime Minister done? Has he kept his 
promise or is it another broken Liberal promise?
<P>
	Here is a sample of the Prime Minister's attempt to reform the 
Senate since his party assumed the mantle of power in 1993: Lise 
Bacon, the former president of the Quebec Liberal Party and a 
supporter of the Prime Minister was appointed by him to the 
Senate.
<P>
	Sharon Carstairs, the daughter of a former Liberal senator, was 
chosen by the Prime Minister to sit in the upper Chamber. Not only 
does the Prime Minister keep it within the party, he also keeps it 
within the family. How about the appointment of Céline 
Hervieux-Payette who was a junior minister in the Trudeau 
government? They were all appointed by the Prime Minister. They 
are all Liberals.
<P>
	Time prohibits me from naming all the obvious patronage Senate 
appointments. In short, a Senate seat has become available 17 
times under the current Prime Minister, and you guessed it, 17 
times Liberals have been appointed to the Senate.
<P>
	What happened to the Prime Minister's commitment to support 
the Reform initiative of a triple E Senate? He certainly did not live 
up to it, that is for sure.
<P>
	This is what the Prime Minister said on May 9, the same day that 
the premier of Alberta wrote his letter regarding patronage 
appointments: ``I will name a senator who I will choose and who 
will represent my party in the House of Commons''. This leftist 
Liberal arrogant attitude is a far cry from the Liberals' previous 
promise of a reformed Senate.
<P>
	We are not supporting this bill. It does nothing much to curb 
patronage appointments and it is not worthy of consideration in this 
House.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="HUMANREPRODUCTIVEANDGENETICTECHNOLOGIESACT">HUMAN REPRODUCTIVE AND GENETIC 
TECHNOLOGIES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 23, 1996 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-47, an act respecting human reproductive 
technologies and commercial transactions relating to human 
reproduction, be now read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
subject of Bill C-47 is of very great importance for citizens.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Human reproduction is a topic that affects everyone, without 
exception, and as parliamentarians it is our duty to debate this bill 
in a mature and thoughtful manner.
<P>
	For the very reason that the topic is both private and universal in 
scope, many of the issues are emotionally charged. As proof, we 
need look no further than the debates on abortion, assisted 
reproduction, protection of the foetus, contraceptive methods and 
genetic engineering.
<P>
	These topics speak to something in all of us, because they 
concern our origins, our lives right now and the lives of our 
descendants. Think, for example, of the recent strong reactions to 
the case of the British woman who received fertility treatments. 
Against the advice of her doctors, this woman conceived eight 
foetuses and lost them all. The reason this story captured the 
world's attention is that each and every one of us reacts 
instinctively to the new reality of reproduction and the questions it 
raises. When human life is involved, all human beings react, and 
this is completely understandable.
<P>
	In order to deal with this reality, the responsibility of elected 
representatives in this House is to determine the best approach to 
adopt in light of the scientific developments that now make it 
possible to influence considerably the reproduction of Canadians 
and of Quebecers.
<P>
	In this bill, the government is proposing an approach based on 
the recommendations contained in the Baird Commission report. 
The commission thoroughly examined all related issues and even 
went beyond its original mandate, because the range of problems 
was so immense.
<P>
	The bill on new reproductive technologies was placed on our 
legislative agenda because the voluntary interim moratorium 
imposed last year did not work. However, before attempting an 
analysis of the bill, I would like to make a few general comments 
which, as I see it, should precede any discussion of a bill that deals 
specifically with new human reproductive technologies.
<P>
	All the authors, all the experts who have examined the issue of 
new reproductive technologies are unanimous in saying that this is 
first and foremost a matter of ethics, of moral and social values.
<P>
	Although on the whole I do not agree with the recommendations 
of the Baird commission-I will get back to this during subsequent 
debates-I agree it has a wealth of expertise, based on the amount 
of testimony it heard and the number of experts that were 
consulted.
<P>
	These experts claim they are aware of the problems raised by 
new reproductive techniques, problems that are not only legal, 
ethical or health problems. Research and development and the use 
of new reproductive techniques have raised national concerns that 
may be social, ethical, legal, medical, economic or otherwise and 
that are of interest to more than one level of authority.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the commission concluded that the federal 
government should take all aspects of the issue in hand and 
regulate and manage them without taking into consideration the 
jurisdictions of the parties concerned and the reality of Quebec 
society. The Bloc Quebecois deplores this fact.
<P>
	It is the same old story we all know. In fact, I will get back to this 
a little later in my speech.
<P>
	So these are moral concerns above all, which I feel raises the 
initial question whether legislation is necessary.
<P>
	The experience of France, which two years ago passed 
legislation that is roughly comparable to the bill before the House 
today, is very revealing.
<P>
	France passed legislation on in vitro fertilization, prenatal 
diagnosis, pre-implant diagnosis and other aspects of reproductive 
technology.
<P>
	However, it was decided to refrain for the time being from 
passing legislation on such sensitive issues as surplus embryos and 
embryo reduction.
<P>
	In an article published in the magazine l'<I>Express</I> in February 
1994, the author, Luc Ferry, discussed several problems. He noted 
first of all that technically assisted productive techniques are so 
controversial that one wonders whether it was really necessary to 
pass legislation to deal with such a sensitive area.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5943"> 5943 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	The question arises because of the complexity of the biological 
phenomena and the minute percentage of the population that is 
actually concerned.
<P>
	In fact, several observers felt that since the number of cases was 
so small, it would have been preferable to let the courts decide on 
the merits of each case.
<P>
	The author mentioned several problems that were difficult to 
regulate because of practical considerations and the issue of ethics 
and individual freedom. For instance, how could one actually 
prevent the use of prenatal diagnosis for sex selection when parents 
do not tell their physician the real reasons for having this done.
<P>
	Another difficult situation is the one where a woman uses donor 
insemination to ensure that her offspring is entirely different from 
herself, for instance, a woman of colour, because she has 
experienced racism, will select a donor who is white, so that her 
child will not have to face certain problems.
<P>
	Similarly, a woman could give birth after menopause. This 
possibility has caused a controversy, the reason being that nature 
was prevented from taking its course. But what about freedom of 
choice?
<P>
	One might also consider the phenomena I mentioned earlier such 
as embryo reduction, when in order to allow some embryos to 
survive, the others are destroyed, and surplus embryos, when more 
than the requisite number is produced and then preserved for use in 
case the initial procedure fails.
<P>
	Clearly, all these situations have a number of aspects that are not 
medical at all and can hardly be regulated with rigid and specific 
legislation. Nevertheless, they are all connected with human 
reproductive technologies.
<P>
	So initially, we must ensure that we properly identify the scope 
of these problems and their complexity, before we can pass 
appropriate legislation.
<P>
	I would now like to consider the general scope of the bill 
introduced by the Minister of Health. I will wait until third reading 
to give a detailed analysis of the bill. Today, I will broach only one 
subject which has even broader consequences, and I am referring to 
the fact that this is one more intrusion by the federal government in 
an area under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	First of all, I would like to remind the House that the Bloc 
Quebecois has asked time and time again that the government take 
action in an area falling under its own jurisdiction: criminal law.
<P>
	Indeed, the Bloc Quebecois believes that certain practices should 
be prohibited under the Criminal Code, as they are not socially 
acceptable to the vast majority of citizens. We had asked that 
practices such as the trade in ova, embryos and foetal tissue be 
criminalized.
<P>
	In fact, the report states, on page 447, and I quote: 
``Commissioners are strongly opposed to commercializing human 
reproduction, as are Canadians generally. We heard clearly from 
Canadians that they are uncomfortable with any situation involving 
the development of reproductive technologies or services on the 
basis of their profit potential, particularly where only those with 
the means to pay can have access to them''.
<P>
	This is a social consensus the Bloc Quebecois agrees with.
<P>
	However, we totally disagree with the situation where, in the 
name of federal government's power to ensure peace, order and 
good government, the commissioners suggest that the government 
have sole jurisdiction over anything having to do with human 
reproduction. That spoils it for us, and we strongly disagree.
<P>
	To understand this conclusion, we must analyze the 
commissioners' reasoning. First, they state that because of the 
concepts and practices involved new reproductive technologies are 
unique. Also, the primary purpose of these techniques is to ensure 
procreation, with all the distinct historical, social and ethical 
implications that it may have.
<P>
	Such logic is hard to accept. Based on the same logic, the federal 
government should have jurisdiction over anything occuring during 
the perinatal period, since birth is the final outcome of the 
procreation process.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	The federal government would also have full jurisdiction over 
education, the environment, health and what not, all on the basis of 
uniqueness.
<P>
	The fact that something is important to human beings is not a 
valid reason to give a level of government control over an area that 
does not fall under its jurisdiction. You are probably familiar with 
Quebec's position on the matter, which is: anything coming under 
provincial jurisdiction should be left to the provinces to deal with.
<P>
	The reported stated further: ``New reproductive technologies 
are, in many ways, unique in Canada's health care system, in that 
they are administered under the jurisdiction of the provinces and 
territories, but, because of their profound social, ethical and legal 
implications, raise issues that require national attention. Few 
individuals or families in this country are not touched in some way 
by new reproductive technologies''.
<P>
	The commissioners themselves agree that this is a societal issue 
relating to health.
<P>
	On the one hand, as far as we know, health comes under the 
jurisdiction of the provinces because they are in a better position to 
make appropriate decisions for their people.
<P>
	On the other hand, precisely because we are dealing with social 
values, it is obvious that this should be a provincial jurisdiction. To 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5944"> 5944 </A></B>
<P>
act any differently would deny, once again, the existence of Quebec 
as a society, with all its elements and its differences.
<P>
	We will not accept any such thing, it is out of the question.
<P>
	There is also no question of the Bloc Quebecois supporting a bill 
containing provisions to establish a Canadian reproductive 
technologies control and monitoring agency. In our opinion, if the 
provinces are capable of enforcing the Criminal Code, they are also 
perfectly capable of making and enforcing regulations relating to 
health.
<P>
	In fact, they already do, and the thought has not crossed the mind 
of anyone at the federal level to question their jurisdiction in that 
area. So why do it in another area?
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois squarely rejects the government's approach, 
whereby it will pass a statutory act instead of criminalizing 
unacceptable practices.
<P>
	We repeatedly asked the government to amend the Criminal 
Code. Instead, it proposes a federal act, whose implementation will 
be monitored by a federal body, while applicable penalties will be 
imposed under the sole authority of the federal government. This is 
what is unacceptable.
<P>
	So, instead of letting the provinces implement the act through 
their courts and legal staff, as is the case with the Criminal Code, 
the federal government totally excludes them and takes over 
everything that relates to new reproductive technologies.
<P>
	Again, the Bloc Quebecois will say no to this new intrusion.
<P>
	One year after the Quebec referendum, it is appropriate to 
remind the Prime Minister and his cabinet of the commitment they 
made to Quebecers in the heat of the federalist fervour that 
prevailed at the time. Quebecers were solemnly promised, and 
unfortunately too many of them believed it again, that federalism 
would be renewed, that powers would be decentralized, and that 
provinces would be given back the fields of jurisdiction, which are 
already theirs on paper.
<P>
	How can we reconcile these fine promises with the bill before us 
today? It is impossible. Far from decentralizing, the federal 
government wants to get more involved in the health sector and, 
worse still, it wants to appropriate all future rights in this sector. 
This is unacceptable.
<P>
	Once again, the fine rhetoric was just that, and I hope Quebecers 
will remember. This is yet another good example.
<P>
	This bill is unacceptable because it infringes on the jurisdiction 
of the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague for her speech and for all of the information she has 
provided to us concerning the new reproductive technologies and 
Bill C-47.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	I would now like to make some comments and ask her a 
question.
<P>
	First of all,I would like to give a quick review of what has led up 
to Bill C-47. As you know, in 1977 a group of feminists put 
pressure on the government for the creation of a royal commission. 
Twelve years later, in a throne speech, the promise of this famous 
commission was made, and the Baird Commission was born.
<P>
	In 1993, the Baird Commission tabled its final report. There 
were 40,000 witnesses heard, and 300 researchers provided us with 
their research data. This cost $30 million dollars in total, and lasted 
two years longer than planned. In other words, they took four years 
to deliberate and to come up with 293 recommendations.
<P>
	I would like to make one clarification. The entire inquiry went 
on without consulting those in the best position to respond to the 
needs of the public, that is the provinces, the provincial ministers 
of health. Not one province was consulted by the Baird 
Commission about these new technologies, they were left on the 
sidelines, not asked if they had any recommendations to make to 
us, totally ignored.
<P>
	The result is a report rather similar to the main thrust of Great 
Britain's Warnock report. As you know, Great Britain's federation 
is not in the least like ours. Its provinces do not have the same 
powers as ours do at this time. This report, therefore, bears no 
relevance to the needs and demands of our provinces.
<P>
	While this report urging the government to introduce a bill was 
tabled in 1993, a decision was made to impose a voluntary 
moratorium in July 1995 because some of the latest developments 
in reproductive technologies were totally unethical.
<P>
	Can you tell me what a voluntary moratorium means when 
researchers and scientists are now involved in cloning and 
producing human-animal hybrids? There is a voluntary 
moratorium in effect. It should be pointed out that experts and 
researchers reacted to this voluntary moratorium with complete 
indifference. It was a failure, it did not make any sense.
<P>
	In June 1996, the minister tabled a bill. Although measures in 
this area have been demanded for 20 years, the bill that was tabled 
is not only incomplete and impossible to understand, but it also 
ignores provincial needs under the Constitution, because the 
provinces are responsible for providing health care services.
<P>
	This bill criminalizes certain activities without amending the 
Criminal Code. This makes it a parallel law allowing the federal 
government to impose national standards. And this is what the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5945"> 5945 </A></B>
<P>
government does by implementing the bill in three stages. First, it 
prohibits certain procedures, which we agree should be 
criminalized although we feel the government should not interfere 
in areas like health care. According to the Constitution, the 
provinces have jurisdiction over health care.
<P>
<B>(1325)</B>
<P>
	The government is quietly putting forward a minor parallel bill 
in order to centralize even further. I will give a concrete example: 
the proposed national agency, which will impose national standards 
and be in charge of controlling and monitoring activities.
<P>
	The bill also provides that the minister reserves the right to make 
appointments to a supposedly distinct, independent agency, but all 
the administrators in this agency will be appointed by the minister. 
You may not see things the way I do, but if this is not the ultimate 
in centralization, I do not know what it is.
<P>
	Furthermore, some of the clauses in this bill are rather vague. 
Even the title contains an inconsistency between the French and the 
English text: the phrase ``manipulation génétique'' in the French 
version is more restrictive than the words used in English.
<P>
	In closing, I would ask my colleague from Québec to elaborate 
on clause 5, just to show you how vague and confusing the clauses 
can be.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
comments. She explained very well how, with this statutory act, the 
federal government will interfere in a field of provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I wish to reply to my colleague regarding clause 5, which deals 
with surrogate mothers and which prohibits anyone from giving or 
offering consideration to obtain the services of a surrogate mother. 
This prohibition seeks to prevent the payment of money and the use 
of intermediaries.
<P>
	Consequently, a woman could act as a surrogate mother, if she 
did so as a free service. The clause is not very clear, particularly in 
subclause 3, which reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) No person, other than the surrogate mother, shall arrange or offer to 
arrange-the services of a surrogate mother.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	On the one hand, the bill makes it impossible for someone to 
give or to offer consideration, while on the other hand it allows a 
surrogate mother to make arrangements for her services. Let us be 
clear. It should be either one or the other.
<P>
	The purpose of this provision is to prevent the negotiating of 
amounts of money for bearing children, through intermediaries 
between a couple and a surrogate mother. However, the situation 
becomes totally different if the service is provided free of charge, 
or if it is negotiated by the surrogate mother herself.
<P>
	This is where we have reservations. The stated objective will not 
be met, because the bill does not reflect a clear and well defined 
will. One can easily imagine that this provision will be 
circumvented. Moreover, the provisions of the Quebec Civil Code 
confirm that contracts entered into by surrogate mothers are 
absolutely null and void.
<P>
	I mentioned clause 5, but there is also clause 7, which prohibits 
the use, without the consent of the donor, of sperm, ova or 
embryos, for human reproductive technologies or for medical 
research. Again, several terms used in the provisions of the bill 
create problems because of their lack of clarity.
<P>
	For example, clause 4 prohibits the use of any diagnostic 
procedure for the purpose of ascertaining the sex, except for 
reasons related to health. What are these health related reasons? Is 
the mental health of the woman one of them? Are we talking about 
the health of the foetus or of the parents? Again, the wording of the 
bill is not clear.
<P>
	Here is another example of lack of clarity that can lead us to 
believe that these prohibitions are not for real. Clause 7 prohibits 
the use of sperm, ova, embryos or zygotes for the purpose of 
research, donation, maturation or fertilization without the consent 
of the donors involved. Again, it can be presumed that such 
activities will be allowed if donors give their consent.
<P>
<B>(1330)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism) (Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support Bill C-47, 
the Human Reproductive and Genetic Technologies Act, which 
seeks to preserve the dignity and the sanctity of human 
reproduction, and the dignity and safety of all.
<P>
	The bill seeks three objectives. Protecting the health and safety 
of Canadians is one of them.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to comment on the remarks of the hon. member for 
Quebec. The member spoke clearly to the fact that the whole idea 
of the royal commission's report was not appropriate.
<P>
	The point to remember is that the commission on reproductive 
technologies was a federal royal commission. When it was finished 
and the report was made public, over 50 stakeholder groups were 
consulted over a long period of time to decide on some of these 
issues, how the public saw them and what the public's interests 
were in them.
<P>
	I first have to address some of those issues because there is a 
misunderstanding or a misrepresentation of them. I also want to 
address some of the aspects of the issue raised earlier by the 
member for Drummond and to correct some of the 
misinterpretation of facts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5946"> 5946 </A></B>
<P>
	The member for Drummond claimed that in 1977 a coalition 
of feminist groups called for a royal commission on new 
reproductive technologies. The coalition was formed in 1987 and 
the first IVF baby was not born until 1978. The member for 
Drummond seems to have overlooked her party's record on the 
whole issue of the bill.
<P>
	The member continually asked for the report to be tabled and for 
decisions to be made concerning the royal commission report. On 
May 4, 1994 she complained in the House that the government was 
too slow to act on the report. She said that such an action would 
have a major impact on ethics and research.
<P>
	On October 7, 1994 her colleague from Laval Centre called for 
the government to table a bill to regulate practices connected with 
new reproductive technology.
<P>
	On December 9, 1994 the member for Laval Centre said in the 
House that it was increasingly clear that the commercialization of 
human genetic material, embryos and fetal tissue was growing in 
Canada. She called for regulation in this area as soon as possible.
<P>
	When the government placed a voluntary moratorium on some 
of these techniques in July 1995 there was criticism from the hon. 
members that the government was not going far enough, that there 
were no real sanctions against those who would continue with these 
practices.
<P>
	What is more, the member for Laval Centre held a press 
conference on February 19, 1996 to complain that the government 
was not acting quickly enough on the issue. She demanded 
immediate action to have the more egregious of these practices 
inscribed in the Criminal Code.
<P>
	On June 5, 1996 the member for Drummond repeated that this 
area was in urgent need of legislation. Now we have before us the 
long awaited legislation. Based on the record of the members 
opposite I fully anticipate their support.
<P>
	The bill is about ethical considerations. All technology needs to 
be regulated. The good that is done by a new technology must be 
checked against the harm or the potential for harm that can be done 
by that technology. The number one ethic of physicians is to 
consider first the well-being of the patient and to do no harm.
<P>
	The bill specifically set out to control unethical and unsafe uses 
of new reproductive technologies and to regulate practices that are 
unacceptable to ensure that they are offered to Canadians in an 
effective and safe way.
<P>
	Many Canadians will be affected by these technologies but more 
especially women and children. Some prohibitions clearly address 
serious ethical issues the technology is forcing us as a society to 
consider: cloning and creating animal human hybrids, to name only 
two. However we cannot forget that it is women who are most 
deeply affected by these technologies, that they are practised 
almost exclusively on women's bodies.
<P>
	Commercial surrogacy, for instance, the practice of bearing a 
child for another party in return for payment, brings forward shades 
of <I>The Handmaid's Tale</I> by Margaret Atwood. Commercial 
surrogacy violates the dignity of women by reducing procreation to 
a market phenomenon and parenthood to a transaction. Women's 
reproductive functions become commodities to be bought or sold. 
Women are not commodities.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Women who are surrogates tend to be younger, less educated and 
have lower incomes than the couples who commissioned them to 
bear a child. The imbalance of resources and power means that the 
surrogate mother is vulnerable to infringement of her autonomy. 
No matter how willing she is to participate she cannot negotiate on 
an equal footing with the other parties involved.
<P>
	With regard to the commercial sale of eggs and sperm, a woman 
who agrees to sell her eggs takes risks with her health and her 
well-being. Generally this woman is perfectly healthy and she is 
certainly not infertile. Yet this healthy fertile woman will be 
prescribed fertility drugs to stimulate multiple egg production. She 
will undergo painful medical interventions to retrieve those eggs 
and in exchange she will earn $2,000 or less. The government will 
not permit a payment based system of egg donations to develop in 
Canada.
<P>
	As a physician I have often seen the joy and the wonder of the 
birth process. In fact I have delivered over 800 babies myself. I find 
the idea of seeing reproduction transformed into a commercial act 
to be completely unacceptable. Women are deeply affected by 
these reproductive technologies. In many instances some are no 
more than experimentation on women's bodies.
<P>
	What of the children born of these technologies? The greatest 
threat to children's emotional well-being arises out of the use of 
donated eggs and sperm. The elements that have characterized the 
sperm donation system as it developed in Canada are secrecy and 
anonymity.
<P>
	Closely related to secrecy is the principle of anonymity where 
the identity of the sperm donor is kept from both the recipient and 
the child. The pressure of maintaining the secret of donor 
insemination can place tremendous strains on a family. Adult 
children born through donor insemination have testified to the 
harm that maintaining secrecy has caused them, particularly if the 
truth emerges in the middle of a family crisis.
<P>
	Anonymity too causes great strain for children finally aware of 
their birth through the use of donated eggs and sperm who want 
information about their genetic parents, only to find that it is not 
available.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5947"> 5947 </A></B>
<P>
	We know that the health status of people is dependent on their 
genetic and familial history. Research in adoption has revealed the 
importance of information about birth parents to a child's physical 
and emotional well-being.
<P>
	As part of its commitment to comprehensive management for 
new reproductive and genetic technologies, the government is 
examining the implications of a more open system of information 
both in gamete and embryo donation. It is appropriate to insist as a 
government that children born of these technologies be given a full 
disclosure of his or her history because the health and well-being of 
children have to be of paramount importance in the decisions we 
make about new reproductive and genetic technology.
<P>
	The value of children in our society is self-evident but it is 
important to state firmly and unequivocally that children are not a 
means to an end. They are of value not only because of any great 
gifts that they possess, not because of the way in which they fulfil 
their parents dreams and not even because of the joy they bring to 
their parents. Children are of value merely because they exist, 
because they are.
<P>
	The government values children. It believes that the hallmark by 
which our society can be judged is the priority placed on the 
interests and well-being of its children. The government has 
established a transparent and explicit framework for its policy on 
new reproductive and genetic policies.
<P>
	Concern for children's interests is a vital aspect of that 
framework. We have approached the issue of children and new 
reproductive technologies from the perspective of the need to 
protect those who are vulnerable to adverse consequences of the 
technologies. Who indeed is more vulnerable than a child?
<P>
	These technologies affect children in different ways apart from 
their emotional and physical well-being. Some practices and 
procedures have consequences so adverse and so easily apparent 
that prohibition is the only possible response. The consequences of 
other uses of technologies, adverse or otherwise, are less obvious 
or are controllable through regulation as we are trying to do.
<P>
	The government is saying some practices must be regulated and 
some practices must be absolutely prohibited. These include the 
implication for the child's health and for the child's long term 
well-being. Serious issues about the legal status of children must be 
raised.
<P>
	By putting forward this legislation we have said that some 
procedures are so abhorrent that there is no alternative but to 
prohibit them and to set criminal penalties for their use because 
they all are practices that have turned children into commodities to 
bought or to be sold. This is why the legislation makes it criminal 
to buy or sell human sperm or eggs. Sperm and eggs are the 
building blocks of human life. To make them into commodities 
subject to the conditions of the market is to commodify them, to 
turn them into products. This in turn is dehumanizing. It will affect 
in the long run the way we as a society value children and how we 
value human life.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	Permitting payment for sperm and eggs also increases the 
possibilities of health problems for the children who might be born 
as a result. Studies have shown that when a donation is made for 
payment, donors have less reason to be honest about the state of 
their health and about their family history.
<P>
	The prohibition on cloning is obvious to everyone in terms of its 
impact on the health of children. We simply do not know the health 
implications of creating large numbers of genetically identical 
people, either for individual children or for the population as a 
whole. We only have to read <I>Boys from Brazil</I> to know what we are 
talking about.
<P>
	The use of fetal eggs to create a human embryo could be harmful 
if they are from a miscarried fetus since genetic disorders in the 
fetus usually are one of the major causes of miscarriage.
<P>
	Children's physical health can be seriously damaged from using 
many of these technologies. It can be affected in the short term and 
in the long term. We do not know enough about the long term 
effects of some of these technologies on children. These children 
have not lived long enough in their life span for us to see some of 
the effects on their lives. We are taking risks in experimenting with 
children in Canada.
<P>
	Canadian and American studies have shown that 20 per cent to 
25 per cent of low birth weight babies suffer some form of serious 
disability and will continue to need attention and care in varying 
degrees for much of their lives.
<P>
	Other health effects of new reproductive technologies are simply 
not known right now. That is why the advent of technologies such 
as intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, has to be treated with 
a great deal of caution.
<P>
	ICSI helps to overcome male infertility by selecting just one 
sperm, often an immature or inferior sperm, and injecting it into 
the centre of the eggs. The use of ICSI is spreading rapidly 
throughout the world, including in Canada.
<P>
	We do not know until the children born through this technique 
reach adulthood if that sperm was a healthy sperm. If it turns out 
that the sperm would have been much better through natural 
selection not to have been fertilized at all, it is not the physicians 
who will suffer and not even the parents. It is the children who will 
bear the greatest burden of the use of this technology in the long 
run.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5948"> 5948 </A></B>
<P>
	We do not know what effects fertility drugs may have on 
children. Yet we use these drugs now almost routinely. We do not 
know if there is some damage involved in being fertilized in vitro 
instead of in a woman's body. Gathering information about the 
long term outcomes of assisted reproduction for children is one 
of the functions the government would assign to a regulatory 
structure as outlined in the position paper that was released when 
Bill C-47 was first introduced into the House.
<P>
	Physical harm is just one aspects of genetic technology. Let us 
talk a bit about sex selection which is prohibited in the legislation 
because it contravenes the government commitment to 
safeguarding the emotional well-being of children. A child who 
knows that he or she was born only because of being the right sex 
may not feel valued. The sibling of such a child may feel forever 
unworthy of their parent's love and care because of having been the 
wrong sex.
<P>
	It is only one small step when we undertake some of these 
prohibitive technologies to genetic, ethnic and gender 
manipulation of our society as a whole.
<P>
	It is clear to me, as it should be clear to members of the House, 
that Bill C-47 is a balanced response to the dangers posed by the 
unhampered proliferation of reproductive technology. It does not 
say that reproductive technology is inherently bad. It says that we 
do not know enough about some of them, and it says that some of 
them do not fit into our society's attitudes to human rights and to 
people.
<P>
	It makes clear that human life and human dignity are not for sale 
at any price. It is the only possible way to reassure Canadians that 
our societal values are being respected, that we place a value on the 
rights of all of our people regardless of their gender or their age, 
and that we will allow neither to be so crassly exploited.

	<B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to speak to this topic today, a topic that gives me the 
shivers. As you know, when we talk about reproductive 
technologies, we are talking about research, genetic engineering, 
all sorts of things. It is a debate that could not have taken place 30 
years ago. As research advances, we must ask ourselves serious 
questions, and I am glad that we are discussing them. This is a field 
of medicine that was once in the realm of fiction, but has now 
become reality. We can see what the consequences will be in the 
longer term.
<P>
	I was listening to the speech by my colleague across the way, on 
the government side, and there are certainly a number of points on 
which we do not agree. What bothers me the most, as I have just 
said, in such an extremely delicate matter-

	<B>Hon. Ethel Blondin-Andrew (Secretary of State (Training 
and Youth), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today on a 
point of personal privilege to address the issue of my use of 
government credit cards and to clarify outstanding questions and 
concerns.
<P>
	When I was appointed Secretary of State for Training and Youth 
by the Prime Minister in November 1993 I was provided with both 
En Route and American Express credit cards by the Department of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	At that time I was fully advised of the departmental guidelines 
governing the use of these credit cards. It was clear to me then, as it 
is today, that I would be responsible to the department for the full 
reimbursement of all personal expenses incurred.
<P>
	Since being issued these credit cards I have both incurred 
business and personal expenses. I have never hidden or denied this. 
As a matter of routine procedure I have fully reimbursed the 
Receiver General for any personal purchases. This has been my 
practice since day one.
<P>
	I have always known that my record of credit card use was 
subject to public review under access to information and I have 
never acted to hide records or to mislead the public. For the record, 
I would like to note the following three points.
<P>
	I never asked for the use of a government credit card and I 
certainly never asked for special treatment or exemption from 
applicable guidelines.
<P>
	The administrative procedure in place for repayment of monthly 
credit card statements was of departmental design. I had no say or 
input into this procedure.
<P>
	Yesterday in the House the member for Elk Island referred to a 
memo dated January 22, 1996. He did not mention that attached to 
this memo was a personal cheque to cover all non-departmental 
expenses. He did not mention that also attached to this memo was 
an itemized breakdown of those expenses with complete notation 
of personal expenses. He did not mention that five days prior to this 
expense claim on January 17 my office sent a memo to the

department outlining what my personal expenses were and pointing 
out that I would be submitting a cheque for them.
<P>
	I admit this administrative procedure is very convoluted. The 
covering memo referred to by the member for Elk Island is a form 
document prepared by departmental officials and as a stand alone 
record is misleading. In fact, my staff raised this concern with HRD 
officials and requested a revised covering memo that more 
accurately reflected business and personal expenses. A copy of that 
revised memo forms part of the subsequent record and certainly 
predates any access to information request.
<P>
	During the three years that I have used these cards I have not 
once been advised that I was in breach of departmental guidelines.
<P>
	To the Canadian public, my constituents, my family of course 
and my loyal friends, Mr. Speaker, I want to assure you that at no 
time did I use these credit cards in bad faith or for personal 
financial benefit.
<P>
<B>(1350 )</B>
<P>
	The suggestion in the media that I have used government credit 
cards for the purchase of vacation airline tickets to Hawaii and 
Mexico is simply false. I did vacation in Hawaii. I like to think that 
I have worked hard for my money and deserved the vacation. I paid 
for my airline tickets with cash. I have the receipts which I can 
make available to the media.
<P>
	I have also travelled to Mexico and I have a cancelled personal 
cheque to confirm my payment of those airline tickets.
<P>
	On the charge of purchasing a fur coat with a government credit 
card, I can only say that a deposit of $554.53 was required and that 
a credit card imprint was needed. That expense was promptly 
reimbursed. Like many Canadians I now have an outstanding 
balance and I am on a monthly repayment plan with the retailer.
<P>
	Finally, I am in full agreement with the Prime Minister and his 
observation that while conforming to departmental guidelines, my 
use of government credit cards for personal purchases was a 
mistake and in poor judgment. As a northerner with much of my 
time spent in remote communities with no access to financial 
services, I have not had any previous need for a personal credit 
card.
<P>
	With the benefit of hindsight I see that reliance on government 
issued credit cards was a mistake. Following discussions with the 
ethics commissioner, I have applied for and received a personal 
credit card for all non-departmental purchases.
<P>
	At this time, I am prepared to table documentation in the House 
to support my statement on this issue. I ask for unanimous consent 
to table this documentation.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there unanimous consent?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am not sure if this is a question of privilege. 
Surely it is a statement by the minister. I am going to permit the 
hon. member for Elk Island to make an intervention because his 
name was directly mentioned in the statement.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. 
I also appreciate the member rising in the House today. My purpose 
has been and will be to bring accountability for the taxpayers of 
this country.
<P>
	I have something to say about some of the allegations she has 
made with respect to the fact that I did not mention the cheque that 
was attached, that I did not mention the itemization. Try as we 
might, we could not get that data. We received information that had 
more white-outs, in fact, over half of the items were whited out. We 
did not have that data. That is exactly what we were driving at.
<P>
	We want that information to be available so there is open 
accountability, as the Prime Minister promised in the red book and 
in other places. That is the intent.
<P>
	We are now going to examine what the minister tabled. I hope 
we can put this to rest. If not, our pressure will continue.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> We have a statement made by an hon. member of 
Parliament. We have an intervention by the other hon. member who 
was mentioned. I would rule that this is not a point of privilege. 
However, I am prepared to accept the documentation, as you have 
indicated that I should by unanimous consent.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	Therefore, I now consider this matter to be closed. It is not a 
point of privilege. It is a point of information. And the information, 
now being part of the proceedings of this day, are available to all 
members of Parliament and any other interested groups.
<P>

<P>
	My dear colleague from Lac-Saint-Jean was in the middle of his 
question. I wonder if we could perhaps set aside the question and 
you could put it again after question period, at which time the hon. 
minister will be able to reply.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being almost 2 o'clock and since we always need a little more 
time to get in all of our statements, with your permission I am

indeed, ready to make them.

donors of building materials who were instrumental in the 
renovation and relocation of the one room school, S.S. No. 14,

	This one room school, which has been in existence for over 100

demolition, they asked the township of Enniskillen to consider 
donating the building to them to relocate on the Discovery site.

Industries Inc., winner of entrepreneur of the year award at 
Kelowna's Business Excellence Awards this past week.
<P>
	Four and one half year ago in my constituency of Okanagan 
Centre, Greg Webb told his family, ``it is our turn'' and formed a 
steel manufacturing company. From a one-man operation, the firm 
today employs 65 people manufacturing parts for Western Star 
trucks and Newness Sawmill manufacturers. They also build 
hydraulic pumps for the oil industry in Alberta and supply the 
stainless steel skirting for an upscale motor home manufacturer in 
the United States.
<P>
	Mr. Webb has developed a widely diversified company that is 
not dependent on a single market sector. He attributes his success 
to good networking skills and treating people as they should be 
treated.

	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
concern is increasing for the welfare of six Kurdish trade union 
officials arrested by Turkish security forces. These arrests highlight 
a now longstanding criticism that my NDP colleagues and I have 
expressed about the way the Turkish state treats the Kurdish people 
living in Turkey.
<P>
	The suggestion has been made by the Canadian Kurdish 
Information Network that the Red Cross be allowed to visit the 
Kurdish region. This is a good idea and Canadian support for it 
should be accompanied by much stronger objections on the part of 
Canada about the behaviour of the Turkish authorities.
<P>
	The six trade unionists and others who have been similarly 
treated should be returned safely to their families. Turkish 
membership in NATO should not blind us to their faults or make 
Canada more silent about Turkish treatment of Kurds than we are 
when Kurdish minorities are being mistreated in other countries.
<P>
	The Kurdish people are currently without a homeland of their 
own. Perhaps some day that will change. But in the meantime it is 
up to the international community and countries like Canada to 
make sure their human rights are respected.

	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today is the last day of breast cancer awareness month. I would like 
to remind everyone that in Canada over 17,000 women are 
diagnosed every year with breast cancer. This means that every day 
an average of 49 Canadian women come to know of their problem.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of these women, 5,400 die every year, and 15 die every day. 
Unfortunately, very little is known about this illness. Its cause is 
still a mystery.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The cure remains elusive. Too many women put off self 
examination of their breasts day after day due to fear. This 
diminishes their chances to beat the disease.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Only the families and friends of women with this form of cancer 
know the tragedy that has befallen them. Only those who see a 
woman die of breast cancer know what it really means.
<P>
	Research is necessary, but for that we need money and the 
government must continue to provide assistance.

Mr. Speaker, every year, Halloween brings us its procession of

released a most troubling apparition: the former grand sorcerer 
Parizeau came back from the grave to haunt his successor, whom 
he accused of being too timid about promoting sovereignty.
<P>
	As soon as he saw the ghost of his master appear on the horizon, 
the little goblin from Roberval, like a frightened child, rushed to 
point his finger at his ex-leader Lucien Bouchard, stating: ``I am 
not the one who does not talk any more about sovereignty''.
<P>
	The Leader of the Bloc Quebecois would be hard pressed to hide 
his true colours now that we have seen through his disguise. At the 
next election, the leader of the Bloc will go back to sit on Jacques

launched its national public awareness campaign called 
``Menopause: Let's talk about it''. It is the first time in North 
America that a medical association launched such a significant 
campaign on the subject.
<P>
	Between now and the year 2000, more than 40 million women in 
North America will be going through menopause, including 4 
million in Canada. In other words, every ten seconds during the 
next 20 years, a woman in the baby-boomer generation will reach 
the age of menopause.
<P>
	Menopause is no longer a taboo subject, but much remains to be 
done about prevention, since menopause increases, for instance, 
the risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Women today 
can expect to live at least 30 years after menopause.

	While some may believe a moment of silence is appropriate for

counsellor had not seen the minister's expense account, nor her 
written statement, when he made his decision. We know the Prime 
Minister's propensity for defending his ministers right to the limit, 
and sometimes beyond.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Prime Minister, and he is the one under 
scrutiny in this matter, how he justifies his statement of yesterday 
that he had checked with the ethics counsellor, when the latter has 
apparently said that he had seen neither the expense account nor the 
secretary of state's statement. I would like him to give us some 
explanations.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as in every matter of this nature, the ethics counsellor was 
advised of the problem. He spoke with the secretary of state. He 
then concluded that the explanation was satisfactory.
<P>
	Allusion has been made in this House to a document that he had 
not seen, but that had apparently been explained to him verbally. 
When he saw the document, it confirmed the version given by the 
secretary of state.
<P>
	I accept the completely acceptable version given in the House by 
the secretary of state.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the question is not about the secretary of state. I took the 
trouble to point out that we accepted her explanations. That is not 
what is at issue. What is at issue is the Prime Minister's propensity 
for defending his government at all costs, with or without 
justification.
<P>
	When, without taking the facts into consideration, the Prime 
Minister has relied on an opinion given by the ethics counsellor, 
how can he claim this opinion is of any value, when it was arrived 
at solely on the strength of a few discussion, without all the 
documents having been seen? Of what use is the opinion of an 
ethics counsellor who has not looked into a matter thoroughly? 
That is the question.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the counsellor checked the document which was shown in 
this House. He analyzed it. As I was saying earlier, it was entirely 
consistent with the version given him by the hon. secretary of state.
<P>
	I have nothing to add. If the hon. member is not questioning the 
version given by the secretary of state, let him suit action to word 
and stop asking questions.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, with all due respect for the Prime Minister, I would like to 
say to him that I will ask all the questions I want, however I want. 
That is my affair, not his. And I would like him to be so kind as to 
answer the question.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	How can the Prime Minister justify having sought the opinion of 
the ethics counsellor without personally ensuring, in his capacity as 
Prime Minister, since it is a question of defending his government's 
integrity, that all the documents were brought to the counsellor's 
attention?
<P>
	Is that not the normal way to proceed, before holding up such an 
opinion to defend the integrity of his government? Would that not 
be wiser, more prudent, more reassuring to the Canadian public? 
And is not the purpose of seeking opinions of an ethics counsellor 
who does not have all the documents in his possession so that 
accommodating opinions will be given?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> I said, and I 
repeat, that all the documents were checked by the ethics 
counsellor and that the version given by the Secretary of State is 
the version behind the decision about which I informed the House 
yesterday, to the effect that there was no intention to harm in this 
administrative error. And, as it happened, when the additional 
document was shown to him, the ethics counsellor examined it and 
concluded that it in no way changed the decision he had initially 
made to inform me that there was reason to pursue the matter, that 
the version given by the secretary of state was acceptable.

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, this is not an actual quote, 
for the very good reason that what I said at the conference is that, 
when I became minister responsible for the CBC, I told them at the 
outset that I could not bypass the budgetary process already in 
place, but that I would fight for a $100 million programming fund.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance went ahead with this programming 
fund, 50 per cent of which will go to the CBC. That is what I said 
when I was appointed at the end of January. That is what I delivered 
with the finance minister's support.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it may not be an actual quote, but we saw it live on 
television. It was even better. Another minister who needs video 
evidence.
<P>
	Yesterday, the minister said she was working with her colleague, 
the Minister of Finance, on multi-year financing for the CBC. In 
fact, Southam reported last weekend, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The finance minister told reporters the government intends to do 
the right thing for the CBC after it has wrestled the deficit to the 
ground''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Will the Minister of Canadian Heritage again blame her finance 
colleague next March on television, whether or not it is an actual 
quote, for her government's future cuts to the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, as I said before many 
times in this House, like all government agencies, like 
Radio-Québec, the CBC has been cut. Unfortunately, the cuts the 
Quebec Minister of Culture had to make to Radio-Québec were 
even deeper than those at the CBC.
<P>
	We are all going through some difficult times, but I am confident 
that with the finance minister's support in the upcoming budgets, in 
the next budget, we will continue to strengthen the CBC for all 
Canadians.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government puts ministers in a very awkward spot by not revealing 
and making public the so-called ethical guidelines for cabinet 
ministers. Integrity means more than just saying I am sorry after 
the fact.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	The Prime Minister promised and promised again to restore 
public trust in our political institutions. Canadians deserve to see 
the ethical guidelines the government says it has come up with. It is 
not good enough for the Prime Minister to hide behind imaginary 
parliamentary tradition.
<P>
	In the interest of restoring public trust and confidence in this 
parliamentary institution, will the Prime Minister release his 
guidelines on ethics for cabinet ministers? Yes or no.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is a directive that the Prime Minister sends to his 
ministers for their guidance. Ethics cases are discussed when they 
come to the House of Commons. Members of Parliament and the 
press can look at the decisions that are made.
<P>
	On the case we discussed yesterday, I am satisfied with the 
explanation given by the Secretary of State earlier today.
<P>
	These are the facts. The member may not agree with the facts, 
but I am satisfied the Secretary of State has acted in good faith all 
along. All the bills have been repaid properly to the crown. There 
was some problem in the administration but no money was spent 
illegally or against any guidelines. It was done properly and all the 
money has been reimbursed properly in good time.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
not particularly keen on the Prime Minister just saying the facts. I 
want to see the facts and I think the Canadian public wants the 
same.
<P>
	This has been a very awkward spot. I wonder how many more 
cabinet ministers on the front bench are in the same position today. 
Maybe we should ask for a show of hands. Why would it be so 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5956"> 5956 </A></B>
<P>
strange or incongruous that one minister would get caught in this 
kind of bind yet there would not be others? Maybe we should ask 
for a show of hands. We have seen how well some of these systems 
work with these imaginary guidelines.
<P>
	Yesterday the Prime Minister said that he consulted the ethics 
counsellor about the youth minister's expense claims. Lo and 
behold, the ethics counsellor admitted that he had not seen the 
expense claims, that he just took people at their word.
<P>
	Let me ask the Prime Minister about their word, about his word 
and everyone else's word. Will he come good on his word in the red 
book that he would have an independent ethics counsellor who is 
responsible and reportable to Parliament, not just to him?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in the last analysis the person who is responsible for the 
conduct of all ministers is the Prime Minister of Canada. I maintain 
that and I have the responsibility.
<P>
	She will be the first one to know if I say someday that it is not 
my decision, that it is the decision of somebody else. As Prime 
Minister I have to take responsibility for the activities of all my 
ministers and I will not give that responsibility to someone else. I 
will always face all my responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
know what kind of comfort that is to his cabinet or the Canadian 
public watching right now.
<P>
	I sense a double standard. The former defence minister was 
forced to resign for a technical breach of the government's ethical 
guidelines. Whether the guidelines are public or private, we really 
do not know what they say. Cabinet ministers are supposed to know 
what they say but I am not sure they are entirely clear on it.
<P>
	The Prime Minister stubbornly defends the youth minister who 
in her estimation and I think in that of the Canadian public did 
something worse. She admitted today in the House of Commons 
that it was a mistake and we appreciate that.
<P>
	However, this minister knowingly signed a document on which 
she said these were government expenses. I will ask the Prime 
Minister one more time: Why is the defence minister called out on 
a technicality yet the youth minister is called safe for a blatant 
breach of the Prime Minister's guidelines and we do not even know 
what they say?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, days before the form was signed, the Secretary of State 
indicated that some elements of the expenditures were personal. 
The expenses were accounted for the same day. When she signed 
the document she attached a cheque to reimburse her personal 
expenses.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development. A 
Statistics Canada bulletin released  yesterday indicates that the 
number of employment insurance claims is at its lowest level since 
1981. However, we should not rejoice too soon, because the 
number of unemployed is now 55 per cent higher than in 1981.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister, who extols the virtues of his reform, tell us 
why the number of unemployed is currently so high, while the 
number of recipients is constantly decreasing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, allow me to answer the short 
digression of the member for Mercier. The fact is that 700,000 jobs 
have been created since 1993.
<P>
	As for the member's question, it is important to realize that the 
employment insurance act is the result of an extensive consultation 
process involving 100,000 Canadians. This legislation will prepare 
Canadians to enter the 21st century and to adjust to the new market 
reality.
<P>
	Using the actual number of hours worked results in a system that 
is more fair and better balanced. The new program currently allows 
an additional 500,000 people to be covered, including 270,000 
women.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, for July 
and August 1996 alone, the number of UI claimants dropped by 5.3 
per cent. According to Statistics Canada, this drop in the number of 
claimants and beneficiaries is due to the new legislation. Will the 
minister agree that, contrary to his comments, his reform deprives 
more than 50 per cent of those unemployed of the right to claim 
benefits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, we put a very high value on 
work. We value work and we do not want a passive system that 
encourages people not to look for work. On the contrary, we are 
investing in those who are prepared to get training and to take the 
necessary steps to find work.
<P>
	We are extremely pleased that our active return-to-work 
measures meet the needs of Canadians. What Canadians need in 
our new economy is to go back to work with the proper training.
<P>
	We are pleased that this reform meets the needs of my 
constituents in Papineau-Saint-Michel, including women who are 
poor and who are often unable to work more than a few hours per 
week. These women are now covered from the first hour of work 
and they are grateful to us for that.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the main

some $3 billion per year out of that program. The result is that this

<P>
	Will the health minister admit that every woman suffering from

list because of those cuts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member raises an important subject in terms of breast 
cancer. I do not think there is anyone in the House on either side of 
the aisle who is not supportive of initiatives as they relate to breast 
cancer.
<P>
	The government, in co-operation with a variety of different 
groups, is contributing a fair sum of money in terms of research 
and how we can effect positive solutions.
<P>
	Over the last number of years $25 million have been directed 
toward research. More has to be done.
<P>
	We have signed a memorandum of understanding with the 
United States to focus not only our capital and our money but our 
human resources to find the kinds of solutions women and society 
in general would like to have as they relate to breast cancer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, representatives 
of 44,000 Canadian doctors appeared in front of the finance 
committee this week. What did they ask for? I quote: ``Stop the 
devastating health care cuts''. They gave the Liberals a failing 
grade on medicare. They asked for a reinfusion of funds into 
medicare. Strangely that sounds a bit like Reform's fresh start on 
medicare.
<P>
<B>(1435)</B>
<P>
	Will the minister steal another plank from the Reform Party, do 
exactly what the Canadian doctors have asked and reinfuse more 
money into medicare?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
flip-flops and inconsistency have been characterizations of the 
members opposite.
<P>
	In September 1993 the leader of the third party said that his party 
``would support user fees or deductibles and would eliminate 
universality''. Days before the federal election in 1993 the Reform 
Party said it was opposed to private health care and user fees.
<P>
	If that is not a flip-flop, if that is not an inconsistency, I say to the 
hon. member to go back to med school and become a real spin 
doctor.

question is for the Minister of Industry. A study released today by 
Heritage Canada concludes that 97 per cent of the money paid in 
Canada by film distributors for Canadian productions comes from 
businesses which are under Canadian control, and that, 
proportionally, these Canadian-controlled distributors create six 
times more jobs than do foreign-controlled distribution companies.
<P>
	What is the minister waiting for to block Polygram's request, 
since there are no grounds to justify this foreign company's 
distributing films in Canada, particularly since this is categorically 
against Canadian policies in this area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as I explained to the hon. member for 
Rimouski-Témiscouata last week, it is impossible, under the 
Investment Canada Act, to discuss specifics while the issue is still 
before me.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to quote from the Heritage Canada study which says, among 
other things: ``We conclude that the Canadian distribution policy is 
well justified and continues to be pertinent, and that the 
consequences of its not being applied would be highly prejudicial 
to the Canadian industry- and contrary to the public interest''.
<P>
	In reality, what the minister is being asked to do is to ensure that 
Canadian cultural rules are respected and to not negotiate any 
cut-rate deals. Will the Minister of Industry assume his 
responsibilities, do his duty, and reject the Polygram application?

	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the

hon. member for Macleod has said that he does not support tobacco 
legislation. He said: ``I do not for one second believe that an 
advertising ban is the way to go''. Then on February 7 he wrote to 
me and said that he would give me unqualified support for the new 
strategy for tobacco advertising.
<P>
	Yesterday he said: ``Reformers see the answer to reducing 
tobacco consumption in education, not legislation''. But on June 
21, 1994 he said that education campaigns were not the way to go.
<P>
	Canadians and the House would like to know where the Reform

<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr.

	Since the government rolled back the taxes on tobacco there has

<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr.

in helping to establish basic institutions of democracy.
<P>
	It is now the government's view that we have to broaden that to a 
new dimension of trade in economic and commercial relationships.
<P>
	As a result of the meetings last week in Ukraine, where we had 
the largest foreign delegation ever to visit Ukraine, we were able to 
sign over $600 million worth of business arrangements which have 
established Canada as probably one of the largest investors and 
participants in the Ukrainian economy.

contribution under this program to Paprican it was to create jobs in 
British Columbia as well as in Montreal. When I was in Alberta last 
July to give money to TR Labs on a repayable basis to support 
wireless technologies it was to create jobs in Alberta. Where are 
the complaints from the hon. member about those job creation 
efforts?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the cover-up continues.
<P>
	The government introduced legislation that was to get the 
highest standards of ethical conduct by public officials and 
lobbyists yet these guidelines are hidden in the secret vault in the 
Prime Minister's office.
<P>
	Today we find that the president of Bombardier's aerospace 
group, Canadair, sits on the advisory board of Technology 
Partnerships Canada, the same body that granted the $87 million 
loan.
<P>
	Can the minister please tell the House if this situation is a 
conflict of interest or is it not? If it is not, why not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first, I would like to thank the hon. member for his 
question because he gives me the opportunity to point out the 
important role that we think the private sector needs to play in 
helping this program to work well.
<P>
	We put together a private sector advisory board which is helping 
us to review the parameters of the program in the most effective 
way. We are using the board to give us a foresight into the 
technologies we should be supporting. We are asking it to review in 
retrospect the allocation of funds so that it can give us advice on 
whether it thinks the effectiveness of the program is as great as it 
could be among sectors.
<P>
	I will tell the member that we have been absolutely scrupulous in 
ensuring that in reviewing any specific application that are made 
through Technology Partnerships Canada that no member of that 
advisory council is consulted in the review of the application. This 
is done entirely by officials. It is based on the guidelines that were 
set out and made public when the program was announced. We 
know that the government is creating jobs not only in the 
immediate term, but into the next century.

	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The federal government was a trustee of the pension fund of 
former employees of the Singer company from 1947 to 1962. Its 
mandate was to protect the interests of the employees of this 
company. However, the federal government allowed Singer to draw 
funds from the pension surplus, thus depriving retirees of an 
amount that today is estimated at more than $8 million.
<P>
	Will the minister acknowledge the demands of former Singer 
employees by granting them their request for compensation, and do 
so before the last pensioner dies?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I have noted the question put by 
the opposition member, and I will give him a reply as soon as I 
have had time to look into the case.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I got in 
touch with the new minister and his office about this almost three 
weeks ago, and I may add that the average age of the Singer 
employees is 80. So we cannot afford to wait.
<P>
	Would the minister agree that if he lets this dispute go to court, 
because that is what is bound to happen, it would generate 
tremendous costs for the taxpayer and mean intolerable delay for 
the retirees, whose average age is more than 80?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is referring to 
a decision that was made in 1962. I must admit that I was nowhere 
near the government at the time, so, as I said in reply to his first 
question, I will look into the case as soon as I have a chance. I can 
assure you I will give the most comprehensive answer that I can, 
because this issue is certainly very important to the people 
concerned, and I think it is entirely legitimate to look into a case 
instead of improvising an answer.

	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Nova 
Scotia finance officials are predicting that the changeover for the 
GST harmonization deal is going to cost businesses in Nova Scotia 
about $200 million in the first year alone, and $100 million 
annually in ongoing costs due to tax and pricing.
<P>
	How can the minister justify implementing this disastrous plan 
when it will mean lost jobs and higher prices and hundreds of 
millions of dollars in higher costs for the people of Atlantic 
Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is quite the opposite. In fact the most recent independent studies 
that have come out of Nova Scotia have demonstrated that it is 
going to lead to very large scale job creation among small and 
medium sized business.
<P>
	What was indicated in the study that came out yesterday was that 
the harmonized tax was going to reverse the cash flow drain that 
was coming out of Nova Scotia and the other Atlantic provinces as 
a result of the original introduction of the GST.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is 
simply not the case. The finance officials in Nova Scotia are saying 
$100 million annually and $200 million in the first year.
<P>
	While the finance minister is promising jobs, jobs, jobs, the 
government robs, robs, robs.
<P>
	Large chains will survive this because they can pass on higher 
prices to consumers across Canada, but small business will either 
be forced to lay people off, charge customers more or simply go out 
of business. Those are not very good options. When Canadians are 
crying out for jobs, why is the minister setting out to kill jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the Reform Party in terms of its questions lobs, lobs, lobs.
<P>
	It was made very clear by independent studies in Atlantic 
Canada, specifically in the case of Nova Scotia, that the 
harmonized sales tax will lead to substantial job creation because it 
will lower the costs for small and medium sized business. For the 
first time they are going to have the opportunity to incorporate and 
put tax credits into their cost base which is going to lower their 
costs. That is the reason they did it. It is a reason that 
Newfoundland did it.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is a good question.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchi:</B> Quite frankly, the Reform are specialists on this 
file: endangered species.
<P>
	The government listened to the task force that was put in place, a 
task force that reflected industry, agriculture and environmental 
concerns. If members look at the legislation that we tabled today, 
the first ever federal legislation on endangered species, they will 
find that 80 per cent of the task force recommendations are 
covered.
<P>
	If they check, they will find more territory covered by the 
legislation than previously. Also, whether the quality is on habitat, 
offences or including the public, the files have been moved 
forward.
<P>
	Last, the provinces and territories need to be complimented on 
agreeing on a national accord so that we have a national plan and 
not a patchwork plan to protect and safeguard endangered species.

<P>
	However, on October 18, a Federal Court judge found many 
parts of the government's legislation to be lacking and quashed the 
decision in the Williams case.
<P>
	Since the government has used Bill C-44 as a cure-all for all the

do now to protect Canadians from immigrants and refugees who

question is for the Minister of Health. In June, the minister tabled 
his policy on new reproductive technologies, announcing among 
other things the establishment of a federal agency responsible for 
monitoring the use of these new technologies. After the Canadian 
Food Inspection Agency, a new agency is threatening to interfere in 
health matters.
<P>
	Knowing full well that reproductive technologies are a health 
matter, which makes them a provincial jurisdiction, and knowing 
how much establishing such an agency will cost, how can the 
minister justify establishing yet another federal agency in these 
days of budget restrictions?

done that.
<P>
	We have come forward with a bill that will go to committee. It 
will be examined. Hearings will take place. If improvements are

has conceded that the co-operation of the provinces is critical to 
making this process truly effective.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	As far as federal lands are concerned, is the minister prepared to 
do a full habitat inventory for species currently on the list? As far 
as provincial co-operation is concerned, can the minister tell us 
what enforcement powers he has at his disposal if any or all 
provincial governments fail to include habitat protection within 
their own legislative framework?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, for too many years in this country when it has come to 
endangered species the time clock on the species has ticked while 
federal and provincial governments have bickered over the rock 
that the bird lands on. We argue: Is it your rock, is it my rock and 
what do we do about it?
<P>
	Instead of continuing in that old, frustrating and losing manner 
the government decided to start on the other end. We started with 
the endangered species.

	<B>Hon. Lawrence MacAulay (Secretary of State 
(Veterans)(Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency), Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to rise in my place today as November 11 
approaches to pay tribute to Canadians who gave their lives for 
their country in two world wars, the Korean war and in 
peacekeeping operations around the world. Their sacrifice 
protected the democracy Canadians cherish today.
<P>
	On Monday, November 11 we will pause for a minute of silence 
to mourn the loss of these Canadians. At cenotaphs from one end of 
the country to the other and in cemeteries around the world where 
Canadians lie, we will remember them. But today as I remind this 
House of the coming ceremonies to mark the sacrifice of those who 
never returned from war, I would also like to remind our colleagues 
that in the coming week we are also going to pay tribute to the 
people who did come home.
<P>
	The Prime Minister has declared the week of November 3 to 11 
as veterans week. It is an occasion when people across the country 
can reflect upon the achievements and sacrifice of Canadians 
during wartime and in peacekeeping operations around the world.
<P>
	Canadian veterans have served with distinction, winning respect 
and gratitude. I would remind this House that these Canadians were 
drawn from the entire country. They built the foundations of our 
national spirit.
<P>
	Hon. members will recall that last year Canadians celebrated 
veterans week as part of the Canada Remembers program which 
marked the 50th anniversary of the end of the second world war. 
Veterans Affairs Canada was very pleased to help co-ordinate many 
of the events which paid tribute to our veterans. I know many  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5963"> 5963 </A></B>
<P>
individual Canadian men and women enjoyed the opportunity to 
re-create emotions, both happy and sad, from their youth.
<P>
	Perhaps most important of all, the Canada Remembers 
celebrations last year gave many of today's young Canadians their 
first history lesson about what our country accomplished during the 
war. It gave an opportunity for one generation to speak to another. 
Young Canadians have grown up without the spectre of war casting 
its chill over their future. They could be excused for taking our 
cherished freedom for granted.
<P>
	I hope that during this year's veterans week we will once again 
create the bond between the generations that will invite an older 
generation to tell its stories to a younger generation. I hope too that 
teachers across the country will use this week to talk to students 
about Canada's proud history and the important role we played on 
the international stage during these years.
<P>
	Finally, I hope that Canadians of all ages will take time to honour 
those who gave so much of themselves, both overseas and on the 
home front, to bring Canada through those trying times.
<P>
	I invite all members of this House to help us honour Canada's 
veterans during veterans week and indeed all year long.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean H. Leroux (Shefford, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
honoured to rise in this House today, in my capacity as the Bloc 
Quebecois critic for veterans affairs, to acknowledge, as is 
tradition, Remembrance Day and Veterans' Week, which will run 
from November 3 to November 11.
<P>
	The least we can do is to set some time aside every year to 
remember the men and women who served in the two world wars 
and in the Korean conflict.
<P>
	From the bottom of our hearts, we thank all those who served at 
the front, the sailors and airmen from all regions of Canada, the 
members of the merchant navy, the nurses, and all the men and 
women who risked or gave their lives to overcome tyranny.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	Need we remind the House that over 100,000 young Canadians 
and Quebecers died in the two world wars, while hundreds of 
others were killed in Korea and the various peacekeeping 
missions?
<P>
	Unfortunately, many bloody conflicts are still raging around the 
globe. I cannot help but think about the serious consequences of the 
conflict between the Tutsi rebels and the Zairian army. Over 1 
million refugees are caught in the middle. Yet, the international 
community seems totally incapable of mobilizing and intervening 
between the warring factions. Worst of all, the humanitarian 
agencies had to leave the area immediately.  The consequences are 
extremely serious. We may be powerless to prevent another 
disaster for humanity.
<P>
	If I mention the tragedy unfolding in Zaire, it is because I am 
also thinking of all those who assume the responsibility for 
maintaining peace in the world, particularly the Canadian 
peacekeepers. As you know, more than 2,000 Canadian 
peacekeepers are currently deployed overseas in places like Bosnia 
and Haiti.
<P>
	Today we remember the sacrifices made by those to whom we 
owe this legacy of freedom and democracy, and by all those who 
are now working for peace.
<P>
	The extensive human losses and the horrible suffering endured 
by all the people caught in these endless wars defy understanding. 
What can we say to the widows and orphans, the brothers and 
sisters who lost loved ones forever?
<P>
	All these brave people fought, all these lives were sacrificed so 
there would be no more wars. So that future generations would be 
spared all this pain and suffering.
<P>
	Again, I join with all my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois in 
expressing our sincere gratitude to all those who gave their lives 
and, of course, to all the survivors of these tragedies. Let us not 
forget there are still many survivors who deserve all our admiration 
and support.
<P>
	In this regard, I condemn this government's lack of 
consideration for the members of the merchant marine. Their 
concerns must be considered a priority. We must make every effort 
to ensure that this government pays due attention to the views of 
merchant marine veterans and holds proper consultations with the 
coalition representing them.
<P>
	Having said that, I will conclude my speech by saying how much 
the Bloc Quebecois wants to honour the memory of our veterans 
and pay them a fitting tribute.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Madam

of the Peace Tower, each page bearing the names of those who died 
carrying the torch of freedom.
<P>
	Over 114,000 Canadians were killed during the course of World 
War I and World War II and the Korean war. Many more returned 
battered in body and spirit.
<P>
	The peace, security and freedom you and I enjoy comes as a 
result of the blood they shed and the courage and determination 
they devoted to casting aside the tide of oppression. Their fate, our 
future; what a very great price to pay, what a very great debt to 
owe.
<P>
	The Memorial Chapel bears the inscription: ``They are too near 
to be great but our children shall understand when and how our fate 
was changed and by whose hand''.
<P>
	Last fall during the Far East pilgrimage, I stood with youth 
delegates before a marker on a grave in the Commonwealth 
Cemetery in Yokohama, bearing the name of a young man who at 
age 19 died as a prisoner of war. He had been captured at Hong 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5964"> 5964 </A></B>
<P>
Kong three years prior at age 16. The impact this marker left on our 
minds and hearts will never be forgotten.
<P>
<B>(1515 )</B>
<P>
	It also took me to my stepfather, Stanley Edward Akrigg, who 
died in January at age 96. He was a big boy and he joined the 
Canadian army in 1914 at the age of 15. At the age of 17 he won the 
military medal and fought in the battles of Vimy Ridge, the Somme 
and Passchendaele. Two days before his 19th birthday, in October 
1918, he lost his brother, who served in the same regiment, to a 
German artillery shell.
<P>
	It also brought to mind my cousin, Ronald Loughton Movold, 
who was a tail gunner in a Lancaster bomber. He lost his life in 
Europe in April 1944.
<P>
	The torch of remembrance must pass to those too young to have 
known the Canadian warriors who were too young to die. The 
poppies we wear are a time honoured symbol of their sacrifice. 
They were inspired by the poem written by Lieutenant Colonel 
John McCrae after surviving 12 days of heavy bombardment in his 
Belgian bunker on May 3, 1915. Through the shelling he saw a 
cemetery across the road filled with red poppies. Tearing a page 
from his diary, he wrote the poem ``In Flanders Fields''. We are 
responsible to remember their gallant contributions so their 
sacrifice will not have been in vain and to ensure that we preserve 
the precious rights and freedoms for which they died.
<P>
	We must also remember the tens of thousands of Canadians who 
have served in more than 30 individual missions over 36 years of 
Canadian peacekeeping. More than 100 Canadian forces personnel 
have lost their lives and hundreds more have been wounded during 
peacekeeping tours. They too must be remembered.
<P>
	Our gulf war veterans were exposed to the intensity and 
volatility of modern day warfare during their fight to preserve the 
delicately balanced stability in the Middle East. During the war, 
many Canadians witnessed on their television screens a blaze of oil 
fires and exploding warheads. In service to our country and the 
global community, Canadian lives were scarred. Here too we find 
personal tragedies and sacrifice.
<P>
	Veterans week, November 3 to 11, is a time to pause, remember 
and accept our heroes' challenge: ``Take up our quarrel with the 
foe: To you from failing hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold 
it high. If ye break faith with us who die we shall not sleep, though 
poppies grow in Flanders Fields''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg Transcona, NDP):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I join with my colleagues in the New Democratic Party 
caucus today in the House of Commons to pay tribute to Canadian 
veterans. We pay tribute particularly to those who made the 
supreme  sacrifice: those men and women in the army, the navy, the 
air force and the merchant navy who gave their lives in World War I 
and World War II; those who died in the Korean war; those who 
have died in the course of peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	Fortunately no one died in the Gulf war but as the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands indicated, there is evidence that people who 
served in the Gulf war have a variety of lasting effects which need 
to be acknowledged by the government.
<P>
	That is why when we gather on Remembrance Day we pay 
tribute not just to those who died but also to those who came back, 
as the legion says in one of its creeds, after having given the best 
years of their lives.
<P>
	A long time ago, just before my 20th birthday I was cycling with 
a friend through Holland. We came to a big monument. We had 
stopped at the Canadian war cemetery at Bergen op Zoom. We went 
for a walk through the beautiful place which has been kept 
wonderfully by the Dutch all these years. We realized what we had 
stumbled upon. We spent a couple of hours there because we were 
struck with the row upon row upon row of Canadians who were 
buried there. It struck me that at the time of their deaths they were 
about the same age as I was then, 19.

	It was not until 10 years later that I had an occasion to visit the 
cemetery at Adagem in Belgium and another 10 years later I visited 
Vimy. The older I get, the more it is impressed upon me how young 
these people were, giving more meaning to the passage which is 
used at every Remembrance Day service: ``They shall not grow old 
as we who are left grow old. Age shall not weary them, nor the 
years condemn''. If anyone has ever lost a relative not necessarily 
in war but to an accident at a young age, we all know what that 
means. Those people are forever youthful in our imaginations. 
They grow not old.
<P>
	I was struck, as I always am, by images of those cemeteries, by 
the images of the Menin gate outside the village of Ypres where the 
names of 35,000 Commonwealth soldiers are inscribed who have 
no known grave. Every week the people of that town gather to do a 
last post ceremony at the Menin gate. They have been doing that 
since 1918 with the exception of the years when the town was 
captured during the second world war.
<P>
	I say this because in Europe, whether it is in Holland, or at the 
Menin gate or elsewhere, people appreciate what Canadians and 
other Commonwealth and allied soldiers gave at that time. I think 
we in Canada could do no less. I often feel that we do not 
appreciate to the extent that we should what our veterans gave.
<P>
	I hope this Remembrance Day and in Remembrance Days to 
come that future generations will be lucky as my generation was. 
My grandfather served in the first world war, my father in the 
second world war, but my generation was not called to war. I hope 
<P>

<B><A NAME="5965"> 5965 </A></B>
<P>
that will continue to be said about my son's generation and my 
grandson's generation. We all should devote ourselves to that goal.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B> Madam Speaker, on behalf 
of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, I wish to pay 
tribute to the many Canadians who sacrificed so much for the peace 
and freedom we enjoy today.
<P>
	The first world war ended at 11 a.m. on November 11, 1918 and 
the devastation was felt deeply. In just a few short years the lives of 
70,000 Canadians were lost and twice as many were wounded in 
the name of peace. I know because my uncle served overseas and 
was wounded very badly at that time.
<P>
	The second world war, a horrifying episode in history, claimed 
the lives of 45,000 Canadians and many thousands more were hurt. 
Many did come back home and we thank God for that.
<P>
	Canadians also gave their lives during the Korean war and our 
armed forces answered when the United Nations called for action 
to put an end to Iraqi aggression against Kuwait.
<P>
	Two of my brothers served in the second world war. They were 
in Belgium, Holland and France. It was not easy. It was not easy for 
my mother who made all of those fruitcakes to send over to them, 
who made all of their little pillows. She sent over their socks that 
she knitted. She cried as she waited for the mail to come, hoping 
and praying that they would come home safely. Luckily, both of 
them did.
<P>
	Canadians have never backed down or run away in the face of 
aggression. Canadians know that to ensure world peace, the laws 
that govern relationships among nations must be respected and 
enforced. That is why we have almost 2,000 members of the 
Canadian military serving throughout the world on peace and 
humanitarian operations.
<P>
	This year marks the 51st anniversary of the end of the second 
world war. On Remembrance Day, November 11, I would ask 
everyone to make a commitment to honour the sacrifices made by 
so many Canadians and to honour all of those who returned.
<P>
	Last year in Holland during the VE Day celebrations, Canadian 
veterans were treated like the heroes they are for their role in the 
liberation of that country. Here at home we must never forget the 
risks these heroes took and the sacrifices they made so we can 
enjoy the country, the peace and the freedom we have today. A 
freedom we often take for granted for which a very high price was 
paid.
<P>
<B>(1525 )</B>
<P>
	Out of thankfulness, respect and gratefulness, we must work 
harder than ever to preserve and protect the programs vital to the
<P>
well-being of so many veterans. I say that because many of our 
veterans come to see me because they are worried about the cuts in 
the last post fund. We must look after our merchant navy vets as 
well.
<P>
	Today I say thank you to those who fought for the freedoms that 
we enjoy. I say thank you to those who continue to wear the 
uniform of Canada for their extraordinary service to us.
<P>
	Let us never forget the high price that was paid so that we can 
live in peace, individually and collectively. We must be vigilant 
about maintaining that peace.

TECHNOLOGIES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from October 23 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-47, an act respecting human reproductive 
technologies and commercial transactions relating to human 
reproduction, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
directing my remarks today to Bill C-47, an act respecting human 
reproductive technologies and commercial transactions relating to 
human reproduction.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5966"> 5966 </A></B>
<P>
	This is an important subject touching on moral, ethical and 
scientific issues and economic issues as well, plus the  role of the 
state in private lives. It is also a subject I have a personal interest 
in. I have dealt with infertile couples, helped by test tube 
procedures in my own medical practice, helping them to fulfil their 
fondest dreams to have a family. I cannot forget the joy, the 
excitement and the satisfaction of those individuals as they were 
successful in having their children.
<P>
	This is not an academic or dispassionate subject but one that has 
a personal interest for me. Since it also touches upon life itself and 
my personal and strongest beliefs as a Christian individual, I put 
these practices into my personal belief structure that life is not just 
an accident, that there is a higher authority.
<P>
	Let me start by saying that Reform's approach on a bill like this 
one is very specific. There is a moral component to this bill. I state 
my position as a Reform MP, provide the facts to my constituents, 
determine the position of my constituents, and vote their wishes if a 
clear consensus is evident. I want the Canadian public to know that 
I am in the process of doing that right now. My householder is 
going out with a questionnaire on human reproductive technology.
<P>
	The objects of the bill are threefold: (a) to protect the health and 
safety of Canadians in the use of human reproductive materials or 
assisted reproduction, other medical procedures and medical 
research; (b) to ensure the appropriate treatment of human 
reproductive materials outside the body in recognition of their 
potential to form human life; and (c) to protect the dignity of all 
persons, in particular, children and women, in relation to uses of 
human reproductive materials. Those are noble goals, but how shall 
we reach those goals?
<P>
	The bill has prohibited a number of things. The prohibitions are 
strenuous. The first prohibitions are almost science fiction 
procedures that are possible but not plausible for most Canadians, 
such as the fusion of human and animal egg and sperm, the 
implanting of a human embryo into an animal. These activities are 
abhorrent to most Canadians. Strong controls are reasonable in 
these areas.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The second area of prohibitions are the attempts to control 
assisted reproduction by making commercialization of these 
practices illegal. These activities today are controlled by 
self-regulating professional bodies with standards for licensing, 
training, technology and ethics. The actual things being controlled 
in this area are much more available to Canadians. For instance, 
sperm donation is currently available. Donors are paid for their 
donation. That would not be allowed under the bill. Under the bill a 
sister could not bear a family member an infant, be a surrogate 
mother, and receive compensation for time lost at work. In the bill 
as well an altruistic woman could not donate extra eggs to receive 
services she could not otherwise afford.
<P>
	Controls are probably necessary in this area. How stringent 
should they be? Some of these decisions are personal and private.
<P>
Many consider such decisions to be too private for governmentto intervene.
<P>
	Since the science fiction procedures and the assisted 
reproduction procedures are not of the same magnitude, the bill 
should reflect that significant difference. A division of the bill 
would be useful.
<P>
	On enforcement in the bill, criminalization, penalties for 
breaking the prohibitions are very severe: $500,000 fine and 10 
years of imprisonment for breaking some of the prohibitions. On 
the regulatory apparatus that will likely follow the bill, we have 
had a discussion paper laying that out. The bill is quite vague. 
Clause 12 says the minister can designate anyone he wants to be an 
inspector or an analyst. Clause 13 says the governor general can 
make regulations unspecified. These are big powers and big issues. 
It sounds like: ``Just trust me and all will be well''.
<P>
	First, I accept the principle that these technologies require 
regulation by law. In principle I accept the bill at this stage of the 
debate.
<P>
	Second, I urge the government to divide the bill along the lines 
of science fiction procedures on one hand and the commercial 
aspects of childless couples on the other.
<P>
	Third, I do not accept the premise without more discussion that 
harsh penalties and criminalization are necessary or advisable in 
this area.
<P>
	Fourth, I remain sceptical that government monopolistic 
regulation is the only or the ideal way to control such activities.
<P>
	Fifth, I have gone over the reproductive consultation process 
which was very thorough. In Bill C-47 and the proposals that will 
follow I find many definitions and phrases that are vague, such as 
human dignity and protecting the dignity of all persons. To leave 
that undefined for me is very difficult. By whose definition do we 
look at dignity?
<P>
	I present these thoughts for other members' consideration and 
review. My colleagues and I will carefully review the bill at 
committee hearings.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Halifax, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to debate Bill C-47, the new reproductive and genetic 
technologies act.
<P>
	Many people in Canada today live with the knowledge that they 
are at risk of passing on a serious sex related disorder to their 
children. They have witnessed at close range the devastation that 
these disorders, for example hemophilia and Duchenne muscular 
dystrophy, can wreak on those who suffer from them and on their 
families and friends. For many the only alternative to the risk of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5967"> 5967 </A></B>
<P>
passing on the disorder that is acceptable to them is not to have 
children at all. That is a very high price to pay.
<P>
	The development and availability of prenatal diagnosis and other 
technologies which permit couples to find out the sex of an embryo 
or fetus have meant that they can for the first time make informed 
decisions about whether and under what circumstances to have 
children.
<P>
	There are some people, however, who have strong preferences 
for children of one sex, not for health reasons but solely for 
personal or cultural reasons. The same technology that provides 
such profound assistance to couples who risk passing on genetic 
diseases, the families who are facing potential tragedies, can also 
be used to satisfy the desires of people who for varying reasons 
strongly want a boy or a girl.
<P>
	Using technology to try to predetermine the sex of an embryo or, 
even worse, using prenatal diagnosis simply to choose the sex of a 
child is a practice which I believe is abhorrent to the majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The government examined the issue carefully and concluded that 
there are serious grounds upon which to prohibit sex selection for 
non-medical reasons. The practice puts vulnerable people at risk, 
particularly children and women. It contravenes our country's 
commitment to equality between the sexes. It is an inappropriate 
use of medical resources.
<P>
	For these reasons Bill C-47 makes it illegal to use technology to 
try to influence the sex of an embryo or to determine the sex of a 
fetus.
<P>
	When we talk about sex selection we are talking about three 
different uses of technology, each with the same goal. The first 
method of sex selection takes place before conception. An egg, 
fertilized with X bearing sperm, leads to the birth of a girl. One 
fertilized with Y bearing sperm leads to the birth of a boy. It 
follows that if the X can be separated from the Y the likelihood of 
having a child of the desired sex can be increased. Once separation 
has occurred the gender of a child can be predetermined.
<P>
	This method of sex selection is not always effective, but there is 
enough of a market for it that two private clinics have been opened 
in Canada, as well as clinics in the United States, the United 
Kingdom and elsewhere.
<P>
	The second method of sex selection has arisen from the practice 
of in vitro fertilization. IVF results in the creation of embryos 
outside the body, usually more embryos than can safely be 
transferred back to the woman's body. Some criteria are necessary 
to decide which embryos should be transferred to the womb. A 
technique called pre-implantation diagnosis involves removing 
several cells from an embryo while it is outside the body and 
examining them for the presence of chromosomal or genetic 
disorders. Embryos with any disorders obviously would not be 
implanted.
<P>
	The pre-implantation diagnosis can also be used to determine the 
sex of the embryo. Those who have strong preferences for the sex 
of their child can arrange for the embryos of the desired sex to be 
transferred back to the woman's body. The first two methods are 
used before pregnancy has been established.
<P>
	The third method is used much later in the development of the 
fetus. Prenatal diagnosis, usually amniocentesis or ultrasound, can 
be used to determine the sex of a fetus.
<P>
	Protecting vulnerable members of society including children, 
respecting the Canadian commitment to sexual equality and 
ensuring that medical resources are used appropriately are the 
principles underpinning the prohibition on sex selection for 
non-medical reasons. Sex selection renders children vulnerable to a 
range of harm. The impact of sex selection on children's emotional 
well-being can be profound. It is not he alone who bears the burden 
imposed by sex selection. Siblings can also be harmed by the belief 
that they are not the right sex and that they are not as deserving of 
their parents' care and love. Children's self-esteem and sense of 
self-worth are fragile. The knowledge that their parents prefer a 
child of the opposite sex can do untold damage and the effects can 
last a lifetime.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	Women can also be made vulnerable by the use of sex selection 
technology. Some women, particularly those from cultures where 
male children are more highly valued, have been subjected to 
pressure to use sex selection techniques to ensure they give birth to 
sons. This pressure can take the form of threats of marital breakup 
and violence. We are not as far removed as we perhaps thought 
from the days of Henry VIII.
<P>
	Women representing minority communities have made great 
efforts to resist pressures for sex selection within their 
communities and to promote the wider adoption of fundamental 
values such as sexual equality.
<P>
	The government does not want to undermine or compromise its 
efforts. Respect for cultural differences cannot be used to justify 
coercion. Countries where preference for male children is strong 
have seen a skewed birth ratio since the advent of prenatal 
diagnosis with many more males born than the normal birth ratio of 
about 51.5 males for every 48.5 females.
<P>
	There is little evidence that the availability of sex selection for 
non-medical reasons could have as significant an impact in 
Canada. However, the consequences of even a relatively small 
change in the ratio of males to females are not known. In the 
absence of this information it would be foolhardy to risk tampering 
with ratios that have developed over thousands of years of human 
existence to allow for the continuation of our species.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5968"> 5968 </A></B>
<P>
	For those reasons sex selection is sex discrimination. Society 
should not allow technology to be used to promote some arbitrary 
standard of the ideal family as consisting of both sons and 
daughters.
<P>
	Sex selection techniques involve the use of limited health care 
resources. Except for sex related genetic disorders they are not 
medically necessary services. They do not treat or avoid disease. 
Nor do they promote human health.
<P>
	People in this country view their health care system as one of the 
defining elements of being Canadian. To squander such a precious 
resource in ways that are ethically questionable would be wrong. 
The government is acting to ensure this does not happen.
<P>
	After much consideration and consultation with stakeholder 
groups, the government has come to the conclusion that sex 
selection is so unacceptable to Canadian values and to the health 
and well-being of Canadian children that it cannot be provided.
<P>
	Sex selection offends notions of sexual equality and of 
protection for the vulnerable. It has the potential to harm 
vulnerable women and children. It could have unknown impact on 
population health in the future should a skewed sex ratio be the 
result. It is an inappropriate use of our finite health care resources.
<P>
	For all these reasons the government is prohibiting sex selection 
for non-medical reasons through the new reproductive and genetic 
technologies act. I am pleased to speak in support of the bill.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
must congratulate my government colleague on her speech. She has 
clearly listed all of the dangers of the new technologies if time is 
not taken to criminalize them, if we do not come up with a detailed 
and responsible bill.
<P>
	I would like to return to Bill C-47 on a somewhat more technical 
level. I would like to ask her whether she agrees with what I am 
going to set out. These clauses, in my opinion, might lead to legal 
debates, and I therefore feel that this bill is incomplete.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	In clause 1, there is an inaccuracy in the French text compared to 
the English. The French says ``manipulation génétique'', while the 
English says ``genetic technologies''. I would like to begin by 
asking whether she grasps the difference between the two.
<P>
	In the explanation given on the short title, reference is made to 
assisted procreation, and this is confused with basic research. I 
believe that, when assisted procreation is referred to, what is meant 
is the provision of care and treatment, while on the other side there 
is medical research in genetics. I would like to know whether she  
does not think that combining these two is dangerous. I feel these 
are two completely different things.
<P>
	I would like to know whether these definitions have really been 
studied seriously by the members of the government in connection 
with Bill C-47. I am only at clause 1, and could refer to them all up 
to 49. I believe this bill is totally vague, that it is not clear and will 
lead to legal wrangling. Could she answer me on this?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Madam Speaker, indeed I could respond. With 
regard to the first part of the hon. member's question on 
manipulation génétique and the phrase in English, I am not an 
expert in the French language. If it has a different meaning I can 
only suggest to the hon. member that this is something that should 
be brought forward at the committee stage of the bill.
<P>
	I am sure that the people at the committee, the clerk of the 
committee, the researchers, the people responsible in the 
Translation office, will correct those words. That is a housekeeping 
kind of correction and I do not think it is incumbent on me in my 
knowledge of the bill to make any kind of response. I suggest the 
hon. member bring it to the committee.
<P>
	On some of the other questions-goodness knows I am a lawyer 
and I am used to splitting hairs-but on May 4, 1994 the member 
for Drummond complained in the House about the government's 
slowness to act on this issue. I can only suggest with regard to some 
of the questions that she is putting in a hair splitting manner-I do 
not know if she shares my profession or not, if she does not she 
should because she is good at it. She said such an action would 
have major impact on ethics and research and that we were too 
slow.
<P>
	These kinds of questions do not help to speed the delivery of the 
bill. I would be delighted to address any questions the member 
might have on the substance of the bill. With questions that really 
relate to terminology, the short title and definition I think she 
knows there is a legislative branch and people in committees that 
can solve these problems. I would hope that the hon. member might 
have questions with more substance to bring to the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury, Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am happy to rise today to speak to Bill C-47, the 
new reproductive and genetic technologies act.
<P>
	It is not often that legislative measures come with an explicit 
ethical framework attached. Bill C-47 addresses issues that touch 
our most basic beliefs about the nature of human life, the value 
which we attach to it and the role of reproduction and parenthood in 
our society.
<P>
	Following the lead of the royal commission on new reproductive 
technologies, the federal government developed an ethical 
framework to guide its policy development in the area of new 
reproductive and genetic technologies. These principles are 
outlined in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5969"> 5969 </A></B>
<P>
petition paper that the government released at the same time it 
tabled Bill C-47. The government did this in the belief that ethical 
principles must be open to public scrutiny and debate if they are to 
have any meaning. I would like to touch on some of these now.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	One of the ethical principles guiding the government's policy 
making is the need to balance individual and collective interests. 
Individual autonomy is a value that Canadians espouse but 
decisions are not made in a vacuum. Every individual is part of the 
larger society and decisions made by individuals can have 
repercussions for that society.
<P>
	Individual autonomy does not include the freedom to harm 
others, to coerce them or to undermine social stability. Those 
seeking assisted reproduction or prenatal diagnosis, gamete donors 
and the children born as a result of assisted reproduction, are all 
individuals whose interests are affected by policy making about 
new reproductive genetic technologies. Their interests must be 
balanced with the interest of society as a whole, as well as those of 
identifiable groups in society.
<P>
	For instance, the provision of prenatal diagnosis has 
implications for how we as a society view people with disabilities. 
Women as a group are of particular importance since it is women 
who experience the technologies most directly. Women from ethnic 
or racial minorities have special interests that must also be 
considered. Individual interests do not automatically take 
precedence over collective interests nor can the collective 
tyrannize individuals.
<P>
	We must protect those who are most vulnerable to the harmful 
effects of the technologies while respecting the rights of infertile 
individuals or those who are at risk of passing a genetic disease to 
their children to seek the intervention they see as being of most 
help to them.
<P>
	Canada is committed by the charter of rights and freedoms to the 
principle of equality between men and women. This is the second 
principle in the government's ethical framework. This does not 
mean, however, that men and women must be treated equally. 
Rather we must recognize that the physical and social burdens and 
risks of reproduction are borne primarily by women.
<P>
	The prohibitions contained in this legislation reflect the careful 
consideration given to the special needs and interests of women. 
Practices and procedures that leave women vulnerable to 
exploitation and coercion such as commercial surrogacy 
arrangements or egg donation for payment have been expressly 
prohibited in no small part because of the negative impact on 
women's equal status in Canadian society.
<P>
	Protecting those who are vulnerable is a priority for the 
government. It is the third element of our ethical framework. 
Society has a responsibility to ensure that those who are vulnerable 
are not manipulated or controlled by those in positions of power 
and authority. Any individual or group who does have the power or 
the resources to adequately represent themselves is in need of 
special protection. Women are vulnerable to such exploitation in 
part because of social and economic factors that limit their power. 
Individuals or couples seeking to use these technologies are also 
vulnerable. They need technology to help them have a child, 
technology to which access is limited and determined by others.
<P>
	That is why the government is prohibiting the use of their 
embryos for research purposes without their express informed 
consent. Children born through the use of these technologies are 
particularly vulnerable. Technology such as sex selection and 
commercial surrogacy demean the value of children in our society 
and have been prohibited because they make children into 
commodities.
<P>
	With Bill C-47 the government is also seeking to protect the 
health and safety of Canadians. This requires a commitment to the 
appropriate use of medical treatment. Currently we would like to 
help all people who are infertile but in a world of diverse needs and 
finite resources it is our responsibility to ensure that decisions 
about the provision of medical treatment be made in accordance 
with clearly defined health care priorities.
<P>
	The first step in ensuring an appropriate use of health care 
resources is to minimize the number of people requiring medical 
treatment by emphasizing prevention. In its position paper on a 
comprehensive management regime for new reproductive and 
genetic technologies, the government has outlined non-legislative 
initiatives it is taking, including the establishment of a framework 
for sexual and reproductive health. This framework will, among 
other others, provide the basis for a comprehensive strategy for the 
prevention of infertility. Even with the best preventive efforts in the 
world, there will still be people who suffer from infertility. The 
principle of the appropriate use of medical treatment requires the 
simplest and least invasive intervention should be used first to 
assist those people in conceiving a child.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	Non-commercialization of reproduction and reproductive 
materials is the fifth tenet of the government's ethical framework. 
By commercialization I mean the introduction of a profit element 
into reproduction, the buying or selling of reproductive materials 
or reproductive services. Commercialization is contrary to the 
basic values we hold about the inalienable rights of people not to be 
bought or sold. It disregards the importance of reproduction and its 
significance in our lives as human beings.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5970"> 5970 </A></B>
<P>
	Finally, the government is committed to the principle of 
accountability at all levels. Individuals have a responsibility to 
safeguard their own reproductive and sexual health to help prevent 
infertility in the first place. Canadian society has a right to regulate 
and monitor how the technologies are used to ensure that our 
values and priorities are being respected.
<P>
	Governments and practitioners have a joint responsibility to 
protect the reproductive and sexual health of their communities and 
the individuals they serve. These ethical principles provide one 
pillar of the government's approach to our new reproductive and 
genetic technologies.
<P>
	Other important aspects are concern for the health and safety of 
Canadians, a perspective on infertility and a consideration of the 
well-being and the interests of children. These are also essential 
components of the government's approach. Together these pillars 
make up the framework that has guided the government in 
prohibiting certain practices and procedures. They will continue to 
guide us as we develop our regulatory components.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to point out something that is very clear. I understand 
very well all these debates we are having on Bill C-47. This is a 
social debate concerning our values, but I wish we could work on 
the bill before us.
<P>
	Before going any further, I would like to say to all the 
government members that the official Opposition is in favour of 
criminalizing many reproduction techniques. Indeed, it must not be 
said that the opposition is against regulating and criminalizing 
certain techniques.
<P>
	The problem is that the bill before us is, in our opinion, 
incomplete. I was part of feminist groups which, in 1977, called for 
a royal commission of enquiry because, considering what was to 
come, we thought something had to be done before the scandals 
arrived.
<P>
	Twelve years later, in the throne speech, the government 
promised to do an enquiry. This enquiry took four years and cost a 
lot of money. Many people were met, but they forgot to consult the 
provinces, which are the only ones who can, according to the 
Constitution, administer health care. I believe reproduction 
techniques are a health care matter.
<P>
	What the official opposition asked for was to criminalize certain 
techniques and modify the Criminal Code. What we see in Bill 
C-47 is a parallel law, which gives all the powers to the federal 
government, not to the provinces.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member who just spoke why the 
government is trying again to centralize powers. Once again, when 
we are talking about health care, under the  Constitution, and they 
are frequently referring us to the Constitution, it is the provinces 
that have the power to administer health care.
<P>
	Can the member explain to me why the government is so intent 
on centralizing while the member pretends that it is, in fact, 
decentralizing? In reality, it is the other around, and it is harmful.
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Madam Speaker, 
in response to the question, I can only say that the exercise of the 
federal government in areas of health and safety is 
well-established.
<P>
	I need only recall how many times the hon. member has called 
on the federal government to take action. There seems to be some 
inconsistency in calling on the federal government to take action 
and, at the same time, to suggest that by taking action it is trying to 
somehow centralize a power. It is not at all unusual for the federal 
government to be engaged in areas of this nature. I can think of 
many that we discuss as members of the health committee.
<P>
	On that point, the member has also mentioned, in questioning 
my colleague earlier, the fact that the legislation is somewhat 
inconclusive. That will lead probably to a more meaningful debate 
in committee as we look at the legislation. I am sure if it was more 
definitive then the accusation would be, what is the point of 
looking at this bill since the decisions have all been taken.
<P>
	Consequently, I do not think it is at all unusual for the federal 
government to take a leading role in acting in the health and safety 
interests of Canadians. There is a lot of precedent for that. I 
welcome the government's attention to this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to speak to Bill C-47, an act respecting human 
reproductive technologies and commercial transactions relating to 
human reproduction.
<P>
	This bill, which follows the voluntary moratorium on certain 
reproductive technologies proposed by the Liberal government in 
July 1995, is the result of the deliberations of the Baird 
Commission, which worked from 1989 to 1993, and whose 
mandate was to inquire into and report upon current and potential 
medical and scientific developments related to new reproductive 
technologies and their health repercussions.
<P>
	The commission was also requested to study the ethical, social, 
economic and legal consequences of these new technologies in 
order to recommend what policies and safeguards should be 
applied.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5971"> 5971 </A></B>
<P>
	The main conclusions and recommendations of the Baird 
Commission were in line with other studies done elsewhere in the 
world on the same subject. However, several recommendations are 
problematic because they do not respect Canada's unique 
situation, specially with regard to the constitutional distribution 
of powers.
<P>
	Several recommendations the federal government would like to 
implement affect areas under provincial jurisdiction such as health, 
family law and civil liability, which could be a problem.
<P>
	This bill was meant to be-and I said was-the government's 
response to society's concerns about scientific advances in the area 
of human reproduction and the possible use of these technological 
innovations for questionable commercial or scientific purposes.
<P>
	But it proves to be a belated and incomplete response to public 
concerns. Since the report of the Royal Commission on New 
Reproductive Technologies was made public in November 1993, 
the Liberal government has dragged its feet on the matter.
<P>
	It was not until July 1995, more than two and a half years after 
the Baird report was tabled, that the government took a first step to 
put the brakes on the unbridled growth of the reproductive 
technology industry by proposing a temporary voluntary 
moratorium.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois along with several newspaper editors, 
former members of the Baird Commission, including Patricia 
Baird, interest groups, including groups representing women and 
the clergy, criticized the fact that the moratorium was voluntary, 
since some physicians and clinics continue to provide services 
banned by this moratorium, which the government cannot or does 
not want to enforce.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Last January, the federal government announced the creation of a 
temporary advisory committee, whose mandate was to enforce the 
moratorium.
<P>
	That did not prevent a newspaper from advertising for young 
women to sell their ova to infertile couples; institutions from 
continuing to pay sperm donors; doctors from retrieving sperm 
from deceased husbands on the request of their widows. To help 
you understand what is meant by the expression ``new reproductive 
technologies'', I will give you a list of a few activities which were 
carried out and are still being developed because the government's 
moratorium is only ``voluntary'': contracts in which surrogate a 
mother is paid to carry a child she will give up to her customers 
after delivery; trade in human ova, sperm and embryos; child 
gender selection for non medical reasons; free in vitro fertilization 
for women who cannot afford it in exchange for ova; alteration of 
the genetic material of an ovum, sperm or embryo and its 
transmission to a subsequent generation; experiments on bringing 
babies to term in artificial wombs; duplication or cloning of  
human embryos; production of human and animal hybrids; use of 
ova retrieved from cadavers or foetuses to give birth to babies or 
for research purposes.
<P>
	There seems to be a consensus in our society on the fact that 
these technologies give rise to ethical, moral, social, economical 
and legal problems and that they must be controlled.
<P>
	Canadians and Quebecers concerned by the situation think that it 
is about time the government began to do something. However, 
they are still worried to see that it does not seem to know exactly in 
which direction it is going.
<P>
	Indeed, the government itself admitted that Bill C-47 was 
incomplete and temporary. It does not reflect a comprehensive 
vision of the issue and only confirms some prohibitions included in 
the moratorium while waiting for another bill that would complete 
the legislation.
<P>
	In addition, even though this bill meets the demands of the 
official opposition with respect to criminalizing certain practices, 
the federal government is not amending the Criminal Code, 
enforcement of which would fall to the provinces. On the contrary, 
it is proposing parallel legislation that paves the way for the 
creation of a federal agency to monitor new reproductive 
technologies. Another federal agency.
<P>
	Thus, the primary object of the bill is not to criminalize practices 
deemed unacceptable by society, but rather to set up a federal 
agency to monitor new reproductive technologies.
<P>
	A good example of this barely concealed goal of concentrating 
all the power at the federal level is clause 11 of the bill, which says 
that the Attorney General of Canada must give his consent before a 
prosecution for an offence under this Act may be instituted. This 
just shows that the federal government does not wish to co-operate 
with the provinces. This will complicate enforcement of the 
legislation, since hospitals, for one, come under provincial 
responsibility.
<P>
	This new federal agency to monitor new reproductive 
technologies would be responsible for granting licences, inspecting 
clinics and enforcing regulations, and would also be called upon to 
oversee the development of reproductive technologies and to 
advise the federal health minister in this regard.
<P>
	It would be responsible for granting licences for practices 
considered acceptable. These technologies could include, for 
example: in vitro fertilization; donor insemination; use of foetal 
tissue; preservation, manipulation and donation of human ova, 
sperm and embryos; research on embryos; diagnostic testing on a 
foetus before it is implanted in the uterus; late life or 
postmenopausal pregnancy.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5972"> 5972 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As well, this agency would set up a data bank on donors and 
children of donors in order to allow future meetings in certain 
special cases. But a serious oversight in this bill is that it does not 
define how, by what mechanism, approval would be refused. 
Somehow, we do not know when, this will be done in a later phase 
of the supposed federal strategy.
<P>
	There is also a problem in clause 2 of the bill. Its definitions of 
certain technical terms do not correspond to their medical 
definitions and a number of terms are missing from the list. This 
will sustain endless legal debates when this legislation deals with 
the first offences. It seems to me that as parliamentarians we have a 
responsibility not to pass laws without knowing whether or not they 
can be enforced.
<P>
	In the case before us, we have every reason to believe that the 
federal government, because it does not wish to co-operate with the 
provinces, will have to acquire additional policing and legal 
structures in order to be able to enforce its law. The federal 
government will have to deploy considerable resources in order to 
oversee hospitals, research centres and private companies in all 
provinces.
<P>
	Apart from the fact that once again the federal government is 
interfering in the field of health, which, according to the 
Constitution, comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
provinces, the creation of this agency promises to be costly and a 
source of duplication, resulting in delays and inefficiency.
<P>
	As well, seeing the federal government's inability to apply or 
obtain compliance for its moratorium on certain reproductive 
technologies, there are doubts about its ability to enforce its 
legislation without the support of the provinces, which in their 
capacity as the administrators of health systems, are in the best 
position to act.
<P>
	The confusion we see in this government is reflected in its bill, 
and it is astonishing that it deals with reproductive techniques, 
commercial operations, and genetic manipulations on the same 
footing. It would have been appropriate to make a clear 
differentiation between assisted procreation, basic research and 
commercial ventures.
<P>
	On the one hand, there is the issue of the provision of legitimate 
care and treatment to people who are merely trying to create life in 
order to establish a family, but who are unable to do so without the 
assistance of medical science to overcome the obstacles nature has 
placed in their way.
<P>
	On the other hand, there is the issue of medical or scientific 
research in genetics, perhaps with praiseworthy intent, but raising 
serious ethical issues, the first of these being whether the end 
justifies the means, and whether, consequently, all manner of 
manipulations of living  matter may be permitted provided they are 
for the good of humanity.
<P>
	Finally, there is the commercial aspect, relating to the sale of 
products created using the latest scientific techniques, if the word 
``product'' can be used when transmitting life is involved. In our 
health system, which is public and accessible to all, the underlying 
concept is still the provision of medical care and services to the 
public.
<P>
	Private enterprise can benefit from participation in the provision 
of this care, but it is difficult to stomach the idea of strictly 
commercial operations, the principal purpose of which would be 
profit, without throwing our entire system open to re-examination. 
The idea of selling human beings, which became obsolete when 
slavery was abolished, must not be allowed to be revived.
<P>
	You will have readily understood that the new reproductive 
techniques can be applied to completely different areas, and that it 
would be dangerous to liken them without distinction. Yet this is 
what the government has done. After its initial slowness, now it is 
acting precipitously and in an atmosphere of confusion.
<P>
	It is ironic to note that the federal government is creating a new 
structure to control reproductive technologies, while the successive 
cuts being applied on the federal level to health transfers, which are 
disguised under the lengthy title of Canada Health and Social 
Transfer, have had the effect of placing the provinces in a difficult 
situation as far as health care funding is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	How can the Liberal government, which is cutting health 
financing, force new national standards on the provinces for 
reproductive technologies, which they will have to apply, subject to 
financial penalties, without even consulting them on the content of 
those standards, while at the same time imposing a major cut in 
financing? The explanation is that this government wants to 
centralize at all cost, and the federal minister want to control 
everything in order to have greater powers.
<P>
	This rigid approach, which brings more federal standards and 
less financing, shows clearly enough that expressions like ``flexible 
federalism'' or ``profitable federalism'' have become futile and 
outdated.
<P>
	The whole approach of this bill shows that the health of 
Canadians and Quebecers is not a priority for this government. Its 
priority is to control everything from Ottawa and to centralize in an 
atmosphere of confrontation. Co-operative federalism is gone, 
welcome to the Liberal kingdom of Plan B.
<P>
	There are numerous reasons why the Bloc Quebecois cannot 
support this bill. It is incomplete and does not contain an 
appropriate definition of the goals of the act and responsibilities for 
its implementation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5973"> 5973 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, this bill does not amend the Criminal Code as the 
Opposition had asked, which complicates its implementation. 
Third, it creates a federal agency in the area of health, which is 
a provincial jurisdiction, and tries to impose national standards, 
which will cause more jurisdictional disputes. Finally, this bill 
imposes national health standards.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like so many 
people I am concerned about the health technologies, and having 
followed the proceedings of the Baird commission, which went on 
for a number of years, I looked forward to the tabling of the federal 
government's bill on reproductive and genetic technologies.
<P>
	There are many new approaches to health care and research, and 
one of them involves altering the genetic code. This is useful 
because some diseases can be cured in this way, and now we can 
see whether babies who are still in their mother's womb are likely 
to have certain health problems and then try to correct them. There 
are many reasons why we were looking forward to this bill. And 
especially since there is both a moral and a medical dimension.
<P>
	When we started altering the genetic code and talking about sex 
selection and the various technologies that are possible, when we 
talk about the sale of embryos and surrogate mothers, this is what 
society has been debating in Canada and Quebec for years.
<P>
	I expected the federal government's bill to be complete at least 
in one respect. I listened to the speech by the member for 
Laurentides, and I realize that eventually another bill will 
compensate for the shortcomings in the one before the House 
today.
<P>
	I just want to put a question to the hon. member for Laurentides, 
considering the fact that Canada, in its present state, is a vast 
country whose diversity is such that people differ in the way they 
see things.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	I realize, as I read polls like Angus Reid, that people in Quebec 
and the Atlantic provinces do not react in the same way to certain 
questions as people in British Columbia and Western Canada.
<P>
	I think this might be one of those areas where we should have 
decentralized. This is probably one of those areas where we should 
not have national standards. I am not saying that ethics should vary 
from one area to the next, because I think certain practices should 
be condemned in Quebec as well as in British Columbia or the 
Atlantic provinces, but I think that depending on the location, there 
may be a way to put some different interpretations on certain 
practices.
<P>
	If we had decentralized towards the provinces, since health care 
is their jurisdiction, I think we would have had a better and more 
flexible interpretation of the  legislation. What I am afraid of in this 
area is uniformity, the federal approach, the national approach. I do 
not think this area is one that lends itself to uniformization.
<P>
	My question to my colleague is this: even if we did not consider 
the constitutional implications, according to her, would it have 
been better to proceed with a form of decentralization, to amend 
the Criminal Code and let the provinces be responsible for 
enforcement, so that enforcement could be flexible across what is 
now Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to point out that what my 
colleague for Drummond-our health critic-asked was that 
instead of this bill, it would be legally more desirable for the justice 
department to draft legislation banning certain technologies.
<P>
	But instead, the government is interfering in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. This must be pointed out. For the benefit of 
all our viewers, I would like to read the position the Bloc 
Quebecois has always maintained and will continue to maintain 
with regard to health care.
<P>
	I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Under subsections 92(7) and 92(16) of the 1867 act, and according to their 
interpretations by many courts, health and welfare are areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. This being said, the Bloc Quebecois is in favour of the five national 
standards enshrined in the Canada Health Act, in other words it supports the 
underlying principles of the health care system. However, it believes that the 
provinces must have full authority in the matter.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>This position stems from a number of factors, especially the government's 
financial withdrawal. As a matter of fact, the repeated unilateral cuts in health care 
funding to the provinces have resulted, in Quebec alone, in a $7.9 billion shortfall in 
health care budgets. While the provinces are subject to national standards coupled 
with financial penalties for non-compliance, they have no control over the level of 
funding they get from Ottawa.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Bloc Quebecois finds this situation unacceptable since all the federal 
government is doing is passing on to the provinces the cuts aimed at controlling the 
federal deficit, without any regard for their impact on the health care system, which 
it claims it is protecting. The Bloc Quebecois is extremely concerned and worried by 
the consequences these drastic and repeated cuts might have for the health care 
system as we know it today.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois intends to do all it can, through the stands it 
takes, to preserve the principles of universality, accessibility, public management, 
comprehensiveness, and portability.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>However, it believes that, in the current context, the federal government is 
jeopardizing its own standards by making the provinces bear the burden of these cuts 
in order to bring its deficit under control.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Therefore, the Bloc Quebecois demands that the federal government respect 
provincial jurisdiction in the area of health care; consequently, it must withdraw 
from this area and transfer all federal health care moneys to Quebec.</BLOCKQUOTE>

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I enjoyed my colleague's speech. She brought forth a 
number of very interesting concerns.
<P>
	Most poignant was that the concernsof the Bloc Quebecois 
member and the people of Quebec are the same as those of the 
people of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Newfoundland or 
any other province. The legislation demonstrates the 
heavy-handedness of the central federal government. It is a concern 
for all of us.
<P>
	If Quebec separates, does the member feel the people of Quebec 
would be covered under the principles of the Canada Health Act? 
Would that coverage be effective if they travelled to other Canadian 
provinces, and vice versa?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Guay:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to give a short answer. That 
was a very long question, which would require a debate that could 
last a very long time. I would like to say to my colleague that 
Quebec has always been innovative in its legislation, in particular 
in the area of health. Quebec would continue to be innovative, and 
might do so even more rapidly as a sovereign country.
<P>
	This being said, today's debate does not deal with the Quebec 
constitution or the Canadian Constitution but with health, an area 
which also involves morality and ethics. I would like us to go back 
to this bill rather than talking about the Constitution.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted you are in the chair because your great love 
of literature is well known to us all and I will take the House on a 
literary voyage this afternoon.
<P>
	First, I will make a few remarks on Bill C-47 which address how 
the government and this country will manage the reproductive and 
genetic technologies that face us in the next century.
<P>
	It is to a great extent a bill I support but it is a bill based on fear. 
We now realize we have attained the technological ability to 
actually manipulate the human entity, the physical human being.
<P>
	There are some prohibited practices which are particularly 
horrifying. I think I speak for most Canadians when I say we are 
very nervous when we read of this type of thing being possible, the 
actual genetic alteration of genes and changing the very character 
of the human being which may be born in next generation. The 
cloning of human embryos is something that is straight out of 
science fiction novels. It is something that we may see in ``Star 
Trek''. Now as a government we see this as a possibility and it is 
something we want to prohibit.
<P>
	One prohibited practice is the creation of animal human hybrids. 
It gives us shivers to think of the possibility we now have the 
technology that may make it possible. The transfer of embryos 
between humans and other species is something which is 
horrifying. The creation of embryos for research purposes seems to 
lower human dignity to the point where only scientific endeavour is 
important and not human dignity.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	We are all concerned about and abhor these things to a greater or 
lesser extent. Fear sparks the bill, a very legitimate fear that has its 
origins in our culture and in our literature.
<P>
	I will take the House back to <I>Frankenstein</I>, a novel by Mary 
Shelley in 1818. <I>Frankenstein</I> is probably one of the most well read 
or distributed novels in the English language. It has probably been 
translated into every imaginable language.
<P>
	The story deals with a scientist in the early 19th Century who 
harnessed electricity. As as result he found he was able to animate a 
human being that he created out of body parts obtained from 
cemeteries. He was engaged in body snatching. At the time that 
Mary Shelley wrote the novel-and she did it in about three 
days-body snatching for medical research was a common and 
accepted practice in Britain although the public was horrified by it.
<P>
	In any event the monster was created. He was not a monster 
initially. He was seen by Dr. Frankenstein, the scientist, as 
something he could create as a result of science. He could put these 
body parts together and give this being life. For a moment Dr. 
Frankenstein became like God. He animated life.
<P>
	We know what happened. The human being that was created by 
the scientist became a monster in the eyes of humankind. He was 
an individual with a sense of emotion, a sense of wanting to belong, 
who eventually committed murder. He was so horrible and 
monstrous to look at that he was pursued and destroyed.
<P>
	The picture of Frankenstein is something that has echoed down 
through the years. It is a part of our culture. It is a part of the 
francophone culture as well because the <I>Hunchback of Notre Dame</I>, 
for example, is about another monster in our society that could be 
created by humankind.
<P>
	Another novel comes even closer to the type of prohibited 
practices we talk about in Bill C-47, <I>The Island of Dr. Moreau</I>, 
which was written in 1896 by H. G. Wells. H. G. Wells is famous 
for having written the novels <I>The Time Machine</I> which involved 
going back in time and <I>War of the Worlds</I> which involved an 
invasion of earth by Martians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5975"> 5975 </A></B>
<P>
	<I>The Island of Dr. Moreau</I> is less well known. In this novel a 
young man is marooned on an island where experiments are being 
undertaken by a surgeon-scientist by the name of Dr. Moreau. Dr. 
Moreau takes creating human beings a step further. He has 
travelled to a remote island and he is in the process of taking 
animals and reshaping them by surgery into human beings. The 
island becomes filled with various types of beasts who resemble 
humans.
<P>
	The theory at the time was that if body parts were changed 
around to make an animal look human it would acquire human 
characteristics including speech. On <I>The Island of Dr. Moreau</I> 
these various animal humans had the power of speech. Our hero on 
the island is very frightened by them.
<P>
	Let me read a bit from the novel. This part describes the hero 
encountering the creations of Dr. Moreau. It reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The two most formidable Animal Men were my Leopard-man and a creature 
made of hyena and swine. Larger than these were three bull-creatures who pulled in 
the boat. Then came the silvery-hairy-man, who was also the Sayer of the Law, 
M'ling, and a satyr-like creature of ape and goat. There were three Swine-men and a 
Swine-woman, a mare-rhinoceros-creature, and several other female whose sources I 
did not ascertain.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the most chilling moments in the novel is when the hero 
on the island tries to escape from the compound of Dr. Moreau and 
enters the jungle. He encounters these animal humans and is chased 
by all nightmarish creatures that are half animal and half human. 
There was a chillingness. I would like to read the passage but it 
would take too long. It was a chilling to imagine this man going 
through the dark and moonlit forest and being chased by various 
creatures that were half leopard and half man.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	This image of horror achieved by H. G. Wells just about 100 
years ago entered the psyche of English speaking society of the day 
just as the novel <I>Frankenstein</I> and similar novels dealing with 
cloning and the creation of human animal creatures have done. We 
have this sense of horror when we even contemplate the concept of 
marrying the human being with the animal, with a creature.
<P>
	Obviously both these novels spring out of Christian traditions 
from the Middle Ages, medieval paintings of the devil's creatures 
as being half man and half beast. Literature and the arts have an 
effect on culture like a pebble thrown into the pond. The ripple goes 
down through the ages and touches all people. We do not need to 
have actually read the novels. We do not need to have read <I>The 
Island of Dr. Moreau</I> to have felt the effect of the story told by H. 
G. Wells at that time.
<P>
	The reason we react so negatively and we feel Bill C-47 is 
necessary is that we see the possibility of creating animal human 
hybrids. We experience the same fear  innate in the novel 
<I>Frankenstein</I> or the novel <I>The Island of Dr. Moreau</I>. In many 
respects we are reacting to something in our culture as a result of 
our literature and our religion.
<P>
	There is one problem. What will happen in the future when we 
pass these laws, when we forbid as we will do genetic tinkering? 
What will happen a decade from now when a married couple want 
to have children but carry the cystic fibrosis gene or the muscular 
dystrophy gene? Will there not be a huge pressure to do something 
to prevent these couples from having children who will die by age 
30? I had a friend who had a daughter with cystic fibrosis. It is a 
terrible wasting disease of children. Their lungs fill up with fluids, 
a thick mucous. Muscular dystrophy is similar in a sense that it is a 
wasting disease. It is a tragedy to see young people suffer from it.
<P>
	In both instances they are genetic illnesses. It may be possible 
through genetic tinkering to prevent the embryos from carrying 
that genetic defect. There will be a huge pressure to go around the 
essence of this law when it comes to tinkering with human genes. 
There will be people who will be wanting that change to have 
healthy and whole children.
<P>
	There is another aspect. Science marches on. Science is 
something that humans at various points in history have tried to 
stop. They have tried to stand in its way because they feared the 
results coming down the road. We are not the first ones who have 
tried to pass legislation that prevents the development of new 
technology. In this case it is human technology but there are many 
times in the past when there has been an effort to prevent changes 
we are afraid of.
<P>
	I will quote again from the book <I>The Island of Dr. Moreau''.</I> This 
is the doctor himself speaking. He is explaining why he has 
undertaken this fearsome experiment of creating human beings out 
of animals. We should all take note of what he said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You see, I went on with this research just the way it led me. That is the only way I 
ever heard of research going. I asked a question, devised some method of obtaining 
an answer, and got a fresh question. Was this possible or that possible? You cannot 
imagine what this means to an investigator, what an intellectual passion grows upon 
him!</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	While I support Bill C-47 absolutely, we will never be able to 
stop the progress of science that heads in directions of which we are 
fearful. The very technological possibilities we fear will 
nevertheless become subjects of curiosity and research. Ultimately 
I am sure research will continue on those subjects.
<P>
	I have a few more words of Dr. Moreau. He was talking about 
these beast humans he created. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To this day I have never troubled about the ethics of the matter. The study of 
Nature makes man at last as remorseless as Nature.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	I will use the opportunity of speaking to Bill C-47 to make a 
prediction. There are a number of prohibited practices here 
including those I have mentioned. I predict that in 50 years 
two-thirds of these prohibited practices will be legal in this 
country and one-third will have been tried somewhere in the 
world.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise a 
second time to say how much I appreciated the speech of the 
member who just spoke. I think he put the question well and his 
selection of literary quotes was relevant.
<P>
	There is a French novelist-I am not sure of his name-who 
wrote a book entitled <I>Les animaux dénaturés</I>, a story about a 
crossbreeding between monkeys and man that turned out badly.
<P>
	The member mentioned a number of practices that are 
objectionable, and I agree with him. He also mentioned all the 
possibilities that science has to offer to cure a number of illnesses. I 
agree with him on the fact that in maybe 50 years from now, 
considering what is happening now in the field of genetics 
research, something around two thirds of what will have been done 
will be for the best and the other third will have been made illegal, 
if the laws of ethics and, more simply, of humanity, remain the 
same.
<P>
	There is a French scientist who, at some point, ended genetic 
research performed on animals because the same procedure could 
have been applied to man. He thought that, considering the present 
state of science, ethics and even religion, this research had to be 
stopped.
<P>
	But research must go on. However, such things as paying donors, 
sex selection, artificial uteruses, cloning, choosing the sex-as we 
all know, in some cultures, it is far better to be a man than a 
woman-those techniques could create a situation where there will 
be more men than women. This is the cultural issue, but there is 
also a moral and even a religious issue.
<P>
	I ask my colleague why the government did not include these 
measures, which it often describes as horrifying and terrifying, in 
the Criminal Code. I think Canadians would have readily 
understood that some of these procedures are in fact in the criminal 
realm.
<P>
	What about cloning. If I remember well, that means you create 
two genetically identical human beings. These are not twins, they 
are clones, just like computers.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	I think that would be criminal. Why did the government not seize 
the opportunity to ban these procedures and include them in the 
Criminal Code? Then, Canadians would have understood that it is a 
crime to do such things, that those procedures are criminal 
activities. Now it seems we equate something forbidden by the 
Criminal Code with something immoral. We all  know that very 
often there is a difference between the two. Some activities might 
be very immoral but acceptable according to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	Why were those procedures the previous member called horrible 
and reprehensible, and for good reason, not incorporated in the 
Criminal Code?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Jonquière for his question. I do not think there are any easy answers 
for that.
<P>
	It is very difficult to make a branch of scientific research into a 
criminal offence. I hate to bring up such a subject but it is like 
abortion which is a medical practice.
<P>
	When you apply the Criminal Code to that type of activity, Mr. 
Speaker, it is a tremendous moral quagmire because scientific 
research, scientific and medical understanding is always a 
two-edged sword. On the one hand, in the case of chemical 
weaponry or germ warfare research we should condemn these 
activities and practices as criminal.
<P>
	On the other hand, chemotherapy for cancer is a direct result of 
the development of mustard gas bombs during the first and second 
world wars. The aerosol spray can is a product of research on germ 
warfare. Penicillin, the antibiotic, was developed as a result of 
research into germ warfare.
<P>
	When we enter into the field of reproductive technology we are 
fearful. It is, after all, just another step in a scientific endeavour and 
the expansion of the understanding of ourselves and the world we 
live in. We want to apply moral standards and rightly so.
<P>
	The principle of applying Criminal Code sanctions against 
scientific research is dangerous. I prefer that the moral, ethical and 
irresponsibility problem is dealt with-with penalties-in a 
separate body of law, separate from the Criminal Code.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for 
Hamilton-Wentworth for his intervention on this bill. I have some 
concern about the type of reading material he enjoys but we all 
have our likes and dislikes.
<P>
	I was interested too in the question from the hon. member for 
Jonquière who is calling for this type of activity to take place over 
amendments to the Criminal Code. It confused me when I heard 
that because on October 7, 1994 the member for Laval Centre 
called for the government to table a bill to regulate practices 
connected with new reproductive technologies.
<P>
	On December 7, 1994 the member for Laval Centre said: ``It is 
increasing clear that the commercialization of human genetic 
material, embryos and the fetal tissue is growing in Canada''. She 
called for regulation in this area.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5977"> 5977 </A></B>
<P>
	The position of the Bloc is further confused by the fact that on 
July 5, 1995 the government brought forward a voluntary 
moratorium on some of these practices and there was criticism 
that it was not going far enough and that there were no real 
sanctions against those who would continue with these types of 
practices.
<P>
<B>(1650 )</B>
<P>
	On June 5, 1996 the member for Drummond said that this area 
was in urgent need of legislation. The government is doing exactly 
what Bloc members asked us to do.
<P>
	Then they come forward with this notion that somehow an 
amendment to the Criminal Code is the way to go. They have to 
talk with one voice. They have to talk on one steady theme. They 
cannot be jumping all over the place when it comes to deciding 
whether this should take the form of legislation in a bill or 
amendments to the Criminal Code.
<P>
	That argument aside, I was very interested in the argument put 
forward by the member for Hamilton-Wentworth because he did 
touch on-we are all exposed in one way or another-an individual 
who he knows with cystic fibrosis.
<P>
	I went back to check it out because I was interested in the line 
that the member brought forward. Something like germ line genetic 
alteration apparently has the potential to permanently alter the 
human gene pool by changing the genetic structure of individuals 
in ways that are passed on to their offspring.
<P>
	Several other geneticists in the field are against this idea. Several 
other countries have already investigated it. They are against it. 
The geneticists are not sure how these genes interact after they 
have been altered. They quite frankly admit that they do not have 
the knowledge of what happens to these genes when they are 
altered. It is because of that lack of knowledge that the countries 
and the geneticists have come together to say that currently there is 
still great potential for harm in this area. We are still in the research 
stage.
<P>
	Again, when this bill comes forward-it may be void of what the 
hon. member is including in the bill-it does not preclude the 
government at this date or in a date of review two, three or four 
years, depending on whenever the committee decides when this bill 
should be reviewed, to look again at this germ line genetic 
alteration and say: ``Okay, it is safe now. Let's bring it in as an 
amendment to the bill and incorporate it''.
<P>
	Until we know it is a safe practice, until the geneticists and other 
countries come together in their research to know that it will not 
significantly harm or further complicate the gene pool, then we 
have to be very cautious in the implementation of this legislation 
and what it contains.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bryden:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Hamilton 
West, my neighbour, for his remarks. Let me say that the lack of 
knowledge about the consequences of genetic research is precisely 
what I was talking about.
<P>
	The reason we are worried about it is that we do not know the 
impact it will have on future generations of human beings. We do 
not know what those human beings will look like and what 
problems they will have.
<P>
	The point I was making in my speech is that, nevertheless, 
despite this fear, despite the fact it will never be safe to alter genes, 
to tinker with the genes, the desire to help the people who have 
genetic diseases like cystic fibrosis or muscular dystrophy will 
overwhelm those fears.
<P>
	It will be precisely as the speaker says, this law will be amended 
in the future. It will be changed and we will experiment in that area. 
We cannot stop the progress of science. We can delay it no matter 
what the fears but science will go on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure today to speak to Bill C-47. Before I get 
into my primary intervention, I would like to make a few 
comments about what my hon. friend from the Liberal Party said.
<P>
	He mentioned that this bill is based on fear. Yes, it is based on 
fear. It is a triumph of fear over fact and a triumph of ignorance 
over knowledge. That is a shame.
<P>
	The hon. member quite correctly and eloquently mentioned the 
tremendous benefits that could be derived. He eloquently 
demonstrated that in the examples of cystic fibrosis and muscular 
dystrophy, two genetic diseases that exact a terrible toll on the 
youth of the world. These are diseases which snuff out life in its 
prime, before it can ever achieve its true potential.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	Having personally seen these diseases up close and having 
watched many of these people die, I can only say it is beyond belief 
that this House would even comprehend a bill that would deprive 
people from the opportunity and hope of having a cure.
<P>
	The member quite correctly mentioned that genetic surgery can 
take place all through the genes. That would help people in the 
future not have these terrible diseases. We can eliminate these 
scourges within our midst if we have the tools. However, Bill C-47 
states that the bureaucrats will now have the power to stop the 
research and medical communities from developing and accessing 
the tools that can be of such enormous benefit to people.
<P>
	The member quite correctly mentioned the fact that many 
previous discoveries have come from research that people tried to 
ban in times past. Thankfully for all of us here, that research was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5978"> 5978 </A></B>
<P>
not banned. If it had been I can guarantee that some of the people in 
this room would not be here today. It is because of research that we 
have  been able to eliminate these scourges and save millions and 
millions of lives.
<P>
	There are 13 proposals in this bill for banning certain things. 
Some ought to be banned because they pose a threat to our species 
and to other species. However, we need to determine what those 
are. We ought not take a sledgehammer and deprive the research 
community from developing those tools that are going to benefit 
humanity.
<P>
	Canadian researchers have made significant and enormous 
contributions to the international medical community, to research 
in many areas. Unfortunately, the government is gutting research 
and depriving the research community so it cannot provide these 
important discoveries that are going to benefit everybody.
<P>
	This bill stems from a study that cost the Canadian taxpayers 
over $30 million. This is money that could have been well spent in 
some other areas, particularly in view of the fact that Canadians are 
not receiving essential services that they need and in fact are 
getting sicker and sometimes dying on waiting lists. Essential 
health care services are being rationed because there is not enough 
money to meet the demands on the health care system.
<P>
	In that backdrop, the government chose to spend $30 million 
putting this study together, a study, I might add, which did not 
consult some of the primary players in reproductive technologies 
and infertility. They were grouped into a few areas and I would like 
to illustrate a few of those.
<P>
	I cannot believe that the government would ask that bureaucrats 
deprive the 15 per cent of Canadian couples who cannot have 
children and who desperately want to have children. How arrogant 
can it be to deprive people from having the choice? The 
government has lumped into this bill things that need to be treated 
in a very serious fashion, but some of things need to be regulated or 
in fact banned. However, we need to determine what should be 
banned, what should be regulated and what should be allowed.
<P>
	The government has taken a cudgel and has said to the Canadian 
people: ``Bang. This is not going to be allowed. The benefits of the 
research in these areas are simply not going to be allowed''.
<P>
	There are other areas that are extremely important. The 
government talks about germ cell line alteration. The Liberal 
member who previously spoke brought up some fanciful 
descriptions from <I>The Island of Dr. Moreau</I> and from 
<I>Frankenstein</I>.
<P>
	However, I think we need to look at this in a very factual way. As 
we speak some genetic alterations are taking place in animals, for 
example pigs, to provide people with organs which will be able to 
survive in people who need organ transplants.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
	I ask that members look very deeply into their souls. I would like 
members to ask themselves if they would deprive a 20-year old 
person who was previously healthy but through no fault of their 
own has a viral infection of the heart and needs a new one. Without 
a new heart that person would die.
<P>
	Sadly, there simply are not enough organs to provide all the 
people who need them. Bless the hearts of those souls who die 
tragically but who have arranged that their organs be donated to 
other people. That gift of life brings honour to them and their 
families.
<P>
	This bill would deprive science of providing people with organs 
that would work a lot better in their bodies. Researchers are 
working on the organs of pigs which will have a much greater 
chance of surviving in humans with fewer side effects.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Liberal Party mentioned cystic 
fibrosis, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and a host of other genetic 
problems. These research capabilities that the government chooses 
to ban will deprive Canadians and the rest of the world of being 
able to share the benefits of any discoveries.
<P>
	There are many other genetic possibilities. Science is on the 
threshold of discovering areas where we can make very significant 
improvements in the health and welfare of Canadians. However the 
government wants to deprive Canadians of this benefit.
<P>
	The government wants to create a new registry. The purpose of 
the registry indicates that the bureaucracy thinks it knows more 
than research. The registry is going to cost money that we do not 
have because it has to come out of the existing health care budget. 
This budget is strained beyond the demands that are placed on it 
right now.
<P>
	We need not look any further than the Ottawa heart institute 
where people sadly have died while waiting for important and 
urgent cardiovascular surgery.
<P>
	The bill also proposes to spend money. The bill also proposes as 
its hidden agenda to have things such as in vitro fertilization 
covered under the medical services plan. In committee I asked Dr. 
Patricia Baird how this would be done, given the fact that the 
demands of society on our medical services far exceed what can be 
provided. How can we afford to cover procedures such as IVF 
which costs $5,000 under the medical plan? This would make it a 
right for every single person in Canada. We do not have the money 
to do this. It is high time we prioritized our spending. The 
government has chosen to prevent infertile couples from having 
access to this.
<P>
	In its wisdom the government's rationale is, why should things 
such as in vitro fertilization be brought down to the lowest common 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5979"> 5979 </A></B>
<P>
denominator of commerce? Nobody is going to get rich donating 
their sperm or ova.  It is not a business people want to get into. The 
moneys given to the people who choose to donate their sperm or 
ova is compensation for the time, effort and the extensive studies 
and trial tests necessary in making a donation. It is not much 
money and compensation is necessary to get willing donors.
<P>
	In other countries where the compensation factor has been 
withdrawn the number of donors has dropped precipitously. When 
that drops precipitously, the access couples have to in vitro 
fertilization drops too. What will they do? They will go to the 
United States and get it done there at a greater cost and with greater 
suffering to them. They do not need that when they are already 
suffering under the yoke of not being able to have children.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	Philosophically I do not see how the government can take it upon 
itself to put research under the realm of a group of bureaucrats who 
may not know anything at all about the complex issues at hand. 
Would it not make more sense first to determine what needs to be 
regulated because research is being pursued in an area where there 
is a danger to society, to our species and others?
<P>
	First determine whether these research initiatives pose a threat. 
If that is so, then let us work with the research community to 
produce regulations or if necessary to ban them. The government 
has chosen not to do that. Instead it has chosen to take its 
sledgehammer and squash these initiatives lock, stock and barrel.
<P>
	Some constructive solutions could be employed. Some of these 
solutions involve the identification of the procedures to be covered, 
the procedures that should not be banned and the procedures that 
should be allowed to take place.
<P>
	I do not know where the government has come from on this issue 
except that it wants to create a new registry and regulate an area in 
which it has no place. I ask rhetorically whether the government is 
going to regulate other areas of medical research, or physics 
research, or chemistry research, or research in other basic sciences. 
The government has not done that. It is singling out this area 
because a very small number of people who have ingratiated 
themselves into Health Canada have brought it upon themselves in 
their moral way and decided they are the ones best suited to decide 
which way research should go. That is heavy handed and 
completely arrogant.
<P>
	The government should not have bothered itself with an area in 
which it has no place. It should have concerned itself with the far 
more pressing problems which exist concerning the health and 
welfare of Canadians.
<P>
	Today I attended an international conference on smoking which 
the Minister of Health was at. He said this morning in a heartfelt 
way to the hundreds of people who were there: ``I am going to 
bring good, constructive health legislation to the House forthwith''.  
He also said: ``Judge me by what I do, not by what I say''. The 
minister was talking out of both sides of his mouth because in the 
House today the minister said that he would bring forth legislation 
when he was good and ready.
<P>
	In March the minister promised that he would bring in tough 
legislation to regulate tobacco forthwith. He promised it twice in 
June. He promised it earlier this month. He promised it today. To 
date no one in this country has seen any regulation or any tough 
constructive ideas and legislation to prevent that which is the single 
most preventable cause of death within Canada.
<P>
	I need not remind the House and most of the members who have 
children that smoking is the single most important, detrimental 
problem that exists for Canada's youth today. And it is preventable. 
It is most tragic that with the tobacco tax rollback brought forth by 
the government in 1994, there has been a 30 to 40 per cent increase 
in the consumption of tobacco by children and teenagers. Every 
month 20,000 teenagers pick up tobacco. Every year 40,000 
Canadians die of tobacco related diseases. It is an issue which the 
government should be deeply concerned with.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Instead of concerning itself with the single most preventable 
cause of death in this country, one that exceeds the deaths from 
suicides, car accidents, gun shot wounds and AIDS by a factor of 
three, the government concerns itself with legislation on human 
reproductive technologies. It is depriving the Canadian public of 
research which would benefit many people around the world and 
technologies and medical benefits that would enable the 15 per cent 
of Canadians who are infertile to have an opportunity to have 
children.
<P>
	I cannot fathom how the government in all conscience can do 
this. I do not understand why the Minister of Health does not bring 
forth proper legislation to enable Canadians to have access to 
essential services. Government members continually claim that 
they are the ones who are going to uphold the Canada Health Act. 
They are the ones who say they will ensure access to essential 
health care services to every Canadian in a timely fashion.
<P>
	Accessibility is one of the most important aspects of the Canada 
Health Act. Access to health care is worse today than it was when 
the government came into power. Waiting lists are getting longer. 
The waiting lists for special services are much longer than they 
should be. That is not access. That is not upholding the Canada 
Health Act. That is not enabling Canadians to access health care in 
a timely fashion. It is deplorable that the government is playing 
politics with this issue, an issue which is so important to Canadians 
from coast to coast.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5980"> 5980 </A></B>
<P>
	With respect to the smoking issue, I remind the House it is 
particularly important in the province of Quebec where 
consumption is the highest in the country. It is a profound and 
tragic addiction which affects Quebecers. It puts an enormous 
strain on Quebec's health care budget. But it is an epidemic which 
is occurring from coast to coast.
<P>
	I hope the government will try to work with members across all 
party lines. Believe it or not, we all have the same goal. We all want 
to improve the health of Canadians. We all want to ensure that 
Canadians have access to health care in a timely fashion. That is the 
goal of the Reform Party. I am sure it is also the goal of the Liberal 
Party, the Bloc Quebecois and the New Democratic Party. We have 
to work together on this issue and put aside the rhetoric. We have to 
build a stronger, made in Canada health act with made in Canada 
solutions to provide better health care to all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to ask a question to my colleague from the Reform Party. But 
before doing so, I would like to remind government members that, 
indeed, it is true that the official opposition has urged the 
government to make some reproductive technologies a criminal 
offence. However, we have always said that health is under 
provincial jurisdiction. As for the Criminal Code, it is in the 
purview of the federal government. So it is the federal government 
that must take action in this area.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Reform member, who is a doctor, if he has 
noted in the bill before us that several clauses, definitions and 
terms are used and that these terms, clauses and definitions are 
vague, and if he noticed that, because they are very vague, they 
might be open to interpretation. Has he noted that the definition of 
these terms does not correspond to the medical definition?
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	We know our Reform colleague is a doctor, so I think that, 
through his professional activities, he has surely identified in the 
clauses some terms that are not really defined by medicine.
<P>
	Has he noted, like I did, that the vagueness of some of these 
terms might give rise to legal debates when this legislation deals 
with these first offences?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca): </B>Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from the Bloc Quebecois for her question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The hon. member raised a very good question. She is absolutely 
correct. The government has used a ham-fisted approach to try to 
craft a bill based on fear and not one based on any knowledge of the 
issue.
<P>
	The terms and definitions used are vague and broad. In a court of 
law they would be very difficult to support  unless the government 
were to be more explicit on the issue. The fact of the matter is that 
the government has a lot of work if it is to do this.
<P>
	That will be one of the stumbling blocks. It is one of the major 
reservations I personally have about the bill. The government has 
used a scythe to cut through huge areas of research. It has taken the 
good out with the bad. I am sure that is part of what my friend from 
the Bloc Quebecois was referring to and is one of the major 
problems with this ill crafted bill rooted in ignorance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will start with my comment first 
and then go to the question.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Why?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> The hon. member across the way wonders why. He 
said a little earlier that he deplored playing politics with this issue. 
I could point to a couple of the inconsistencies coming across the 
floor from the member of the third party.
<P>
	In September 1993 the Reform Party supported user fees, 
deductibles, and would eliminate universality. I remind the House 
of what magazine that was in: <I>Canadian Living</I>, September 1993. 
Just before the election of October 1993 the Reform party said that 
it was opposed to private health care and user fees. Where is the 
consistency there?
<P>
	The member for Macleod said in the House on October 17, 1995 
that medicare was bad for everyone. Can we imagine a Reform 
member saying medicare was bad for everyone. I am quoting from 
<I>Hansard</I>. Then on November 23, 1995 the member for Macleod 
said that medicare was important to all Canadians.
<P>
	Where is the consistency there? If they want to start playing 
politics there is plenty of it, but we are not interested in playing 
politics on this issue. Quite frankly I have a great deal of respect for 
the hon. member. He is an emergency medical surgeon. He knows 
what he is talking about when it comes to medical stuff. He has 
lived it. He has breathed it. He has partaken in it. At the same time 
he must understand that the objectives of the bill are to protect the 
health and safety of Canadians, to ensure the appropriate use of 
human reproductive materials outside the body, and to protect the 
dignity and security of all persons, especially women and children.
<P>
	Appropriate is the operative word we are using. We have to team 
up not just as researchers in the great country we call Canada but as 
geneticists outside Canada in other countries around the world who 
have done some research in this area. What may appear to the hon. 
member to be some kind of a broad stroke in the area of specifics in 
the bill are there intentionally to ensure that we are paying attention 
to the world when it comes to actions of speciality medicines, the 
actions of new research, the actions or the findings that come with 
research in the field of medicine. As I said earlier, we  have to 
protect women and children. We have to protect reproductive

<P>
materials outside the body and protect the dignity and security of 
all people.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	The hon. member spoke of in vitro fertilization. He attempted to 
build his case on a falsehood. He made the contention that the bill 
would ban in vitro fertilization. On what basis does the hon. 
member say this? Can he point to anywhere in the bill that says it 
would ban in vitro fertilization?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my hon. friend from the Liberal Party. His concerns are the 
same as our concerns. Our interest is in protecting the health and 
welfare of all Canadians, all people in this country. Our goal is 
exactly the same as that of the hon. member. The word appropriate 
is extremely important and I will get back to it.
<P>
	In answer to his question, Bill C-47 indicates that the buying and 
selling of eggs, sperm and embryos including their exchange for 
goods, services or other benefits but excluding the recovery of 
expenses incurred in the collection, storage and distribution of 
sperm, ova and embryos for persons other than a donor will be 
prohibited. The government will ban in vitro fertilization.
<P>
	I will address some of the hon. member's other concerns. He 
spoke about partisanship in the House. If the hon. member would 
look at my blues he would know that at the end of my speech I said 
I am sure members from all parties would be happy to work with 
the government to ensure we have effective legislation in this area 
and, more important, to ensure that Canadians get their essential 
health care services. The hon. member alluded to that.
<P>
	Canadians are not getting their essential health care services 
when they need them. Accessibility is being denied to Canadians. 
Provincial governments ration essential services because there is 
not enough money to do all we ask for right now. The government 
ripped out $3 billion in transfer payments to the provinces.
<P>
	If the government thinks that providing Canadians access to 
essential services is ripping out $3 billion in transfer payments to 
the provinces for health, it has another thing coming. That is not 
what we want to do.
<P>
	The Reform Party, for the 100th time, is committed to ensuring 
that every Canadian regardless of how much money they have in 
their pockets will have access to essential health care services when 
they medically need them, not when their pocketbook allows it and 
not when the bottom line in provincial coffers allow it. We are 
vehemently opposed to an American style health care system. We 
are the party that wants to ensure that Canadians have access to the 
essential services they need.
<P>
	If we are to move to an era where Canadians have access to 
essential health care services we must change our mindset. We 
must move toward an era where we will amend the Canada Health 
Act to give people choice. It is not a magic bullet. It is not a 
panacea for all that ills the health and welfare of Canadians, but it 
is a start.
<P>
	In conjunction with other initiatives including better 
management, identifying effective preventive measures and 
effective legislation on smoking and tobacco regulation, these 
measures can be used to build a stronger health act and to build a 
system that is distinct and superior to the those of the Americans, 
the British, the Germans and the French. Canada will build it. We 
can do it by making these amendments to the Canada Health Act.
<P>
	We cannot be entrenched in an act put forth decades ago that 
hamstrings the ability of our country and Canadians to move 
forward. If we adhere to the act in its entirety as it stands now, it 
prevents that from happening. The government is living a sham. 
The government is hamstringing the provinces from being able to 
provide health care to Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	Members of my party and I would be happy to present to the 
government any place, any time, anywhere, effective solutions to 
ensure that Canadians obtain their health care in a timely fashion.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to participate in the debate at 
second reading of Bill C-47, an act respecting human reproductive 
technologies and commercial transactions relating to human 
reproduction.
<P>
	We have been waiting for several years for a bill regulating the 
new rapidly changing reproductive technologies.
<P>
	What could be considered science-fiction only a few years ago is 
now an ever present reality that raises basic ethical issues. This is a 
complex problem that requires government intervention, of course, 
to ensure that science continues to serve mankind and not the other 
way around.
<P>
	This bill, which was tabled last June, results from a long process 
that started with the hearings of the Royal Commission on New 
Reproductive Technologies, the famous Baird Commission named 
after its chair.
<P>
	First demanded by several feminist organizations in 1977, this 
commission was finally established 12 years later in 1989. After 
four years of work marked by internal management problems, the 
resignation of four of its commissioners and, above all, an 
astronomical $28 million cost, the commission had heard, believe 
it or not, more than 40,000 witnesses. It is important to mention 
that no provincial government official was among these 40,000 
witnesses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5982"> 5982 </A></B>
<P>
	The commission also looked at the work of more than 300 
researchers before finally tabling in the fall of 1993 a 1,435-page 
report containing over 300 recommendations. So there was 
something to act on. But what did this government do after this 
report was tabled? It did not do anything except stall for a long 
time and act with a carelessness that is reflected in the bill before 
us today.
<P>
	So between 1993 and July 1995, this government did absolutely 
nothing except say that something needed to be done. Despite the 
official opposition's repeated demands for more than two years, the 
government persisted in doing nothing. For instance, when 
questioned, the Minister of Health of the day used to respond with 
vague examples and empty promises.
<P>
	Essentially, the debates went something like this. In January 
1994, in response to question by a government member, the then 
Minister of Health stated that Health Canada was actively 
addressing the recommendations contained in the Baird report 
which could be acted on quickly. That was in January 1994.
<P>
	Then, in February 1994, one month later, the Minister of Justice 
stated that studies were under way and that he would report back to 
the House in due course with the speed the urgency of the situation 
dictated.
<P>
	In October 1994, the Minister of Health indicated that she was 
developing rules in this respect and that there were some 
jurisdictional problems. ``But we are doing our job'', she 
concluded. We know how the federal government deals with 
problems that arise concerning jurisdiction: it ignores provincial 
jurisdictions. I will come back on this later.
<P>
	Still in 1994, it was a long year, in November this time, the 
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Health makes a 
statement to the effect that the issue was a serious, difficult and 
complex one, that raised controversy. In December 1994, the 
Minister of Health, in turn, stated that what was a complex problem 
back in November had become extremely complex. If nothing else, 
they were certainly single-minded.
<P>
	In March 1995, the minister announced her intention to put 
forward a policy on a new reproductive technology and that clearly 
the government was going to act.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	Act it did, in July 1995. While the House was not sitting and we 
were all trying to take some off, the minister imposed a voluntary 
moratorium on certain procedures involving new reproductive 
technologies, a moratorium that did not even cut it with those 
concerned and was mocked left and right.
<P>
	In January 1996, the second last stage, the Minister of Health 
announced that a committee had been established to do a follow up 
on the infamous moratorium, which was no longer described as 
voluntary but interim.
<P>
	This brings us to the tabling, in June, of Bill C-47, a bill that is as 
thin as it is vague, as my opposition colleagues have pointed out. 
But this bill clearly bears the stamp of the federal Liberals in terms 
of interference in provincial areas of jurisdiction, and the area of 
health in particular.
<P>
	Since the Baird report was tabled, the opposition has been 
relentlessly asking that governments provide a framework for 
reproduction technologies. The Government of Quebec has already 
included in Quebec's basic legislation, the Code civil, a provision 
that will make any surrogacy arrangement absolutely null and void. 
This is one way of using existing tools to make new laws.
<P>
	The area of health being a provincial area of responsibility, it is 
up to the provinces to set the standards and restrictions with respect 
to certain human reproduction procedures. It would have been easy 
for the federal government to act within its field of jurisdiction: it 
simply had to amend the Criminal Code so as to prohibit certain 
practices. This is what we wanted it to do. In this way, it would 
have added to the efforts of the provinces, while staying within its 
own field of jurisdiction.
<P>
	Once again, the government had a golden opportunity to act 
efficiently, while respecting the autonomy of the provinces 
regarding this issue.
<P>
	However, as we have often seen in this House, the government 
would rather interfere in fields of provincial jurisdiction. While it 
could simply have amended the Criminal Code to prohibit certain 
practices, such as the trade of embryos and ova, the government 
creates another useless national agency, which will impose 
standards from coast to coast, instead of letting the provinces 
define these standards themselves.
<P>
	I also want to draw your attention to clauses 4, 5, 6 and 7, which 
list prohibited activities. This is very enlightening: the cloning of 
human embryos, it took three years to introduce a bill on this; the 
creation of animal-human hybrids and the fusing of human and 
animal zygotes or embryos, again three years to arrive at this; the 
implant of a human embryo in an animal or an animal embryo in a 
woman; the alteration of the genetic structure of germ cells; the 
retrieving of sperm or ova from a foetus or cadaver for fertilization 
or research purposes requiring it to mature outside the human body; 
the choosing of the sex based on non-medical criteria; ectogenesis, 
that is the maintaining of an embryo in an artificial uterus.
<P>
	There is more. I will continue. This is very instructive. The 
research on human embryos after the 14th day following 
conception; the creation of embryos solely for research purposes; 
and, finally, giving or offering consideration for prohibited 
services.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5983"> 5983 </A></B>
<P>
	It is also prohibited to buy or sell ova, sperm or embryos, or 
to barter or exchange them for goods, services or other benefits, 
except the recovery of costs incurred in the collection, storage and 
distribution of sperm, ova and embryos for other persons; and, 
finally, the use, without the consent of the donor, of human sperm, 
ova or embryos for assisted human reproductive technologies, or 
for medical research.
<P>
	Thus, the prohibitions included in the voluntary moratorium are 
maintained, along with new ones.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Yet, after all these years since the report Baird was tabled, we 
could have expected much more rigour in this piece of legislation.
<P>
	For example, when we prohibit the use of diagnostic procedures 
solely to ascertain the sex of the foetus, except for medical reasons, 
for health reasons, what health reasons are we talking about? Does 
that include the mental health of the mother, or are we referring to 
the health of the foetus or of the parents? The bill says very little on 
that.
<P>
	Clause 7 prohibiting the use of sperm, ova or embryos for the 
purpose of research, donation, maturation or fertilization, specifies 
that the donor's consent must be obtained. One then can logically 
deduce that these uses would be allowed with the donor's consent. 
It is a prohibition without really being one. Moreover, this situation 
is inconsistent with some of the provisions of clause 4, which 
prohibits certain uses. This illustrates the lack of clarity of this bill.
<P>
	However, one question arises: is it possible that lack of clarity is 
provided to give full scope to the national agency that will be set up 
shortly to control and monitor new reproductive technologies? I am 
afraid so. The bill is of a very general nature, and the new agency, 
whose members will be appointed by the federal Minister of 
Health, will be given free rein to develop and implement policies 
concerning, probably, other areas besides the new reproductive 
technologies and to set new national medical and health standards.
<P>
	When the time comes to legislate on such an important issue, 
that raised basic concerns concerning the role of science in the 
human reproduction process, I think it is disgraceful for the federal 
government to see this as just another opportunity to infringe upon 
the areas of jurisdiction of Quebec and all the other provinces. 
Instead of setting up national agencies in each and every area and 
therefore creating useless and costly duplication, the government 
should consult with Quebec and all its other provincial 
counterparts, let them make decisions within their own areas of 
jurisdiction and act in its own areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	All that would be needed are a few amendments to the Criminal 
Code to prohibit the use of some technologies throughout Canada. 
Instead, the government introduces a  bill for which both the justice 
minister and the health minister are responsible, and we know what 
this will entail, and creates a national monitoring agency.
<P>
	One could hope that the government's only motive is to protect 
the health of all Canadians and Quebecers. However, it has another 
major motive, and I might go as far as saying a permanent motive, 
which is to ignore provincial areas of jurisdiction.
<P>
	As a former member of Parliament once said, the government is 
good for us, it wants what is best for us and will do anything to get 
it.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I must inform the House that there are 
two minutes left in this debate.
<P>
	I recognize the hon. member for Lévis for a question or a 
comment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, even though I 
studied that topic in detail, every time I listen to the hon. member 
for Laval Centre, I learn something new. She gave us an 
extraordinary historical background to this issue, not only by 
telling us what she witnessed in this House, the vague and virtuous 
answers provided by the former Minister of Health, but also by 
highlighting the report of the Baird commission. She reminded us 
that the commission heard some 40,000 witnesses.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	I know that the hon. member for Laval Centre has read the 
report, so I do not want to bore her with that, but what she is saying 
is that this very bulky report has resulted in a very slim bill of only 
a few pages. The report dealt with a significant issue, but only led 
to a bill so slim as to look trivial for such an important and a serious 
issue. I would like the hon. member to comment on this.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member has run out of time. It 
being 5.41 p.m., the House will now proceed to the consideration of 
Private Members' Business.

	The House resumed from October 3 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-236, an act to prevent the importation of radioactive 
waste into Canada, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for the opportunity to inform the 
House of the negative consequences of passing the legislation 
proposed in Bill C-236.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5984"> 5984 </A></B>
<P>
	There are many negative consequences of the proposed act. My 
intervention will concentrate on the negative consequences to the 
health of Canadians and other residents of developing as well as 
developed countries. It will also concentrate on the negative 
consequences on sustainable development activities that may 
require international co-operation.
<P>
	Canada has no plans to import nuclear fuel waste. Nevertheless 
Canadian officials are participating in the development of 
international recommendations on the practice of importing and 
exporting radioactive waste, particularly low level radioactive 
waste.
<P>
	The International Atomic Energy Agency or IAEA indicates that 
a state exporting radioactive material should take the appropriate 
steps necessary to permit readmission into its territory of any 
resulting radioactive waste which the importing state cannot 
dispose of properly unless another arrangement can be made.
<P>
	Thus the bill would affect the availability of medical, industrial 
and research equipment containing radioactive sources for 
developed and developing countries.
<P>
	With regard to developing countries, very few of these have 
disposal facilities and therefore may not be able to avail themselves 
of this type of equipment. In many cases, Canada is the leading 
exporter of such equipment and in some cases the only supplier to 
the world. Since many developing countries are in no position to 
adequately dispose of any radioactive waste resulting from the use 
of such equipment and materials, these countries may have but two 
alternatives.
<P>
	The first alternative is to turn to a non-Canadian supplier, if 
available, that would accept the return of radioactive waste but that 
may or may not properly dispose of this waste. The other 
alternative is simply to give up the health and environmental 
activities. This would necessarily increase risks to both health and 
the environment and make it more difficult to move toward 
sustainable development activities.
<P>
	If we believe that giving up good medical practice is not 
desirable, then to which states will the resulting radioactive waste 
be exported? Canada has the technological capability to properly 
manage this waste. Would passing the bill put forward by the 
member for Fraser Valley East indicate to the world that we are 
shirking our responsibilities to the developing world?
<P>
	We were very pleased to hear the member opposite state in the 
previous debate that ``Canada has a responsibility as an advanced 
industrial society to look for ways of helping other societies that 
are perhaps having a little trouble right now to find ways of treating 
the nuclear waste produced''.
<P>
	How do we help these countries? By pressuring them to spend 
considerable sums of money to deal with their own radioactive 
waste resulting from various uses, including medical procedures? 
Many developing  countries cannot afford to do so and must export 
their waste if they are to benefit from the peaceful and beneficial 
uses of nuclear energy. Should developed countries close their 
borders to them? If so, then not only would they not be helping in 
the development of these countries, but they would also be wilfully 
inhibiting the progress of developing countries toward sustainable 
development activities. This would be contrary to Canada's 
international relations, particularly in view of our past and present 
activities in assisting countries that are endeavouring to develop in 
a sustainable manner.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The legislation proposed in Bill C-236 could also impact on 
international co-operative activities on overall waste management 
services not only with developing countries but also with 
developed countries, particularly with the United States. Good 
co-operation with our neighbours on waste management issues is 
essential in view of future special circumstances which may arise 
requiring mutual assistance for the safe and effective management 
of waste.
<P>
	For instance, there have already been cases in other countries 
where hospitals have had to stop using certain medical procedures 
on patients because they were unable to ship the resulting 
radioactive waste to national disposal facilities due to temporary 
unavailability. In such instances it would be more than justifiable 
on a health basis to permit shipping the waste to a neighbouring 
country either for storage or disposal purposes until the temporary 
problem was resolved.
<P>
	A ban on the importation of radioactive waste might seem 
questionable to our neighbours. Therefore this bill would hamper 
Canada's assistance and co-operation with nations around the 
world, resulting in a decrease in the quality of health protection 
systems for Canadians and for residents in developing as well as 
developed countries.
<P>
	I urge the members of the House not to vote for this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak in support of Bill C-236, an act to prevent the 
importation of radioactive waste. This bill was introduced by my 
colleague from Fraser Valley East who I know has carefully studied 
the issue of nuclear waste and its potential for seriously harming 
the environment and endangering public health and safety. I know 
he is very concerned and has put a great deal of effort into this bill.
<P>
	One of the questions I want to address is one with which I think 
Canadians are concerned: Will Canada become the garbage bin of 
the world for nuclear waste? We certainly hope not. I am concerned 
to learn that there are over 400 commercial nuclear reactors in the 
world and many more small nuclear reactors in universities, on 
ships and in submarines. All of these reactors need a place to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5985"> 5985 </A></B>
<P>
dispose of their radioactive waste, waste which remains highly 
toxic for thousands of years.
<P>
	What better country than Canada to ship all this waste to? 
Canada has lots of land. It has a relatively small population. There 
are groups who might be willing to take a time bomb off the hands 
of other countries, especially those countries which have the ability 
to pay and pay handsomely. This thought is deeply disturbing to 
me. It has been a challenge for us to find suitable locations for our 
own nuclear waste. We certainly do not need to take on the 
radioactive waste of other countries, and there is certainly lots of it 
out there.
<P>
	The United States will be looking to dispose of 50 tonnes of 
plutonium over the next 25 years. Russia has another 50 tonnes. My 
colleague from Fraser Valley East tells me that at the Hanford site 
in the United States there is enough high level waste to fill 86 
football fields one metre deep. It will cost $57 billion just to 
dispose of the waste from that site.
<P>
	Some might suggest that allowing nuclear waste to be disposed 
of in Canada would have an economic benefit. However, our 
economic problems are not going to be solved by allowing Canada 
to become the nuclear garbage bin of the world. We have to solve 
those problems here. The provinces have shown us that we are on 
the way to a solution. If the federal government would get on board 
to a greater degree, we would be able to resolve our economic 
problems. This is not a method which we should use to solve those 
problems.
<P>
	We hear that there are certain aboriginal groups in Canada that 
are considering offering their lands for disposal purposes. Their 
lands lie over the Canadian Shield. They figure that they can make 
a fair amount of cash by allowing nuclear waste to be buried there. 
They call it economic development.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	With the pollution coming into Canada from some of the 
European countries and the United States, the Canadian Shield 
does not even have the ability to filter out the pollution problem we 
have. Some of the Canadian soil on the prairies has the buffering 
actions that are necessary but it certainly does not exist in the 
Canadian Shield which is basically rock.
<P>
	It seems to me that in the Nisga'a agreement, which will be used 
as a pattern by many other aboriginal self-governments, allows an 
aboriginal government to run its own environmental assessments. 
In effect, that local government can decide how harmful burying 
nuclear waste is on its land and whether it is worth the risk.
<P>
	I have no problem with aboriginal communities taking on 
Canadian nuclear waste if they feel it is profitable enough for them 
to do so, but I do not like the idea of taking on international waste. 
We need to solve our own problems but we do not have to solve the 
international problems. That has to be done in their own countries. 
It is bad enough to have to worry about our own highly toxic 
garbage. Let us not take on the dangerous toxic nuclear waste of 
other countries.
<P>
	I want to examine the question of whether this agreement 
contravenes NAFTA. There is some question about whether 
passing this act would contravene our trade agreement with the 
United States and Mexico. There is a NAFTA dispute settlement 
panel. If the panel was asked to look into this matter, several 
factors would have to be considered.
<P>
	Chapter nine in the NAFTA would certainly be scrutinized. This 
chapter sets out the permissible barriers to trade that are related to 
standards that a country might want to set for itself. Article 904 
allows a country to adopt any standards related measures that are 
important to its safety. The protection of human, animal and plant 
life is included here, as well as the environment. The article allows 
a country to prohibit the importation of a good or the provision of a 
service by another country that does not comply with this standards 
related measure.
<P>
	There would probably be some debate as to whether nuclear 
waste burial is the trade of a good or the provision of a service. 
There would also need to be some evidence of the danger to the 
environment for humans, plants and animals. There might also be 
some debate on whether prohibiting the importation might not pose 
an even greater danger to Canada. Burying the waste near our 
border might be more dangerous for our safety than burying it far 
away from populated areas.
<P>
	It is always difficult to predict the outcome of the legal 
wrangling that would take place. Much depends on the skill of the 
lawyers and the make-up of the panel. I would certainly be willing 
to place a bet that Canada could defend its standards related 
measure and maintain its right to prohibit the importation of 
nuclear waste. This is a very serious matter.
<P>
	I would like to add my weight to those who are calling for the 
ban on the importation of nuclear waste into Canada. Because it is a 
commodity that has a very dangerous level to our safety and has a 
life that goes on thousands of years, this has to be considered very 
carefully. We need some kind of provisions that limit the ability of 
certain groups to bring this into Canada.
<P>
	In conclusion, I call on all members of the House to support this 
bill and to vote in favour of it. Canada is a beautiful, wide open 
country with lots of forests, lakes and streams. Let us keep it as 
clean as we can and as waste free as possible. Let us not allow 
Canada to become the nuclear garbage bin of the world.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great interest that I take part today in this debate at second reading 
of Bill C-236 introduced by my colleague from Fraser Valley East, 
an act to prevent the importation of radioactive waste into Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5986"> 5986 </A></B>
<P>
	I want to remind you at the outset that, in May 1995, the report 
of the Auditor General of Canada contained a chapter on this issue, 
entitled: Federal Radioactive Waste Management. Page 3-5 of this 
report provides, and I quote: ``Canada has no disposal facilities 
for any of its high-level or low-level radioactive waste.'' And 
further on: ``Decisions still have to be taken in Canada on whether 
and how to proceed to a disposal solution. Despite the significant 
investment, in Canada, of about $538 million in research and 
development, there has been no consideration of alternative 
approaches for moving Canada's high-level radioactive waste 
program forward after March 1997, when current federal funding 
ends.''
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Clearly, Canada is not yet equipped to receive foreign countries' 
radioactive waste. Since Canada does not know yet what to do with 
its own waste, how could it deal with, dispose of or store other 
countries'?
<P>
	In this sense, the bill by my Reform colleague may seem 
premature and untimely, since Canada is not soon going to become 
the nuclear waste dumpsite of the world. But as untimely as it may 
be, Bill C-236 is to me a good message to send to the authorities so 
that they seriously question the appropriateness of bringing foreign 
countries' nuclear waste to our shores.
<P>
	Currently, Canadian nuclear authorities are considering two 
projects for our nuclear waste. The first one deals with the 
permanent storage of spent fuel, or highly radioactive waste, and 
the other one deals with the development of a low radioactive waste 
disposal site in Ontario, in Deep River to be more precise.
<P>
	As far as the permanent storage of spent fuel is concerned, the 
authorities are considering the possibility of storing this highly 
radioactive waste in a huge cave dug into the Canadian shield. 
According to present plans, this cave should be ready by the year 
2025 and more than 4 million spent fuel clusters could be stored 
there. For your information, a cluster is about the size of a fireplace 
log and the anticipated 4 million clusters represent a volume 
equivalent to that of seven Olympic swimming pools. This spent 
fuel, 85 per cent of which is produced by Hydro Ontario reactors, 
remains highly radioactive for at least 500 years, and its handling 
requires appropriate steps to ensure the protection of human beings 
and the environment during this period.
<P>
	In fact, certain elements of this fuel remain harmful for tens of 
thousands of years if they escape containment and are ingested or 
inhaled.
<P>
	In view of this portrait of the Canadian situation, not to say 
Ontarian, we must ask if we really want more of such hazardous 
waste, especially coming from abroad. An article published in the 
<I>Globe and Mail</I> on October 27, 1994 entitled:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``Canada eyed as world site for nuclear waste, proposal to use 
Canadian Shield called dangerous''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
-shows the fears and apprehensions of environmentalists with 
regard to this issue of permanent disposal. The article says at the 
beginning, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``It may take 20 to 50 years to happen, but Canada has moved 
one step closer to becoming the world's nuclear waste dump site, 
environmental critics charged yesterday''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Environmental groups argue that Canada cannot legally ban the 
import of radioactive waste from the United States and that 
Canadian nuclear authorities might find it beneficial to open their 
future site to foreign waste. One can also read, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``You build a dump here and you can bet the U.S. will be beating 
the bushes to get rid of their stuff''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These are very real concerns of environmentalists that we must 
consider very seriously.
<P>
	More recently, the Prime Minister of Canada gave his support to 
a feasibility study to import into Canada plutonium from Russian 
and American nuclear warheads to burning it as fuel in our 
CANDU reactors. This plutonium considered waste by these 
countries is considered fuel by Canada.
<P>
	That is about one hundred tonnes of plutonium that we would 
burn in the interest of a peace effort, according to the Prime 
Minister. But once this plutonium is burned, it produces highly 
radioactive waste. How many bundles will be added to ours, to the 
4 million bundles expected by the end of 2033? This roundabout 
way for foreigners to dispose of their plutonium waste raises some 
serious questions.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Would it not be better to sell them Candu reactors so as to make 
them autonomous and responsible for their own waste? And why 
should those countries not find their own solutions to this problem?
<P>
	This overview of the status of highly radioactive waste clearly 
shows we must be careful and the apparent danger of linking the 
issue of financial profits to that of the environment in this matter.
<P>
	Spent fuel is and must be considered extremely toxic, with all 
the adverse effects that may occur in case of management 
problems.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5987"> 5987 </A></B>
<P>
	As for low level radioactive waste, Canadian authorities are also 
considering a type of permanent storage. Deep River was chosen 
as the site, as I said earlier. One of the technologies being 
developed involves the use of an underground structure protected 
against intrusion, consisting of a series of concrete vaults where 
waste would be stored for 500 years, after which it would be 
harmless. This project is not going down smoothly in this Ontarian 
locality and serious concerns are being expressed throughout the 
region. Can you imagine the reaction the communities concerned 
would have if, in addition, they were to receive waste made in 
the USA?
<P>
	I look favourably on the bill put forward by the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley East. While Canada may be renowned around the 
world for being accommodating, it should not have to become the 
nuclear waste-basket of the world just to live up to its reputation.
<P>
	Finally, I would suggest that the Prime Minister and his 
ministers and members of Parliament take a good hard look at what 
impact importing plutonium will have in Canada.
<P>
	Members from Ontario, and particularly those in whose riding 
CANDU reactors have already been designated to burn plutonium, 
thereby adding to the radioactive waste problem, should consult 
their voters on this issue.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Dromisky (Thunder Bay-Atikokan, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is my pleasure to speak to Bill C-236, proposed by the 
hon. member for Fraser Valley East. The bill would prevent the 
importation of radioactive waste into Canada.
<P>
	Although at first this bill appears somewhat harmless, in reality 
it is fraught with a number of negative consequences. Those 
consequences are international and domestic in scope. They pertain 
to health and have serious environmental impacts. Presently 
Canada does not import any nuclear fuel waste whatsoever. The 
Government of Canada has no plan to do so.
<P>
	The hon. member from the Reform Party mentioned plutonium. 
There are international agreements and conventions in operation at 
the present time to prevent the transportation of plutonium across 
borders.
<P>
	Plutonium is one of the deadliest materials available at the 
present time. As a result, every nation in the world must be on 
guard and vigilant in the prevention of the transportation of any 
plutonium through the black market which comes from the 
dismantling of nuclear bombs and nuclear warheads in countries 
such as Russia.
<P>
	However, we import radioactive waste produced by medical 
equipment that is used in other countries. To discontinue this 
practice would have serious negative consequences. For example, 
the potential exists for significant impacts on the health of people 
from developing countries that often cannot effectively manage 
radioactive waste disposal like we can.
<P>
	Specifically, developing countries with inadequate waste 
disposal systems may not be able to utilize radiological treatment 
of cancer and early detection analysis of various diseases. This 
would be a very real possibility if we refused these countries access 
to our disposal systems. At present clients from all over the world 
obtain products from Canadian firms that manufacture radio 
isotopes and equipment containing radioactive materials which are 
used to make medical diagnosis and treat disease, particularly for 
cancer and heart patients, sterilize surgical instruments and blood 
for transfusions, prevent diseases such as malaria and increase the 
efficiency of agricultural methods.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	When discussing the benefits of nuclear energy, we often 
concentrate on the production of an economic, environmentally 
sound way of producing electricity. We often forget to highlight the 
other benefits such as those just mentioned in the health area which 
lead to the avoidance of diseases, the elimination of infections and 
the provision of good nutrition and food.
<P>
	There are many examples where the uses of nuclear energy 
considerably improve the health and economic development of 
people worldwide. Let me highlight one. Chile has developed a 
multibillion dollar food export industry. It is also the only country 
in South America that is internationally recognized as being free of 
the Mediterranean fruit fly. Until recently, however, Chilean fresh 
foods were still excluded from certain markets because of the fear 
of outbreaks originating from Med flies in northern Chile.
<P>
	After many unsuccessful attempts with insecticides, finally in 
1990 Chile turned to a biological method using flies sterilized with 
radiation. As a result of this, no wild Med flies have been detected 
since mid-1995. And in December 1995, Chile was formally 
declared a fly free zone by international experts.
<P>
	According to the Chilean minister of agriculture, this will mean 
an annual increase of $500 million in fruit exports over the next 
five years. This is a very good example of the use of the type of 
material and equipment produced and exported by Canadian firms.
<P>
	The countries that utilize medical equipment and material 
exported by Canada expect us to assist them with their waste 
disposal. If they are refused assistance in waste disposal, in turn 
they could readily refuse to buy equipment containing radioactive 
sources and radio isotopes from Canada. Canadian exporters of 
medical and industrial equipment and materials would lose a 
sizeable portion of their clients. A reduction of this nature would 
lead to job losses here at home. Certainly the Reform Party does 
not want job losses.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5988"> 5988 </A></B>
<P>
	With know-how and good marketing practices, Canadian firms 
have managed to be leaders in the industry that provides radio 
isotopes and irradiation equipment around the world. They have 
proven themselves to be a reliable supplier of these products. They 
contribute significantly to Canada's exports and in the process 
provide quality jobs for Canadians in this rapidly growing high 
technology field. Bill C-236 would put the brakes on the growth 
of this industry.
<P>
	I would like to highlight one of the Canadian firms in this field. 
Nordion International Incorporated is a leader worldwide in the 
production of radio isotopes. Nordion contributes worldwide to the 
prevention of diseases and healing patients. Nordion's total 
revenues in fiscal 1995 were $191 million. The company exports to 
over 70 countries and 98 per cent of its sales are from export 
markets. It has over 700 employees and more than 50 per cent hold 
post-secondary degrees or diplomas. Nordion's Canadian facilities 
are located in Montreal, Vancouver and in Kanata, Ontario.
<P>
	This company expects that future growth will see a considerable 
expansion of their products, including the development of new 
radio pharmaceuticals, new sterilization processes, food 
irradiation, sewage sludge treatment and commercialization of 
therapeutic based opportunities. All relevant export sales by 
Nordion involve the return to Canada of the spent radioactive 
sources from the irradiation equipment.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	Bill C-236 would prevent Canadian companies such as Nordion 
from providing essential products to companies that unfortunately 
cannot properly dispose of radioactive waste resulting from the use 
of these products.
<P>
	The reality is that this bill is of no value. Canada has the 
expertise and regulatory system to ensure that radioactive waste is 
treated in a manner such that it would not pose a risk to human 
health or the environment. We are the leaders in the processes. We 
are the leaders in knowledge. We are the leaders in this field. 
Passing this bill would negatively affect the health of people in 
some developing nations. It would harm the environment of these 
countries and lead to job losses in Canada. It is for these reasons I 
cannot support Bill C-236.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I stand today in full support of Bill C-236 put forward by 
my colleague from Fraser Valley East. I have listened to the 
assertions made by members from the government. I honestly 
cannot believe in good conscience that they have actually 
mentioned their claims. Obviously they have not read the bill.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill is to protect Canadians now and in the 
future. Currently we do not have any legislation to protect 
Canadians from waste from other countries being brought to our 
shores for disposal. There are no regulatory measures. That means 
radioactive waste can be imported. That is the purpose of Bill 
C-236. The member has proven to be proactive on this issue. This 
should not be taken lightly and has been put forward with 
justification.
<P>
	The justification has been seen here in the House today and I will 
give some examples. Members from the government strongly 
suggested that we as a caring, considerate society in the face of 
sustainable development ought to be bringing nuclear waste from 
other countries to be deposited on our shores because these 
countries do not have the capabilities of waste disposal. This will 
be done under the guise of sustainable development.
<P>
	Sustainable development is not bringing somebody else's waste 
to Canada's shores. It means dealing with your own waste in your 
own country in your own fashion. It is true that these countries 
probably do not have the technology to deal with waste disposal. 
That is where Canada can make an effective contribution because 
we are leaders in the nuclear industry. This is an opportunity for 
Canada to provide technical assistance to these countries to deal 
with their nuclear waste.
<P>
	We should not be bringing their nuclear waste to Canada. It is not 
our responsibility to do that. We would be abrogating our 
responsibility to the health and welfare of Canadians if we brought 
these highly toxic, carcinogenic and teratogenic, mutagenic 
substances to our soil. Later I will give examples of how serious 
this problem is in the Arctic.
<P>
	Contrary to what government members have been saying, we 
export plutonium from Saskatchewan, which is our second largest 
producer of plutonium, to Japanese power plants. That is a serious 
problem because this plutonium, which can live for tens of 
thousands of years, has to travel across Canada and then across the 
oceans. We rely on other regulatory bodies in order to ensure the 
safety of Canadians but that should not be the case.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	My colleague from Fraser Valley East brought forth this very 
strong and important bill to protect Canadians by ensuring that 
waste is not brought to this country, transported across Canadian 
soil through Canadian towns and cities, creating a potential for the 
public to be exposed to lethal material.
<P>
	We are clearly in favour of sustainable development. We fully 
support Canadians using our technology to help those who are less 
fortunate in other parts of the world, but let us not bring their 
problems to our shores.
<P>
	It is also important to dispel the myths put forth by some Liberal 
members saying that we are against the importation of nuclear 
materials for technology and medicine. I ask the hon. member to 
read the bill. The bill deals with waste, waste, waste. It deals with 
nuclear waste, not nuclear material effectively used in industry and 
in the world of medicine.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5989"> 5989 </A></B>
<P>
	It is important for us to put the bill in perspective and to look 
at the international complexity of it and why the member brought 
it forward. There are over 413 nuclear reactors in the world. Each 
of them produces nuclear waste, much of which is a real problem 
to get rid of. We have our own problems in our own country in 
disposing of our own waste. We do not need to bring in literally 
thousands of tonnes of spent nuclear rods and nuclear materials 
out there looking for a home. That home is not in Canada.
<P>
	We should also look at another issue. I was at a meeting with a 
number of scientists from Russia who said they had to 
decommission over 100 nuclear submarines within the next few 
years. They were referring to the nuclear material within the 
submarines. The response of the Russians has been widespread 
dumping on the Kola Peninsula, widespread dumping in northern 
Russia.
<P>
	This is not a problem happening half a world away that will not 
affect us. This problem very much affects us. One need not look 
any further than at the aboriginal people in the Northwest 
Territories, the Arctic and Yukon. They have much higher rates of 
genetic abnormalities and birth defects as a direct result of the 
outpouring of nuclear material that is being negligently, 
irresponsibly and criminally disposed of over areas of the Kola 
Peninsula in Russia.
<P>
	That is the problem. It is affecting Canadians today. We have to 
be very clear about that. The government ought to pay very close 
attention to the problem. Nobody is speaking for those aboriginal 
people in the north who are suffering from the effects of this 
nuclear material.
<P>
	It is not something that Canada should take on its shoulders 
alone. Clearly it is something in which we can take a leadership 
position in the international community to bring forth all the good 
ideas out there to provide help to the Russian people on how to deal 
with the problem.
<P>
	It is not the only problem. We have seen much about Chernobyl. 
We have heard much of the problems associated with this disaster. 
However the Chernobyl reactor is just one of many other reactors 
that exist in Russia today. There are literally dozens and dozens of 
leaky nuclear reactors in Russia that will produce other Chernobyls 
in the near future.
<P>
	The international community will not have the ability and the 
funds to deal with the problem when it actually becomes a 
horrendous situation along the lines of Chernobyl. It is extremely 
important for us as a country to work with other countries to 
address the problem in a proactive fashion now, before the reactors 
leak in a widespread fashion, the outcome of which will affect 
Canadians. It is that simple.
<P>
	The leakage of nuclear materials half a world away indeed 
affects us. Members from the government said that we do not need 
to worry about nuclear material  being brought into Canada because 
nothing has happened of the sort. The fact remains that 
international organizations have found that Canada is an ideal place 
to dump nuclear waste. In Ontario alone 1,300 spots have been 
identified in the Canadian Shield.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	The theory is that we dig a hole half a kilometre into the 
Canadian Shield and dump the nuclear waste into it. Earthquakes 
and seepage into the groundwater have not been taken into 
consideration. There is also the consequences of the nuclear 
material, some of which has a life in the tens of thousands of years. 
It kills. It is carcinogenic. It is mutagenic and teratogenic. It causes 
terrible defects in children. This is not pie in the sky; this is 
happening now.
<P>
	People are closely looking at Canada, particularly the Canadian 
Shield, as an ideal place for the disposal of waste from other 
countries.
<P>
	In closing, I fully support Bill C-236 in the name of the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley East. I encourage all members of the 
House to support it for the sake of the health and welfare of all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Geoff Regan (Halifax West, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise today to speak on Bill C-236 which has a significant 
international component. Canada has an important role to play in 
strengthening international co-operation in radioactive waste 
safety. This assistance would diminish if the bill passes.
<P>
	Radioactive waste from peaceful uses of nuclear energy has 
many uses from medical treatments to the production of electric 
power. It must be properly managed at national and international 
levels by all countries.
<P>
	It seems the whole issue is an example of how we have become a 
global village. Environmental issues like pollution and radioactive 
fallout as we saw in the case of Chernobyl have no boundaries. The 
issues of air pollution do not know boundaries. We cannot put up 
walls and prevent that kind of pollution from crossing over into our 
country.
<P>
	Therefore we have to take an interest in it and look at it not 
simply on a domestic basis. We must look beyond our borders and 
realize that we are responsible citizens of that global village who 
have to consider this issue in that light.
<P>
	Canada happens to be the world's leading supplier of radio 
isotopes for cancer treatment. Radio isotopes also have other uses 
such as industrial ones. They are used in checking for leaks in 
sewage and other kinds of pipes. They are also used for sterilising 
food. Perhaps members have heard of irradiated food.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="5990"> 5990 </A></B>
<P>
	We must assume our responsibility for the proper disposal of 
the isotopes we are exporting from this country. How can we do 
that if we do not allow them back into our country?
<P>
	The last member suggested that we were taking the wrong 
approach. However, I recall the member for Esquimalt-Juan de 
Fuca saying less than an hour ago that we should not be leaving 
decisions regarding technology to bureaucrats in the health 
department. The bill would leave discretion about what waste 
means and what kinds of waste would be allowed into the country 
and what could not to the Atomic Energy Control Board of Canada. 
It is strange on the one hand the member does not want to leave 
things to the bureaucrats and on the other hand he really does. This 
seems to be a contradiction.
<P>
	Canada has taken a leading role in disposal technology for this 
kind of waste. From the long term perspective it is better to know 
where waste from products created in Canada and exported goes. 
We have an interest in it. Wherever it ends up in the world it can 
come back to haunt us later.
<P>
	The management of radioactive waste is now regulated in most 
countries. Canada's approach to safety generally exceeds 
international recommendations. By the way, it is important to note 
that Canada has no plans to import or export nuclear fuel waste. 
From our point of view we are not talking about that. If the bill had 
been clearer about what it intends we might not have that problem, 
but it is not. It simply talks about radioactive waste and does not 
clarify whether we are talking about nuclear fuel waste, radio 
isotopes or other kinds of such products.
<P>
	Nevertheless, some less developed countries are worried that 
industrialized countries will be tempted to dump or get rid of their 
unwanted waste within the developing world. I can understand why 
they would be concerned about that possibility. They have banned 
the import of radioactive waste. However, most developed 
countries do not have such a ban. On the contrary, they see this 
practice as one in which they have considerable expertise, thereby 
helping to eliminate undue risks to health and the environment by 
properly disposing of these products. They also consider this 
practice to be compatible with sustainable development activities.
<P>
<B>(1825)</B>
<P>
	The mid-1970s saw an increase in worldwide concern about the 
transboundary movement of waste in general. At that time the 
major concern was that nuclear waste and radioactive waste could 
be exported from industrialized countries where there was an 
absence of legal, administrative, regulatory, financial or technical 
capabilities. In fact, the waste could have been sent to less 
developed countries, causing great problems.
<P>
	OECD member countries have also been concerned with the 
control of transboundary movements of  hazardous waste since the 
beginning of the 1980s. This eventually led to the preparation of 
the convention on the control of transboundary movements of 
hazardous wastes and their disposal. This important international 
convention was adopted in Basel, Switzerland on March 22, 1989, 
under the auspices of the United Nations environment program and 
entered into force on May 5, 1992. Canada is a party to that 
convention.
<P>
	Under the general obligation of the convention each party will 
prevent the import of hazardous waste if it has reason to believe 
that the waste in question will not be managed in an 
environmentally sound manner. The convention also indicates that 
the exportation of waste is allowed if the state of export does not 
have suitable facilities to deal properly with the waste in question 
and also if the waste is required as raw material for recycling or 
recovering industries in the state of import.
<P>
	Developing countries have also established their own 
conventions, having recognized that they are particularly 
vulnerable in not having adequate radioactive waste management 
facilities. For instance, the Bamako convention on the ban of the 
import of hazardous wastes into Africa and the import or 
transboundary movement of hazardous wastes within Africa was 
adopted in Bamako, Mali, on January 30, 1991. Although the 
convention bans the import of wastes by African states, it permits 
the export of such wastes when a state does not have adequate 
disposal facilities.
<P>
	Generally, it is recognized by states that the practice of 
importing or exporting waste is not in itself detrimental, but that 
conditions must be attached to this practice.
<P>
	The first condition involves the proper notification of all 
countries involved, followed by their acceptance. Governments 
must respect the right of other governments to decide whether they 
wish to provide disposal sites for radioactive waste originating 
from other countries.
<P>
	Second, there must be proper management of the waste by all 
countries involved. Any country considering exporting its waste 
would have to assure itself that the levels of protection for workers, 
the public and the environment in the importing country are, at the 
least, equivalent to those observed within its own borders.
<P>
	Over the years general principles have evolved internationally 
with regard to importing and exporting hazardous or radioactive 
wastes. These principles include, if feasible, that waste should be 
managed within the generating country. There can be sound 
environmental or socioeconomic reasons for exporting or 
importing waste for a variety of objectives, such as treatment, 
temporary storage, recycling or final disposal. Controlling the 
import or export of wastes, in the form of providing notification, 
granting licences and compliance with regulations is necessary.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="5991"> 5991 </A></B>
<P>
	Any state may exercise its sovereign right to permit or ban any 
imports or exports of waste within its borders. Every state wanting 
to participate in the international transboundary movement of 
waste should have a regulatory authority and should adopt 
appropriate procedures, as necessary, for the regulation of such 
movement. No state should permit the receipt of waste unless it 
has the administrative and technical capacity and regulatory 
structure to manage and dispose of such waste in a manner 
consistent with international safety standards.
<P>
<B>(1830 )</B>
<P>
	Last, the ultimate aim remains to minimize the production of any 
waste, as it should be, taking into account social, environmental, 
technological and economic concerns and considerations.
<P>
	With specific reference to the safety of radioactive waste 
management, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, 
is recognized as the premier international body to provide expert 
advice. Canada continues to actively support the IAEA efforts in 
this area. The following IAEA activities are particularly relevant to 
the import of waste.
<P>
	In 1990 the IAEA established a code of practice for 
transboundary movement of radioactive waste. The IAEA has 
developed regulations for the safe transport of radioactive 
materials which are binding on member states. Experience has 
shown that these regulations are effective in ensuring safe transport 
of such materials. Member states are currently developing an 
international convention on the safety of radioactive waste 
management. The IAEA has produced a technical document on the 
nature and magnitude of problematic spent radiation sources.
<P>
	In September the IAEA adopted a resolution which indicated 
that under certain circumstances safe management of radioactive 
waste might be fostered through voluntary agreements among 
member states to use the disposal facilities for low level 
radioactive waste available in one state for the benefit of the other 
states.
<P>
	For over 20 years, nations around the world have been working 
diligently to find a sustainable way to deal with the transboundary 
movement of chemical and radioactive waste. While we must 
continue to be vigilant, the progress that has been made and that 
continues to be made at the international level provides increased 
confidence that the practice of importing and exporting radioactive 
waste can be conducted within the context of sustainable 
development not only on a regional scale but truly within the global 
village.
<P>
	We have shown that some countries do need to export the 
radioactive waste that results from activities essential for 
sustainable development. We must ensure that such countries 
export their waste to countries that have the expertise needed to 
effectively handle the radioactive  waste. Canada can be such a 
country and should not turn its back on countries in need.
<P>
	I urge members of this House not to support this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of Bill C-236 put forward by the member for Fraser 
Valley East. The purpose of this bill is to prevent the importation of 
radioactive waste.
<P>
	Worldwide there are 413 commercial nuclear reactors, an untold 
number of small research reactors at universities and other reactors 
on ships or submarines. Together they have generated and will 
continue to generate enormous amounts of highly toxic nuclear 
waste, waste that will be deadly for 10,000 years.
<P>
	Canadians in general do not want radioactive waste in their 
backyard. It took eight years and $20 million for the siting task 
force struck by the Minister of National Resources to find a place 
for our low level radioactive waste. Note this does not cover high 
level radioactive waste. The town of Deep River finally said yes in 
September a year ago, but only two communities in Ontario even 
volunteered to consider the question.
<P>
	It should be self-evident to most that the import of radioactive 
waste should be banned. As I will explain, there are some 
compelling reasons why a law should be passed to firmly establish 
this principle.
<P>
	In doing so it should be clear that this bill would not ban the 
importation-I hope members are listening across the way-of 
plutonium from U.S. and Russian warheads to be burned as fuel in 
CANDU reactors. This idea is only one of nine separate proposals 
the Americans are considering as an option.
<P>
	In essence the plan calls for the CANDU fuel bundles to be 
fabricated in the U.S. and brought into Canada as fuel, not as waste. 
It would be a great contribution to global disarmament but 
Canadians would be expected to subsidize the conversion process. 
In that regard I am opposed to the idea that the Government of 
Canada should do any subsidization of a process such as this.
<P>
<B>(1835)</B>
<P>
	If the process were to be done, I understand it would be on a 
commercial basis most likely with help from Atomic Energy of 
Canada Limited. As a crown corporation close to the federal 
government, AECL's role might consist of paying and in effect 
subsidizing the retool of facilities such as the old Bruce reactor 
which might then burn the plutonium.
<P>
	Clearly any support should be contingent on the Government of 
Canada controlling the regulatory side but staying out of the 
financial side. Pointedly, we Canadians should not be paying to 
beat American and Russian swords into ploughshares. If we want to 
use our tools to act as the blacksmith for the military powers of the 
world, we should not have to pay for the raw materials.

	This proposal is not without an environmental cost to Canada. 
The Department of Natural Resources tells us that the United 
States is looking to get rid of 50 tonnes of plutonium over a 
25-year period. We are also looking at the same amount from 
Russia, 50 tonnes over 25 years. In total, 100 tonnes is how much 
plutonium will be generated from the dismantling of a total of 
40,000 nuclear warheads.
<P>
	By way of comparison, at the moment we already have 22,000 
tonnes of high level waste in Canada stored on sites of over 22 
nuclear reactors. This includes 78 tonnes of plutonium. By the year 
2025, we will have 58,000 tonnes which will include 200-odd 
tonnes of plutonium.
<P>
	The price Canada would have to pay is increasing radioactive 
waste in our country by a third. The government's decision will 
have to strike a balance between the environmental security of 
Canadian citizens and the probability of plutonium in nuclear 
warheads being used for more harmful purposes. Once Canadians 
learn about this plutonium deal, they may want to think twice about 
it. However Bill C-236 does not specifically address that issue.
<P>
	To get back to the purpose of my colleague's bill, why do we 
need a law regarding the importation of fissionable waste 
materials? Because of the profit in the business of burying high 
level radioactive waste. That is the reason.
<P>
	There are profit oriented groups which might want to import 
waste for money. The United States alone has an enormous high 
level waste problem. Because of that, there is an enormous profit 
potential in it.
<P>
	The U.S. Hanford site located 300 kilometres south of the B.C. 
border has enough waste to fill 86 football fields one metre deep. It 
will cost $57 billion to dispose of that. It is estimated that the 
clean-up cost in the United States alone will total a staggering $230 
billion.
<P>
	The problem continues to grow. The U.S. has a total of 77,000 
tonnes of waste to bury. Someone is going to look to this for a 
profit. Let us take an example. The Meadow Lake Tribal Council, 
which represents nine Indian communities in northern 
Saskatchewan, reported on February 25, 1995 that it was 
considering the offer of land for a price. That underlines the 
problem.
<P>
	I will try to draw this to a close although I do have much more to 
say about it. Even the Nisga'a law which is under consideration in 
British Columbia can have an effect on this.
<P>
	In conclusion, Bill C-236 provides a golden opportunity for 
Canada to send a discouraging message to the United States and to 
profit seeking groups within Canada who might view the absence 
of legislation as a way to capitalize on the import of nuclear waste. 
It is an opportunity for the government to respect the wishes of a 
majority of Canadians who are opposed to the importation of 
hazardous radioactive waste.
