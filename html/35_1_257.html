	<B>Ms. Jean Augustine (Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to recognize Wednesday, November 8, 1995 as 
Take Our Kids to Work Day.
<P>
	Today over 153,000 Ontario students will accompany a friend, 
parent or volunteer sponsor to their workplace in an effort to learn 
about the demands and opportunities of the working world. The 
program is an initiative of The Learning Partnership which 
provides students with an interactive hands on work experience in a 
field of interest to them while emphasizing community 
responsibility for the future of our young people.
<P>
	I would like to welcome Anne McGuire, a grade nine student 
from Bishop Allen Academy in my riding of 
Etobicoke-Lakeshore. Anne is spending the day here in my office 
on Parliament Hill to further her interest in politics. Perhaps at 
some time in the future she will join us here as a colleague in the 
House of Commons.

	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the week 
of November 4 to 12 has been set aside to honour those Canadians 
who fought and those who died in two world wars, in Korea and in 
peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	When veterans returned home from Europe 50 years ago they 
were filled with hope, pride and optimism. They were ready to 
build a strong Canada. How disappointed these veterans must be 
today. The country they were willing to give their lives for is $567 
billion in debt and is in danger of breaking apart.
<P>
	If action is not taken immediately to solve the debt crisis, to 
build a new Canada within a new federalism, to reform health care,

	<B>Mr. Gilles Bernier (Beauce, Ind.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if our political 
leaders in Canada have not grasped the very clear message sent by 
Quebecers on October 30, they will have to live with the 
consequences. Quebec wishes to regain its proper place within the 
Canadian context. Rather than being purely symbolic, the proposed 
changes should respond to the legitimate and traditional demands 
of Quebec.
<P>
	People of Canada, the steps that are taken must be in harmony 
with what has been said in recent weeks. Let us put an end to 
double talk. Federalism as we know it must be reshaped; moreover, 
Quebec is not the only one calling for federal withdrawal from 
areas of provincial jurisdiction. More than ever, we must 
demonstrate a desire to make the changes necessary for national 
unity, while respecting our differences.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, whereas 
many people, strangely enough, joined together prior to October 30 
to promise Quebec constitutional changes that would satisfy it, all 
attempts to fulfill these promises have failed one after the other, in 
the days following the referendum. In desperation, the government 
yesterday announced the creation of a mysterious committee, but 
nobody yesterday knew its make-up, its mandate or its time frame.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
Was the hasty set up of a committee to study the question of 
constitutional and administrative changes to the federation not the 
result of the government's inability to find a way out of the dead 
end it found itself in because of the commitments made by the 
Prime Minister and the fierce opposition by the provinces, certain 
ministers and certain members?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the promises the Prime Minister made regarding changes 
in connection with the distinct society, in particular, are promises 
the Prime Minister will keep.
<P>
	Obviously, the Bloc Quebecois has no interest in these promises 
being kept, since their aim is to destroy the country. However, if we 
look objectively at events in recent years, we will see there have 
been significant changes in the federal government. We also know 
that the Leader of the Opposition has said he is not interested in 
discussing change of any sort until after a yes vote in the 
referendum.
<P>
	Therefore, the opponents of change benefitting Quebecers are 
the Bloc Quebecois and the Parti Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we do not 
need to look too far back in the course of events to discover that 
those who oppose the Prime Minister's  commitments are those 
sitting on that side-in the caucus and in cabinet-and the 
provincial premiers.
<P>
	Should I also remind the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
that the job of the Bloc Quebecois at the moment is to ensure that 
Quebec is not cheated again, as it has so often been in the past?
<P>
	The Deputy Prime Minister said yesterday that the federal 
government could move without necessarily seeking provincial 
approval, because, in any case, Quebec could block any initiative. 
Are we to understand from her remarks that the federal government 
has once again decided to work secretly to come up with a proposal 
it will then try to impose on Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the allegations by the member for Roberval are clearly in 
error.
<P>
	With regard to the distinct society, it was the leader of the Parti 
Quebecois himself who said: ``Stop bothering me with this idea of 
a distinct society''. This is a matter of public record and contradicts 
what the member for Roberval has just said. So, he is the one 
opposed to a distinct society and not our Prime Minister.
<P>
	Furthermore, in talking about negotiating the best for Quebec, 
let me read you, Mr. Speaker, what Lucien Bouchard himself 
said-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My dear minister, I would ask you to give this 
man's title.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Massé:</B> Mr. Speaker, on the subject of negotiations, the 
Leader of the Opposition said the day they would be at a table 
would be the day after Quebec had voted yes in a referendum, 
which he hoped would be held in the very near future. This reveals 
very clearly that the Leader of the Opposition does not agree with 
73 per cent of Quebecers, who indicated they wanted negotiations 
on Canada's future.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, are the 
accusations by the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and the 
government's phoney committee whose establishment was 
announced yesterday not simply delaying tactics aimed at keeping 
a lid on the profound division not only in the Liberal caucus, but in 
cabinet, where a number of members are still under the influence of 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and

leader of the Bloc Quebecois.

<P>
	Furthermore, in the committee that was struck, we are going 
to try to find a solution to the problems the country is facing, one 
that will help Canadians, including Quebecers. And the Bloc 
Quebecois is opposing our efforts at finding a solution to the 
present problems and is opposing the resolution of difficulties in 
jurisdictional matters, despite the fact that the majority of 
Quebecers indicated in a democratic decision that they did not 
want to leave Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental 
Affairs. All observers are still wondering what kind of logic 
prompted the federal government to think it might be helpful to set 
up a committee of ministers in charge of reviewing the possibility 
of making constitutional and administrative changes to the 
Canadian federation. Many people have questions, but few 
ministers can answer them.
<P>
	How can we believe that this phoney committee can propose 
acceptable changes to Quebecers, when the real decision makers, 
that is, the provincial premiers, are not even on it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, those who want to find a real solution to the problems met 
to set up a working group whose mandate is to look at possible 
changes.
<P>
	It is clear that the official opposition-whose goal, as its leader 
indicated, is to break up the country-has no interest whatsoever in 
co-operating or in finding something positive to say about the 
working group we have set up. Yet, this working group is clearly 
needed to make a list of the changes required to reconcile all 
Canadians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, on Radio-Canada's <I>Téléjournal</I>, the Deputy 
Prime Minister made this short statement: ``We are now trying to 
make it possible to fulfil the promises made by the Prime 
Minister''. Let us be frank.
<P>
	Is the creation of this phoney committee not simply a federal 
trick to allow the Prime Minister to save face, since he is unable to 
deliver the goods and to meet his commitments?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, during the campaign, the Prime Minister made promises

went to sleep on the national unity issue, failing to provide a strong 
federalist vision of strategy to counter the separatist dreams and

on October 30 and the Prime Minister belatedly decided to act on 
the demand for change inside and outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	Now, a week later, we find the government going back to sleep. 
Instead of offering leadership it falls back on a tired, old precedent 
of appointing a top down, closed door committee to come up with 
some post-referendum strategy.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. 
What on earth happened to the sense of urgency that the Prime 
Minister expressed on October 30? By what date will this cabinet

<P>

Speaker, it is curious to hear the Reform Party complain about the 
unity task force.
<P>
	Who wrote the 20 points in the Reform constitutional plan? Was 
it the committee or was it a submission by one of the Reform

<P>

Speaker, the constitutional proposals in Reform's new 
confederation package have been under discussion with the 
Canadian public for five years. It came from the bottom up, not the 
bottom down.
<P>
	The fact remains that the only government response to the 
Quebec referendum thus far has been to start down the same rocky 
road that led to the failures of the Meech Lake and Charlottetown 
accords by establishing a top down, closed door committee of 
cabinet to develop unity proposals without the involvement of 
Canadian people. This is the process that doomed Meech, doomed 
Charlottetown and will doom this post-referendum strategy unless 
the public is involved.

Canadian people, the ones who pulled the no vote out of the fire, 
into the development of its post-referendum strategy?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council

third party should remember that the Charlottetown accord passed 
in his riding. If he were expressing the will of the people he 
represents he would be in favour of these negotiations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Chamber and the National Press Gallery have become 
dangerously complacent about the failure of government ministers, 
including this minister, to give direct answers to straight questions. 
Maybe he can do that on a thousand different subjects and it is 
considered clever in the Chamber although it is not considered 
clever outside. If the government fails to directly answer straight 
questions on the issue of the unity of the country, it is playing with 
the life of the country and it will earn the just contempt of every 
Canadian who cares about the unity of the country.
<P>
	I will ask my question of the minister once again and I will go 
slowly. What specifically does the government intend to do to 
bring the Canadian people into the discussion of its national unity 
proposal?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and

Speaker, if we ask straight questions we get straight answers. If we 
ask contorted questions unfortunately we get contorted answers.
<P>
	In this case if the question is what is the mandate of the 
committee, the mandate of the committee is very clear. The 
promises the Prime Minister mentioned during the campaign will 
be kept. At present we are looking at various ways in which 
governments could be made more effective. This is part of the 
changes we have carried through with the government in the last 
two years and this will continue.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. On the 
government's phoney committee, we have the Minister of Justice, 
who, last week, was looking for legal means to prevent Quebecers 
from voting again on their future, the minister of fisheries, who 
urged thousands of Canadians to act in violation of the Quebec 
referendum act, the minister of Indian affairs, who raised the 
possibility of dividing Quebec's territory, and the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, who will not recognize that Quebecers are a 
people.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	Under these circumstances, how can this committee come up 
with anything that would be acceptable to Quebecers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, when official opposition members refer to a phoney 
committee, it is clear that they are choosing words that have no 
connection with reality, just to discredit a tool used by the 
government to try to improve the situation.
<P>
	Again, this comes as no surprise to me, since the self-appointed 
role of the official opposition is to destroy this country, which 
strips it of any credibility when it comes to looking after the 
interests of Quebecers. We are the ones looking after the interests 
of Quebecers by respecting the wish of the majority, which is to 
find, within Canada, ways of making the federation work better.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> This is the whole 
point, Mr. Speaker. Will the minister admit that, in this committee, 
the interests of Quebecers will be looked after only by ministers 
who said repeatedly over the past two years that Quebecers did not 
want to hear about the Constitution?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, again, I think it is pointless to keep answering questions 
from the opposition, whose sole goal is to promote the destruction 
of this country, and not to help Quebecers.
<P>
	We, on the other hand, have established a commission which has 
been mandated, in accordance with the wish clearly and 
democratically expressed by Quebecers in the referendum, to find 
solutions within the Canadian federation.

security at 24 Sussex over the weekend. With every passing day the 
revelations get more bizarre and Canadians are rightly concerned

did these officers receive and who was responsible for putting these 
people in the position of gatekeepers at 24 Sussex?
<P>

the circumstances of the incident and what steps should be taken to 
make sure it is never repeated is under way.

available to me by the end of the week. In light of that I will have a 
lot more to say about this incident which is certainly something 
that should never have happened and something I never want to see 
happen again.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the 
same night this tragedy happened, in Israel the security force 
resigned; its members have either been thrown out or they have 
resigned.
<P>
	Why can that not happen here when our Prime Minister's life 
was in great danger that night? Why was the intruder not spotted? 
Why did it take seven minutes for the RCMP to respond? Why did 
the RCMP secure the perimeter of the place without securing the 
Prime Minister?
<P>
	More amazingly, none of the three senior officers who are on 
emergency standby duty 24 hours a day with cell telephones 
answered when Mrs. Chrétien made the emergency call. They were 
not available. They did not answer their phones even though they 
were on 24-hour standby emergency duty.
<P>
	Will these senior officers be held accountable? Can the solicitor 
general assure the House, without the report having even been 
tabled, that junior officers will not take the fall for their superiors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the important thing is to determine in a factual way all the 
circumstances and then to put steps in place to make sure the

<P>
	Yesterday, when asked about the mandate of the cabinet 
committee, the minister could only say that the committee was 
going to look at all the possibilities for constitutional and 
administrative changes in the Canadian federation.
<P>
	I put my question to the minister in the hope that he will provide 
an answer. Can the minister tell us if the proposed resolution to 
recognize Quebec's distinct  character, as well as the bill on 
regional referendums, are among the options which his committee 
will look at?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council 
for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, once again, the commitments made by the Prime Minister 
during the campaign concerning a distinct society clause and a 
constitutional veto for Quebec will be fulfilled. Our committee will 
also look at non constitutional measures, so as to not overlook any 
means to make our federation more effective.
<P>
	This is what we will do in the coming months. We should not 
pre-judge the results. We, at least, are working in the best interests 
of Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilbert Fillion (Chicoutimi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, will the 
minister admit that, if the government gave such a wide and vague 
mandate to its committee, it is because it wants to keep all the 
doors open? The government obviously does not know how to 
fulfill the commitments made to Quebecers by the Prime Minister 
during the referendum campaign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy Council

Minister during the campaign will be fulfilled and we will review, 
with dedication, the changes that could be made to improve the 
way Canada works.
<P>

<P>
	Was the minister's helicopter press conference today a feeble

According to this report, we are apparently not yet protected from 
another contamination like the one experienced in the early 1980s.

another tragedy such as was experienced in the early 1980s remains 
possible?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
that is exactly why the Government of Canada struck the Krever 
commission to study the 1980s tragedy and to try to ensure it does 
not recur.
<P>
	Mr. Justice Krever has commissioned all sorts of studies to help 
him decide what ought to be done. We continue to await his report

begun to inspect blood donor centres on an annual basis. We also 
have a system for making inspection findings public.

that no funds have been advanced to that organization since 1991.

suggest it let the police do their work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Duncan (North Island-Powell River, Ref.):</B> Mr.

cash flow constantly throughout the years, despite the cutting off of 
federal funds. There are still moneys coming in from the previous 
loans portfolio and they are being mismanaged, poorly managed.
<P>
	I ask the minister again if he will not cease and desist with this 
president running this organization to the detriment of the Métis 
aboriginal people they are meant to benefit.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with respect to the efficiency of the administration and the 
appropriateness of the conduct of the organization, the member is 
right that we have concerns about it. That is why I indicated to 
interviewers that we would be investigating it.
<P>
	Not only has there been no additional federal money given to the 
organization, not only has the agreement with the organization 
terminated, but we are continuing to work with them to correct the 
administrative conduct if necessary. If necessary we will take 
whatever action is required to recover funds that were previously 
given to the organization.

ahead and buys 15 search and rescue helicopters, the same number 
the Conservatives planned to buy, without any guarantees they will 
be less expensive.
<P>
	Since the minister refuses to say anything about purchasing 
combat helicopters, does this mean that, to make its policies more 
palatable to the taxpayers, the government is making these 
announcements piecemeal and plans to invest in a program as 
ambitious as the EH-101 deal?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

called for in the white paper that resulted from the special joint 
committee's deliberations. The hon. member's party took part in 
that.
<P>
	We announced the contract for the APCs some weeks ago, and 
now we have made the announcement of a competition for the 
replacement of the Labrador search and rescue helicopters, which 
are over 30 years of age and nearing the end of their life. This will 
be an open competition. We hope to examine new ways of 
financing that particular purchase, perhaps by leasing. The bottom 
line will be to save the taxpayers money.

<P>
	When we realize that the aerospace industry is mainly based in

the fact that, in the case of the 15  helicopters, there is no Canadian 
content requirement and that two months ago, the same minister 
<P>

	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

things called for in the white paper was to move to off the shelf 
procurements, and that means to get the best deal for Canadian 
taxpayers.
<P>

<P>
	Unlike the hon. members opposite, I happen to know that 
Canadian industry is very competitive, especially in the areas of 
integrated systems and electronics. Many of those industries are in 
Quebec. I am sure many of those industries will have a chance to 
show to bidders that they are competitive and can be part of this 
particular contract.
<P>
	With respect to the question of the absolute price, we cannot talk 
about an absolute price if we are to have a competition in which 
price is to be one of the principal determinants. However, I will 
guarantee that on the search and rescue helicopters it will be much 
cheaper than the price that was to be paid for the EH-101 for the 
same job. We have reviewed the specifications and have found out 
that what the previous government ordered was really too rich for 
even the application of search and rescue standards in the country.

under way and I hope that Lieutenant-General Baril, the 
commander of the army, will submit his report in the near future.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
minister stubbornly refuses to suspend the promotions given to the 
soldiers involved in the dinners honouring Marc Lépine and shows 
little sensitivity in this matter, I will put my question to the Deputy 
Prime Minister.
<P>
	How can the government tolerate the fact that soldiers who took 
part in celebrations in honour of someone who killed 14 young 
women were promoted by the Canadian Forces and that these 
promotions were not suspended, even after these events were 
brought to the defence minister's attention?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I find it 
offensive that people would make judgment on people and convict 
them without the evidence. Let us wait for General Baril's report 
before we make any judgment.

	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday a federal court judge struck down a 
section of the Immigration Act that was used to keep members of 
terrorist groups and criminal organizations out of the country. In 
the court's questionable wisdom, the judge felt that to deny entry to 
members of terrorist organizations is a violation of their charter of 
rights and freedoms guarantee to freedom of association.
<P>
	I ask the minister of immigration to confirm that it is the 
intention of the government to appeal this decision and to advise 
the House on what steps it plans on taking in the meantime to keep 
members of criminal organizations and terrorist groups out of the 
country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her 
question.
<P>
	First, it would be advisable to understand this is one section in 
the Immigration Act, which has probably been used twice in the 
last 10 years.
<P>
	Second, the judgment just came down yesterday. It is some 70 
pages. Our officials and officials from the justice department and 
the solicitor general's department are considering an appeal.
<P>
	Third, it would be unfair to give the impression to Canadians that 
because there may be a question on section 39 of the act the 
department and the act are powerless with respect to those who 
come to this country and are deemed to be undesirable. The power 
of certificates in section 40 is still there. The power to detain is still 
there. The power to deport and move to inquiry is still there. The 
powers obtained under Bill C-44 that allow inquiries to stop 
refugee claims if there is a threat to Canada are still there.
<P>
	We are discussing one tool in a toolbox that gives plenty of 
options to the Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, what we are talking about is a court of Canada 
saying it is okay for criminals and terrorists to enter our country.
<P>
	Canadians want to know if the government is prepared to use the 
notwithstanding clause in the charter of rights and freedoms to 
keep terrorists and criminals out of the country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member should stop 
fearmongering and begin to deal with decisions in a calm, fair, and 
rational manner. I realize that is a bit much to ask of the Reform 
Party.
<P>
	The federal court said no such thing. The federal court made a 
decision based on section 39 with respect to simple association 
with various memberships of organizations. It did not say it was 
okay for terrorists or others to come into the country.
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	We are saying that this is one section of the Immigration Act. We 
may indeed appeal this decision. It was only handed down 
yesterday. Let us reflect on what the court took months to 
deliberate on and let us do the right thing rather than jump into 
scare mongering that does no one any good anywhere.

	<B>Mrs. Dianne Brushett (Cumberland-Colchester, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as we approach the end of the calendar year many 
Canadians focus their attention on the dreaded task of filing their 
income tax returns. The Department of National Revenue sends out 
millions of tax packages to individual Canadians each year.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16369"> 16369 </A></B>
<P>
	Given the budget restraints this year, could the Minister of 
National Revenue tell the House what his department has done 
to streamline the tax filing operation and to save money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her continuing interest in 
government deficiency and saving taxpayers' money. We 
appreciate it very much.
<P>
	The department introduced a number of changes to the 1995 
income tax packages for individuals. This will save approximately 
$3 million annually. It translates into an environmental saving of 
some 320 million pages or, if we want to look at it somewhat 
differently, 13,600 trees.
<P>
	This is part of a continuing process in the department on which 
we have embarked over the last few years and which will with the 
$3 million save a total $9 million. It has been done through cost 
efficiencies and savings rather than any cut in service. It is 
eliminating duplication of information. It is simplifying the tax 
filing of individuals and, as I mentioned, it is substantially helping 
the environment.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Foreign Affairs and follows up on the question of the 
member for Davenport.
<P>
	Every party in the House except the Bloc Quebecois has 
condemned French nuclear tests in the South Pacific. Does the 
parliamentary secretary not recognize that French nuclear tests in 
the South Pacific clearly violate the undertaking that France gave at 
the special conference in May of this year?
<P>
	Will the parliamentary secretary make it very clear to the House 
that Canada accepts the undertaking made by France was violated, 
and will Canada do the right thing and restore its co-sponsorship of 
this important resolution?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jesse Flis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the international community 
and the hon. member should know Canada's position on extending 
indefinitely the ban on nuclear testing. He heard the explanation of 
why Canada is supporting the resolution while withdrawing its 
co-sponsorship.
<P>
	Canada felt the wording was not strong enough. Canada 
registered its objections at the time when France was intending to 
set off another nuclear test. That is well known. The hon. member 
is trying to score political points over nothing.

members of the House.
<P>
	The member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and the member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke belong to the class of 1965. They 
were first elected to this place in a general election held on this day 
30 years ago. I should like to salute them in the name of the

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Some members want to make interventions and I 
recognize the hon. House leader of the government.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House of 
Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I am pleased to associate myself as do all members of the House 
with your words of congratulation.
<P>
	I believe it is time that I personally stopped thinking of the hon. 
members for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke as those two new guys around 
here. Not many members have had the privilege of serving 30 
consecutive years in the House. I am happy to note that the active 
membership in this special club has just tripled. I assure new 
members and the House that I could not have chosen any better 
company.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce came 
here as a passionately committed champion of the less fortunate 
and the dispossessed, a relentless crusader for justice and equity, 
and a forceful advocate of international understanding. He has 
served in many capacities, including as a minister of the crown. He 
has taken on every challenge with energy and persistence.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16370"> 16370 </A></B>
<P>
	If there are some newer members who marvel at his vigour, they 
should take note that there are even hockey players only one third 
his age who have trouble skating with him for an entire game.
<P>
	The hon. member for Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke has 
distinguished himself as a real tribune of his people. An educator 
by profession, he has continually demonstrated the effectiveness of 
speaking sometimes in soft tones but always in very plain 
language.
<P>
	He too has served in many capacities, earning a well justified 
reputation in matters concerning defence and public 
administration. When he speaks we all recognize that he is 
accurately reflecting what his people are saying. He has often 
proven the value of persistence and honest hard work.
<P>
	A decade ago he had a close electoral call, being returned by 
only 38 votes. This earned him the nickname of Landslide Len. He 
rolled up his sleeves and in the next election proved his nickname 
well earned. He won the next time by more than 10,000 votes.
<P>
	To conclude, anyone who has been to the district of 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce in Montreal or who has visited the upper 
Ottawa valley can soon learn how it came about that these areas 
have returned the same members in nine consecutive elections. In 
both cases one finds that almost everyone knows their member of 
Parliament, and even if not a partisan supporter everyone can tell 
about the personal service that each of these members has 
provided. Of course these members probably do so as Liberals, as 
members of our Liberal caucus.
<P>
	These are two honourable and decent people who have served 
Canada well for 30 years. May they both serve for many more.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, allow me 
to join my hon. colleague to convey, on behalf of my caucus, our 
heartfelt congratulations to our two colleagues, the hon. members 
for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce and Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
on 30 years of parliamentary activity. That is unusual and, party 
politics aside, we all have to respect such tenacity and commitment 
to serving one's fellow citizens.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	All too often, the members of this House have to sacrifice their 
health or families to uphold democracy, which makes those being 
honoured today all the more deserving. I would therefore ask them, 
on behalf of the members of the Bloc Quebecois, to accept our 
sincerest congratulations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I too 
should like to pay tribute to these two long serving members. I 
think after having won two elections I am a veteran at this but in 
fact I am just a kid. The hon.  member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke and the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce have had incredible careers here.
<P>
	With respect to the hon. member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, in the 30 years he has served 
there has often been a cold and cynical environment in this place, 
sad to say, but he has contributed immeasurably to making 
members of the House remember that their purpose in Ottawa is to 
serve those who elected them back home. There are no votes to 
gain in the Chamber.
<P>
	While in government he served as acting speaker of the House 
and parliamentary secretary to the ministers of national defence 
and energy, mines and resources. In opposition he served as official 
opposition critic for national defence, financial management and 
regional development. Yet, when asked about his great 
achievements as a member of this place, the hon. member often 
mentions funding for the Ottawa Heart Institute.
<P>
	He has found an enviable role in Parliament that does not include 
the high and mighty stature of being a minister. Funding for the 
Ottawa Heart Institute was very important to him. I remember the 
time he went in for heart surgery. We were grateful that our prayers 
were answered and he was able to return here. We are glad he is in 
good health and feeling well enough to be able to keep up a 
rigorous schedule.
<P>
	Regarding the hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, again he 
is somebody who has served here for 30 years. I was 13 years old 
when these two men were elected. It gives me a sense of history. 
The hon. member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce has also had a wide 
and varied career. He has served in a variety of capacities as 
Solicitor General, Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, and Minister of Consumer and Corporate Affairs. 
The titles go on and on. They show the wide diversity of knowledge 
they have gained from this place.
<P>
	He has worked in many areas, but it is amazing that he has 
demonstrated his tenacious commitment to the convictions and 
principles on which he has staked his political career, I am sure 
more than once. In a firm commitment to the principles in which he 
believes and on which he has been re-elected on eight successive 
occasions, which truly distinguishes the hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, his unwavering belief in the principles in 
which he believes so firmly and for which he stands, has seen him 
stand to be counted many times, including a recent personal and 
difficult decision for him to oppose his own party.
<P>
	The hallmark of that successful politician, someone who is 
willing to stand to be counted, is that he is able to balance the 
realities of the party system with the wishes of his constituents 
while remaining true to his own beliefs. The hon. member for 
Notre-Dame-de-Grâce retains the respect and support of his con-

stituents. I  know my party especially has appreciated him as 
chairman of the justice committee on which he served.
<P>
	I wish both gentlemen well and a happy anniversary. I wish 
God's richest blessing on them as they continue in this place.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I very sincerely thank the government House 
leader and all my colleagues, the House leader for the official 
opposition and its members, and the House leader of the Reform 
Party and its members for their good wishes. If it were 30 years ago 
today I would do it all over again.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> There is no greater calling in Canada than that of 
a member of Parliament representing constituents and the nation 
and participating with the nation in international affairs. Some of 
the great things done by people in this place are the small things 
they do for their constituents. It has always been rewarding for me 
to travel through villages, towns, cities and communities and be 
called by my first name and taken into confidence. The people of 
Canada respect those who treat them with decency; I would say 
today that a sense of decency toward our fellow citizens and to be 
credible in their presence is one thing MPs should always bear in 
mind.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	I have seen, met and befriended some wonderful people who 
have passed through this great institution, people who have made a 
fantastic contribution to Canada. Quite frankly, I can say at this 
stage in my life on behalf of those people whom I have known and 
many who are in the House today, I do not think that this country's 
elected people get half the credit they deserve for the wonderful job 
they are doing.
<P>
	I say to all members, good luck and all the best to you as you go 
on in your careers. Thank you very much for your friendship.
<P>
	There is one thing that cannot go unmentioned here today. 
Whenever there is a party for Len Hopkins, I do not want it to be a 
party for Len Hopkins; I want it to be a party for my good wife Lois 
who is in the gallery today-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hopkins:</B> -and for the members of my family, Doug and 
Sherri, who have tolerated me over these 30 years. There are many 
in the House who know what it is all about.
<P>
	The best thing for people in public life today is to be decent to 
people, respect them and listen to them. Enjoy your career here by 
doing useful things for those people and for the country. Remember 
that this is a great institution through which many wonderful 
people have passed in bygone years. It is up to those of us here 
today  to make certain that people in the years to come look back 
and say that we respected the system and looked up to the Canadian 
people and did the best we could for this great nation of ours.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the last word always falls to the 
Speaker. Len and Warren, my words are also meant for you.
<P>
	In the name of your colleagues here in the House and for those of 
us who have served by your side over the decades, it is good to 
know there are people like the two of you, fighters fighting quietly 
at times and at other times more vociferously.
<P>
	This House is an honourable place. The two of you, Warren and 
Len, have brought greater honour to the House by being part of it. 
Thank you for serving Canada.

Canada is doing in meeting the goals we have set domestically and

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, having tabled the document, 
how did Canada do?
<P>
	Overall the OECD report is positive for Canada. It points to 
areas where we are doing well. Equally important, it points to areas 
where we must do better. The report credits co-operation among 
various levels of government as a key reason for effective 
environmental protection in Canada. It recognizes that Canadian 
governments have embraced the concept of sustainable 
development.
<P>
[Translation] 
<P>
	But Canada-like most OECD countries-continues to struggle 
with turning the concept of sustainable development in reality. The 
report says we have to do better-and we are. Over the past year, 
we have taken significant steps to address this problem. Bill C-83, 
which amends the Auditor General Act, is an example.
<P>
	It requires that government departments prepare sustainable 
development strategies and integrate sustainable development into 
departmental policies, programs and operations. This means giving 
the federal government the tools to start making the shift to 
sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The OECD report also has a lot to say about the way we are 
bringing environmental policy to life in Canada. While the report 
compliments the way we use voluntary agreements, it says that we 
need to increase the use of economic instruments. The report is 
right. We should use economic instruments in more cases to 
achieve our environmental goals. However, the government also 
believes there is a definite role for good legislation and good 
regulation and a definite need for legislation to be vigorously 
enforced.
<P>
	The federal government's flagship environmental legislation is 
the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It is here that good 
regulation can shift society and industry to cleaner commercial 
practices. As members of the House know, this legislation is 
currently under the mandatory five year review. The government 
will be tabling its response to the standing committee report very 
soon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In terms of wildlife and species protection, the OECD report 
makes it clear that we still have a lot of work ahead. While we can 
be pleased that population levels for many vulnerable species are 
going up, the report points to many cases where the laws are weak. 
It suggests that  Canada give special consideration to protecting 
wildlife in areas where there are severe pressures from human 
activities.
<P>
	The government recognizes this need. Last May, I released a 
proposal for a new Canadian Endangered Species Protection Act. 
This is the first time a federal government has moved to create a 
co-ordinated and co-operative national approach to protect the 244 
species of wild plants and animals that are endangered, threatened 
or vulnerable.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	On air pollution, the OECD report is positive about the 
effectiveness of Canada's federal-provincial partnership in 
reducing air pollution. We have met our goals for emissions of 
many air pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon 
monoxide causing acid rain. It also points to areas where air quality 
is inadequate for human health and ecosystems.
<P>
	In parts of Canada there are consistent breaches of national and 
provincial ambient air quality standards for ground level ozone, 
what we call smog. Environment ministers across Canada are 
strongly aware of the need to take action to reduce pollution from 
cars and from industry. We have begun to take action in concert to 
address this problem.
<P>
	Last month in Whitehorse, Yukon my provincial colleagues and I 
endorsed a report calling for the tightening of regulations under the 
federal Motor Vehicle Safety Act. Our report also calls for actions 
to improve fuel efficiency and to promote advanced technology and 
alternatively fuelled vehicles.
<P>
	There will be new standards for cleaner gasoline and diesel fuel. 
All in all, we believe these changes will significantly reduce the 
level of smog in Canada. That means cleaner air and healthier 
Canadians, which means Canadians will live longer.
<P>
	The most sobering element of the OECD environmental 
performance review report is that we are told we need to do more to 
meet our climate change goals. The report says that Canada will 
have a tough time meeting its climate change goals with our current 
plans. Nor does it believe that our national action program will 
allow Canada to meet its international commitment to stabilize 
carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 at 1990 levels. Clearly, 
tougher measures must be taken.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	The report encourages us to be more aggressive and to consider 
the use of all instruments available to reduce our emissions of 
carbon dioxide, instruments including charges, regulations and 
indeed taxes. The world's leading scientists have confirmed that if 
human beings do not reduce and eliminate their impact on the 
world's climate, the repercussions for Canada and the planet earth 
will be severe, crippling and irreversible. Aggressive  actions must 
be taken now. They must be taken if we are to fulfil our 
responsibil-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16373"> 16373 </A></B>
<P>
ity to protect the health and future of our children and 
grandchildren.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	And so, what messages can we take from the OECD 
Environmental Performance Review of Canada? Yes, our efforts to 
protect the environment are bearing fruit. But we cannot be 
complacent. There are important environmental issues that we have 
not resolved. And there are goals and commitments that we have 
not successfully met.
<P>
	In Canada, we have a record of working together to solve 
problems. This is something we can be proud of. The OECD has 
recognized this, but we must continue.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, 
the Minister of the Environment is tabling the OECD's report on 
Canada's environmental performance.
<P>
	This report also recognizes the efforts made by the Canadian 
Council of Ministers of the Environment, which proved itself to be 
a useful instrument in several respects. The report highlights the 
environmental strengths and weaknesses of the federal and 
provincial governments, which made sustainable development a 
central theoretical concept but with few concrete applications.
<P>
	The minister states that, contrary to what the report says, her 
government was able to translate the concept of sustainable 
development into a reality. To prove her assertion, she used the 
example of Bill C-83, which creates the position of commissioner 
of the environment.
<P>
	I simply want to point out to her that creating the position of 
commissioner of the environment is no guarantee of sustainable 
development for the federal government, let alone for Canadian 
and Quebec society. On October 3, the auditor general admitted 
before the Standing Committee on the Environment and 
Sustainable Development that he would have no control over the 
scope of departmental action plans. The departments themselves 
will be responsible for setting objectives, which cannot be 
questioned by anyone. In simple terms, nothing can prevent a 
minister from setting meaningless or superficial objectives.
<P>
	More importantly, the auditor general questioned the 
departments' ability and willingness to find ways to assess the 
effectiveness of their action plans. On this subject, he said, and I 
quote: ``In an era of downsizing and restructuring, I fear that the 
challenge will not be taken up. In our experience, in order to take 
positive action, departments need leadership, support and 
direction'', something that is obviously lacking.
<P>
	How can the minister come here to brag, when she knows full 
well that her government was unable to force her colleagues to 
develop meaningful action plans that could set an example for the 
private sector?
<P>
	At report stage and third reading of Bill C-83, I will be pleased to 
analyze more thoroughly the amendments put forward by the 
committee, which open the door once again to federal meddling in 
areas of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The minister admitted today that there is a real need for 
environmental legislation to be vigorously enforced. I fully agree 
with her. In this regard, she should be reminded again that Canada 
is still acting illegally by exporting toxic waste to the third world 
and that her officials simply cannot afford to put an end to this 
practice.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The minister is quite right. It is not enough to sign international 
arrangements such as the Basel convention; we must also enforce 
them. In that sense, instead of interfering in areas that are no 
concern of hers, as she keeps doing, the minister should ensure that 
those acts which are clearly under her responsibility are properly 
enforced.
<P>
	Moreover, the minister should also be reminded that, since her 
government came to office, the number of proceedings under the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act has clearly dropped 
compared to previous years.
<P>
	Similarly, the minister mentioned the CEPA regulations. The 
report in which the standing committee criticized the fact that there 
are hardly any regulations respecting the CEPA must have escaped 
the minister's attention.
<P>
	The minister also announced that the government's response to 
the standing committee's report on the CEPA would follow shortly. 
The minister might be tempted to table a bill reflecting the 
centralizing designs of the Liberal members of the committee, but I 
would caution her against it.
<P>
	In the last referendum, the people of Quebec have clearly 
indicated that they will no longer tolerate the federal government's 
highhanded and centralizing approach. The Bloc Quebecois and 
myself are anxious to see if the minister got the message and acted 
on it.
<P>
	I wish to stress the fact that this government's attitude since 
coming to office and the episode of the Environmental Assessment 
Act, which raised an outcry, have left a bad taste in the mouth of 
provincial governments. Co-operation between the various levels 
of government must not be taken for granted, and the minister has 
already gone beyond the limit of what can be tolerated in many 
respects.
<P>
	As far as air pollution is concerned, it is obvious that the minister 
is walking on eggs. According to the OECD, Canada's performance 
is far from enviable. While, clearly, some provinces have simply 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16374"> 16374 </A></B>
<P>
not taken their  responsibilities, the minister can hardly brag about 
her own performance.
<P>
	The minister's proposal at the recent summit in Berlin to literally 
deliver permits to pollute, as well as her bill on MMT, which could 
result in a significant increase in greenhouse gas emissions, are 
evidence of her poor performance.
<P>
	I also note that Bill S-7, which seeks to introduce the use of more 
environment friendly fuels for the federal fleet of vehicles, is not 
an initiative of this government, but of Senator Colin Kenney.
<P>
	Finally, I want to point out that the OECD report presented to us 
today concerns the provincial governments just as much, if not 
more. Indeed, in its report, the OECD recognizes that the provinces 
assume most of the responsibilities related to management of the 
environment. Canada still has a long way to go before it can claim 
to be a leader in environmental issues.
<P>
	The OECD's criticisms primarily concern provincial 
governments. It is up to them to take the initiative and to reduce 
pollution, improve management of our natural resources, and 
improve integration of the economy and the environment.
<P>
	I also think that it would be in the best interests of the provinces 
to take a direct part in signing international agreements. That way, 
they would have no excuse for not reaching objectives they 
themselves have set.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the OECD report shows that we are doing fairly well, but 
there is more that we can do. We have embraced the concept of 
sustainable development, but like many countries we have had 
trouble in translating this into reality. Encouragingly the minister 
agreed with this.
<P>
	In the face of this admission the government has produced a pea 
soup agenda with respect to the environment, this even after a 
superb report by the committee on the environment that was 
completed earlier this year and was lauded in many quarters.
<P>
	I ask the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister of the 
Environment: Why is she putting bills such as the environmental 
auditor general forward when the functions of the environmental 
auditor general can be co-opted by existing structures?
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	Why are we talking in the House about banning MMT and 
spending enormous amounts of money and time on this issue when 
there is no reason to ban it for reasons of health? There is a lot of 
evidence to show that MMT does not damage onboard devices, the 
basis on which the Deputy Prime Minister is trying to ban it.
<P>
	The government is taking up these issues when there are other 
larger, pressing, persistent and dangerous issues affecting Canada's 
environment as we speak.
<P>
	First, the OECD report states that Canada has not been exporting 
toxic materials to other countries since we signed the Basel 
convention in 1992. The investigative unit of the minister's 
department shows that Canada is exporting highly toxic materials 
to non-OECD developing nations such as Hong Kong, China, India, 
Thailand and South Korea. The toxic substances being exported to 
these countries cannot meet the environmental standards we have 
in our country. These countries are taking toxic materials, stripping 
parts away, and burning them or dumping them in a fashion that is 
highly damaging to the environment.
<P>
	Second, there are 26 sites in this country that pose a high degree 
of hazard to people, flora and fauna. There is absolutely no plan to 
address these toxic sites within our own border.
<P>
	Third, the OECD analysis also showed that on a per capita basis 
we emit the highest levels of such damaging agents as nitrous 
oxide, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Yet in the face of this 
the minister wants to ban MMT which will greatly increase nitrous 
oxide emissions, which is a very important component of the smog 
that exacerbates respiratory problems.
<P>
	Fourth, Canada refused to agree to be a signatory of an important 
section of the UN convention on the prevention of pollution from 
ships. As a result, one-third of the garbage on some of the most 
pristine and protected beaches in the British Isles comes from 
Canada. I would ask the hon. minister to please look at that.
<P>
	I agree with the minister's statement about working with 
industry to try and develop economic ways to help them become 
more sensitive to the environment, and in developing ways to use 
industry in a sustainable fashion. We would be happy to work with 
the minister on that.
<P>
	I also applaud her statement on trying to protect our flora and 
fauna. It is a heritage that the people of the country have been given 
and in turn, we are obligated to give to future generations.
<P>
	Our problems demand immediate action, not only for the benefit 
of all Canadians but for the benefit of people around the world. Our 
environment is not only shared with those within our country, it is 
shared by all people on the planet. We have only one planet, only 
one environment and only one opportunity to make sure our 
environment will be sustainable and sound for coming generations.
<P>
	We are at a watershed on the planet right now. If we choose to 
put forward sound plans for sustainable utilization of the 
environment, then we will have a world worth living in. But if we 
choose not to take this course of action, then the planet we know 
will not be what we were born into. It will be a very sorry place to 
live.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16375"> 16375 </A></B>
<P>
	In southeast Asia a number of countries have gone full bore into 
developing their nations with very little respect for the 
environment. As a result great numbers of children are being born 
with genetic defects which are directly due to the polluted 
environment into which they are born. We must take heed of this 
and develop our country for the future in a way that we will not 
fall into this trap, for us and for the coming generations.

	The House resumed from November 7 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-94, an act to regulate interprovincial trade in and 
the importation for commercial purposes of certain manganese 
based substances, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Bruce-Grey has 
the floor. Our hon. colleague still has 11 minutes remaining in his 
intervention.
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ovid L. Jackson (Bruce-Grey, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
glad to be here today to speak to Bill C-94, the manganese based 
fuel additives act.
<P>
	Yesterday I made the case for the onboard diagnostic equipment. 
I spoke of the process in an engine during the four-stroke cycle and 
the fact that when the fuel is burned in such a rapid sequence it 
exits the tailpipe and how it affects the onboard diagnostic 
equipment.
<P>
	I will conclude my remarks by talking about the fuel as it comes 
out of the exhaust pipe and enters into the catalytic converter. A 
catalyst is a device that causes something to happen that would not 
have happened without this device. It basically changes the 
substance without changing itself.
<P>
	I talked about what happens with regard to rhodium and 
platinum and palladium used in this device and how it affects 
adding or subtracting oxygen and the fact that we added or 
subtracted oxygen by triggering certain devices by computer 
controlled mechanisms.
<P>
	In the House we talk about problems in Canada. We have 
interprovincial problems. Sometimes because we do not have 
natural enemies we spend a lot of time navel gazing or talking 
about other things. It is important, particularly when it comes to the 
environment, that we act collaboratively and work hard to try to do 
the best for our country.
<P>
	The environment is quite fragile. It is quite integrated. As we get 
more and more knowledgable about it, we understand how 
important it is and how important it is to interact with it and when 
we do the right things what the environment can do for us in terms 
of giving us healthy lifestyles. Given the fact that air will migrate 
across states and across provinces, it is very important that we have 
collaborative action to look after that. It does not matter  how small 
those applications are in terms of looking after the environment. 
We have to act.
<P>
	I am reminded of the fellow who said ``If you think cleaning up 
the environment is hard, trying cleaning out your garage''.
<P>
	As the House gives final consideration to Bill C-94, I would like 
to explain the background to this legislation and what it seeks to 
accomplish.
<P>
	MMT is the commonly used acronym for a more tongue twisting 
name: methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl. This is a 
manganese based fuel additive used to increase the octane rating of 
gasoline.
<P>
	MMT was first viewed as a replacement for lead in gasoline. In 
Canada it has been used since 1977. As all members are aware, lead 
was phased out of virtually all Canadian gasoline by 1990. The 
phase-out has brought considerable improvement to urban air 
quality.
<P>
	If I may compare MMT to lead, heaven forbid-I think lead was 
probably more dastardly and more harmful-we would notice that 
when we try to fill our car up the nozzles for the new gasolines are 
smaller and the hole is smaller so we cannot use the old nozzles in 
cases where they have lead.
<P>
	Lead had its positive points. It was an octane additive. It was 
used to increase the combustion chamber pressures. If you increase 
the compression ratio you get higher initial pressure, higher final 
pressure, and more power. Older cars went up to something like 
11:1 compression ratio.
<P>
	The lead itself actually stops the gasoline from blowing up. 
Gasoline becomes unpredictable. For those who drive their 
vehicles very hard, especially some of the older model cars, and 
turn the ignition switch off with their foot on the accelerator pedal 
and the car runs on, it is called dieseling or after-running. It is 
sometimes caused by a hot carbon particle setting the gasoline on 
fire, although it is not electronically triggered by the sparkplug. It 
is just the heat that is left in the residual amount of carbon left in 
the combustion chamber that actually sets the gasoline on fire.
<P>
	These octane enhancers try to predict or control this 
explosiveness or the volatility of the gasoline so that it works under 
controlled processes. When it is controlled it burns a little better 
and you get better reaction from it and you can control the work it 
is doing. You are changing heat energy to mechanical work in an 
engine.
<P>
<B>(1550 )</B>
<P>
	Today almost every Canadian motorist uses MMT, simply 
because Canadian refineries use it. The exact amount of MMT may 
vary from one batch of gasoline to another. In general, premium 
grade gasoline contains a higher MMT level than regular grade 
gasoline.
<P>
	MMT has always been controversial. In 1978 it was prohibited 
for use in unleaded gasoline in the United  States because it was 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16377"> 16377 </A></B>
<P>
suspected that the substance could damage emission control 
equipment. Despite recent moves to reverse the U.S. prohibition, 
MMT is certain to have no place in the high tech cleaner fuels for 
the future.
<P>
	Hon. members from the opposition party and the Reform Party 
have made the case that there is not enough evidence. I have seen 
films from the automotive manufacturers, and they have said 
categorically and have shown that the catalysts in the converters 
are coated at a faster rate. The person who will lose in this case is 
the consumer.
<P>
	If Ethyl Corporation and the automotive manufacturers want to 
work something out, we do not want to be the referee. The federal 
government has spent a lot of money because members of the 
opposition and sometimes our own members have asked the 
government to do certain things. We end up spending a lot of 
money and sometimes the resultant solutions are not that good.
<P>
	Look at the Krever report on blood contaminants concerning 
things that have happened in the past. Those proceedings are going 
on and on; it is going to cost us millions of dollars and will 
probably result in a lot of lawsuits from people about things that 
have happened in the past. It seems the only people who get a lot of 
jobs are lawyers. I am sure my lawyer friends are going to be mad 
at me, but that is a problem with some of the things that happen 
here.
<P>
	In this case, the federal government should not intervene in a 
dispute between the Ethyl Corporation and the automotive 
manufacturers. It has to make a decision on behalf of Canadians 
and the environment. That is what this decision is all about.
<P>
	Canada is being forced to confront the downside of MMT not 
because a new environmental threat has emerged but because we 
are getting better at countering those threats.
<P>
	Cleaner air involves using cleaner fuels as well as cleaner cars 
and trucks. While research has continued on the product we put 
into our gas tanks, it has also continued on our hardware, the engine 
that burns the fuel and the control equipment that lowers emissions. 
Technological advances have steadily cut the harmful emissions 
coming out of tailpipes.
<P>
	Now we have taken another major step toward the introduction 
of sophisticated onboard diagnostic systems, which are known as 
OBDs. These systems are extremely valuable for the environment. 
They are responsible for the monitoring of the vehicle's emission 
controls and alerting the driver to malfunctions. They ensure the 
cleaner burning engines of today and tomorrow operate as 
designed. They ensure automobiles are properly maintained, 
resulting in decreased tailpipe emissions and improved fuel 
economy.
<P>
	This is a very important technology, but it is even more 
important that it works, that it does the job properly on the new 
cars. This is where the problem arises.
<P>
	The automobile manufacturers are convinced that gasoline 
containing MMT adversely affects the operation of sophisticated 
onboard diagnostic pieces of equipment. Accordingly, the industry 
has made the decision that it will not accept the risk of increased 
warranty repair costs caused by MMT related damage. Some 
companies have even indicated they will disconnect the OBD 
systems in whole or in part if MMT continues to be used in 
Canadian gasoline. That means the cost of maintaining these 
systems could be passed on directly to Canadian consumers and 
Canadian consumers would pay more to operate these new cars.
<P>
	What we have here is a conflict between two key industrial 
sectors, the automotive manufacturers and the oil industry. The car 
makers insist that MMT harms their product, forcing them to adopt 
practices that may raise prices for consumers.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	The oil industry claims that MMT reduces nitrogen oxide 
emissions by up to 20 per cent, but the figure is subject to dispute. 
In any case, alternatives to MMT are available. By the industry's 
own estimates, the cost of MMT removal translates into an increase 
of 0.1 to 0.24 cents per litre at the pump, which is a negligible 
amount, given that gasoline prices regularly fluctuate by a few 
cents per litre.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment urged both industries to find a 
voluntary resolution to the issue of MMT in Canada by the end of 
1994. She said that if they did not do so the government would take 
action. The deadline was subsequently extended into February of 
this year to review automotive and petroleum industry proposals. 
Unfortunately, the matter was not resolved, so the federal 
government proceeded with Bill C-94.
<P>
	Allow me briefly to explain the key provisions of the bill. The 
legislation will prohibit the import or interprovincial trade for a 
commercial purpose of MMT or unleaded gasoline containing 
MMT. It will give the Minister of the Environment the power to 
authorize exceptions for MMT, which will not be used in unleaded 
gasoline, subject to a monitoring requirement. Coverage of the act 
can be expanded by order in council to cover other manganese 
based substances. The act is binding on all persons and entities, 
including federal and provincial governments.
<P>
	I believe that the initiative taken by the government is correct. I 
feel that the onboard diagnostic equipment malfunctions outweigh 
the gains we can achieve with respect to nitrous oxides. We could 
control the nitrous oxides. The OBD systems will give us better 
fuel  economy and better burning engines, resulting in fewer 
emissions to the environment.
<P>

<B><A NAME="16378"> 16378 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak today to 
third reading of Bill C-94. I am pleased to speak for two reasons. 
First, it will give me the opportunity to show Canadians a sad 
example of bad legislation. Second, speaking today allows me to 
reveal again how the government's inability to display good 
judgment will cause Canadian industry, the consumer, and the 
overall environment to suffer.
<P>
	On May 19, 1995 Bill C-94 was introduced in the House of 
Commons by the Minister of the Environment. After introduction 
the minister proceeded to hold a press conference, where she 
informed reporters that the reason for banning MMT was because it 
caused problems with onboard diagnostic systems in new 
automobiles. That was not the only reason the minister proceeded 
to ban MMT. She stated that Canada was one of the few countries 
in the world using MMT in unleaded gasoline and that this should 
change.
<P>
	The minister knows very well what the best solution to the entire 
debate would be. She knows that a series of independent third party 
tests are needed, but she will not initiate this or facilitate it.
<P>
	As members of the House and, more important, as 
representatives of all Canadians it is important we weigh and 
pursue every available option to come up with an appropriate 
conclusion before we create legislation. We should be asking 
ourselves: What indeed is the best science can tell us?
<P>
	The Liberal government calls itself responsible. What is really 
meant by the term responsibility, in view of Bill C-94? On these 
technical matters it certainly does not hurt to demonstrate and then 
legislate. That is not too much to ask.
<P>
	We know that at the time the bill was introduced MMT was not 
yet approved for use in unleaded gasoline in the United States. 
Since 1978 MMT has not been in U.S. fuel. In 1978 the 
Environmental Protection Agency did not approve MMT because it 
felt it might be detrimental to the health of Americans. 
Understanding what the Americans did with respect to MMT is 
very significant to what this government is trying to do with Bill 
C-94.
<P>
	In the U.S. there was an air quality act brought forward by 
Congress in 1967. The act established a registration program for 
fuel additives. The regulations made registration a condition of sale 
and required that manufacturers provide information on the 
recommended range of concentration and use and chemical 
composition and structure.
<P>
<B>(1600 )</B>
<P>
	In 1970 Congress amended the act to transfer authorization of 
the registration program over to the EPA. Congress required that 
the EPA designate fuels and fuel additives for registration. The 
clean air act required that manufacturers provide information on 
the chemical composition to the EPA. The EPA also had the 
authority to judge the effects of additives on emission control 
performance and public health.
<P>
	In 1977 Congress made more amendments to the clean air act. 
One amendment dealt with the emergence of catalytic converters in 
automobiles. I will read what the courts had to say about the new 
amendment and the effect it would have on MMT:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As catalytic converters could not be used with leaded fuel, their adoption had 
led to a sharp rise in the use of MMT as an octane booster, and Congress 
responded to concerns that it and other fuel additives might harm the 
effectiveness of these converters. Section 211(f)(3) required that manufacturers 
of certain existing additives, those that were ``not substantially similar'' to 
constituents of fuel used in the certification of vehicles for emission purposes 
for 1975 or later model years, stop distributing such additives effective 
September 15, 1978.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Congress directed the EPA to grant a waiver once it determined 
that the additive would not cause or contribute to the failure of an 
emission control device system. The EPA deliberately stalled on 
making a decision until the courts instructed it to do the testing.
<P>
	On November 30, 1993 the EPA found that MMT did not cause 
or contribute to the failure of emission control systems. However, 
not wanting to be outdone by the courts, the EPA denied the waiver 
on the grounds that the manufacturer, Ethyl, had not yet established 
the absence of health effects.
<P>
	The court wrangling continued until October 20, 1995 when the 
United States Court of Appeals, in the case of Ethyl Corporation v. 
Carol M. Browner, administrator of the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency, ruled:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>We order the EPA to register MMT for use as an additive in unleaded 
gasoline, as of November 30, 1993.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	What is significant with this ruling is not that Ethyl won and that 
MMT could be sold in U.S. unleaded gasoline by the end of the 
year, but rather it is the process that was undertaken by Congress 
and then the EPA not to approve MMT in unleaded fuels. Back in 
1978 the EPA said that MMT might pose a health problem and 
cause adverse effects to catalytic converters, but through the 
examination of all evidence by the courts these negative concerns 
were put aside.
<P>
	The EPA has until December 4, 1995 to appeal the decision made 
by the court. Considering that it did not appeal an earlier decision 
this year it is doubtful it will appeal the October 20 ruling. The 
implications of this are rather ironic. When the bill was introduced 
in May both the environment minister and the industry minister 
said  that eliminating MMT from our gasoline was essential to 
achieve a North American harmonization of fuel. They said we 
should copy the Americans.
<P>
	Both ministers were confident that the ban on MMT would 
remain in the United States. On May 5 I asked the environment 
<P>

<B><A NAME="16379"> 16379 </A></B>
<P>
minister during question period about the fact that the courts would 
probably rule in Ethyl's favour. In response he stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I advise the hon. member that last week when I had the opportunity of 
speaking with Carol Browner, head of the EPA, she reaffirmed the U.S. 
commitment not to allow MMT. She decried the fact that there is only one 
country, Canada, that still allows MMT. We intend to change that.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Minister of Industry has gone further than his colleague, the 
Minister of the Environment. On April 25 in a question period 
response he told me:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Key to that is uniformity of standards between the U.S. and Canada. The 
member will know that MMT is not permitted in the United States by legislation. 
It is crucial that we have uniformity of standards. The effort we put into trying to 
ensure there was a voluntary agreement between the two sectors has been well 
placed, but finally governments have to decide.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Ministry of Industry has clearly stated on the record that it is 
important U.S. and Canadian gasoline need to have the same 
composition harmonization. That is his position and he will no 
doubt vote in favour of Bill C-94. The government is confused. I 
thought the definition of harmonization was two sides being in 
harmony with each other. I guess the minister has a different 
definition as MMT is now going to be used in the U.S.A.
<P>
	The industry minister is not the only one who has different ideas 
of harmonization. During the clause by clause consideration of the 
bill I moved the motion that we hold off on the bill until December 
5, 1995, one day after the EPA's 45 allotted days to appeal the court 
ruling. The U.S. ruling was not only significant for Ethyl 
Corporation but was equally important for the Canadian consumer. 
I point out a statement by the member for York-Simcoe in rebuttal 
to my motion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think in terms of what's going on in the United States. The decision that was 
encountered recently regarding MMT was based on some technicality. We also have 
to give consideration to the fact that MMT is banned in California and some of the 
high ozone states.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before we left for the Senate I was quoting the member for 
York-Simcoe. She had said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I think in terms of what's going on in the United States. The decision that was 
encountered recently regarding MMT was based on some technicality. We also 
have to give consideration to the fact that MMT is banned in California and 
some of the high-ozone states- So any kind of justification for the fact that 100 
per cent of the United States is not going to be using MMT is simply just not 
acceptable because that's not true. At least 30 per cent of the country will not be 
having MMT usage at all.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When I was a youngster in elementary school and I thought I 
might be embarrassed, I would perhaps disassemble to get out of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16380"> 16380 </A></B>
<P>
trouble. The comments made by  the member for York-Simcoe in 
the environment committee show that the government's back is up 
against the wall and it is now saying anything it can to save face. 
The policy of the government is clear: legislate how the minister 
feels, or wants to favour someone, rather than by what is right in 
view of legitimate evidence.
<P>
	When MMT is reintroduced into the United States later this year 
probably 70 per cent of the gasoline will have MMT in it, if we use 
the numbers from the member for York-Simcoe. Let me also 
point out that the environmental restrictions in California are 
different from any of those used in other states. I have often heard 
the description that California is a country all of its own. If 
California lifted the ban on MMT I am certain the members of the 
Liberal caucus would find some other reason it is important to ban 
MMT.
<P>
	When the EPA attempted to ban MMT it mistakenly believed it 
was harmful. The Liberal government wants to ban not the 
substance but rather the importation and interprovincial trade in the 
substance. This is clearly an anti-free trade bill. Some would ask 
the reason for doing it this way. The government has no other 
choice. When it is unable to do something through the proper 
channels, old style Liberals find other ways.
<P>
	This is the government that told the Canadian electorate 
following the last election that it would show credibility and 
responsibility and be forthright with the public. Here is another 
example that can be added to a long list of old style governance and 
politics.
<P>
	Every Canadian should ask the Minister of the Environment why 
she did not go through the proper channels and ban MMT under the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. She is the sponsor of this 
legislation so why did she not use her department's act, an act that 
was designed specifically for banning harmful substances. The 
answer is simple. She could not. There is not a scientific basis for 
it. MMT appears to be no more harmful than household dust on the 
furniture.
<P>
	In order to add a substance to the schedule of banned substances 
under CEPA it must be proven by Health Canada that the substance 
is hazardous to the health of Canadians. Anyone who has listened 
to any of the debates on this bill is well aware of the December 6, 
1994 Health Canada report called ``Risk Assessment for the 
Combustion Products of MMT''. It states that ``all analyses 
indicate that the combustion products of MMT in gasoline do not 
represent an added health risk to the Canadian population''.
<P>
	On October 18 a Health Canada official appeared before the 
Standing Committee on the Environment and Sustainable 
Development and concurred that the 1994 report remains the 
position of the department. Therefore I urge all members of the 
House not to include in their speeches during this third reading 
stage any reference that the removal of MMT will improve health 
quality. I
<P>
heard several government members make a mention of  this during 
second reading. It is a false and inaccurate assertion. A member 
may make an unforeseen mistake, however in this case, the 
evidence gives clear direction concerning what can be claimed.
<P>
	From the outset Reformers have unequivocally stated that we 
would support the banning of MMT if the government could prove 
through an independent scientific test that MMT was harmful to the 
automakers onboard diagnostic systems or OBD-IIs as they are 
called in the industry. However the minister has only scoffed at 
Reform for even suggesting independent testing. The Motor 
Vehicle Manufacturers Association has provided her with their test 
data and that is all the data she apparently needs or wants to see.
<P>
	When the petroleum companies appeared before the committee 
they suggested they would have a tremendous amount to lose 
should MMT be removed from Canadian fuels. In their testimony it 
was suggested that the removal of MMT could result in an increase 
of manufacturing costs by as much as $69 million per year.
<P>
<B>(1620 )</B>
<P>
	According to the Canadian Petroleum Products Institute, the $69 
million increase would be due to the fact that refiners would have 
to burn more crude in order to achieve the high octane levels 
needed for today's automobiles. They would also have to retrofit 
refineries. Other expensive additives would have to be used which 
might eventually be revealed to be very harmful.
<P>
	This bill has been through the various stages. I want to make it 
clear that at every stage Reform has made every attempt to put the 
bill on hold until conclusive proof is found. We have not been 
obstructionist. We have called for common sense, not unreasonably 
siding with any group, unlike the government.
<P>
	I want to read into the record parts of three letters I have come 
across, all from provincial ministers of the environment and all 
concerning MMT. First, from the Hon. Vaughn Blaney, Minister of 
the Environment for the province of New Brunswick:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given that neither the federal government nor the motor vehicle 
manufacturing industry have provided the information and assurances that this 
province and the refining industry have requested regarding the economic and 
environmental impacts of this bill, and given the current discussions on use of 
this compound in the United States, I would hereby request that this bill be set 
aside until the questions raised have been clearly responded to by Canada and a 
decision on the continued use of this additive is taken in the United States.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From the Hon. Wayne Adams, Minister of the Environment for 
the province of Nova Scotia:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I realize that there are conflicting reports respecting pros and cons of MMT use. 
However, the task force should consider the potential increase in NOx emissions, 
higher production costs, and higher energy demands associated with the 
manufacture and use of a non-MMT gasoline. I believe that it would be prudent to 
withhold a final decision with respect to fuel reformulation and  MMT until such </BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16381"> 16381 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>time as all stakeholders have had sufficient opportunity to assess the available 
information and the question of MMT is settled in the U.S.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	From the Hon. Bernard H. Wiens, Minister of the Environment 
and Resource Management for the province of Saskatchewan:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The province understands the importance of the automobile manufacturing 
industry in Canada, however, our petroleum refining industry continues to be 
concerned that the removal of MMT would cause substantial cost increases for 
their industry. In addition to the cost implications, increased greenhouse gas 
emissions as a result of intensified refinery processes required to replace MMT, 
and increased vehicle tail-pipe emissions of smog forming Oxides of Nitrogen 
(NOx) would also occur. The data supplied to date by the automative industry 
does not identify a net air quality benefit and as such, we have difficulty 
rationalizing the cost to the refining industry or consumers.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The issue of NOx benefit is a serious one. NOx emissions are 
major contributors to urban smog. As well, there is no disputing 
that the presence of MMT in unleaded gasoline actually reduces 
smog as it complements complete combustion. All of the experts 
agree, including those from Environment Canada. The only dispute 
is about the appropriate amount.
<P>
	Environment Canada officials claim that the amount is 5 per cent 
whereas Ethyl and the petroleum companies claim it is closer to 20 
per cent. Whatever the number, the result is that MMT reduces 
NOx emissions, it certainly does not increase it.
<P>
	One of the most interesting aspects of this entire debate is the 
absence of the Minister of Natural Resources. Within the minister's 
purview are the many refineries and coming from the capital of the 
oil industry one has to wonder what her opinions are. When asked 
whether or not the natural resources minister is in agreement with 
Bill C-94 the environment minister stood up and stated: ``I would 
point out that any cabinet decision to move on MMT is supported 
by all minister of government''.
<P>
	However, in the final outcome, the Minister of Natural 
Resources will have to explain her actions to her constituents. I 
doubt the scientists and technicians of her department support the 
bill. They have been muzzled and disallowed from expressing their 
own personal and professional views.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Natural Resources really stand in the House 
and vote for such changes as proposed in Bill C-94? May I remind 
her that she won by one of the smallest margins in the last federal 
election. If I remember correctly there were several recounts. I 
suggest the minister make her voice known around the cabinet 
table instead of succumbing to the unreasonable pressure of the 
Minister of the Environment.
<P>
	Since the very beginning Reform has pushed the environment 
minister to do independent testing and let the auto manufacturers 
and Ethyl Corporation work  things out themselves. The minister 
could not believe that I would suggest such a thing. She was 
adamant that the auto manufacturers were correct and that was that.
<P>
	I have some new information about a recent development. I hope 
each of my hon. friends across the floor, including the Minister of 
the Environment, will be listening very closely. The American 
Automobile Manufacturers Association and its members are 
continuing to develop an MMT vehicle test program. They expect 
to co-operate with the makers of MMT. The industry is talking 
about the pursuing a sharing of data about the effects of MMT on 
OBD systems. It looks like the industry can solve the problem itself 
without government interference.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	It is time for the environment minister to change her headstrong 
approach. When industries are willing to work together to find 
common ground, the government should stay clear. If the Minister 
of the Environment is too willing to interfere, I can only ask the 
question, why? If the minister wants to have a credible legacy in 
the environment portfolio I would suggest that she put aside this 
bill and let it gather some household dust.
<P>
	The government's lack of a meaningful legislative agenda for the 
country is now noticed by the political observers. The country is 
falling apart on the tenets of the fundamental agreements that made 
the Confederation of Canada, yet we are dithering over MMT in car 
gas. The sense of proportion for government is missing at this 
critical point in our history.
<P>
	If we must regulate gasoline additives for the country, then let 
the minister come forward with a bill that deals with rules and an 
open process for any substance that does not come under the 
Canadian Environmental Protection Act. This anti-free trade bill 
before us today will likely be challenged on the reasonable basis 
under the NAFTA provisions. I think the intervenor should win on 
the merits against the government as everything our party has said 
on this matter would support such a challenge. It is my assessment 
that the government is in a very weak, unjustifiable position on that 
count but is hoping that it will slip by.
<P>
	In closing, Reformers say to the Minister of the Environment 
who is the Deputy Prime Minister, give up on this misguided track 
and get on with saving the country.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, seldom 
in recent times have I witnessed a debate into which so much 
misinformation has been injected and so much confusion has been 
put on the record in order to create a lack of confidence in the 
actions of the government.
<P>
	With all due respect to the member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby, this matter is not a new one. It is not one 
that has prompted 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16382"> 16382 </A></B>
<P>
the Minister of the  Environment and the government to make a 
rash decision. It has been around for some time.
<P>
	If I remember correctly, in October 1993, the Minister of the 
Environment announced that if the petroleum industry would not 
take voluntary action to resolve the issue of MMT in gasoline by 
the end of 1994, she would have to take action to prohibit its use. 
This deadline was extended to February 1995.
<P>
	This decision has a long history. The government has carefully 
watched a dispute between two industrial sectors and despite the 
prompting and the time extension, a solution was not found and it 
was found necessary to intervene. In the face of the inability of the 
two major stakeholders and one proponent to meet and come to an 
agreement on MMT, the onus must fall on the government to 
determine what needs to be done in the public interest.
<P>
	The most informed judgment available at the time in this case 
was the judgment that MMT as a fuel additive had to go. So much 
for the accusation that the government has not thought it over and 
has not given the parties sufficient time to come to a solution on 
their own. This matter was also pointed out when we had our 
hearings in committee.
<P>
	A number of issues are at stake. One issue is the question that 
emission systems would fail prematurely because of the presence 
of MMT in gasoline. There is the issue of unnecessary repair costs 
when these emission systems are not plugged in. Millions of 
motorists would be affected by the presence of MMT in the new 
model cars. Data and analyses only come from companies that 
make MMT or from automakers and the government as an 
independent agency has to judge both and decide which way to go. 
There is the risk of increased warranty repair costs to the consumer 
and the possible reduction of the warranty coverage for Canadian 
motorists.
<P>
<B>(1630)</B>
<P>
	An overall encompassing issue and a matter I would like to bring 
to the attention of those who oppose this bill is that technological 
progress is pushing legislative changes. That is what it boils down 
to. This is technology which is moving ahead and is impossible to 
ignore. We must take that fact into account and find ways of 
protecting the consumer. I am sure the constituents in Athabasca, 
the constituents in New Westminster-Burnaby and the 
constituents of that great Canadian patriot from Laurentides will all 
benefit from this measure.
<P>
	Cars coming onstream into the marketplace have OBDs, the 
onboard diagnostic systems, which will ensure that the mix of 
emissions produced are under control in the most advanced levels 
that technology has reached. If we do not remove MMT from 
gasoline, this technology cannot be utilized by the consumer. The 
manufacturer of  the car, as we were told in committee, will simply 
disconnect the diagnostic system from the engine.
<P>
	Initially I had some difficulty understanding what manganese 
does. I found it very helpful to hear the explanation given to us by 
people in the know who made two points.
<P>
	The exhaust of an engine passes over the specially coated surface 
of a catalytic converter, which we all know is that little box under 
the car which was installed some time ago in order to reduce car 
emissions. When the exhaust gas passes over it, certain pollutants 
are removed. Manganese is produced by virtue of the consumption 
of gasoline in the engine. If the manganese covers the surface of the 
catalytic converter, then this type of catalytic converter cannot 
function properly. As a result, vehicles will pollute more over time. 
Here is the link between the effect of manganese and the catalytic 
converter in a very linear form.
<P>
	Engines in recent times have adopted the technology of oxygen 
sensors. They determine how much oxygen goes into the air and 
fuel mixture in the engine. If manganese is used in gasoline, over 
time the manganese will coat the sensors. When it coats the 
sensors, the sensors give a false signal that air must be injected into 
the mixture. As a result the engine consumes more fuel because the 
air-fuel mixture becomes too rich.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The cars built for the North American market are equipped with 
onboard diagnostic systems. The system tells the motorist when the 
emission equipment must be looked at. Unlike the emission 
inspection systems of the past, the onboard diagnostic system 
identifies the first moment the vehicle begins to pollute 
excessively. That is important to remember because unlike what we 
were told by the hon. member for New Westminster-Burnaby, 
there are health implications. There is no need, thanks to the 
onboard diagnostic system, to have inspection stations, to wait in 
line ups, to pay inspection fees, and the like.
<P>
	The majority of motorists whose vehicles are not polluting 
excessively need not be inconvenienced. All they need is the 
onboard diagnostic system. It helps the motorist and the 
environment. It improves the control of the emission of various 
gases produced in the combustion engine.
<P>
	The oxygen sensors are important. We must keep that in mind. 
The catalytic converter is important. The removal of manganese is 
a function of the performance of these two items, the catalytic 
converter and the sensors.
<P>
	We want to achieve something which is good for the consumer 
and which is also good for the quality of the air we breathe, 
particularly in densely populated urban centres from Vancouver to 
Halifax.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16383"> 16383 </A></B>
<P>
	A number of red herrings have been brought forward during the 
debate. I will not spend too much time speaking on the comments 
which were made the other day by the great patriot from 
Laurentides when she had to drag in and quote Terence Corcoran 
of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> who was criticizing the Minister of the 
Environment in a rather pathetic way. If it were up to Mr. 
Corcoran, our environmental standards would quickly return to the 
middle ages. The criticism was that the removal of MMT would 
produce more pollution. The theme of the hon. member for 
Laurentides was also picked up quite extensively by the hon. 
member for Athabasca. He was very strong in committee on that.
<P>
	In committee we heard the views of Ethyl Corporation, which is 
opposed to the bill, as it was opposed to the removal of lead in 
gasoline 10 years ago, and quite adamantly so. We also heard views 
from the car manufacturing industry. We had to conclude that the 
claims about increased pollution as advanced by Ethyl Corporation 
were seriously exaggerated. They were based on data collected by 
Ethyl from test cars and not on data from a Canadian fleet. I am 
told there is a big difference between the two.
<P>
	The Canadian fleet tests took into account world operating 
conditions and concluded that the NOx reduction was more in the 
order of 5 per cent than the 20 per cent claimed by Ethyl. The claim 
that removing MMT will lead to a higher production of NOx is one 
that has not been sufficiently and clearly substantiated in our 
committee hearings. Actually, the matter was put to rest quite 
effectively when we heard that the operation of the diagnostic 
system permits a control of all polluting gases produced during the 
combustion process. This is important. The overall impact of the 
diagnostic controlling system is that it will reduce the overall 
engine pollution in all of its components, namely carbon 
monoxides, NOx and hydrocarbons.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	With respect to the lack of provincial support, a letter was read 
from the New Brunswick minister of the environment. I believe we 
also received a letter from the Saskatchewan minister, but we 
certainly have not received a letter from the minister of the 
environment for British Columbia. We understand that British 
Columbia is very much in favour of this legislation. We have not 
heard from the province of Ontario, which I suspect is also very 
much in favour. I suspect the same for the province of Quebec. I 
believe that the provinces, by and large, have expressed either 
directly or indirectly considerable support.
<P>
	I submit with all due respect to my knowledgeable and esteemed 
colleague from New Westminster-Burnaby, it is hard to believe 
that this matter could be put into the category of being an anti-free 
trade measure. This measure really does not have to do with free 
trade.
<P>
	The NAFTA agreement gives much relevance to matters related 
to labour and the environment. This comes clearly under the 
environmental heading. It is a very legitimate initiative and it is 
certainly not motivated by anti-free trade reasons.
<P>
	I dealt with interference by the minister earlier. This is an 
intervention by the government by two ministers who, after having 
exhausted all alternative avenues, had to conclude there was no 
other course of action relevant than to proceed and provide the 
necessary protection for the consumer.
<P>
	The technology is inexorably moving ahead. We have reached a 
new plateau in the knowledge of how to control and reduce 
pollution emitted by motor cars. We have to move with the 
technology. We have very little alternative other than to allow the 
disconnecting of the onboard diagnostic system by the car 
manufacturer if manganese is not removed. Surely that measure 
would be reminiscent of another era when we pretended that certain 
evidence was not staring at us and we looked the other way because 
we did not like the evidence.
<P>
	We have to take the evidence into account. We would be 
seriously criticized and quite rightly so by members of the 
opposition if we were inactive on this matter. In the end this 
measure will lead to a reduction in air pollution in highly populated 
areas. The performance of the engines will be improved. There will 
be an improvement in mileage with the same consumption of fuel, 
and there will be an improvement in terms of reduced emissions.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	We all know from studies conducted by a number of esteemed 
medical doctors that there is a connection between air pollution and 
hospital admissions, particularly in connection with asthmatics. 
These have been measured in the past. They have been 
scientifically supported by way of printouts of admissions to 
various hospitals in the province of Ontario. This fact cannot be 
denied.
<P>
	It seems to me that for all these reasons we are moving on the 
right track. If we did not do that we would be in the same league as 
countries like Bulgaria, Argentina, or perhaps Taiwan. Let me see 
what other countries are still using manganese in gasoline: Russia, 
the Ukraine. I am sure that sooner or later, if their automotive 
technology will allow, they will be glad to also move away from 
the use of MMT.
<P>
	We are moving from one stage of improvement in technology to 
the next. In the 1980s we were concerned with lead. In the 1990s 
we are concerned with MMT. In another decade we will be 
concerned with some other aspect of this technology. But it is quite 
clear that as the number of vehicles on the roads increases and as 
the population increases and as the number of people who want the 
freedom of movement a car allows increases, we will have to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16384"> 16384 </A></B>
<P>
tighten up the system and find ways to  reduce the pollution that 
accompanies the operation of a car.
<P>
	In that context, this measure makes sense and fits into the 
progression. It is not the first step of this nature, because we 
already took an important step in the 1980s by removing lead from 
gasoline, and it will not be the last. There will be other measures 
following in the years to come.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Chatters (Athabasca, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
couple of questions concerning the member's presentation.
<P>
	He stated that this issue has gone on for some time. I would 
accept that. I heard the suggestion that the two sides were unable to 
reach a conclusion. I would ask him how he could realistically 
expect the two sides to ever come to any agreement after the 
minister made this statement, prior to October 1993, that she was 
prepared to ban the use of MMT. How can he realistically expect 
the Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Association to continue to 
bargain in good faith after that statement was made and it was clear 
what would happen if no agreement was achieved?
<P>
	This member in committee clearly stated that he was no expert in 
these matters. We heard evidence presented before the EPA and 
two court challenges in the U.S. that there has been significant 
failure of OBD technology in the U.S. There is just as high a failure 
rate there without MMT as there is in Canada. This evidence was 
presented by experts in the court as well as before the EPA. Even 
his own members on the committee expressed serious doubts as to 
the validity of the evidence. Why does he then as a layman accept 
unquestionably the evidence provided by MMT as to catalytic 
converter problems and all the rest of it?
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	Finally, why does the member insist that this has no implications 
on trade or that it is not a trade matter when clearly section 1209 of 
the energy chapter of the draft agreement on internal trade reached 
with the provinces states that no party shall prohibit or hinder 
access to its petroleum markets or its petroleum product markets? 
How then can this bill not affect trade?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try to answer some of his 
questions.
<P>
	The Minister of the Environment became a minister after the 
election in 1993. She made the statement after being appointed in 
October. I am not aware of any other statement she made before 
that.
<P>
	In the red book there was a commitment to sustainable 
development. There was a commitment to a number of pollution 
prevention measures. This fits perfectly within the general 
principle of pollution prevention, I submit to the hon. member.
<P>
	There was a valid question on how can the two parties come to a 
realistic agreement. They can if they are given the time. Since a 
year and a half as of last June has elapsed, one can conclude that the 
two parties are unable to arrive at a satisfactory conclusion. There 
is a point when that institution called government, to which the 
public entrusts its interests, has to move. One could argue that it 
should have been done sooner. Some people would argue that it 
should have been done at a later date. That is question of judgment 
and a question of policy.
<P>
	The other question had to do with trade and section 1209. The 
NAFTA agreement states that matters that are related to 
environmental policies would have to be taken into account before 
this particular section 1209 is invoked and put into effect. In other 
words, when Canada signed the NAFTA agreement in December 
1993 it was done with a mutual understanding, and I think 
reinforced by the Americans as well, that there would always have 
to be consideration given to modifying the agreement either in the 
field of labour or in the field of the environment. This is a classic 
example that has been invoked.
<P>
	As to the OBD systems in the U.S., I have been told that waivers 
have been provided to automotive manufacturers because of the 
complexity of the systems and not because they have failed in the 
field. This is in answer to the third question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the member for Davenport began his speech by talking about red 
herrings. I think it is appropriate, because he seems to be a master 
at this.
<P>
	The first red herring is the bill itself. At a time when our nation is 
facing a debt increasing by $100 million a day, at a time when we 
have a stalker who has killed and is taunting the police and our 
justice system needs repair, at a time when we have a gaggle of 
cabinet ministers huddling about what the meaning of national 
unity is, we are here debating Bill C-94 about manganese additives.
<P>
	The member has some of his own red herrings, like the red 
herring of comparing manganese additives to lead based additives. 
The health officials say that this additive has no bearing on health 
and that it is not a harmful emission.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	I would like to ask the member for Davenport why he would 
compare in such a way the manganese additives with lead based 
additives when the government itself has said there is no 
comparison.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not know whether I should be 
flattered or offended by being called a master of red herrings. I will 
leave it to my colleagues to judge me in that respect. Maybe I am 
more effective on that front than I ever thought.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16385"> 16385 </A></B>
<P>
	The member from Chilcotin is very kind in drawing to my 
attention that manganese has no health effects, according to health 
authorities. He is correct. We were told that in committee. But it 
is the effect on the diagnostic system on board that reduces the 
totality of the gas emissions that is the important factor. If that 
diagnostic system is not functioning properly, you have poor 
performance and more pollution. You do not want to have more 
pollution because that has an effect on health. It is in that context 
that I made that statement.
<P>
	Why compare manganese to lead? It is not a question of 
comparing it. All I am saying is there is a progression. First we 
fought the battle of removing lead in gasoline, which today 
everybody accepts, but boy was it ever controversial 10 years ago: 
the sky would fall, jobs would be lost, refineries would go out of 
business-all things we were told in 1983. Perhaps I should also 
offer the information that at that time I was environment minister 
and this was part of my task. It was pretty dramatic as to the 
consequences of removing lead in gasoline, believe me.
<P>
	In any event, it was done gradually. Today we consider that as a 
normal fact of life. There are positive effects in the health of 
children, the ones who suffer from exposure to lead when it is 
contained in gasoline. It is one of the reasons it was done.
<P>
	I am saying it is part of a progression. First it was lead, now it is 
manganese. Ten years from now perhaps it will be another 
substance, because technology is moving ahead and legislators 
have to move as well. If we do not move with technology, I submit 
to you we will lose relevance. The public will justly think that the 
political institutions are no longer performing the job they are 
supposed to do. I think that is the last thing we collectively would 
like to see happen.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to ask the hon. member for Davenport why 
we even have this bill, when MMT is proven by the Department of 
Health not to be a health hazard to Canadians and there is ample 
evidence demonstrating that MMT does not affect onboard devices 
at all. I wonder why we are trying to ban this substance.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caccia:</B> Mr. Speaker, we have discussed this a few times. 
The Department of Health is saying that there is no proof that 
manganese is damaging to health. That is how it is being put. 
Nobody has said that manganese is a healthy thing. Nobody is 
saying that manganese is good for the environment.
<P>
	Manganese, I must draw to the member's attention, is a heavy 
metal. Anyone who knows about heavy metals knows what that 
means and the importance of dealing with this substance in a 
proper manner.
<P>
	I hope I have answered the question.

	He said: Madam Speaker, I count it a real privilege to rise this 
afternoon to lend my support to the Canadian family. I can think of 
few things in our country as important as the topic I am addressing 
this afternoon. In fact, if I raise my sights just a little higher, it is 
fair to say that worldwide few topics are as unifying as people's 
desire to look after their families.
<P>
	The UN declaration that 1994 be the year of the family means 
that all of us, worldwide, need to care to preserve the family each 
and every year.
<P>
	We have just gone through a distressing period in our nation and 
there may be more difficult times ahead before we are through. 
However, if strong families make a strong nation then today, more 
than ever before, we need strong families in Canada. I am proud to 
say that strengthening the family is the purpose of Bill C-322. 
Allow me to describe how this will happen by first describing the 
role of a familiar Canadian institution, the Auditor General of 
Canada.
<P>
	As members know, Canada's auditor general does his excellent 
work by choosing perhaps a dozen government programs and 
departments every year and investigates them. He then reports any 
waste or inefficiency to Parliament. That is all he does. However, it 
seems to generate action in government. That is all the auditor 
general for the family would do too, except that it would 
investigate and report on behalf of the nuclear family in Canada.
<P>
	The auditor general for the family would be a small, inexpensive 
office set up by Parliament. The legislation restricts it to just 20 
people. By contrast, the current auditor general employs 600 
people. Even the Status of Women Canada has 93 employees.
<P>
	Many positive and important legislative changes over the years 
have been brought about by policy groups funded by the federal 
government to examine government programs as they affect that 
group. The government creates them when it perceives that a group 
is at risk in society and needs some help.
<P>
	I mentioned the Status of Women Canada a moment ago because 
the secretaries of state also perform much the same function as 
would the auditor general for the family. We have secretaries of 
state for women, for  youth, for veterans, for multiculturalism and 
science, among others. We have an auditor general for the 
environment. We have the National Council on Aging and the 
National Council on Welfare. We have advisory councils on 
forestry, on business, on libraries, on gender integration in the 
Canadian Armed Forces, on native peoples, on racial equality in 
the arts. I could go on and on.
<P>
	What is there for the family? Precious little in the way of 
recognition by governments.
<P>
	The kinds of advisory groups, or think tanks, I just mentioned 
are established when there is a broad public perception that a group 
is at risk. They have a definite policy focus and have a real effect on 
public policy.
<P>
	Let us take the last annual report for the Canadian Council on the 
Status of Women as an example. That report is now two years old 
but it contains recommendations that sound very much like the 
government's agenda today. There were recommendations on a 
stalking bill, on female genital mutilation and on child custody, all 
issues that are understandably high on the government's list of 
priorities. In other words, by bringing these to the attention of the 
government they eventually became government policy and a 
government priority. I would like to see the family take a higher 
priority too.
<P>
	If we wanted to create a group that would speak for the family, it 
begs an important question: Is the nuclear family in Canada really 
at risk? Polls reveal a broad public perception that the family is in 
trouble, but the federal government has not reacted to it. Perhaps it 
is because the Canadian family, at least in times past, has not been 
as politically correct an issue as hundreds of others that I could 
name.
<P>
	A poll done by the Angus Reid Group for the International Year 
of the Family in 1994 told us that the public perceives the family as 
a group in crisis. Sixty-three per cent of all respondents to the 
survey agreed that the family is in crisis and 40 per cent agreed 
strongly. The poll told us more. Even more Canadians, 68 per cent, 
including single parents, agreed that the traditional two-parent 
family is the best type of family in which to raise children. There is 
certainly a clear, broad public consensus in Canada on the need to 
help the family, even the so-called traditional family.
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	There might be a broad public perception of need but are there 
other more objective indicators of need to which we can point? You 
bet there are. This year the Department of Human Resources 
Development, a government department, wrote a report called ``A 
Social Outlook'' that paints a picture of the family in crisis.
<P>
	Family incomes are dropping. The poverty rate among 
two-parent families has risen from 9 per cent to 12 per  cent in the 
last two decades. Families that would prefer the option to choose 
whether parents work outside the home find that they are forced 
into the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16389"> 16389 </A></B>
<P>
workplace whether they like it or not. Those that would like to 
choose to stay at home to look after the kids find that they cannot.
<P>
	The study also shows that between 1960 and 1986 the time 
parents had to spend with their kids, that important bonding time 
with their own family, has fallen by 10 hours a week.
<P>
	Families also suffer a discriminatory tax regime in Canada. 
Often it is cheaper to live together than it is to get married. The tax 
system also discriminates against homemakers.
<P>
	A chartered accountant from New Brunswick has calculated that 
a single income family in which one parent chooses to stay at home 
will pay 36.2 per cent more in tax than a dual income family 
earning the same gross amount. The tax system clearly 
discriminates against those who choose to live in a more traditional 
arrangement, the kind of arrangement that most people in Canada, 
according to the Angus Reid poll, think is the best one to raise their 
children, especially at a young age.
<P>
	Without tax reform, at the very least, we risk losing that vital 
middle class which forms the backbone of our nation. Unfair tax 
policy harming the family is the kind of policy that the auditor 
general for the family could investigate and expose, bring into the 
light so the government could deal with it.
<P>
	There is much more evidence. A U.S.-wide study called the 
National Longitudinal Survey of Youth followed 14,000 people 
since 1979 and found that the children of single parents are almost 
three times as likely to be single moms and drop out of high school. 
They are less likely to graduate from college or university. One out 
of four babies in the States are born to single moms and this adds 
up to a cycle of continuing poverty, continuing lack of opportunity 
and obviously something that we would not hope for those families 
and those children.
<P>
	The U.S. <I>News and World Report</I> ran its cover story on the 
family in February this year. This is how its story began. I will 
quote just the opening words: ``Dad is destiny. More than virtually 
any other factor, a biological father's presence in the family will 
determine a child's success and happiness, rich or poor, white or 
black. The children of divorce and those born outside of marriage 
struggle through life at a measurable disadvantage, according to a 
growing chorus of social thinkers''.
<P>
	The article goes on to describe the various attempts in the States 
to reconnect fathers to their families. Fortunately, we are not yet as 
bad off in Canada, but the operative word there is yet. We may trail 
behind the States in our social trends, but we are on the same road.
<P>
	For instance, the Vanier Institute for the Family tells us that 
Canada's divorce rate has jumped from being one  of the lowest in 
the world in 1965 to being one of the highest in the world in 1988. 
It is about one-third higher than in Sweden and France. We are 
second only to the United States of America. The problem of 
family break-up will have and is having measurable negative 
effects on our economy, on our justice system and on government 
spending.
<P>
	If the family is under threat in Canada, then our future is also 
threatened. This bill recognizes that the family is important, that it 
is suffering, that children are suffering because families are 
suffering. Families deserve a voice, a place of priority in the House 
of Commons and in the legislation dealt with.
<P>
	You may think this bill is a fringe idea coming from a Reformer, 
Madam Speaker. I hope you do not think that, but perhaps 
somebody listening thinks such a thing. This is far from the case. 
The Canada Committee for the International Year of the Family 
was struck by the federal government to examine federal family 
policy during that year, 1994. In January 1995 it presented its 
recommendations. The Canada committee recommended the 
creation of a permanent federal secretariat for the family within the 
Government of Canada. Its mandate would almost be the same as 
that in my bill: ``To serve as a catalyst, to initiate research and 
education on the changing structure and status of the Canadian 
family and the impact of federal policies and programs on the 
Canadian family; secondly, to work as a broker to develop tools 
and resources to aid in the development of harmonized policies and 
programs which support and strengthen families; and third, to 
prepare a family impact assessment statement on all significant 
new federal laws, policies and program initiatives''.
<P>
<B>(1740)</B>
<P>
	These three functions correspond directly to the auditor general 
for the family's three main functions that I have in my bill: ``To 
examine government programs, to propose changes to them if 
necessary, and to report to Parliament on all of its deliberations''. 
This is a mainstream idea whose time has come. The government 
needs to act now to preserve, enhance and support the nuclear 
family in Canada.
<P>
	I want to answer those who might say that the focus of this bill is 
too narrow, that it touches on the nuclear family as opposed to 
another more inclusive definition of the family. I have used the 
term nuclear family in the bill to designate what is commonly 
understood as a family in Canada.
<P>
	This is in no way meant to be a pejorative statement or a 
condemnation of the numerous social arrangements which society 
accepts. There are many other acts of Parliament, for instance, that 
target particular groups for assistance and help without any 
pejorative connotation. For example, we have an act of Parliament 
granting benefits for unemployed workers, but this is not a jab at 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16390"> 16390 </A></B>
<P>
those who have jobs. It simply targets one of the many  groups in 
society with which Parliament needs to concern itself.
<P>
	It is the same for the auditor general for the family. Society 
accepts many diverse living arrangements, as it should, but those 
arrangements are simply not the focus of this particular bill. The 
bill merely recognizes the importance of one needy group in our 
society, the nuclear family, and it attempts to enhance its 
well-being.
<P>
	I have chosen the definition for the family found in the 
<I>Dictionary of Canadian Law</I>. It states: ``The family includes a man 
and a woman living together as husband and wife, whether or not 
married, in a permanent relationship, or the survivor of either, and 
includes the children of both or either, natural or adopted, and any 
person lawfully related to any of the aforementioned persons''.
<P>
	This is similar to the definition used by other dictionaries and 
also the federal government and the governments of all 10 
provinces. I realize that it is never a perfect definition but we do 
have to try to do something and certainly this is the standard 
definition found in the dictionary.
<P>
	Finally, the nuclear family is hardly a narrow or isolated group. 
In the enormous study done by Murdock some years ago in which 
he studied 250 societies around the world, he found that ``the 
nuclear family is a universal human social grouping. It exists as a 
distinct and strongly functional group in every known society''.
<P>
	Does this mean that all government programs must be focused 
only on the family or only on married folk or only on their 
children? Of course not. This bill merely recognizes the importance 
of the family in our society and it attempts to enhance its 
well-being.
<P>
	I was reminded of the centrality of the family in Canada when I 
attended a wedding just a few weeks ago. The bride was beautiful. 
The husband to be was very nervous. He was determined to go 
through with his decision and his promise to stick to his wife for 
life. The father of the bride was pretty close to tears giving away 
his little girl, but he was also pretty close to shedding a few tears of 
joy as well. I should know because the father was myself and 
Karina is and always will be my not so little girl anymore.
<P>
	Even though there were a couple of hundred people there, there 
was something very private, something very personal about that 
ceremony, and that was the transmission of values from me to my 
child, from the parents of the groom to him and the fusion of those 
values into what was really a new family. We watched the creation 
in a sense of another new family unit.
<P>
	It is almost like running a race in which one runner passes the 
torch on to the next one and together each runner helps run the race 
for the whole team. If the torch is dropped, the race can still be 
finished but it is not the same. In fact, the race cannot be won.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	The torch in this analogy is the invaluable inheritance of secure, 
committed families. The race is the life of every Canadian. 
Canadian families are too often too easily dropping the torch 
during the race. As a result, individuals within families are 
suffering and the whole country is suffering because our families 
are suffering.
<P>
	In Canada 13 per cent of all families are single parent families. 
That is one million families. Nearly 30 per cent of all Canadian 
marriages end in divorce. Even if we lay aside the arguments for 
the family that are based on the emotional hardships suffered by 
broken families, we can point to strong economic arguments of 
why we want to promote and encourage the family.
<P>
	Surely it is in the interests of all political parties, our 
government, our nation, to find ways to promote the family unit, 
where a loving, committed husband and wife nurture healthy, 
happy children. Within that unit they pass on the values of 
commitment and faithfulness and stability and responsibility to 
their own children, who will in turn carry the torch in their 
generation and will pass it on to the next.
<P>
	Families are the root of a prosperous and peaceful nation. If 
Parliament is to cultivate the ground from which strong families 
grow, it must now begin to study the social environment for the 
family and begin to change its policies to provide a more 
favourable environment for families.
<P>
	If the government for whatever reason finds that this auditor 
general for the family is unacceptable, that this idea just does not 
carry the day, I appeal to government members to create their own 
body that would perform a similar function. Listen perhaps to the 
recommendations of the commission which asked for a permanent 
secretariat on behalf of the family, but find some ways to 
encourage and enhance that important institution.
<P>
	The family in Canada is in crisis. The time to act on its behalf is 
now. I hope all members will lend their support to the principle of 
an auditor general for the family.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, if there is one thing we have in common as members of 
this House, it is our shared belief in the value of family life and the 
central role the family unit has within our society. Families are at 
the very core of our social fabric.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is why I congratulate my hon. colleague across the way for 
introducing this bill for the creation of an auditor general for the 
family.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member. By bringing the bill forward he 
provides those of us on this side with an opportunity to comment 
constructively on this area of  social policy. It also allows us to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16391"> 16391 </A></B>
<P>
review the many ways this government is already working to 
support individual Canadians in the pursuit of their social and 
economic objectives, including in meeting the commitments to 
their families.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Right at the start, I must express my disagreement with the 
importance attached to the nuclear family in Bill C-322. This term 
seems to define what constitutes today's Canadian family in too 
narrow terms.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It may be that a generation or two ago the traditional family 
structure was that of a male breadwinner and a stay at home mother 
who looked after the house and their children and all lived under 
the same roof. That may have represented a typical Canadian 
family but that situation has changed dramatically.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The nuclear family is no longer the dominant model in Canadian 
society. Now we have many different models: single parent 
families, blended families, extended families and so on.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The two parent with children household now comprises less than 
half the families in Canada. Our lifestyles have changed over the 
years since the nuclear family defined society and the direction of 
our social policy and any related legislation must reflect those 
changes.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is our duty as legislators to base ourselves on today's realities 
and not yesterday's ideals. Deciding a certain model merits our 
attention more than another is tantamount to thumbing our noses at 
all those Canadians whose family structure does not fit within the 
model of the typical nuclear family.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having said that, I want to emphasize that our government is not 
against the nuclear family. We agree with the preamble of the bill 
which says that the nuclear family is one of the foundations of 
Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	It is true that the nuclear family is one of the foundations of our 
society, but it is our opinion that the foundation of society is the 
family unit, and family units may take different forms. We agree 
that the nuclear family constitutes an important element in 
Canadian society, but we contest the fact that it is the only family 
structure that counts.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	To this government all Canadians are important, whether they 
are members of a nuclear family or not.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Finally, as we have stated in the red book, the Liberal 
government's policy is to aim at greater equality of social 
conditions for all Canadians. We wish to broaden the outlook, not it 
narrower.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As hon. members know, it is the Liberal Party which has been 
responsible for the major social policy initiatives of this country 
over the years. It is Liberal governments, including this 
government, which have confirmed time and time again our belief 
in the value of the family as the basic unit of society. We have 
signalled the commitment through many of our programs in 
support of family members.
<P>
	This is an important concept. Whereas my hon. colleagues 
opposite would single out members of only one type of family unit 
for attention, our government believes in looking at the needs of all 
Canadians and all types of family structures and in doing that, 
looking within a broad economic and social context and not within 
a narrowly cast definition of family.
<P>
	It is our belief that if we want to assist Canadians to meet their 
family obligations, we must look at the overall environment within 
which people live and work. We must look at and respond to needs 
within the social, economic, technological and cultural 
environments in which individual Canadians as family members 
find themselves.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We do not feel that we must evaluate Canadians, or the effect of 
federal programs and institutions, in terms of the needs of this or 
that family model. If our goal is to improve the quality of life of all 
Canadians, we shall improve the quality of life of the members of 
all Canadian families.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Thus, we have programs designed to provide income assistance 
to families with children. That means all families with children are 
eligible, not just one kind of family. Income assistance to families 
with children is one of the oldest parts of Canada's social security 
system, dating back to 1918.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the most important elements is the child tax benefit, a 
non taxable income-related benefit for those with children under 
the age of eighteen years. It comprises a basic benefit, a 
supplemental benefit for children under the age of seven years, and 
a work income supplement.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16392"> 16392 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	One of the best ways we can help Canadian families is to 
enhance the ability of individual Canadians to find a job and keep 
that job. This is a central objective of our economic and social 
policy.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The objective is to help not only those Canadians who are part of 
one type of family or another, but all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	Very often, helping a Canadian to find and keep a job also means 
helping him or her balance work and family responsibilities. In 
today's world, increasing numbers of Canadians have to strike a 
balance between responsibilities toward their employers and 
family responsibilities. This is also a reflection of the changing 
structure of the Canadian family.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	For example, over the past few decades an increasing percentage 
of women have remained in or re-entered the workforce while 
raising young children. At the same time there have been 
increasing demands for support for older relatives and friends 
leading to the creation of the so-called sandwich generation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Under these circumstances, a good child care system becomes a 
vital necessity, and the possibility of assistance may have a 
considerable impact on the family.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Nuclear family or not, many Canadians are feeling these 
pressures. Governments need to be responsive to these 
developments in the workplace and their impact on families as 
well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	One of the ways our government is responding to those needs is 
the ``child care visions'' research and development program 
announced earlier this year by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The child care visions program will lead to a better 
understanding of emerging child care issues as well as increased 
knowledge about the needs of Canadian families. One of the 
objectives of this program is to encourage greater involvement by 
all sectors of society in meeting child care needs.
<P>
	Once again, we view these issues in the broad context of 
economic and social policy needs and not in the narrower context 
of a family definition. There are other programs in place and under 
development to support workers to meet their family 
responsibilities.
<P>
	In the very near future, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development will be meeting with his provincial counterparts to 
discuss the best possible ways to take care of our children. This will 
be a very important initiative for this government to help the 
family.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak to the bill standing in the name 
of the hon. member for Fraser Valley East and entitled, an act 
respecting the office of the Auditor General for the Family. The 
hon. member made an excellent presentation and explained very 
clearly his reasons for proposing this legislation.
<P>
	The purpose of this bill, after a preamble that stresses the 
importance of the nuclear family and states that Canada should 
encourage, support and protect it, is basically to appoint an Auditor 
General for the Family who would examine federal policies and 
make recommendations to ensure that the federal government 
encourages the development of the nuclear family.
<P>
	The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development made it very clear that this bill is well 
intentioned. No one in this House wants to diminish the role of the 
family in our society, and everyone wants children to have a family 
in which they can develop their potential. The bill would, however, 
create a number of problems.
<P>
	First, there is the definition of family. The bill refers to the 
nuclear family, the traditional family that is still very important. 
This is the family where there is a father, mother and children. 
However, for the past 20 or 30 years at least, we have seen changes 
in the family structure in Canada and Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	We see families with only a father, or only a mother. We see 
families made up of individuals who previously belonged to other 
families. If we adopt the bill as presented by the hon. member for 
Fraser Valley East, this would mean ignoring a number of families 
that play just as important a role in bringing up their children as the 
nuclear family. These families would, to a certain extent, be 
discriminated against or overlooked.
<P>
	My colleague, the member for Fraser Valley East, said this 
would not preclude steps being taken to foster the development of 
other kinds of families, but the fact remains that if we take the 
trouble to appoint an Auditor General for the Family who will be 
dedicated to the well-being of nuclear families, as it says in the bill, 
we are excluding a certain number of families. As many as 20 per 
cent of the families in this country do not correspond to the 
description of a nuclear family.
<P>
	Yet it is in these families that children are often likely to need 
special programs. Not because their families are less competent 
than other families, but because the  responsibilities of a single 
father or a single mother are tremendous. I think there is a case here 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16393"> 16393 </A></B>
<P>
for government support. We see no indication in the bill of how 
these families would be helped by adopting this legislation.
<P>
	The real problem, and the hon. member made this very clear, is 
the children. We want children to develop in a satisfactory family 
environment. I think that a satisfactory family environment, at least 
for many people like me, in the Bloc Quebecois, is first of all an 
environment in which there are sufficient resources to provide for 
the children's development, to clothe them, feed them and educate 
them. That is the kind of family environment in which a child has a 
chance to develop its potential.
<P>
	I think that any steps we would want the Canadian government to 
take should be based on fighting poverty and maintaining social 
programs, if we want to support children who live in a family 
environment. It is vital to be clear on the problem: child poverty 
and family poverty cause young people to have health, social 
development and education problems. Therefore, I do not think the 
bill before us, despite the hon. member's good intentions, will 
contribute to improving the quality of children's lives in Canadian 
families.
<P>
	Another problem I notice in reading the bill-and I apologize, 
Madam Speaker, perhaps many members in this House have heard 
this argument, these remarks, too often for their liking-but are 
again looking at a jurisdictional conflict between the provincial and 
federal governments.
<P>
	In my opinion and in the opinion of many of the Bloc members, 
matters to do with family, marriage and families' private lives are 
more matters of provincial jurisdiction. So, once again, there 
would be a degree of conflict between an organization, an office of 
the auditor general, at the federal level and provincial institutions. 
Some provinces have family secretariats.
<P>
	So again, we have not progressed from the stage where the 
federal and provincial governments often take contradictory or 
parallel measures, to the detriment of families and children needing 
care and support.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Even my colleague from the government said in his speech that 
daycare services should be set up. This would perhaps be more 
important at that point for the well-being of children living in a 
family setting. Daycare services, however, come under provincial 
jurisdiction. So we face the same dilemma, we are in stuck in this 
situation. I think there comes a time to put a stop to it.
<P>
	Finally, and my colleague for Fraser Valley East mentioned it as 
well, there is the matter of taxation, a problem that can be 
detrimental to family life. Every year, in Quebec, as in Canada, 
there are reports and studies which tend to demonstrate that people 
with  families are disadvantaged from the taxation point of view.
<P>
	This leads us to again bring up the question of tax reform in 
Canada. Every year we hear the Minister of Finance, people from 
the health department and human resources development, 
government members saying that, yes, we will have to address the 
taxation issue in order to help families and to ensure greater equity, 
greater fiscal justice, in Canada. Good intentions still and again, 
but we have seen nothing concrete in the two years that we in the 
Bloc have been here.
<P>
	We will vote against a measure such as this. The first reason, as I 
said at the start, is that it is aimed at the nuclear family and we 
believe, in light of recent changes-in the past ten, fifteen, twenty 
years in Canada we have seen major changes-we must not give 
preference to the nuclear family, despite all of its merits over the 
centuries, which it continues to have.
<P>
	Second, this is an area where overlap with provincial 
jurisdictions is such that, in the long run, it would only fuel further 
argumentation and might cancel out certain pro-family clauses in 
provincial legislation.
<P>
	Let me state once again that I am very much aware of the good 
intentions of the hon. member for Fraser Valley East. However, for 
the reasons I have just set out in my address, I personally, and the 
members of the Bloc Quebecois, will oppose such a measure.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Roseanne Skoke (Central Nova, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is a privilege to rise today in the House in support of private 
member's Bill C-322, an act respecting the auditor general for the 
family.
<P>
	The bill would establish the position of the auditor general for 
the family, tasked with identifying and examining federal 
programs, exposing programs and policies detrimental to the 
well-being of the nuclear family in Canada, and recommending 
changes through an annual report to Parliament. The office would 
be analogous to the auditor general's office, serving the same 
function on behalf of the nuclear family in Canada. Unfortunately, 
this bill is non-votable.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for Fraser Valley East for taking 
the initiative to advance this private member's bill in defence of the 
rights of the traditional family.
<P>
	On many occasions I have spoken both in the House and in 
public forums across the nation in defence of the rights of the 
traditional family. Unfortunately, it is not enough to just speak 
about family, family life, and family values issues. It is time the 
House gave formal recognition to the rights of the traditional 
family.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16394"> 16394 </A></B>
<P>
	The family unit is the basic institution in life and the solid 
foundation upon which our forefathers have built this great nation. 
The protection of families, family life,  and family values must be a 
priority with the government.
<P>
	The conventional terms of debate in matters of political, social, 
economic, and legal issues tend to focus on individual rights and 
the rights of the state and not the rights of the family. This is 
unfortunate and must change, for the family is the most important 
reality in our lives.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	The rights of the family are being seriously undermined and 
eroded. Families have inherent rights. Families have inviolable 
rights. Families existed before the church. Families existed before 
the state.
<P>
	Parliament has no jurisdiction to redefine traditional family or to 
enter into the realm of sanctity of marriage or sanctity of life. It is 
important to be reminded that family is the basic institution of life. 
Life begins from the moment of conception and continues until 
natural death. The inherent and inviolable rights of family must be 
protected, defended and safeguarded by Parliament.
<P>
	Bill C-322 is offering the government a mechanism to identify, 
examine, expose, and amend policies and legislation that encroach 
on the rights of the traditional family.
<P>
	Parents are the primary educators of their children and are solely 
and fundamentally responsible for the emotional, psychological, 
physical, social, spiritual and moral development of their children. 
It is time the government funded the family and stopped funding 
agendas designed to undermine and destroy traditional family 
values.
<P>
	For the government to promote and encourage institutionalized 
child care by providing tax benefits is both inequitable and unjust. 
It is removing the economic freedom and flexibility of families to 
make a conscious choice of what is in the best interest of their 
children and their family by imposing an economic hardship on 
single income families.
<P>
	The traditional two-parent family is under relentless attack from 
special interest groups and others who regard the traditional family 
as an impediment to their goals. For example, the feminist agenda 
requires careful scrutiny, as the continuous quest to conquer the 
alleged male oppression of women has placed pressure on society 
to move the focus from family rights to individual rights and rights 
of special interest groups. The advancement of the feminist agenda 
in government policies has advanced an ideology predicated upon 
equality of women that is more concerned with achieving formal 
equity and has forsaken substantive equity. By doing so, the 
feminist movement has done a great disservice to women, 
motherhood, to our children, and to the traditional family.
<P>
	The Canadian position advanced at the Beijing conference 
appeared to be advancing and protecting the equality of women. 
However, the Canadian position that was advanced called for 
gender, not the family, to be the most important criterion for 
determining government policies.
<P>
	It is the feminist position that family is the initiator and cause of 
the inequity between men and women, together with their failure to 
recognize the importance of the role of women and motherhood 
within the traditional family unit. It is against this relentless attack 
upon the traditional family that government must protect and 
safeguard.
<P>
	In conclusion, the family is the basic institution of life and the 
solid foundation upon which our forefathers built this great nation. 
The protection of family, family life, and family values must be a 
priority with the government.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to speak to Bill C-322, an act respecting the 
office of the auditor general for the family, developed and 
sponsored by my colleague from Fraser Valley East.
<P>
	The Reform Party has long recognized the importance and value 
of the Canadian family through our policies and actions, such as we 
see here today in Bill C-322. As my colleague earlier so well 
stated, few topics are as important to this nation at this time.
<P>
	This bill seeks to establish the office of the auditor general for 
the family. The mandate of the auditor general is based on the 
premise of evaluating and assessing the impact, performance, and 
effectiveness of government policy, programs and administration.
<P>
	Clause 4 of this bill outlines this proposed auditor general's 
duties. The auditor general for the family shall examine federal 
programs and institutions to determine their impact on the nuclear 
family in Canada; expose programs and policies that are 
detrimental to the well-being of the nuclear family; and 
recommend through his annual report to Parliament changes to 
federal government programs and policies that would enhance the 
well-being of the Canadian nuclear family.
<P>
<B>(1815 )</B>
<P>
	Like the Auditor General of Canada, the auditor general of the 
family would be an official officer of Parliament and would report 
to the House on an annual basis. The auditor general of the family 
would also be empowered to make special reports to Parliament on 
``any matter of pressing importance or urgency'' as outlined in 
clause 5 of the bill.
<P>
	As I alluded to in my opening remarks, the family is the most 
fundamental institution in society. The family nurtures its members 
and provides for the security and needs of its members. The family 
provides for the  transfer and protection of our values, our heritage 
and our culture. The family provides the stability and the prosperity 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="16395"> 16395 </A></B>
<P>
of society. It is most appropriate to think in terms of an auditor 
general in assessing the well-being of Canadian families.
<P>
	Over the past decade the Canadian family has been under 
increasing social, political and economic pressures. These 
pressures originate from many facets of government policy 
direction. For example, the mismanagement of our nation's 
finances has created tremendous pressure both on the earning 
power and even the job availability of Canadians and their families.
<P>
	The average family income in 1984 was $43,204. In 1993 it was 
$43,225. After tax income has actually fallen 6.5 per cent from 
1989 to today. The tax bite out of money earned is over 30 cents on 
the dollar. The facts indicate that it requires almost double the paid 
working hours to support a family as it did 20 years ago. Translated 
into action that means two income earners in a family as opposed to 
one simply to survive.
<P>
	Sixty-two per cent of mothers with children below the age of 
three are now in the workforce compared to thirty-nine per cent in 
1981. Economic pressures can be devastating to family stability.
<P>
	A recent study has found that two-thirds of parents presently 
experience moderate to severe levels of tension in balancing work 
and family commitments. According to a recent study teen suicide 
rates for young men has quadrupled since 1960. According to 
UNICEF in 1995 we now have one of the highest rates of teen 
suicide in the world after New Zealand and Finland.
<P>
	Violent youth crime has been shown to have doubled since 1986. 
Meanwhile our divorce rates have risen tenfold to where Canada is 
second only to the United States with one divorce for every 2.4 
marriages. Statistics such as these reveal what can only be 
described as a social revolution taking place in the heart of our 
homes. We as legislators in the House must do what we can to 
strengthen and improve the condition of Canadian families.
<P>
	What concrete measures has the government taken to improve 
the state of families in Canada? Where are the legislation, the tax 
relief, constructive and effective programs? Where is the sincere 
commitment or are mere platitudes enough?
<P>
	The Liberal government has been tragically absent and worse yet 
in some cases culpable in this crisis. Citing facts as we heard a few 
minutes ago that less than half of Canadian families are dual parent 
with children is grossly misleading, or saying that we must face 
reality and do nothing about ailing families.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> Why is it misleading? Finish the clause. Why is it 
misleading?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> To answer my colleague's question, two-parent 
families with children now compose approximately 80 per cent of 
families in Canada. That will answer my colleague's question.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Clancy:</B> According to whose statistics?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Hayes:</B> I ask my Liberal colleagues if they walk into a 
village that has been ravaged by some disease whether they would 
simply walk away from those who are suffering while muttering 
something like reality must be faced.
<P>
	I shall highlight two specific and current examples of some 
issues that the auditor general of the family could examine.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	I recently attended the world conference in Beijing. I was there 
to ensure that the views of the family and of family life were 
represented within the Canadian delegation and the conference 
itself. At the conference our government committed to the Beijing 
platform for action which requires that the government implement 
over 500 actions in the next five years. Although the conference 
was supposedly about women, the document introduced barely 
mentions family and when it does it is often depicted as a place of 
oppression and violence.
<P>
	One of the actions discussed deals with children's rights. The 
document elevates children's rights above those of parents, 
including unrestricted access to ``reproductive health services and 
education'' and confers upon our children so-called sexual rights. 
Parental prerogatives and authority are replaced routinely with 
government and bureaucratic intrusion. The document ignores the 
value of family relationships, seeking to use words such as 
caretaker or girl child in place of beautiful words like mother and 
daughter.
<P>
	This platform for action has not been tabled in the House. It has 
not been debated and it has not been examined by members of the 
House. In short, it has simply not received the scrutiny that it 
deserves. It is a Liberal government endorsed product without any 
reference to the Canadian people that will have and has a profound 
effect and impact on the Canadian family in society.
<P>
	A second example is also related to the Beijing conference. 
Before the conference started the Secretary of State for the Status 
of Women publicly released a document entitled ``Setting the stage 
for the next century, the federal plan for gender equality''. The plan 
was released as the government's position on the objective of the 
conference while it simultaneously instituted gender equality and 
gender based analysis throughout the 24 departments and agencies 
of the government. I quote the plan from page 17:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>

<B><A NAME="16396"> 16396 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A gender based approach ensures the development, analysis and 
implementation of legislation and policies with an appreciation of gender 
differences.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It makes gender, not family, a priority in all policy development 
and seeks to deconstruct ``stereotypical roles'' and replace them 
with a social revolution that shakes the very foundation of the 
traditional family. In dismantling barriers that supposedly impede 
the progress and equality of women, it denies the value of women 
and families anywhere outside the workplace.
<P>
	The plan and its implementation would have far reaching 
consequences for families and society. That is what the minister 
intended when she wrote that ``every aspect of our lives is being 
reshaped'' by the plan. It is sad but true.
<P>
	If there were an auditor general of the family he would be able to 
assess the impact of programs like the platform for action, report 
his or her findings to the House, make recommendations to the 
government and the House, and raise the profile of these issues. 
This Reform bill would do much toward attaining that goal in terms 
of providing information about the family and introducing greater 
accountability to the system.
<P>
	Reports on the family would generate interest in family issues. 
They would cultivate a culture of respect for the Canadian family 
that is sorely lacking in federal legislation and throughout the 
federal government.
<P>
	These are basic, fundamental and significant accountability 
measures that I believe will expose an anti-family agenda endorsed 
by the Liberal government. An auditor general would strengthen 
and improve the condition of the Canadian family.
<P>
	Let me conclude by stating that Bill C-322 will do much to 
establish a family first philosophy that will establish a culture of 
recognition and respect for the Canadian family within government 
and here in Ottawa.
<P>
	Moreover, by establishing an auditor general of the family it will 
do much to ensure that family friendly policies are developed and 
implemented. Current policies and programs would be examined 
from the perspective of benefit or harm to the family and not for 
special interest groups.
<P>
	It is with these considerations that I urge the House to support 
the bill developed wisely by my colleague from Fraser Valley East.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak however briefly on the bill which I do not support.
<P>
	I am a feminist. I am a very proud feminist. I am very proud of 
the government's record, particularly at the recent Beijing 
conference, particularly on supporting the plan of action, and most 
particularly on the matters mentioned by my hon. colleague with 
respect to setting the stage for Beijing and gender analysis, a policy 
which is long overdue.
<P>
	I do not say that just to be combative. I do not say it just to 
disagree with my hon. colleague over there, or indeed with my hon. 
colleague from Central Nova. I say it because I think there is a deep 
misunderstanding in certain segments of society.
<P>
	Before I became a feminist and before I became a 
parliamentarian I was a woman, a daughter and a granddaughter. I 
am still all those things. I come from an amazingly wonderful 
family. I was brought up by a single parent. My father died at the 
age of 39, leaving mother with heavy burdens because there was no 
medicare. My mother educated herself and she educated me. She 
brought me up to believe in tolerance and equality for all. She also 
brought me up within the context of a larger extended family, those 
aforementioned grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins to the third 
and fourth degree. It was a typical Nova Scotia and Cape Breton 
family.
<P>
	On behalf of feminists across the country I resent the insinuation 
that we are not family oriented. Because we believe in gender 
equality, because we believe in freedom from fear and freedom 
from violence, because we believe in pay equity and employment 
equity, because we believe women hold up half the sky, I resent the 
theory that we should be told we are anti-family. We are not 
anti-family. We are the people who hold the flame every bit as 
much as my hon. colleague across the floor or my hon. colleague 
from Central Nova.
<P>
	On this side of the House there are mothers, grandmothers, 
married women, single women and divorced women who have 
children of their own or who are loving godparents, aunts or 
whatever to many children. We care and we care deeply. No one 
has the right to equate feminism with an anti-family stand. No one 
has the right to question the way we feel about our families.
<P>
	I love my family as much as I love my country and the two are 
interchangeable. It is shameful for anyone to suggest otherwise.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I take the few 
remaining moments in this private member's debate to say that I 
am very proud to be part of a political party, an organization which 
stands unashamedly for the family.
<P>
	As the hon. member opposite just said, family is very important. 
There is no doubt in anyone's mind in the event a father is taken 
away by death or even by divorce that there are many additional 
hardships on the mother who is left to raise the family as a single 
parent. I cannot help but say that we are not in any way desirous of 
adding any more hardships to the person who already has so many.
<P>
	I presume I will have more time when this debate resumes.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="16397"> 16397 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired. 
Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 6.30 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow at 
10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.30 p.m.)
