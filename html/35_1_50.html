Madam Speaker, on a point of order. We were supposed to have a

	<B>An hon. member:</B> You were not there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> We are now.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> When I called the 
debate, not a single member rose to take the floor, and in that 
case, the question is put. Members who wish to speak in debate 
must be in the House and rise in their seat.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Alfonso Gagliano (Saint-Léonard):</B> Madam Speaker, if 
I am not mistaken, I believe you gave everyone plenty of time. 
Personally, I said ``question'' more than five times. You looked 
around the House. You even asked members whether they 
wanted to speak. When no one rose, you rose yourself to put the 
question. Everyone was given plenty of time. I am sorry. We 
were prepared to have a debate, but now the question has been 
put. That is how it is.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> A motion has been 
moved to defer the taking of the division until 6.30 p.m. next

saying ``<I>débat</I>'', because we do want to speak on this bill. I do 
not understand-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I would point out to the 
hon. member that when the Chair calls for the debate to begin, a 
member must rise in his place. No member did in fact rise when I 
called for debate.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> On a point of order, 
Madam Speaker. I would like to support the comments on the 
point of order made by my other colleagues on this side of the 
House. Our members also were here prepared to debate. We did 
not hear the Chair indicate that this was an appropriate time to 
begin the debate. We believe this debate should go forward this 
morning as we have clearly indicated we are prepared to do. We 
have submitted speakers to the Chair. It was obvious that we 
were ready to go ahead and we think that the process should have 
allowed us to hear and realize that this was the time to do that.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> In response to the point 
of order by the hon. member for Calgary North, I called the 
debate, I named one of the ridings on the member's list 
effectively. That member was not in his place and did not rise. 
The question was called for and once I have called the question it 
is too late to go back to debate unless we have unanimous 
consent of the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, on a 
point of order. It has always been my impression that the goal of 
this House is to allow members to speak on issues put before 
Parliament by the government. In this particular instance, I 
would point out that in order for the debate to flow smoothly, 
insofar as the translation in both official languages is concerned, 
the Chair must co-operate with members and show considerable 
understanding, and vice-versa.
<P>
	As far as this particular debate is concerned, members were 
prepared to speak. That includes members of our party and of the 
other party as well. My colleagues indicated to me that they 
were somewhat unclear on the approach taken to this debate. 
They did not understand exactly at what point in the proceedings 
the Chair was and they wonder if perhaps the Chair could not 
have been a little more tolerant toward the members who wanted 
to speak on this subject, in particular the member for 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, even though apparently they had 
missed their opportunity to do so.
<P>
	I think one thing should be made clear. We need your 
co-operation to ensure that the proceedings flow smoothly, as 
the government needs ours. The smooth running of Parliament 
depends on this mutual trust. Tricks should not be played on 
members and the Chair should not move hastily to ask if 
someone wishes to speak and when no member rises 
immediately, move on to something else. We know that the 
Standing Orders require that we ask for the floor. We have an 
agreement which works very well for Question Period. Members 
do not have to clamour to be recognized. The Speaker proceeds 
in a specific order. Some customs in this House cannot be 
overlooked. If my colleagues were to understand from your 
decision that they must now rise and shout in order to be 
recognized, then the complexion of this House could change 
rather dramatically.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I respectfully ask that you reconsider your 
decision and allow our colleagues to speak. Our goal is not to 
muzzle members, but to give them an opportunity to speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Madam Speaker, 
there is obviously a problem here this morning but, in my 
opinion, the problem is not on the government side.
<P>
	When the House met, you called for debate on the question 
before the House, on this bill at second reading, twice. Yes, you 
called for debate twice and you even called on a member who 
was not in the House to start the debate. The member was not 
here. Only two Bloc members were here in the House. And I am 
sure that these two members could not have participated in the 
debate because the member for Richmond-Wolfe has already 
delivered his speech on this bill; he cannot make another one.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> I was here. I rise on a point 
of order, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> No. I am on a point of order. Wait for your turn.
<P>
	May I refer all members and you, Madam Speaker, to 
Standing Order 17:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every Member desiring to speak is to rise in his or her place, uncovered, and 
address the Speaker.</BLOCKQUOTE>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is vital that members rise. No one rose to debate. We sat 
here and called for the question and finally after a lengthy 
delay-I submit a more than adequate delay-Your Honour put 
the question to the House. The question was put, the votes were 
called for, and then members realized after the vote had been 
called for that there was a problem because they wanted to 
debate.
<P>
	There is a third reading on this bill. Members will have ample 
opportunity to debate the bill at third reading. We have had three 
days on the bill already. I do not understand why there is an 
objection now, after the vote  has been taken, when none of them 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3087"> 3087 </A></B>
<P>
was here ready to debate when the order was called at ten 
o'clock.
<P>
	It is not the responsibility of the government to do more than 
make the opportunity available. It was available. The members 
failed to show up and now they are complaining about it. Madam 
Speaker, you cannot be responsible for their tardiness.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Richmond-Wolfe has risen. Does he want to speak to the same 
point of order?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Yes, Madam 
Speaker. First, I would like to set the record straight. I was in 
this House and I did not speak in this debate.
<P>
	Second, I think you were aware, as you were given the names 
of the speakers in this debate, that we were going to rise. Reform 
members had also given notice that they would rise.
<P>
	I do not intend to continue and stir up a dispute. What you 
must realize, regarding our mutual co-operation in this debate, 
is that we in the Bloc did not quite understand the meaning of 
your announcement. This is why we are asking you to exercise 
your authority and your good judgment. We misinterpreted your 
remarks.
<P>
	So if in the future we in the Bloc must alter our relationship 
regarding this co-operation, you must tell us clearly that 
sometimes you cannot make use of your good judgment to allow 
the debate to go on. And I think the party in power should 
consider that what is important in this part of House proceedings 
is to allow members to speak to get through the whole process in 
a democratic fashion. That is basically why we make speeches. 
It is a matter of democracy.
<P>
	And if the party in power wants to muzzle us this morning, 
knowing full well that we had members ready to speak, Madam 
Speaker, I call on your good judgment and ask you for a ruling.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hon. member for 
Charlevoix on the same point of order.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, with all 
due respect I think that the authority over this House rests with 
the person occupying the Chair; you are vested with that 
authority.
<P>
	Earlier, at the opening of the sitting, to make the Chair's job 
easier, I tabled on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois the complete list 
of our members who wished to speak. Two of my colleagues 
from the Bloc Quebecois had taken their seats when I handed in 
my list at the Clerk's table. At the same time, you asked: ``Are 
there hon. members who wish to ask questions?'' At that precise 
moment, I was at the Clerk's table dropping off my list in 
duplicate, with one copy for the Clerk and one for the Chair, to 
help identify those members who were to speak.
<P>
	When you called a member from the Reform Party to speak, if 
he was not here at the time, you should have called the next 
speaker, namely Gérard Asselin, member for Charlevoix, the 
first name on that list. I was right here, at the Clerk's table.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Fernand Robichaud (Secretary of State 
(Parliamentary Affairs)): </B>Madam Speaker, I could not agree 
more with the hon. member for Roberval when he says that 
co-operation from all hon. members in all parties and from the 
Chair is essential to the proper operation of this House. But I 
would like to add that the same kind of co-operation must be 
shown by members in debate, when we have to rise to indicate to 
the Chair our desire to speak.
<P>
	That did not happen, and seeing that no one was rising in his or 
her place, you simply put the question, which was perfectly in 
order. Madam Speaker, for the sake of preserving the good will 
prevailing in this House, we would be prepared, on this side, to 
consent to revert to debate and give these people the chance to 
speak. We are prepared to do this to accommodate you as well as 
the hon. members opposite.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I just want to remind 
hon. members of this House that the orders of the day had been 
called and that I had called for debate. Not one single member 
rose in his or her place, as required for debate. Furthermore, the 
government side asked for the question to be put. As no hon. 
member indicated a desire to speak, I then put the question.
<P>
	I would have a question for the government whip. Could the 
unanimous consent of the House be sought to revert to debate?
<P>
	The hon. member for Roberval has the floor, on a point of 
order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Madam Speaker, I understood the 
Secretary of State to say that he allowed the debate to resume. 
So, quite simply, that means the government no longer objects.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Order! I am sorry to 
interrupt the hon. member, but his microphone is not on. The 
whip's mike was not on.
<P>
	So let us go back. Is there unanimous consent of the House to 
revert to the debate on Bill C-17?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Madam Speaker, we will give unanimous 
consent to the proposition on the understanding that the question 
will be put on the motions by the conclusion of the time allotted 
for government orders this day.

<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> I would have a question for you, 
Madam Speaker.
<P>
	We are satisfied with the decision just rendered and the 
agreement just made in this House. Nevertheless, for our future 
guidance, I gather from your decision that the indicative lists of 
speakers that we provide you are no longer useful and are 
worthless. We have always been opposed to providing the Chair 
with a list of members who should speak in the question period 
during debate.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	I must conclude from your decision that these lists are no 
longer useful in our work and that members will have to ask for 
the floor as the debate proceeds. That is how I understand your 
decision. I would like you to enlighten me on that, because we 
will not make a list just for the fun of it. We will proceed 
differently in future.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The lists are still very 
useful, but they are to be seen only as a guide. Members must 
rise in their place to be recognized.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I 
would like to clarify events. We too are happy that the debate 
can go forward as it ought to so that everyone can be heard on the 
matter. However, when one of our members was recognized who 
was not present-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry to interrupt 
the hon. member. We have responded many times that you are 
just as essential but it is more essential that the member called 
be seated in his or her seat.
<P>
	We have resolved the question and I resume debate with the 
hon. member for Charlevoix.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1994">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 
1994, be read the second time and referred to a committee; and 
of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate this morning in the debate at second 
reading of Bill C-17, which deals with the budget.
<P>
	Let me give a little background on Canada's budget, debt and 
deficit. In 1980-when the Liberals were in office-a debt was 
generated, as well as a deficit which set the first record. Four 
years later, in 1984, the debt had climbed to $187 billion with 
Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau in charge, and the current 
Prime Minister, Mr. Chrétien, as his Minister of Finance.
<P>
	From 1980 to 1984, 74 of the 75 members representing 
Quebec in this House were Liberals. There was only one 
Conservative MP in the province, namely Roch LaSalle from 
Joliette. What did the Liberal members representing Quebec do 
in this House? Were they muzzled by MPs from English 
Canada?
<P>
	The debt of $187 billion which the Conservatives inherited 
from the Liberals in 1984 had grown to $500 billion by 1993. In 
1988, the riding of Charlevoix was represented by a 
Conservative member; however, it was represented by a Liberal 
from 1980 to 1984.
<P>
	Between 1984 and 1993, the member for Charlevoix and 
Prime Minister of Canada, Brian Mulroney, was at the helm and 
left a debt of $500 billion, which costs Canadians $108 million 
every day in interest charges. Six months later, Canada's debt 
stands at $525 billion, costs $110 million a day in interest, and 
the Liberal government is proud of the Minister of Finance's 
budget. A deficit of $39.7 billion-which sets the second record 
in this House-is something unheard of until now. The 
government wants to reduce the deficit by creating deficits. 
Many Liberal MPs are uncomfortable with this $39.7-billion 
deficit but, unfortunately, when the vote is taken in this House, 
the Liberals, who are too uncomfortable to discuss this issue, 
will prove us right and vote for their budget because they are 
once again muzzled by the government.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Madam Speaker, you cannot gag members for years and years. 
If you do, they will try to speak from the side of their mouths and 
those who enjoy a long career in this House might end up with a 
crooked mouth. Liberal members must have the opportunity to 
vote freely on the budget, which will then undoubtedly be 
rejected.
<P>
	There is no light at the end of the tunnel. This budget contains 
a lot of increases. People in Charlevoix will be affected by all 
these measures, since the government has increased 
unemployment insurance premiums for workers and taxes for 
the elderly. It has increased the deficit as well as the number of 
unemployed Canadians and helped to create a feeling of social 
insecurity in this country. Unfortunately, all of this will have a 
negative impact on my constituents in Charlevoix.
<P>
	The budget does not only include increases, it also contains 
cuts that we have to mention here, if only to be honest. Social 
programs are cut by $7.5 billion over three years. Instead of 
dealing with unemployment, the government has chosen to go 
after the unemployed. The government also cut social housing 
and daycare programs, as well as assistance to low-income 
families, job training, post-secondary education, assistance to 
single-parent families, help for families with handicapped 
people and programs to help the handicapped re-enter the labour 
force. All this in the International Year of the Family.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3089"> 3089 </A></B>
<P>
	The government did not take its responsibilities. It has no 
backbone. It should have cut where cuts are needed. It should 
have cut the Senate budget, ministers' expenses and pension 
funds of members of Parliament. It should also have set the age 
of pension eligibility at 60. People in Charlevoix, in Quebec and 
in Canada are being hurt and this budget will only increase the 
poverty level. This week, the Prime Minister was pleased to tell 
us that the unemployment rate was down, but when 
unemployment decreases by 2 per cent in Quebec, welfare 
increases by 2 per cent.
<P>
	I want to remind members that the Bloc Quebecois tabled a 
motion in this House to set up a committee to examine all 
government expenditures, item by item, department by 
department, to review the Auditor General's recommendations 
and to report on these issues. Auditors General, past and present, 
have always done a good job. Unfortunately, their reports have 
always been overlooked.
<P>
	The government is seeking additional revenues. In the red 
book, the Liberal government said it would abolish the GST. 
Why do they want to do so? Because this tax is visible and the 
Liberals want a hidden tax. Why? So they can raise the GST 
from 7 to 12 per cent. They want to broaden the tax base to be 
able to tax food products, drugs, education, volunteer 
organizations and charities. Who will pay and suffer? Not the 
senators, but workers and consumers, low-income families, 
seniors, single-parent families, the unemployed, students, the 
handicapped-of which I have many in my riding of Charlevoix. 
They are the ones who elected me to represent them and defend 
their interests. That is why I speak today, to defend their 
interests.
<P>
	There are too many welfare recipients and UI beneficiaries in 
Charlevoix. Once these people have paid for rent, food, clothing 
and hydro, which are necessities, they cannot afford to buy 
medication for their children or for themselves.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	Let us look at what the government has spent. According to an 
old saying, money cannot buy happiness. That may well be true, 
but money sure helps to pay the bills. The government spent 
$800 million to implement the GST, but it cost small businesses 
$6.4 billion. Yes, the GST needs to be improved. Canada is 
going deeper and deeper into the red, the budget is in the red and 
the deficit is not getting any smaller under this Liberal 
government.
<P>
	The message is clear: Quebecers do not trust the federal 
system anymore. The people of Charlevoix proved it on October 
25. Quebecers from 54 ridings proved that they have finally 
understood that the federal government is no longer effective. 
Liberal or Conservative, it is all the same.
<P>
	I have to thank the people of Charlevoix, both the 
sovereignists and the disenchanted federalists, who voted for me 
and sent me here to protect their interests in this House today.
<P>
	It was Paul Martin, the minister, who said that the House of 
Commons is a theatre. On October 25, the people of Quebec 
tried to change the actors in this House. If the House of 
Commons is a theatre, it is important also to change the horror 
movie that is playing here, the one about social insecurity in 
Quebec and in Canada.
<P>
	Is it the politicians who spend too much or the bureaucrats 
who are guilty of mismanagement? I asked the Minister of 
Finance this question. His answer was: the politicians, of 
course, because we lack control mechanisms.
<P>
	In closing, I would like to leave a clear message with the 
people of Charlevoix and of Quebec. Tomorrow's generation 
will have to foot the bill. I hope that Quebecers will choose the 
only solution that will enable us to help them. They will very 
soon be given another option, namely Quebec's sovereignty.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened to the member from 
the Bloc Quebecois and I have to ask myself whether or not I 
have been working in the same Chamber, in the same Parliament 
of Canada, as he has this week.
<P>
	I must say that even when one is in government there are many 
days when one shares the opposition's frustration with the speed 
with which things happen around here. We know that the private 
sector moves much more quickly than we do. It is just a fact of 
life.
<P>
	The rules are different. The systems of checks and balances 
are not as rigorous as the checks and balances in Parliament but 
those checks and balances are here for accountability. We do not 
have the luxury that the private sector has of making decisions 
arbitrarily and flying them through the system in 24 hours.
<P>
	I know there are many Canadians who would like to see it 
happen that way. There are days when I feel that is the way it 
should happen, but that is not the reality. We have accomplished 
some things in the last few weeks that were related to the 
economy of his community, my community, our country.
<P>
	Look at the work that members of the Bloc, members of the 
Reform Party and our members have done. Look at the work that 
we have done in the industry committee on accessing capital to 
small business. It is important that members tell their 
constituents that the financial institutions of Canada are 
beginning to move. They are beginning to respond.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3090"> 3090 </A></B>
<P>
	Look at the tremendous announcement that we received this 
week from the Royal Bank of Canada on its new $125 million 
venture capital fund for knowledge based industries. That is a 
first.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	I know it is not the be all and end all but our responsibility, 
and I say this to the Bloc through you, Madam Speaker, is not to 
just talk about the frustrations that we all go through in this 
institution. It is also to talk about some of the real meaningful 
things that we have accomplished here and we have 
accomplished some good things this week.
<P>
	I would suggest that access to capital for small and medium 
sized businesses is beginning to happen and in a better way. We 
know we have a long way to go but members should tell their 
constituents about that. Part of our responsibility here is to deal 
in hope.
<P>
	There is a second matter that I have to remind the members of 
the Bloc of because they are always questioning this: ``What is 
in Canada for Quebecers? What is in Canada? Why should we be 
here? It is not working''. I have repeated this message several 
times, and I am going to say it over and over: I cannot 
understand why the members of the Bloc refuse to talk about the 
announcement of the Minister of Finance on January 21, that is 
how far back it goes, when he announced the terms of the five 
year equalization renewal.
<P>
	The minister announced that under the equalization act, an act 
of Confederation, over the next five years Quebec would receive 
$70 billion over and above the other basic allocations on 
programs and services. That additional $70 billion being 
transferred to the province of Quebec over the next five years is 
an unfettered, unguided, no strings attached entitlement.
<P>
	Does that not mean anything to their constituents? Through 
Confederation, this federation of Canada, in the name of 
fairness-and in no way, shape or form am I questioning 
this-there is a $70 billion transfer under equalization from the 
have provinces to the have not provinces.
<P>
	By the way, for the previous five years there was about $58 
billion. We are talking over the last five years and the next five 
years about $130 billion being transferred to Quebec under the 
equalization entitlement.
<P>
	In my community no one questions that, but they think that is 
a meaningful amount of money. I have never heard a member of 
the Bloc say yes, equalization is a good thing, and they do in fact 
recognize it. They always stand up and say: ``We are entitled to 
that because of the personal and corporate income taxes that we 
put into the treasury. We are just getting back what we put in''. 
That is not the case. This is $70 billion over and above that.
<P>
	My point today in responding to the member for Charlevoix is 
that yes, there are many areas in this government where there is 
room for improvement and efficiency. There are some 
duplications that we must figure out and correct.
<P>
	Of course I take an opposite position from the Bloc. If we 
want to talk about eliminating duplications, let us take in the 
area of small business programs. I would not suggest that we 
eliminate the duplication by just handing over all the small 
business programs to the province of Quebec and cancelling the 
national government's small business programs. I would say the 
reverse. Have the province of Quebec cancel theirs and let the 
national government operate them.
<P>
	I am a traditional Trudeau trained centralist and I believe that 
we must have a strong national government. We must have a 
strong national government in order to create national 
programs. National programs are where we create national will. 
That is where we get the spirit that holds the whole country 
together.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The standards whether they be in education, environment or 
health care should be the same whether someone gets sick in 
Newfoundland, downtown Toronto, Quebec City or northern 
Saskatchewan.
<P>
	This whole notion members of the Bloc Quebecois have of 
wanting to destabilize and dismantle the national government 
ultimately works against the citizens not only of Quebec but also 
of every region of our country.
<P>
	I just wanted to take a moment to try and convince the Bloc 
Quebecois members that yes, we too are not satisfied with the 
speed with which things are happening here. We are trying to 
move as fast and as aggressively as we can. However, they 
should not forget to tell their constituents about some of the 
good things we manage to get done in the House and in 
committees day to day.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> 
Madam Speaker, this is the last opportunity I have during these 
scheduled debates to speak specifically on the budget.
<P>
	The budget document outlines the Liberal version of national 
priorities. It certainly has now been widely accepted that this 
year's budget lacked courage and does not sufficiently respond 
to the new realities we are facing in international finance, where 
money and wealth have no loyalties. At the mere touch of a key 
on a terminal, disgruntled or nervous investors representing 
large blocks of funds can turn against an economy when the 
wrong signals are sent.
<P>
	We must not forget that much of what is done in investing and 
international finance is in the realm of what is believed may 
happen in the future, what is being speculated on.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3091"> 3091 </A></B>
<P>
	The range of options a government has in order to perform for 
the international audience is becoming smaller. At this point the 
Canadian government still has a few choices left but these in 
themselves may not be available for long.
<P>
	Specifically, the enactment of this bill implements various 
parts of the February 22, 1994 budget. It affects persons 
employed in the public service as well as federally appointed 
judges, parliamentary agents, the Governor General, Lieutenant 
Governors, parliamentarians and members of the Canadian 
Armed Forces and the RCMP.
<P>
	This law extends the freeze for two years, suspends the 
upward movement within salary scales for a two year period and 
enables incentive payments to be made to indeterminate 
employees of National Defence, Emergency Preparedness and 
the Communications Security Establishment under the civilian 
reduction program.
<P>
	It also fixes a maximum on contributions to provinces under 
the Canada assistance plan. It extends restrictions on the 
payment to provinces under the Public Utilities Income Tax 
Transfer Act.
<P>
	It makes permanent the 10 per cent reduction in payments to 
railways under the Atlantic Regions Freight Assistance Act. It 
increases the reduction in the government share of freight rates 
under the Western Grain Transportation Act.
<P>
	The act also allows the CBC to borrow money.
<P>
	The act establishes a two tier benefit rate in unemployment 
insurance at 60 per cent for low earners and a basic rate of 55 per 
cent. It reduces employee premiums to 3 per cent of insurable 
earnings in 1995. There is also a new benefit entitlement 
schedule which addresses the link between work history and 
duration of entitlement. The minimum entrance requirement is 
increased from 10 to 12 weeks of work.
<P>
	It provides that workers suspended for misconduct, who take 
a leave of absence or quit their jobs for a few weeks before the 
end of their employment will no longer be disqualified from 
receiving benefits for their entire entitlement period. They will 
not be entitled to benefits while suspended or on leave or while 
their contract of employment continues. The benefit of the doubt 
will be given to claimants on these and other issues related to 
just cause or misconduct where the evidence is equally 
balanced.
<P>
	The act also authorizes the establishment and operation of 
pilot projects to study ways to make unemployment insurance 
more efficient.
<P>
	That is the general description of this bill. However, it really 
falls short of what the country needs. I am sure the finance 
minister and members of the cabinet are reasonable people who 
realize what must be done. The problem is they do not have the 
political courage to do the right thing for the long term benefit of 
the nation,  compared to the leadership it will demand in the 
short term to get everyone on side, the vested interests, the 
self-centred thinkers, the politicians who seek to please for the 
short term at all costs.
<P>
	That is what is represented by this bill: a government that is 
only beginning to say it hears what the majority are saying, 
rather than being prepared to act on what the majority are 
saying.
<P>
<B>(1050 ) </B>
<P>
	The budget in general terms sounded as if it came from the 
Reform Party book but when one checked the numbers against 
the rhetoric all credibility was lost. That is why I say this bill 
before us today falls so short.
<P>
	I am not opposing just for the sake of opposing. I truly believe 
that under the guise of being lean and not mean the government 
is discovered to be weak in what it perceives is the prescription 
necessary to be a manager of the national economic climate.
<P>
	Compared with either the experience of other countries or 
with our own history, the four decades between the end of World 
War II and the mid-1980s were a period of some measure of 
economic success for Canada. The Canadian economy grew to 
be one of the strongest in the world. The lot in life of the average 
Canadian greatly improved during that period.
<P>
	The basic reason was the development of our resource base. 
We traded our way to prosperity. However the traditional 
advantages that Canada has had are disappearing and we are 
being eclipsed. The resource sector will always be important but 
the rate of growth we have known because of it is gone.
<P>
	We expect to enjoy continued improvement in our standard of 
living. If we expect to engage in the kind of public programs at 
home and abroad that we like then we are going to have to find a 
new economic vocation and vision.
<P>
	Canadians are beginning to realize what is needed is a vision 
of a new Canada and that is coming from this corner of the 
House. The ethical, democratic and economic visions 
Reformers have developed in close dialogue with communities 
outline the prescription of required action, not the timid 
measures in this bill, but bold efficacious governance that leads 
with courage and compassion.
<P>
	The very last thing we should do about our situation is 
nothing. We cannot afford to assume, like this government, that 
things would work out for themselves in our favour without 
much adaptation, without much effort or without using our 
creative minds. Change begins with the recognition that a 
problem exists.
<P>
	I am encouraged that government members are increasingly 
sounding like Reformers. They are getting the talk. We on this 
side are getting through to many on the other side. Many more 
know in their hearts that we are right but they are part of a club, a 
gang that plays the political game as if it were politics as usual in 
Canada and  that if they just talk nice and do lots of opinion 
polling they will keep power. Others appear to have a sincere 
desire to do what is right for the nation but have not yet gathered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3092"> 3092 </A></B>
<P>
the courage to make a difference, to say no to what they 
rationally know is the wrong course for Canada.
<P>
	I invite them for once in the history of Canada to vote against 
this bill, vote against their club. Say to history and to all time 
there were members with courage and principle who acted for 
the national interests rather than self interests.
<P>
	We must secure our economic base as a nation. As a trading 
nation we must be in the international trading game with 
courage and vigour and not shrink from trading arrangements 
that foster openness, yet strongly monitor the international 
rules, and without fear holds other players to account.
<P>
	We must restructure our income security to ensure that in 
providing assistance from public funds those who are given 
priority are those who need assistance the most. We have built a 
comprehensive set of programs but these efforts do not 
adequately meet the requirements of those who should have first 
call on our national resources, those most in need. We will be 
forced to do it. We will do it ourselves in a compassionate 
manner or we will have it done for us in blunt terms from outside 
forces.
<P>
	Education at all levels must have a greater level of proportion 
of resources. Our emphasis in education must not be just to train 
for a specific task but to prepare the workforce to adapt to 
changing opportunities. A commitment to education goes with a 
commitment to research. Enhancing the Canadian capacity to do 
the basic work of discovery and our ability to apply the results in 
the marketplace will also be keys to future economic success.
<P>
	We have another basic economic question in Canada that is 
not solved by the budget. We must address interprovincial and 
interregional conflict. Canada must become an open market 
within its borders. The free movement of goods, capital, labour 
and cultural pursuits is fundamental.
<P>
	One of the past strengths of Confederation has been that we 
have found ways in our political system to accommodate 
regional differences. Indeed Canadians are generous and 
tolerant of difference, but we bridle and chafe at the prospect of 
preference. Therefore we need a new set of institutions which 
can aid in bringing about a better reconciliation of regional 
differences.
<P>
	Finally we have come to expect that we will play a positive 
role in the world. Attempting to help others is not a Canadian 
service that is new to this generation. Missionaries from 
Canadian churches began to play a significant role in other 
countries in the last century and continue to do so, as our 
soldiers have done in this one.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	We have a proud history of making the world a more stable 
place and we have been prepared to pay the price. The great 
powers have their role. Because we are not one of them we can 
more uniquely play a positive role in international economic and 
political affairs. We can ensure that the interests of the small as 
well as the great are taken into account within the community of 
nations.
<P>
	While we cast our vision afar, we must also do some repairs at 
home. We must erase the consequences of our misguided 
political ideologies and economic policies of the last decade.
<P>
	In closing, for government to be effective we must be open 
and honest with Canadians. This will be politically hazardous 
for some but it will be necessary if the Canadian people are to be 
involved in charting Canada's course. The more we can bring 
democracy into this House and involve Canadians in the 
decision making process we will realize our potential for the 
21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, Bill C-17 is 
meant to implement several provisions of the budget but the 
main ones are those concerning unemployment insurance.
<P>
	Even though several members spoke on the subject, I think 
that it is worth repeating the three main changes in the House. 
First is the increase in the number of weeks of work required to 
qualify for unemployment insurance. I stress this point first 
because, as the opposition critic for training and youth, it is 
clear that the future of our young people is my top priority. Now, 
one of the measures that will hit young Canadians who are 
excluded from the workforce the hardest is the increase in the 
number of work weeks needed to qualify for benefits. The first 
job that those young people can find is often precarious and very 
temporary and, in my opinion, the government's measure will 
hit them particularly hard.
<P>
	The second change is the reduction in the number of benefit 
weeks according to the regional unemployment rate. That kind 
of attack began under the Tories, with Minister Valcourt, and 
continues with the present Minister of Human Resources 
Development, even though members of the present government 
condemned the Conservative policy. Today, the government 
wants to go even further by reducing the number of benefit 
weeks.
<P>
	The third change is the decrease in the benefit rate, which 
once again goes in the same direction as the change brought 
about by the Conservative government, by lowering the rate 
from 57 per cent to 55 per cent of the salary previously earned. 
This will affect over 85 per cent of claimants.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3093"> 3093 </A></B>
<P>
	I would now like to mention some statistics published in 
today's <I>La Presse</I>; the source is none other than the Department 
of Human Resources Development. We learn that the changes 
brought about today will result in 44,000 people being deprived 
of UI benefits.
<P>
	Is my time up, Mr. Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> You still have about thirty seconds.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dubé:</B> So, this concerns every province. For instance, 
and members from Newfoundland will surely be interested by 
this, 1,635 people in that province will be affected by the 
increase in the entrance requirement and 1,370 will be affected 
by the reduction in the maximum benefit period.
<P>
	Prince Edward Island is also hit hard. And so is New 
Brunswick, with particularly striking effects. In that province, 
1,155 people will be affected by the first measure and 1,335 by 
the second. In the case of Quebec, 4,880 people will be affected 
by the reduction in the maximum benefit period.
<P>
	You can thus understand that, under the circumstances, I am 
indignant about these changes we are asked to approve for the 
unemployment insurance program. I am thinking of the MIL 
Davie workers, whose numbers dropped from 3,000 to about 
1,500 in six months. Six months from now, only 300 will remain 
employed; all the others will have to live on unemployment 
insurance benefits, which will have been reduced by these 
changes.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am not sure if the hon. member has used all 
the time allowed; if not, he can resume after question period.
<P>
	It being eleven o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to Statements by Members, pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
rail service, both passenger and freight, has played an important 
historical role in Canada. It is an integral part of our 
transportation system.
<P>
	Most industrialized countries have modern, efficient rail 
systems. In Canada we appear to be closing them down. Instead 
we should be modernizing them with new technologies to make 
them efficient and effective for the future benefit of our 
transportation system.
<P>
	Effective and efficient rail systems are most important to the 
future transportation needs of all Canadians. We must review all 
opportunities for the future advancement of our rail systems 
instead of closing rail lines and losing them forever.
<P>

and expertise are now recognized throughout the world.
<P>
	Remember that it was René Lévesque who gave 
Hydro-Quebec the impetus to become an essential tool for 
Quebec's economic development by providing work for 
thousands of Quebecers and generating billions of dollars in 
economic benefits.
<P>
	Keep in mind as well that the energy produced by 
Hydro-Quebec is renewable and much cleaner than coal or

with regard to the Pearson airport development deal I am happy

	The Pearson fiasco was clearly an example of unfair lobbying

<P>
	I have only one real concern with the government's handling 
of the aborted airport deal. I believe in no uncertain terms that 
no compensation whatsoever should be provided to the 
consortium responsible for whipping up the Pearson 
privatization plan and then pushing it through the Tory cabinet 
like a knife through butter.
<P>
	These people know full well any controversial contract signed

there is considerable pressure being mounted within and outside

<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	Certainly the creation of new industry is always welcome 
news but industry must be based on economics and not 
agrohysteria. Let us remember that this ethanol project is 
premised on cash infusions from government, a principle which 
should be disavowed.
<P>
	Ethanol in jurisdictions with very high taxation can be a 
competitively priced fuel in relation to ordinary fossil fuels. 
However, such is not the case in Canada. Our refining industry 
provides a quality Canadian product at a competitive price.
<P>
	If the proposed ethanol industry could compete on a level 
playing field then it will proceed successfully. Conversely, if the 
ethanol industry as proposed will only be viable as a result of 
artificial means, that is, long term tax concessions and cash 
donations from taxpayers totalling close to 600 million Ontario 
and federal dollars over 12 years, we could conclude that it is 
still the fuel of the future, but not that of the present.

Iran has classified these people as unprotected infidels and has 
engaged in their systematic persecution on the basis of religion.
<P>
	Because of their religion Baha'is are denied basic human 
rights, including the right of redress or protection against 
assault, murder or other forms of persecution. Since 1979 there 
have been 201 Baha'i killed and 15 are missing and presumed 
dead. Baha'is are denied access to education and employment. 
Many have also lost their homes and savings. All of this 
persecution is designed to force the Baha'i to recant their faith.
<P>
	Canada and the international community must continue to 
scrutinize the human rights situation in Iran and make every 
effort to encourage the full recognition of religious and human 
rights for the Baha'i in that country.

Quebecois deplores the fact that the Liberal government is 
dragging its feet on a number of issues, including MIL Davie, 
Hyundai and Oerlikon. The government's inertia will be very 
costly to Quebec in terms of lost jobs. This is happening at a

field in provincial jurisdiction is a blatant contradiction of the 
consensus reached by all social and economic partners in 
Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to bring to the attention of the House a deplorable 
excuse that is being used by murderers in our country in order to 
receive lighter sentences. It is called cocaine psychosis and has 
affected yet another court case in British Columbia.
<P>
	Dale Hicks was convicted for manslaughter, not murder, in 
the brutal killings of two women in their home. One of his 
victims was pregnant and was stabbed 17 times.
<P>
	The judge ruled that the deaths are considered manslaughter 
because Hicks, who was high on cocaine at the time, was 
afflicted with cocaine psychosis and was unaware of his actions.
<P>
	He was sentenced to 10 years but could be out in three and half 
years if he behaves in prison; three and a half years for taking the 
lives of two innocent people. To top it off, his lawyers have 
appealed the sentence, calling it excessive.
<P>
	By taking an illegal drug this killer has been allowed to get 
away with murder. It is time justice is served by making 
criminals accountable for their actions-no excuses any more.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday we 
learned that several provinces were joining forces to defeat 
Ottawa's plans to centralize social program reform.
<P>
	In light of this revelation and further to the insulting 
comments of the Prime Minister who, on Wednesday, described 
traditional demands as whims, the National Assembly passed a 
unanimous motion yesterday confirming Quebec's position, on 
which all sides agree, to the effect that exclusive jurisdiction 
over manpower training should be transferred to Quebec.
<P>
	Does the Deputy Prime Minister recognize that the decision to 
cancel the meeting is a step backward and a sign of bad faith as 
well as a reflection of the serious unease between the provincial 
and federal governments, all because of Ottawa's centralizing 
aims?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I find somewhat 
regrettable about the opposition party's stand is that right now, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3097"> 3097 </A></B>
<P>
there are 400,000 unemployed workers in Quebec. The federal 
government is working with the provinces to find a way that 
would enable the  unemployed to receive training that would 
lead to employment.
<P>
	Instead of complaining that we are trying to achieve a 
consensus, instead of criticizing us for our decision to take some 
more time in order to make the best possible decisions, the 
spokesperson for the opposition should be congratulating us for 
seeking the co-operation of all provinces. That is why we have 
decided, not to cancel the meeting, but only to postpone it until 
we are certain that we have achieved this consensus.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the National Assembly unanimously rejected the federal 
government's package. Maybe the Deputy Prime Minister 
should take this fact into account.
<P>
	My supplementary question is directed to her colleague 
responsible for Human Resources Development. Can the 
Minister of Human Resources Development give us his 
assurance that the decision to cancel the meeting is not simply a 
strategic withdrawal, that he will review his centralizing 
strategy and take Quebec's demands into account and that he 
will get back on the right track?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, the Government of Canada is 
committed to overhauling the social security system. We want 
the process to be open and we want to work in co-operation with 
the provinces.
<P>
	In this regard, the government has a role to play in manpower 
training and in the labour market. To carry out its role, it must 
consult with all groups and governments to find ways of making 
the system as effective and as beneficial as possible for all 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Minister 
of Human Resources Development confirmed yesterday that he 
intended to keep to his schedule and make his reform initiatives 
public before the end of June. Will he not admit that his 
bulldozing operation flies in the face of the unanimous 
consensus that emerged yesterday in the National Assembly and 
is nothing short of a constitutional incursion into the field of 
manpower and social programs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member doth protest too 
much.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that in the last two months we have 
had two major rounds of consultations with the provinces, 
unprecedented during that period of time. Agreements were 
reached in a number of areas of joint collaboration, particularly 
to go forward and look at ways in which we can reduce waste and 
duplication, where we can begin to examine a variety of 
initiatives we can take together. Just a week ago my deputy 
minister travelled  throughout all provinces to discuss with them 
the nature of the agenda.
<P>
	The hon. member says this is bulldozing. I say it is the most 
active process of consultation and co-operation that has been 
seen because we want to make this an open process.
<P>
	Let us be fair about one thing. The hon. member opposite and 
his colleagues have no interest in this process of reform. They 
have no interest in co-operation. All they want to do is destroy 
this process because they want to destroy the country along with 
it.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, accompanied by the 
Minister of National Defence, minimized the seriousness of the 
situation in Bosnia by comparing it to ``a last-minute glitch''; in 
addition, he expected a quick settlement for the 16 Canadian 
peacekeepers held hostage by the Serbian armed forces. We 
know that the situation has degenerated since then, because the 
Serbian forces have taken other UN troops and observers 
hostage, bringing the total number to 155.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Defence report on the negotiations which 
were to begin this morning between UN representatives and the 
Serbian military forces for the release of the hostages?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National 
Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning, our people in Bosnia were able to contact our soldiers; 
the situation is calm, and I must add that the soldiers are not 
being mistreated.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We hope to have some resolution of this situation soon. There 
was a meeting this morning between Mr. Akashi, the 
representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, 
and the Serb leader Karadzic. I think that meeting is still going 
on. As soon as we have any results of that we will let members 
know.

are trying to minimize this. We find this situation completely 
unacceptable and we are very concerned.

	<B>Hon. David Michael Collenette (Minister of National

should point out the Minister of Foreign Affairs is in Montreal 
today. However he has been holding discussions throughout the 
early hours of this morning and right now with his various 
counterparts in the NATO countries. I believe he talked with Mr. 
Hurd a few moments ago. These discussions are going on at the

would like to ask the Minister of Human Resources

federal-provincial meeting will delay the minister's social 
reform program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not believe it will have a 
major impact on the timing.
<P>
	In the very delicate and complicated negotiations that must go 
on not only with provinces but with a number of groups of 
Canadians of course we are going to have to make adjustments. 
However I still believe we can meet a timetable of bringing in 
major changes by the end of this year provided we have the 
goodwill and collaboration. After all, there are millions of 
Canadians who want a change, who need change and are 
concerned about change. It is too bad a few individuals are 
attempting to put a road block in it like the hon. member who 
just spoke earlier.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the 
government of Quebec did not want to participate in Monday's 
meeting, that is Quebec's business but other provinces were 
prepared to attend.
<P>
	Why is the minister allowing the Quebec government to delay 
not only the federal government's planning but that of the nine 
other provinces as well?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it was my decision to postpone 
the meeting. It was not dictated by any province. I just felt if we 
are going to reach agreements and if we are going to have a good 
climate of co-operation then we should give one province, 
several provinces or whatever the time they feel is necessary.
<P>
	We had a useful agenda in front of us. We were going to be 
meeting with the aboriginal groups. We were going to be looking 
at some of the strategic initiatives. We were going to put in place 
an agenda for the reform of the child care system and get those 
started. However, those are all items we can continue.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, I will be recommending that we have a 
meeting of senior officials within the next week or so. We can 
discuss how a further ministerial meeting can get the process 
under way and we can make sure that all the provinces feel they 
can be a full part of the process.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, what 
Canadians really want to know is whether the minister is 
allowing the Government of Quebec to drive the agenda of the 
Government of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the conclusions or the 
implications drawn by the hon. member are wrong. Let us try 
and put this thing into perspective.
<P>
	We are doing social reform review for one simple reason. We 
want to get people in this country back to work. We want to give 
people a greater sense of income security. We want to help a lot 
of very poor children who are not being nurtured properly. 
Those are the reasons we are doing it.
<P>
	We recognize in a federal system like this that we must also 
work carefully with all our partners. I will do everything I can to 
make sure all the partners feel comfortable within that process, 
that they are a part of that process and that it is not being dictated 
by one government or by one group but is an attempt to find a 
consensus.

	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	According to an internal report of the Department of Human 
Resources Development, the unemployment insurance changes 
announced in the last budget will deprive some 44,000 people of 
UI benefits and put 19,000 on welfare.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3099"> 3099 </A></B>
<P>
	How can the minister justify his changes to the unemployment 
insurance program when they clearly restrict access to UI 
benefits and increase welfare rolls, without offering these 
thousands of people any job creation alternative?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the first thing I would like to 
point out in that analysis is that the numbers are far, far smaller 
than the members of the opposition were claiming during budget 
time. In fact, they were making claims that hundreds of 
thousands of people would be thrown on to the welfare rolls. In 
fact, the best estimate we have is that it is only 19,000.
<P>
	We do not take that lightly. That is the reason in the budget by 
the Minister of Finance we have initiated a $6 billion 
infrastructure development program that according to the 
President of the Treasury Board will create close to 100,000 new 
jobs across the country. We will be putting in place a number of 
new employment training programs for these people. We will be 
stimulating small business.
<P>
	The hon. member forgets that one of the real results of the 
budget is that by reducing the UI premiums we will in fact be 
creating a climate where 60,000 to 70,000 jobs will be provided. 
All those jobs will be available.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	It would seem to me the hon. member should be looking at 
how we create jobs and create growth rather than simply at how 
we keep a system that is not working.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> The 
minister seems to have no idea what it is like when 44,000 
people lose their UI benefits. Does he admit that, in addition to 
offloading major expenditures onto the provinces, his reform 
excludes 44,000 people from training programs that would have 
helped them to find jobs?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will say one thing to the hon. 
member. If he can get the co-operation of his colleagues, and 
perhaps some of his colleagues in the opposition party in the 
province of Quebec, we would be able in the next several months 
to create new programs to help deal with unemployment and to 
revise our social security network so we could put far more 
people back to work.
<P>
	The purpose of our reform is to put in place systems so that 
people do not have to be on social assistance and do not have to 
be on UI but get the chance to go back to work. We want to help 
them to do it.

should not question the youth employment strategy because it 
had not yet been released. However yesterday's <I>Financial Post</I> 
carried a detailed description of the program, complete with 
direct quotes from the minister.

comment or ask questions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources

is still not released, contrary to all leaks by whomever.
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that if the hon. member has an iota of 
patience, if he can wait perhaps an hour or two, he will be in full 
possession of exactly what we intend to do to give hope and 
opportunity to the young people of the country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the minister for the answer.
<P>
	I have learned that he has planned a news conference for later

conferences is an old Ottawa trick. Apparently the idea is to get 
the information out without any chance for opposition MPs to

the Minister of Human Resources Development. The minister 
has just informed us today that he will be holding a press 
conference to announce, with great pomp I imagine, his 
apprenticeship plan for Canadian youth.
<P>
	But this plan implies an obvious infringement on the 
provinces' jurisdiction over education. One simple question: 
Did the minister make a point, before announcing this plan, of 
securing the support of the Quebec government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I met with all the ministers of 
education and labour a month ago in Toronto where we outlined 
the directions of the program.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	We indicated at that time we would be working in 
co-operation with the provinces, as we presently do, on the 
existing co-op education program which the provinces utilize at 
the moment. We have agreed to establish working groups of 
officials in each province so that we can ensure the programs are 
totally harmonized and there is no overlap or duplication.
<P>
	Again I come back to one central fact. It strikes me as 
exceedingly strange, when there are 400,000 young people in 
the country desperate to go back to work, wanting to find a place 
where they can get serious training in the workplace, that the 
only question the hon. member has is how do we stop the 
program rather than how do we go ahead with it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, normally the 
Minister of Human Resources Development should have taken a 
lesson in humility from the National Assembly, yesterday, but 
that does not seem to have been the case. Is the minister 
prepared to postpone the implementation of his apprenticeship

is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	He referred to the 400,000 young Canadians actively seeking 
work in the country. Leaked information implies that the 
program would help about 1 per cent of those 400,000 young

problem as this one? Why is he cruelly creating false hope for so 
many young Canadians?
<P>

Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again the Reform Party is 
working on the basis of leaks.
<P>
	I would suggest that Reform members get themselves a proper 
research department so that they can start basing their questions 
on facts rather than on rumour and speculation. The only thing I 
take great comfort from in the hon. member's question is that for 
the first time in the history of the Reform Party's presence in the 
House we now have Reform members saying to the Liberal 
government: ``Spend more money''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not say 
to spend more money. As a matter of fact these programs have an 
effect of costing taxpayers more money.
<P>
	I have a supplementary question. Recently the government 
has begun the very difficult job of trying to reduce the 
dependency cycle of thousands of east coast fishermen. The 
history of these make-work projects in Canada has been a series 
of failures. I had hoped that the 1970 tactics had gone out with 
the last election.
<P>
	Why is the minister now planning to introduce thousands 
more young Canadians to a dependency cycle with yet another 
make-work program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a very cruel statement.
<P>
	There are over 40,000 people on the east coast of Canada who 
have been deprived of a way of life and a way of making a living 
through no fault of their own. Their families for generations 
have fished honestly. The fish have disappeared.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. Yesterday, the 
ultrafederalist Quebec Minister of International Affairs, 
Cultural Communities and Immigration, Mr. John Ciaccia, 
made the following statement: ``COFIs teach immigrants to 
cope with problems of daily life. They are told how schools and 
institutions work in Quebec. They are given tips on food and 
housing.''
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	Is the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, whom the 
Quebec government has called to order along with his colleague, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development, prepared to 
mind his own business from now on and to apologize to the 
Quebec government?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, no Government of Quebec official 
has called me to order. Quite the contrary. I spoke to the Quebec 
minister responsible for immigration and he said very clearly 
what I told the member yesterday on the floor of the House of 
Commons.
<P>
	First, he says that Quebec has nurtured a settlement process 
that clearly is at the top of the list after a 20-25 year agreement 
with the federal government.
<P>
	Second, he has no problem that the committee overseeing the 
Canada-Quebec accord regularly meets with federal and 
provincial officials to discuss what there is for public debate.
<P>
	Third, he confirms to me that there is no incompatibility with 
promoting strong, exciting patriotism and love of Canada and 
one's fierce loyalty to one's province or region. One either lives 
in a province in a country or one lives in a country and in a 
province.
<P>
	Quebec has jurisdiction over independent immigration that 
comes to Quebec, but as far as I know Quebec is still in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Mr. Speaker, now the 
minister is backpedalling. Does he not realize that his clumsy 
action calls into question Quebec's jurisdiction for integrating 
its immigrants into the French community?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think clumsiness is in the eye of 
the beholder. Quite frankly the hon. member is trying to make an 
issue of a non-issue. No one is calling the Quebec government 
or the province of Quebec into question on its resettlement and 
settlement programs.
<P>
	I told the hon. member in committee two days ago. I told the 
hon. member yesterday. I repeat for him again that my 
government and I believe Quebec has done a yeoman's job and 
service on settlement.
<P>
	Second, the hon. member intentionally confuses what I said 
on the settlement issue with citizenship materials to try to 
standardize citizenship materials from one coast to the other. 
That is citizenship, settlement is immigration, and the member 
knows it.

Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	The government recently announced the preparation of a 
broad discussion paper on Canada's programs for seniors. The 
minister clearly stated that the objective was to define a set of 
efficient and compassionate programs to meet our future needs.
<P>
	Could the minister clarify whether this means that the review 
of seniors' programs is part of social security reform? Could the 
minister give his assurance that old age security pensions will be 
protected?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can certainly give the hon. 
member that assurance.
<P>
	Nobody in the government has ever said in any way, shape or 
form that we would be making changes to the fundamental 
protection of seniors through the OAS. The social review that 
we presently have under way is primarily designed to deal with 
questions of employability and with questions of security for 
families and children. That is our real commitment.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance indicated in the budget that we would 
be preparing a paper on the long term issues and implications of 
what happens to a society that is aging and what that means for 
some of the long term security benefits 20 to 30 years ahead. We 
<P>

must address those matters because of the changing age of the 
population and what that would do in terms of premiums and so

no intention of making any changes whatsoever at this time in 
existing security programs for seniors.

	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Yesterday, while the 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration was busy briefing the 
press, some real news was revealed by his deputy minister. 
Apparently no HIV test is required as a part of the routine 
medical testing for immigration to Canada. This is despite the 
fact the Immigration Act reads that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No person who is a danger to public health or who would create excessive 
demands on health services should be allowed into the country.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That is the law. Why is the minister's department not testing 
each and every immigration applicant for HIV and why are we 
letting these people into Canada?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is only news to the hon. 
member because as my colleague mentioned earlier, they clearly 
have a vacuum in their research capacity.
<P>
	The fact is there is not mandatory HIV testing. However, if in 
their routine checks they find traces of HIV, our doctors 
throughout the world are allowed to ask applicants to have that 
test. In the majority of cases they have been refused.
<P>
	There is not mandatory testing yet for HIV. Many applicants 
are tested and many are not permitted to come not only with the 
perspective of problems for other Canadians but also with 
respect to the effect and impact it would have on our health care 
system in Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not 
think the Canadian people are going to be satisfied with that 
kind of an answer.
<P>
	The minister has been aware for some time that HIV testing is 
not done. Not only that, but if an applicant admits being positive 
to HIV he or she still can be admitted to Canada. This is 
outrageous. Surely the minister cannot deny that HIV infected 
immigrants are a threat to our already overburdened health care 
system.
<P>
	Does the minister have statistics on how many AIDS infected 
immigrants or refugees have been admitted to Canada to date?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, I caution the member to try to 
curtail the kind of fishing expedition he wants to engage in.
<P>
	I would point out that that mandatory testing has not taken 
place. Second, where those individuals exhibit traces of HIV 
they are asked to be tested. Third, most of those individuals are 
not permitted into the country. Fourth, the whole question of 
medical inadmissibility is now being reviewed as a result of 
some of the charter cases that have happened in the last number 
of months.
<P>
	I will be happy to provide the hon. member with some answers 
to questions that he asked with respect to specific statistics, 
which I do not have at my fingertips today.

<P>
	On Wednesday, the minister announced to the Government 
Operations Committee that a memorandum of agreement had 
been signed with BioVac of Laval and Connaught in Ontario for 
the purchase of influenza vaccine by the federal government for 
the provinces. This agreement is the direct result of an 
intervention by the Minister of Public Works.
<P>

division of the contract in two equal parts between BioVac and 
Connaught, whereas before BioVac held an exclusive contract?

	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and

for raising the question which is indeed important to all 
Canadians.
<P>
	The member may not be aware, but the Government of Canada 
purchases approximately 1 per cent of the vaccine in question. 
Ninety-nine per cent is purchased by the provinces. We act as a 
facilitator for the provinces. The member is quite correct that 
yesterday I did announce at committee that there was an 
agreement in principle between the participants and that the 
details of that particular agreement will be announced very

obviously to protect the health of Canadians.
<P>
	There are Canadian companies which wanted a Canadian 
solution to a particular problem. I think we have arrived at that. 
We have an agreement in principle which I think will satisfy all 
of the participants. At the same time the primary concern is to

	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question based on fact is for the Deputy Prime Minister and 
Minister for the Environment.
<P>
	On January 24 the minister told the House that the decision to 
locate the NAFTA environmental secretariat would be public 
and transparent throughout and that the decision would be made 
free of politics based on an independent consultant's report of 
the competing bids.
<P>
	The minister said that for the first time in the history of 
government the decision would be based on the environmental 
record of the competing cities. When the minister announced 
that Montreal was to be the site of the secretariat, the minister 
admitted the decision was political.
<P>
	When the government made the political decision to locate 
the environmental secretariat in Montreal, was the minister 
aware that of the competing cities Montreal has about the worst 
environmental record? Therefore, based on the minister's own 
words will the minister reconsider her decision?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I know that hon. members will want to make 
their questions quite succinct and specific. I would invite the 
hon. Minister of the Environment to answer the question.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all the statement by 
the member is absolutely false.
<P>
	I invited him last Monday along with any other colleague in 
the House to come to my office and personally review every 
single one of the applicant cities. There were 25 cities that 
applied, 25 cities that had applications based on five criteria 
which were public criteria, which I released with all relevant 
documents.
<P>
	I invited the member last Monday to come and review the 
applications from his city and from the other cities. 
Unfortunately, he and his colleagues have not shown any 
interest in actually seeing the documents.
<P>
	I have released in this House, publicly, every single document 
on that issue that was reviewed by me. I have invited the member 
and his colleagues to come and personally review the 
approximately 15,000 pages of documents that came from the 
cities. I would ask him to come over and review the facts and I 
think when he sees the facts he will agree with me that among 25 
very good applicant cities, Montreal was the best choice.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
given the fact that the decision to place the environmental 
secretariat in Montreal appears to have been made before the 
phoney competition began, will the minister tell the House if it 
is the intention of the government to buy the affection of the 
separatists in Quebec at the expense of federalists in the rest of 
the country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the tone of the hon. 
member's question is a very good indication of how he and his 
party do not understand that this party believes that Canadians 
belong in every part of this country. My brother living in the city 
of Montreal is every bit as Canadian as anybody living in his 
city. One thing that is going to be very important for the future of 
this country is if Canadians from Edmonton, Montreal, 
Vancouver, Dartmouth, St. John's and Hamilton begin to 
understand that we are all in this together.

In answer to questions from the Official Opposition during 
committee hearings, the Director of the Canadian Museum of

mismanagement. Disturbing facts, especially concerning the 
awarding and managing of contracts for consultants and the 
hiring of museum executives, were confirmed in the committee.

proceed with an in-depth review of the museum's management?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for her question. I am myself 
extremely concerned about situations like this one. The person

<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, we can have both. It is quite natural for the managers of

quality of their own management. They carry on their affairs at

the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice said that 
for the next few weeks the Minister of Justice and the 
department will be studying very closely the possibility of 
making changes to gun control laws. We know that in the 1993 
Auditor General's report it was said that we must have 
evaluation of the existing laws before we even know if they are 
currently being effective.
<P>

<P>

before we proceed with any changes to the existing laws?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the effectiveness of the laws 
at present are being evaluated on a continuing basis and we will 
continue that effort.
<P>
	I want to make it clear however, in terms of what the 
parliamentary secretary may have said, as I have said earlier this 
week I am studying a broad range of options to bring forward to 
caucus and to cabinet for consideration, and that process is 
under way.
<P>
	As to the effectiveness of the present laws, we simply have to 
look at the evidence all around us, the increasing availability of 
guns for people with criminal intent, to know that we have a long 
way to go before being as effective as many of us want to be on 
this subject.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, does the 
Minister of Justice really feel there is any point in spending $60 
million on the Auditor General's department which said that an 
evaluation should take place and then possibly, as he has done 
here, come to the House and say it is fine to do the evaluation 
within the Department of Justice?
<P>
	Should these evaluations not be made public, should they not 
be made transparent so that the people of Canada know whether 
the laws are presently working?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has made a 
point that is very fair but I think we are talking about two 
different things.
<P>
	First, the Auditor General was speaking about evaluating the 
effect of the laws that were put on the books in recent years. That 
is an ongoing process. All of that will be made public. We will be 
determining the effect of Bill C-17 and its implementation. That 
is one thing and it is fully public.
<P>
	The second thing, and I think evaluation is not a good word for 
the second subject, is this government, Bill C-17 now being 
behind us, is looking at other steps we might take for more 
effective gun control.
<P>
	On that subject, what the parliamentary secretary said is that I 
and my colleagues in justice are putting together a list of options 
for further steps that can be taken. We are going to go to caucus 
and cabinet with that list. We are going to select a strategy we 
think is in the public interest and then bring it forward as

	<B>Hon. Christine Stewart (Secretary of State (Latin America 
and Africa)):</B> Madam Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 36, it 
is my pleasure to present a petition on behalf of various 
constituents of mine.
<P>
	The petitioners are asking the government to make 
amendments to the Divorce Act to ensure that they have access 
to their grandchildren. Furthermore an amendment to the 
Divorce Act would give the grandparent who is granted access to 
a child the right to make inquiries and to be given information as 
to the health, education and welfare of the child.

	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
two petitions from citizens of Peterborough riding.
<P>
	The first which is signed by 25 people urges that Parliament 
enact legislation to request effective tax paid markings on legal 
tobacco products. These citizens believe it is important to 
clearly distinguish legal, domestic product from contraband 
product and they believe that these markings will make 
enforcement of federal regulations easier. I have also signed this 
petition.
<P>
	The second petition is also signed by 25 citizens of 
Peterborough. The petitioners point out that we export Canadian 
tobacco but there is virtually no market for this tobacco in the 
United States and so that tobacco is simply reimported. They 
urge that quotas be imposed on tobacco exports to ensure that 
only legitimate export markets are met by our exports. I have 
also signed this petition.

another petition from constituents requesting the repeal of 
section 745 of the Criminal Code.
<P>
	I would like to present it pursuant to Standing Order 36. It has 
been duly certified by the clerk of petitions. I wholeheartedly

	Pursuant to Standing Order 36, I rise in the House today to 
present a petition collected by the British Heritage Institute. The 
petitioners request that the government ensure that the 
provisions of Canada's multiculturalism policy apply to all 
ethnic groups without favour and to publicize widely its 
intentions to do so immediately.

Markham-Whitchurch-Stouffville.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to undertake a process to 
thoroughly investigate the very serious indiscretions committed 
by their elected representative to determine if he is fit to

honoured to rise in the House, pursuant to Standing Order 36, to 
present a petition with several hundred names on behalf of my 
constituents of Kent.
<P>
	The petitioners state an ethanol industry will provide definite 
stability for Canadian agriculture and the Canadian economy in 
general. Ethanol is one of the most environmentally friendly 
fuels available. Chatham, Ontario was recently selected as the 
first site for a major ethanol plant, 20 times larger than any in 
Canada to date, creating approximately 1,100 person years of 
work and contributing an estimated $125 million in annual 
economic impact.

<HR>
<B><A NAME="3107"> 3107 </A></B>
<P>
	As you know, Madam Speaker, I have spoken in the House 
before about the harm to society of serial killer cards. The 
petitioners state that they support the efforts of Debbie Mahaffy 
in her quest to have the killer cards seized at the Canada-U.S. 
border to stop their distribution in Canada.
<P>
	The cards published by Eclipse Comic Books, True Crime 
Trading Cards and other publishers feature the crimes of serial 
killers, mass murderers and gangsters. We do not want these 
cards in our community.
<P>
	The petition goes on to state: ``We abhor crimes of violence 
against persons and we believe that killer trading cards offer 
nothing positive for children or adults to admire or emulate but 
rather contribute to violence. Therefore, the undersigned your 
petitioners, humbly pray and call upon the Parliament of Canada 
to amend the laws of Canada to prohibit the importation, 
distribution, sale and manufacture of killer cards in law and to 
advise producers of killer cards that their products, if destined 
for Canada, will be seized and destroyed''.
<P>
	I reiterate my support for this petition which I table in the 
House today.

	(Questions answered orally are indicated by an asterisk.)
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the following questions will be answered today: Nos 6, 14 and 
15.
<P>
[<I>Text</I>] 
<P>
Question No. 6-<B>Mr. Grubel:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>What is the incidence of social spending by deciles of family income, in 
particular with respect to old age security, unemployment insurance, family and 
youth allowance, and other federal transfers to persons?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> The following table provides the information 
requested by the hon. member form Capilano-Howe Sound.
<P>
	The data in this table are based on Statistics Canada's survey 
of consumer finances for 1991 incomes, the latest year for which 
incomes data are available.
<P>
	There are a number of different definitions of family. For the 
purposes of this tabulation, an ``immediate family'' concept has 
been used. Thus, a family is defined as either a husband and wife 
(including common law relationships) with or without children 
who have never married, or a parent living in the same dwelling 
with children who have never married. All other persons 
(including single persons living alone) are defined as a separate 
family unit. Thus, many recipients of federal transfers would 
show up in high income families because they live with high 
income parents/children. For example, a child receiving UI 
benefits could be living with high income parents.
<P>
	The table shows transfers before taxes. Thus, the table does 
not show the effect of OAS recovered from high income 
individuals. About $300 million of OAS benefits are recovered 
from individuals with incomes above $51,800. This represents 
about 15 per cent of total OAS paid to families in the top three 
deciles. While the entire OAS is recovered from an individual at 
$81,000 of income, a lower income spouse living with a spouse 
who has high income is not subject to the recovery.
<P>
	Family allowances and child tax credit have been replaced by 
the child tax benefit since 1993. The table does not show the 
distribution in respect of the new program because the relevant 
data are not yet available. However, a table showing average 
child tax benefit by income follows.
<P>

<IMG SRC="tables/nen0501501_r1.gif"  ><BR>
<IMG SRC="tables/nen0501501_r2.gif"  ><BR>
<BR><BR>
	Notes: (1) Incomes from some of the transfers in this table are 
not fully reported in the survey. For example, the survey does 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3108"> 3108 </A></B>
<P>
not cover residents of Yukon and Northwest territories, Indian 
reserves and institutions (including homes for the aged). In the 
case of OAS, some $1 billion are not captured in the survey data. 
Further, incomes from some of the transfers are under-reported 
in the survey. (Reporting on the Survey of Consumer Finances is 
estimated by Statistics Canada to be 100 per cent for OAS, and 
85 per cent for the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans and for 
Unemployment Insurance.) Hence total expenditures on each 
program may not correspond with actual expenditures.
<P>
	(2) A family consists of either a husband and wife (including 
common law relationships) with or without never married 
children or a parent with never married children, living in the 
same dwelling. All other persons (including a single person 
living by himself/herself) are defined as separate family units.
<P>
	(3) Each income decile represents about 1,150,000 family 
units.
<P>
	(4) OAS expenditures are before taxes are collected, inluding 
the high income recovery.
<P>
	(5) Statistics Canada data does not report Canada and Quebec 
pension plan benefits separately.
<P>
	(6) The table does not include a number of other federal 
transfers to persons (e.g. veterans pensions and allowances) 
because Statistics Canada data does not report these transfers 
separately.

Question No. 14-<B>Mr. Hermanson:</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the conference on the deficit and the economy held by the 
Minister of Finance on December 13, 1993, at the Ottawa Conference Centre, 
were any of the conference participants' expenses, fees or honoraria paid by the 
government, and if so, what are the amounts, as well as the total costs of hosting 
the conference?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> With respect to the conference on the deficit and the 
economy held by the Minister of Finance on December 13, 1993, 
at the Ottawa Conference Centre, the Department of Finance 
paid $10,380.84 in participants' expenses. No fees or honoraria 
were paid by the government. The total cost of hosting the 
conference is $24,244.91.
<P>
Question No. 15-<B>Mr. Breitkreuz (Yellowhead):</B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>With respect to the GST and businesses which have gross sales exceeding $6 
million per annum, will the government amend the GST regulations to allow 
these businesses to make their remittances on a quarterly or 60-day basis rather 
than on a monthly basis?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Under the GST, only the largest 1 per cent of 
businesses must be monthly filers. Small businesses have, of 
course, much more flexible filing requirements.
<P>
	The filing periods for the GST are quite comparable to those 
in other countries.
<P>
	Providing large businesses with an extra 30 days to remit their 
GST would entail a one-time cash flow cost to the federal 
government of more than $1 billion. This translates into an 
ongoing interest cost of about $60 million per year.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BUDGETIMPLEMENTATIONACT,1994">BUDGET IMPLEMENTATION ACT, 1994</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-17, an act to amend certain statutes to implement certain 
provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 22, 
1994, be read the second time and referred to a committee; and 
of the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philip Mayfield (Cariboo-Chilcotin):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am pleased to rise and speak on Bill C-17.
<P>
	Overspending, high taxes and the enormous debt we are 
paying interest on are the big, big problems this government has 
still to deal with.
<P>
	I spoke before about high taxes that Canadians are paying, 
taxes that are preventing investment in Canada, taxes that are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3109"> 3109 </A></B>
<P>
making it necessary for both parents to go out and work so that 
they can pay their rent, their mortgage and feed their families.
<P>
	Most of all I talked about the fact that high taxes have resulted 
in an underground economy that is going to be difficult to stop. 
Sure, we have halted some of the smuggling of cigarettes 
because the government has cut the tobacco tax, but in its place 
is liquor smuggling. Stories in this week's press tell of 
warehouses stacked to the ceiling with contraband alcohol. The 
reason for this is the high taxes that Canadians are no longer 
willing to tolerate.
<P>
	I have also talked about the government's infrastructure 
program and the fact that it will not create the permanent high 
tech jobs this country needs. Rather, what we have coming are 
short term jobs, jobs that will last only as long as the 
government pours money into the program affected.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	I mention high tech jobs and the fact that the government 
seems to be shying away from the realities facing this country. 
Whether we want it or not, high technology is already here. It is 
going to affect all of us at some point. The information network 
is the first example that comes to my mind.
<P>
	But what does the government do? It announces it will be 
pulling out of the space program. It cancels KAON. Here the 
potential job programs of the right kind are to be found, high 
tech jobs. We are losing the opportunities to create and expand 
the kind of skills this country is going to need if we are to 
compete in future markets, markets that will be technology 
based.
<P>
	A constituent from Williams Lake, British Columbia wrote to 
me about the space program. He is convinced there are very 
good reasons that Canada should stay involved in the space 
program beyond the fact that it provides an insight into cutting 
edge technologies. My constituent goes on to say that he does 
not want to see Canada put on the back burner, but not getting 
involved in high tech industries will put Canada on the back 
burner.
<P>
	The future more so for the next generation is going to be 
exciting. High technology will ensure that this is so, but only to 
the extent that we keep up with all the changes. Just look at the 
last 10 years and the changes to the workplace brought about by 
computers. This leads me to my next point, being able to be a 
part of the changing face of the workplace.
<P>
	The February budget made reference to investing in jobs and 
people. Today the government will introduce its five point 
education program and work strategy program aimed at solving 
the problems of this country's youth, who are rapidly becoming 
known as the lost generation. The aim of the program is to create 
a new work ethic for young people between the ages of 15 and 
24. There will be apprenticeships and the Canadian youth 
service corps. Is this Katimavik revisited? There will be a 
learning package.
<P>
	Apprenticeships can be wonderful things. We do need young 
people to have formal training and marketable skills, but we 
must not leave it to the government to take responsibility for 
teaching the people. The private sector has to take the lead role 
so that people are trained for the jobs that will be there, not the 
jobs the government thinks might be there.
<P>
	The learning package is probably the most commendable part 
of the youth program. If it does offer hope to the youth, if it does 
offer promise and jobs, I commend the government on this. I 
sincerely hope it is not a false promise.
<P>
	In Tuesday's <I>Globe and Mail</I> there was an article by a young 
university student. This student passed comment about the fact 
that the professor had to take time from giving the economics 
lecture to give the class a lesson in grammar. It is a fact that 
some university students, although they have got into university 
and will probably get their degrees, still will be unable to 
function effectively in the real world of business and commerce 
because they cannot write a proper memo. They cannot 
reproduce a report or a letter that can be understood clearly. This 
is a major problem. It is not an isolated incident.
<P>
	The government intends to work developing national 
education standards in math, science and language skills. This is 
long overdue and is a good move by the government. Only when 
we ensure that our children can read, write and express 
themselves properly will we be able to see a decrease in the 
unemployment rates for the younger generation.
<P>
	Education is a major key to self esteem. What satisfaction to 
be able to pass the interview for a job and to adapt to the rapidly 
changing world marketplace.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	Although the government's first budget does have some 
positive attributes, it does not in any way address the most 
pressing problem facing the country: the need to get Canada's 
financial affairs under control.
<P>
	Many Canadians have learned how to cut back on spending 
because they have been forced by economic circumstances to do 
just that. However it is plain to see the federal government has 
not learned this whole lesson yet.
<P>
	Taxation at current levels is an abuse of power. We have a 
government that is taking money from people and businesses in 
such quantities that these people are unable to maintain their 
present standard of living.
<P>
	It is ludicrous when a young person with a minimum wage job 
has to try to borrow money to pay taxes because his employer 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3110"> 3110 </A></B>
<P>
did not deduct sufficient at the source. This is really being put 
between the proverbial rock and hard place.
<P>
	It is just as ludicrous when a small business person is forced to 
shut down because after taxes, licence fees, the cost of special 
audits and all the intrusions that can come from government the 
income is just not there. The business closes down and the 
employer and employees are out of work.
<P>
	At a time when the government could and must reduce its 
expenditures it stubbornly refuses to do so. Rather it borrows 
what it is unable to tax, while taking from people money needed 
to put food on their tables. What is the government using it for? 
Grants to special interest groups; building multicultural centres; 
enforcing bilingualism; grants to multinational corporations; 
duplication of services between departments and between 
provincial and federal governments. A lot of this is in the name 
of humanity and kindness.
<P>
	The government talks about Reform policies being of the 
slash and burn kind. The Reform Party has never advocated 
slash and burn policies as we have been accused. Instead we 
have proposed a program of maintaining essential services such 
as health care, pensions and education while prioritizing areas 
of expenditure reductions with a goal to reducing taxes. 
Non-essential programs that are a heavy drain on the treasury 
have to go if we are not to go belly up as a country. Effective 
prioritizing must begin. The government continues to avoid 
such prioritizing.
<P>
	For example as part of its so-called cuts in spending the 
Liberals have slated closing down the chinook salmon hatchery 
on the Quesnel River in Likely, British Columbia. The reason 
given is that the hatchery is uneconomical. This is true, but the 
reason it is uneconomical is it is being operated at 10 per cent of 
its capacity. How could it possibly be operating in an economic 
manner at such a low rate? The major risk of losing this hatchery 
is the real possibility of also losing the chinook salmon in the 
upper Fraser system. Along with the salmon will go the hatchery 
workers' jobs.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, I feel it is 
my duty to speak on Bill C-17, particularly the part concerning 
unemployment insurance. A duty because I am the member for 
Jonquière and-according to the weekend papers-the 
Chicoutimi-Jonquière region has again the unemployment 
record for Canada, 14.7 per cent. This is an official figure. You 
know as well as I do that many people are discouraged and no 
longer looking for work. These people do not show up in the 
statistics, but they nevertheless live in our communities.
<P>
	In my area, 25 per cent of the population might be on welfare 
or unemployment insurance. Last week, I received a paper from 
a professor at the Université du Québéc which said that, in my 
area, the rate might be close to 50 per cent if everyone who 
wants to work is counted. This is enormous. That is why I feel it 
is my duty to speak out.
<P>
	The bill reduces unemployment insurance payments, raises 
the minimum entry requirements and reduces the number of 
weeks during which unemployment insurance can be paid.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	I read the bill carefully and the only rationale for the 
government to introduce such a bill is to save money. I agree that 
government spending should be rationalized, and during the 
election campaign our party was calling for deeper cuts than the 
ones proposed.
<P>
	But why single out the unemployed? There seems to be a 
philosophy in that bill which says: ``That is it, the government is 
no longer going to support you, you are going to be thrown out in 
the street, and then you will have to manage on your own''. What 
we are doing is applying to the unemployed the law of the 
market, which is the law of the jungle. Everyone must manage 
on his or her own with less and less help from the community or 
the country.
<P>
	I find this attitude scary. We are telling the unemployed: ``You 
are probably out of work because you want it that way, you do 
not really want to work''. We are calling into question the 
honesty of our fellow citizens who, we claim, like to do nothing 
and get paid for it. You know this is not true.
<P>
	If we send people into the street to find jobs, there must be 
jobs to find. Where are they? The government has just launched 
an infrastructure program that is supposed to create 45,000 jobs 
in Canada. The program has just started and there is nothing 
concrete yet. Statistics show that many people would like to 
work, but are unemployed. Where are the jobs? We are often told 
that there are tens of thousands of unfilled positions because 
there is no one qualified to take them. Where are these 
positions?
<P>
	I am a guidance counsellor by training. Before I had the 
honour of representing the riding of Jonquière in this House, I 
worked in a vocational training centre and was, among other 
things, in charge of admissions. Whenever I met people who 
wanted to be retrained and better prepared for the workplace, 
some would ask: ``Which field has jobs available now?'' These 
people had read in the newspapers and heard politicians say that 
there might be tens of thousands of jobs available. Where are 
these jobs advertised? In the newspapers or in the offers of 
employment? We do not see very many there, nor on the bulletin 
boards of UI offices. In my riding, there are people skilled in 
leading sectors because they received training in new 
technologies at the Université du Québec in Chicoutimi. At the 
CEGEP in Jonquière, at the vocational centre where I worked, 
people are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3111"> 3111 </A></B>
<P>
told to develop skills because there will be jobs available, but 
these jobs simply do not exist.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if we reduce benefits and force the 
unemployed to go back to work, there should at least be jobs 
available, which is not the case. This is not the time for the 
Government of Canada to go after the unemployed. What is 
needed are well thought out policies to stimulate employment. 
And, in particular, we should take advantage of the current 
unemployment situation to retrain those who are in need of 
training.
<P>
	I mentioned earlier that I worked in a vocational training 
centre. I used to receive a lot of calls from unemployed people, 
since massive layoffs took place in my region, including at 
Alcan, Abitibi-Price, Cascades, as well as in some stores and 
other businesses. People are not stupid; they realized that they 
might not get their former job back, so they wanted to develop 
new skills and be retrained. This is why they would get in touch 
with the centre where I worked.
<P>
	I would meet with them to assess their retraining 
opportunities. But when it came to the crucial issue, that is, 
``how will I survive while I am retraining and while I am in 
school?'', I would tell them: ``Right now, you get your 
unemployment insurance benefits, but if you come to my 
training centre to take courses during the day, or even at night, 
and you join some groups that are already there to be trained, 
well, you will have to give up your benefits.'' People were 
saying: ``That does not make any sense, I have to support myself 
and my family.'' So, they would postpone their training plans.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	But this is absolutely criminal! It is criminal that, in 
vocational training centres like the one in Jonquière, there are 
spaces available in disciplines which are part of the new 
technologies, such as electro-mechanics, digital controls and 
refrigeration. In my training centre alone, hundreds of 
thousands of dollars have been invested in equipment and 
instruments. Often, these are not being used. And in the streets, 
in stores, there are thousands of people who want to be trained, 
but who are wandering around, trying to occupy their time.
<P>
	I think it would have been important in the present situation to 
have a concerted and effective vocational training policy which 
would make room for people and allow them to be supported by 
the community during their training. After that, they could go on 
the labour market and become an asset for society. But this is not 
what has been done.
<P>
	What did we do during that time in terms of training? We 
argued. I have witnessed that in my own training centre.
<P>
	Often, we waited for information from the federal 
government to see if unemployed workers wanted to apply for 
various training programs. At a certain point, the federal 
government would inform us that, for the time being, it did not 
have the funds and that personnel might be available in three or 
four months. Yet, workers cry out for training while various 
levels of government cannot agree on a clear policy.
<P>
	Members of the Bloc Quebecois have denounced the present 
overlapping in occupational training. The federal government 
makes decisions, the provinces make decisions, the Department 
of Education decides to structure its programs the way it wants 
and, at the end of the day, we have a situation where people who 
want to be trained have no training while places remain empty in 
our training centres.
<P>
	This is outrageous, and that is why I condemn this bill, 
because it sends the following message to the unemployed: You 
cost too much, we doubt you really want to get back into the 
labour market, and so we are going to shorten your benefit 
period, but things should turn out in the end. But they will not.
<P>
	One really wonders about the logic behind this kind of budget 
proposal. It takes a short-term view of the problem. The 
government wants to save billions of dollars in unemployment 
insurance benefits for a couple of years, but the money will be 
spent on welfare benefits because-and one of my colleagues 
made the point this morning-there are some very scary figures, 
and by that I mean that we can calculate the cost of the 
unemployment insurance measures proposed by the 
government. There are new welfare recipients in Quebec and 
people who are not eligible for unemployment insurance 
benefits. This is a frightening situation, because the government 
is introducing measures, knowing there will be a significant 
negative impact, and meanwhile, it does not hold out any hope 
for the unemployed.
<P>
	Last Wednesday, I attended a seminar organized by people 
who are concerned about regional development. At this seminar, 
a number of young people had this to say: We want jobs, and we 
want real jobs. We do not want another Katimavik program. We 
do not want be kept busy painting fences in the parks during the 
summer. We want to get into the labour market. We want to be 
part of the social, political and economic life of our country.
<P>
	Thank you for the opportunity to speak in this debate, and of 
course I will vote against Bill C-17, because I think it is 
absolutely unfair to the unemployed.
<P>

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Madam Speaker, I rise to 
speak against Bill C-17 which has been introduced with a fair 
amount of rhetoric but very little substance.
<P>
	I would like to quote from a news release dated Ottawa, March 
16, 1994 which says that the twin ``objectives of the bill are job 
creation and deficit reduction''. I started to think about job 
creation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3112"> 3112 </A></B>
<P>
	When the Liberals won the election in October of last year, 
one of their first acts was to cancel the helicopter program and 
introduce their job strategy-job creation program which was to 
pave more roads and build a few more sewers.
<P>
	Maybe we did not need the helicopter program but we 
certainly do need the experience, the research and the 
development in the high technology field. If there is anything 
that is going to bring this country out of the doldrums it is in and 
show us the way into the 21st century, surely it has to be the 
electronics industry rather than the paving industry.
<P>
	We have in front of us the electronic highway that will be 
crucial to the development of the technological business of 
industry over the next many number of years. We very much 
stand to lose our competitiveness around the world if we do not 
invest in this high tech area. Yet the government has seen fit to 
cancel everything in that area and introduce a subsidized, 
government paid job creation program that is going to pave 
some more roads and build some more sewers.
<P>
	We had the opportunity to develop a highway that would go at 
the speed of light and yet we think we are only going to build a 
highway on which we can only travel at 40 or 80 kilometres an 
hour. The electronic highway is the way of the future. It had 
vision. It had substance.
<P>
	The job creation program that the government sees has in my 
opinion no vision, no real hope for 400,000 young people. It has 
no real vision for saying: ``We have a program that is going to 
see you through school right through to your retirement. It will 
give you opportunity and prosperity''. All it can think of is short 
term job creation programs to help them through the summer 
and carry on from there.
<P>
	Six billion dollars was supposed to create 65,000 short term 
jobs. I understand that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development may be talking at a news conference at this very 
moment. As he said earlier today, he is going to announce a 
program to spend another $100 million for 10,000 young 
Canadians to see them through the summer. It is with no long 
term vision. That is what upsets me most about this bill.
<P>
	I read in the <I>Globe and Mail</I> today that the federal government 
and the Government of Quebec are now at loggerheads over 
which will do the job training in this part of the country. 
Therefore the whole idea of job creation is stymied, put on the 
shelf. It has been delayed. It has been postponed. Young people 
desperately need the government to get its act together to do job 
creation.
<P>
	The only job creation I see is that civil servants in Ottawa are 
at loggerheads with civil servants in Quebec City. That seems to 
be going on ad nauseam and it is not benefiting the country. It is 
not job creation.
<P>
	If we are going to have job creation and deficit reduction, 
surely we must hold out the vision of lower taxation, lower 
deficits and controlling the debt. As we tell Canadians, they are 
going to be faced with higher taxes and more government 
spending.
<P>
	There is no real incentive on anybody's part to invest in the 
real wealth creating jobs in this country. The government has to 
go back to square one and back to basics and rethink its whole 
strategy on job creation, job training, job motivation, building 
and creating wealth and prosperity. The bill is a very poor start.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	The government also said in its press release that there would 
be a two-year extension of the freeze of public service wages. 
Many Canadians would be glad to have a freeze if their jobs 
were assured. Jobs are in jeopardy; jobs have been lost. Many 
people are now on the unemployment rolls and are asking what 
their futures are.
<P>
	I would like to offer them some real hope that we are spending 
their tax money wisely, but I cannot even offer that. I am looking 
at the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> article of April 9 written by Mr. Greg 
Weston and entitled ``Pink (Slip) with Envy''. He writes about 
the fictitious Bob who has been working for the federal 
government as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No matter what Bob's rank in the bureaucracy, he will be given at least six 
months on the payroll to look for another job. During that time, he and other 
surplus people like him will have priority over everyone, everyone (except 
ex-political hacks) applying for similar positions elsewhere in the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	They are going to shuffle the deck at taxpayers' expense and 
maintain some jobs that may or may not be necessary in the 
federal government. Poor people out there are working hard to 
pay their taxes while civil servants in Ottawa and elsewhere 
around the country feel quite cosy with their job security and 
will not be laid off. The writer continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In fact, under a deal worked out with the unions in 1991 the government has 
agreed not to lay off anyone without first making them a ``reasonable job 
offer''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again the whole concept is to recycle the civil service rather 
than make it efficient, responsive, lean and affordable. He 
continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Even when Bob is finally given directions to the nearest unemployment 
insurance office, he still remains at the front of the government line for 
government jobs for another full year.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Even if somebody who is qualified and on UI he plays second 
fiddle to our hypothetical Bob who is at the front of the line just 
because he used to have a federal civil service job. He is 
guaranteed to be the first in line for the next one that comes 
along. In conclusion he writes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In the past seven years only 5,629 public servants were actually laid off. That 
is an average of about 800 a year out of the 230,000-odd people working for the 
federal government. Among those landing on the street, about 60 per cent spent 
more than six months on the public payroll doing nothing.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3113"> 3113 </A></B>
<P>
	Is that the type of job creation program the government likes: 
people being paid by average Canadians who have to pay their 
taxes to keep people on the public purse for doing nothing? He 
continues:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No one seems to have any accurate figures on what all this is costing Canadian 
taxpayers, but the tab is at least $60 million a year just for the 1,700-odd 
bureaucrats currently floating around in surplus never-never land.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That article tells us that the government has neither addressed 
deficit reduction nor job creation in a positive and serious way. 
It is time government members heard from all Canadians. They 
are certainly hearing from Reform Party members on this side of 
the House that it is time they acted seriously and brought in 
some serious job creation programs. That attitude would create 
an environment or playing field for the private sector to create 
job creation programs.
<P>
	While I still have time I would like to mention I am appalled 
the CBC is now going to be given authority to borrow money. 
Surely the country has enough debt. It is time to recognize we 
cannot keep borrowing money. We cannot keep giving every 
agency in the country the authority to borrow more money, off 
budget by the way, so the finance minister can tell us that the 
deficit is coming down. He has just passed the buck over to the 
CBC.
<P>
	I will wrap up my speech by saying I am opposed to the points 
raised in the bill. The government should bring in something 
positive and concrete to do the job properly.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harold Culbert (Carleton-Charlotte):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I stand today to respond to a few of the comments on 
Bill C-17 by members of the opposition this morning and on 
previous days.
<P>
	I am a strong believer that we have the good fortune of living 
in the greatest country in the world. I would also include the 
province of Quebec in my country. It is part of Canada today. We 
certainly look forward to it being part of Canada for many years 
in the future.
<P>
	With regard to Bill C-17, I am extremely proud of the 
Minister of Finance and the time he took for consultations 
across the nation. As every member of the House is well aware 
he gave every opportunity to bring forward expertise from the 
various sectors of our community and our business world. He 
did this in addition to bringing together a number of economists 
and other people with background and expertise in various 
fields.
<P>
	In addition he did something a little different. He allowed the 
House to have the opportunity of a pre-budget debate. Members 
of opposition parties had the opportunity to bring forth 
suggestions, ideas and input previous to presentation of the 
budget.
<P>
	I must welcome the occupant of the chair. We have a new 
Acting Speaker, a member from my home province of New 
Brunswick who looks exceptionally good in the chair of the 
House of Commons.
<P>
	I am extremely proud of the minister and the opportunity he 
gave each and every one of us in the House to bring forward our 
ideas and thoughts. It should not have been an opportunity just 
to bring forward our own thoughts and ideas on the subject 
matter. It should have been an opportunity for us to bring 
forward the thoughts and ideas of our constituents. Like every 
member of the House I received many pieces of correspondence 
and many telephone calls with sincere suggestions, input and 
ideas about the forthcoming budget.
<P>
	After all the consultation and opportunity, the Minister of 
Finance brought forward a balanced, fair and equitable budget 
for all parts of Canada and all Canadians. Some difficult 
decisions were made in the budget. They were difficult for the 
minister and for government members. Yet they were 
responsible decisions.
<P>
	For example, I am sure no one on the government side 
anticipated prior to the election a $46 billion projected deficit 
for 1993-94. Even after being presented with it, did the 
government back off and say it was going to change its plans? 
Was it going to do something different because it was new and 
different news? No. The government said that it made it more 
difficult but it was going to keep its commitment to Canadians 
over the next three years of 3 per cent of gross domestic product. 
The government is not going to back off. It is going to carry 
forward on the commitments made in the red book that all 
members of the House have held up from time to time and 
referred to by section and page. It was well read across Canada. 
It probably was the most well read book in 1993 and we are 
extremely pleased by that.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	The bottom line is that every decision the government has 
taken is looked at in light of what it would do to create an 
atmosphere in the country that gives our business sector an 
opportunity to create jobs for the future. We stated that up front, 
first and foremost, and we are backing it up today. We are going 
to continue to announce programs with that specific purpose in 
mind.
<P>
	I cannot imagine why that is something anyone should be 
ashamed of, as some opposition members mentioned earlier. I 
am extremely proud to be working with the Minister of Finance. 
We will certainly continue to work with him in that endeavour.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3114"> 3114 </A></B>
<P>
	Now is the time for the government, all members of the House 
and all other Canadians to work together. We have to continue to 
build confidence in our people and confidence in business and 
industry. They are the people who will create jobs in the future. 
Since February 22, the date the budget was brought down, that 
has been certainly brought forward to the people in my 
constituency and many other constituencies across the country. 
A new and modern Canada will see an opportunity for young 
people. This plan will bring back hope to Canadians, hope for 
their futures and the futures of their families.
<P>
	During the recent break we had a couple of weeks ago I had an 
opportunity to meet with many people across my constituency in 
public meetings. Their comments were very positive. They were 
saying: ``You are on the right track. Keep going in that direction. 
It is a good balance. It is a balanced budget. We think we can 
make it work''. They had the confidence we want to see.
<P>
	On arriving in Ottawa I am sure everyone in the House, 
especially the new members, had heard about our perks. One of 
the first things the government did was to look at the so-called 
perks. I have never had an opportunity to use low priced shoe 
shine outlets or to have low priced haircuts. Maybe that is 
obvious today. I have never had the opportunity to have free 
gymnasium workouts or masseurs. That was one of the things 
the government said first and foremost would be gone with one 
mighty slash.
<P>
	In comparison to a projected $46 billion deficit, $5 million 
may not sound like much but to me $5 million is a lot of money. 
To my constituents $5 million is a lot of money. I believe to most 
Canadians $5 million is a lot of money. That is the amount the 
action of eliminating those perks is projected to save Canadian 
taxpayers during the next year.  There is a lot more to be done, no 
question about that, but we have to continue moving forward 
with input and consultation with the citizens of the country. 
When we start working together that is when we start making 
accomplishments, that is when we start getting action and that is 
when we start building an economy and getting people back to 
work.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	I am not embarrassed by the fact that every decision the 
government has made is based on creating the opportunity for 
jobs. I am proud of the Minister of Finance and proud of this 
government. I am proud to continue working with this 
government toward that goal.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Thank 
you, Madam Speaker. I rise today on this bill and I will vote 
against it. This bill is a good example of why Canada does not 
work.
<P>
	Look at this morning's figures. I think that, instead of ``jobs, 
jobs, jobs,'' their party's election slogan should have been 
``welfare, welfare, welfare.'' In Newfoundland, the higher 
eligibility standards will throw  1,635 more people on welfare, 
while the reduced maximum number of weeks of benefits will 
increase welfare rolls by 1,370. In New Brunswick, welfare rolls 
will grow by 1,165 because of the higher eligibility 
requirements and by 1,335 because of the reduced maximum 
period of benefits.
<P>
	I would have expected government members representing 
ridings in these two provinces to rise and tell us that it does not 
make sense, that this is totally at odds with what their party said 
during the election campaign. This would have allowed the 
government to come to its senses and stop sending misleading 
messages.
<P>
	We are telling people that the economy is stalled, to be even 
more cautious, to avoid consuming more, to be careful. We act 
in a way that will make more people go on welfare, consume 
less, and contribute less to the economy. We kill off the weak 
recovery our society may be experiencing. It is a strange 
message to give to Quebec and Canada, to Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
	In their previous speeches, government members told us there 
was a free debate on the budget, that opposition parties could 
make suggestions. Good, I think that is the purpose of the House 
of Commons! That is not the problem, the problem is that our 
suggestions are not acted on. Every time we propose job creation 
programs to kick-start the economy and make people proud to 
earn a living, they come up with measures such as this 
legislation; it will only put more people on unemployment 
insurance.
<P>
	When I say that this bill is an example of why Canada does not 
work, it is because the people cut off from UI benefits will no 
longer have access to training programs linked to 
unemployment insurance. In that sense, it is linked to one of the 
fundamental problems with this system, namely its inefficiency 
when the federal government lacks the will to co-operate with 
the provinces.
<P>
	The minister of Human Resources Development told us that 
youth employment was the priority. Now he is surprised that the 
opposition raises the need to respect the wishes of the provinces 
in that area. The minister should be the first to know-I would 
say this is a very important quality in a minister-that, if you 
want to get somewhere, the co-operation of the people you are 
working with is essential. The only indication he has given was 
to the effect that he wanted to bulldoze the issue. The reform he 
had in mind was one that would override the wishes of Quebec in 
the area of manpower.
<P>
	What he did not bargain for, though-and it must have taught 
him a good lesson-was to see the governing federalists in 
Quebec, who can hardly be called ``big bad separatists'', pass a 
unanimous motion in the National Assembly yesterday. Here is 
what it said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3115"> 3115 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the National Assembly of Quebec ask Mr. Jean Chrétien and the federal 
Liberal government to abide by the unanimous consensus among all concerned 
in Quebec on the need for Quebec to have exclusive jurisdiction over manpower 
training.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It does not sound like a whim to me, yet it is said to be so in the 
case of the Parliament representing the only majority 
French-speaking nation in North America. It seems to me that 
some attention should be paid to that kind of thing.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	In a way, the bill before us reflects this government's problem 
in that it sends a double message: on the one hand, promote 
economic recovery, but oddly enough on the other hand, do it on 
the backs of the least fortunate in our society.
<P>
	Ontario will not be affected as much as other provinces by this 
reform, with 30 people or so not meeting the new eligibility 
requirements. That gives some idea of the influence the Ontario 
caucus has over this government, but I hope members who 
represent other provinces will make sure they have their say and 
convince the government to show a little more compassion for 
regional economies which do not necessarily keep going 
year-round. In that sense, I think it is important for the 
government to act quickly.
<P>
	I would have preferred to vote today on a bill setting up real 
job creation programs. This bill touches on several issues; in 
fact, we might even say that someone tried to smother the 
unemployment insurance issue in this great omnibus bill, but no 
one was fooled. We realize that the reform before the House 
today is the same reform the Conservatives introduced last year 
and which the Liberals have re-established and will continue to 
apply.
<P>
	That reminds me of the question Premier Daniel Johnson of 
Quebec, still a true federalist, put to this government. He asked: 
``Look, who is in charge in Ottawa, the bureaucrats or the 
government?'' That is what we have come to realize with this 
bill. The machinery of government kept working after October 
25, and no one bothered to stop it. That is why these things are 
still going on.
<P>
	When you live in the lovely Ottawa region, it is very easy to 
forget that some people are stuck with unemployment rates of 20 
or 25 per cent and to conclude that UI beneficiaries are people 
who do not want to work. It is not true. If the unemployed were 
happy, they would not have the highest rates of suicide and 
prescription drug use. They would not have to put up with high 
crime rates and other social problems.
<P>
	Some ridings and regions are more dependent on the 
econo-mic situation; in those regions, we need new ways of 
coping with structural change. But this government lacks 
imagination and awareness and takes no action.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I am very happy to be part of the Official 
Opposition because it gives me the opportunity to speak for 
those who have no voice here. The two provinces most affected 
are Newfoundland and New Brunswick. Quebec, too, is hard hit. 
We have been taking the floor for three days in an attempt to 
convince members opposite to change their mind. Government 
members should be rising to demand that this bill or at least the 
clauses on unemployment insurance be withdrawn.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank you 
very much for the opportunity to take part in the debate on Bill 
C-17.
<P>
	What I want to do in these 10 minutes is summarize the 
arguments of my colleagues in the last three days of debate. We 
have looked at this omnibus legislation and in all omnibus 
legislation we have a difficult time in deciding whether we vote 
for it or against it because involved in that type of legislation are 
often some good ideas and often ideas that are partly acceptable 
and some that are not acceptable at all. That is the choice we 
have to make in the final analysis, whether in an overall sense 
there is enough on the pro side to move one to a position of a vote 
of yes rather than a vote of no.
<P>
	That is the way the bill has been presented. The ruling of the 
Speaker was that is the way the debate will carry on and we 
intend to do that. We want to put the government on notice, 
however, that at committee stage and at report stage it is our 
intention to be very aggressive in some of the areas before us.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to touch on each of the important principles in the 
bill.
<P>
	First of all, with regard to public sector compensation, we 
support the government's freezing of salaries as it has at the 
present time and also the freezing of the increments. There may 
be some abnormal circumstances or anomalies arising during 
the next period of time and I hope the government will be 
considerate and compassionate. I hope it will be able to deal 
with any of the circumstances that may in an adverse way affect 
some employee in government who, in terms of their 
responsibility, may have a right to an increase or fair pay for the 
work that they present and the responsibilities that they take in 
the public service.
<P>
	I think of the Government of New Brunswick, I think of the 
government of Alberta when an issue such as this arises and the 
government either freezes a salary or reduces it. I have heard 
this from government and I have heard people in the public 
sector say they are being treated unfairly, governments are 
trying to balance their budgets on the back of the public service. 
We have to assess that statement and look at the framework in 
which it is being made.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3116"> 3116 </A></B>
<P>
	As I walk through my constituency-I am sure it would be 
consistent no matter what community I visited in Canada, 
whether it be a major urban centre or a small community-I find 
people supporting themselves through some entrepreneurial 
endeavour. I find that their incomes have been reduced in the 
last four to five years in a significant way. They have also 
reduced the number of their employees. In the majority of cases 
it is 20 per cent to 25 per cent.
<P>
	Their expectations have been lowered. They have made an 
adjustment in the business community. I visited 800 businesses 
in Lethbridge in the latter part of 1993 and again in 1994. They 
saw they were under economic pressure. The only way they 
could continue their businesses was to have a balanced book in 
which the revenues would somewhat equal the expenditures. 
They could not go out and borrow more to maintain their staff 
levels, their expenditure levels or the standard of living that they 
and their families were enjoying. They had to make adjustments.
<P>
	They made those adjustments. They quietly made them. Many 
of them maintained their businesses. They are in place looking 
for growth in the economy. Certainly they have placed their 
confidence in us as members of Parliament to assure and to work 
toward factors that will bring about that growth.
<P>
	They have made a significant adjustment, more than the 5 per 
cent that is being requested in the province of Alberta, more than 
the 7.5 per cent that is being requested in the province of British 
Columbia. On that basis we support this first move of the 
government in terms of freezing not only the levels of income 
but the increments that usually follow from year to year to the 
public service.
<P>
	The second area is the reductions to the Canada assistance 
plan and the Public Utilities Transfers Act. Again we recognize 
the need for that. The government must consider the fairness 
with which it is done. In 1991 a cap was put on the amount of 
money that was transferred to three of the provinces of Canada. 
The other seven provinces did not have that cap. Now the cap is 
being put on all of them. Supposedly there is equity in the 
distribution of funds so that each Canadian, in no matter which 
province, is treated fairly in terms of those programs. As 
members of Parliament we must examine the concept of 
equalization. I spoke on an earlier bill in this House that brought 
about the equalization formula. I made the point that if the 
equalization formula is right and fair and is doing its job, it will 
mean the equalization of funding across Canada for a variety of 
programs. If that is correct, every other program that 
redistributes income or dollars to the provinces or a transfer of 
dollars to individuals in Canada should be done on an equal 
basis because we have created equality. I hope when the 
government implements this program it keeps that principle in 
mind.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The third area in this bill is with regard to transportation 
subsidies. We would support these reductions in terms of our 
economic conditions because we have to make those kinds of 
decisions. We feel that western Canada in terms of the Western 
Grain Transportation Act and the maritimes should be involved 
in the decision-making and the government should consult 
those respective parties as these programs are delivered and the 
shared responsibility for them is taken.
<P>
	The other area in this bill is the borrowing authority that we 
are giving to the Canada Broadcasting Corporation. We do not 
support that because we feel this is only another avenue by 
which funding is going to the CBC in order to pick up its deficit. 
In the last fiscal year I believe its deficit was between $40 
million and $60 million.
<P>
	We do not believe this is the right thing to do and we certainly 
are going to be speaking about it in subsequent debate. We do 
not believe that the capital projects the CBC has in mind can be 
repaid in a period of two to three years as it stated to us in our 
briefing on this part of the bill. We do not believe that can 
happen.
<P>
	We believe that another means is being established by which 
the CBC is able to secure funds by borrowing. We must 
recognize that the Government of Canada, this Parliament, in 
the end result has the responsibility of picking up the deficit. If 
this plan of the CBC does not work, we are on the hook. It is just 
another way that public funds are put into the broadcasting 
system of this nation. We think this authority is opening up a 
valve that cannot be controlled by this Parliament, even though 
there is a lid of $25 million on the amount that can be borrowed.
<P>
	The last area is the area of unemployment insurance changes. 
I know that has received a lot of debate in the House, both the 
pros and cons, the good and the bad. We believe that this 
program should be put on an insurance basis so that if someone 
loses his or her job, he or she has income during the interim 
period between jobs. It should not be an income program as it 
has been. It has changed from its original objective to an income 
program in many instances.
<P>
	I know presumably responsible people who have highly paid 
jobs for three or four months who after that automatically go on 
unemployment insurance and take advantage of this government 
income. It is in every business community that we can think of. 
It is up to us as legislators to stop that in any way that we can.
<P>
	In conclusion, and I realize I only have a few seconds left, I 
will make these two points.
<P>
	First, we are going to vote against this because of the mixture 
of principles that are in the bill. Our position is weighted on the 
side to say nay to the bill.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3117"> 3117 </A></B>
<P>
	Second, we are opposed to some of the measures that are 
contained in the bill and we are concerned that the reforms do 
not go far enough. They could be extended and be better for 
Canadians.
<P>
	On that basis, and I summarize this for my colleagues in the 
Reform Party, it is our intent to vote nay on this second reading 
of the bill.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> 
Madam Speaker, during the two-week Easter break, I am sure 
many members, particularly those representing eastern regions, 
have had the opportunity to find out what their constituents and 
Canadians in general think about the conclusions and 
consequences of the last budget.
<P>
	In my riding, right in the middle of income tax time, people 
called by the dozen to complain and say how mad they were 
about the government digging again into their pockets to take 
more than what was planned. With the implementation of the 
new regulations on unemployment insurance, ordinary workers 
will again be the ones to foot the bill for the cuts imposed by the 
budget.
<P>
	Before the election, the Prime Minister said to people in his 
riding that he was still the ``little guy from Shawinigan'' and 
promised, in clear enough words as we all heard on TV, a shower 
of contracts that would create jobs in his region where the rate of 
unemployment is quite disastrous. A few weeks only after his 
election, he strikes; he goes after all the unemployed in his 
riding. We should not be surprised that the Prime Minister of 
Canada has to be surrounded by bodyguards when he visits his 
riding.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, I represent a riding in east-end Montreal, 
Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies. This district has been suffering 
the ill effects of the recession for longer than the rest of Canada. 
As for back as 1987, the government recognized the very serious 
case of chronic unemployment in that riding. That is why I want 
to talk about Bill C-17 today.
<P>
	According to the document tabled by the Minister of Human 
Resources Development at the time of the budget, and I quote: 
``The proposed changes to the UI program are designed to 
promote job creation, adequacy and fairness''. The minister is 
therefore telling us that the fundamental reasons for changing 
the unemployment insurance program are adequacy and 
fairness. We will see that it is not so. When you look at the bill 
before us, you realize that the Liberals have simply dug up a bill 
that was being prepared by the Conservatives, as others have 
already pointed out.
<P>
	As three researchers at the Université du Québéc à Montréal 
said in a study on the federal budget and the unemployed: ``The 
federal budget of February 22 forecasts a net reduction in the 
deficit of $8 billion for 1995-96'' but they say that only half of 
that, about $4.1 billion, will come from new measures 
announced by Finance Minister Martin. The other half comes 
from a continuation of the measures announced in the 
Mazankowski budget. Since Canadians and Quebecers have 
chosen to get rid of all but two of the members of the former 
government, one can safely assume that they were not exactly 
pleased with these ineffective measures to create jobs.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, in the study we just mentioned, the UQAM 
researchers dealt at some length with the inefficiency of these 
measures. They had this to say: ``We fear that reducing the 
length of the benefit period will be quite ineffective and will not 
bring about the desired results, namely, as to Mr. Axworthy 
himself said, to oblige recipients to work for a longer period of 
time in order to qualify for benefits for the same number of 
weeks. Current research does not allow us to draw conclusions 
on how the length of the benefit period affects job tenure and the 
length of unemployment in Canada''. They conclude on this 
note: ``It certainly does not support the minister's position''.
<P>
	And yet, the Minister of Human Resources Development had 
at his disposal the tools necessary to evaluate the inefficiency of 
the measures he was about to propose since, as early as the fall 
of 1993, the National Council of Welfare-a body created in 
1969 by the Liberal government of the time-said the following 
in its report: ``Changes to unemployment insurance which 
would exclude certain workers could lead to an increase in 
welfare rolls.''
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Ironically, this would add to the financial burden of the 
federal and provincial governments, which are already worried 
about their huge deficits. That is what we see happening in fact, 
although unemployment is supposed to have gone down a few 
points, in Quebec or the Maritimes or elsewhere.
<P>
	What is actually happening is that people are leaving 
unemployment insurance to go on welfare. There is no 
employment recovery, then; that is nonsense. The authors of this 
report continue: ``Before thinking of reducing unemployment 
insurance further, governments should do more research on the 
connections between unemployment insurance and social 
assistance.'' We can reasonably believe that, if the measures 
concerning unemployment insurance contained in this bill are 
adopted, any resulting decrease in the number of unemployed 
people will just add to the number on welfare.
<P>
	The government, for its part, estimates that the impact on 
provincial welfare programs will total $65 to $135 million. The 
study that we are quoting today speaks of $1 billion, of which 
$280 million would be borne by Quebec. As we clearly see, this 
government is just passing its deficit on to the provinces again. 
Meanwhile, our pseudo-premier of Quebec says nothing about 
it, but the voters are not fools. They well know that when the  
federal government transfers its deficit to the provinces, wheth-
<P>

<B><A NAME="3118"> 3118 </A></B>
<P>
er it is in Quebec City or in Ottawa, they always end up paying 
the bill.
<P>
	So what other issues or reasons could have motivated the 
minister to present this bill or have it passed? It is simply to 
lower the deficit. Once again, the poorest people in society are 
being made to bear the burden of the blunders committed 
previously by all levels of government.
<P>
	We all know that the government could have tried to save 
money quite differently. The three economists of the Université 
du Québec à Montréal mention one way, which I will quote here: 
``There was no shortage of ways to reduce federal spending 
besides the budget for unemployment insurance.'' The 
government could simply have opened the last few annual 
reports of the Auditor General of Canada-I should have 
brought them with me, they are very thick-in fact, any report at 
any page. It would have found enough cuts to make without once 
again going after the unemployed.
<P>
	Under the circumstances, we have no choice but to say that the 
government did not do its job properly. In fact, I should rephrase 
that comment because it is not strong enough. Once again, the 
Liberals merely pursued the previous government's policy, a 
policy which they vehemently criticized when they sat on this 
side and which allows the rich to get richer, while penalizing the 
poor.
<P>
	The report released by the National Council of Welfare 
clearly showed the way to go. Our priority should be to develop 
tax and economic policies which will lead to a reduction in the 
number of unemployed people. The best way to reduce 
dependency on welfare or unemployment insurance is to ensure 
full employment. But this is clearly not being done.
<P>
	People in my riding are fed up, and so are ordinary citizens in 
Quebec and in Canada. They are fed up with seeing their 
purchasing power being eroded day after day. They are fed up 
with seeing the deficit still growing after being told for years 
that it will diminish. Our only perspective is a disastrous deficit 
of $500 billion. And we are told that, for sure, it will climb to 
$600 billion in the next three years. People are fed up with 
seeing successive governments resort to the same old solutions 
which have already proven to be costly, ineffective and illogical.
<P>
	Last October, voters in Quebec realized of course that they 
should not support those who resort to these old solutions which 
have the direct effect of ruining the country. Soon, when the next 
provincial election is held, Quebecers will again display the 
same wisdom. It may be that, in the not too distant future, we 
will achieve the ultimate goal of this process and find the true 
solutions for us Quebecers by becoming a sovereign state which 
will eliminate the useless spending, wasting of public money 
and overlapping of systems which our governments have been 
tolerating for too long and which they ironically refer to as 
profitable federalism.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval)</B> moved
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That in the opinion of this House, the government should approach Canadian 
National Railways and have it authorize the privatization of the 
Franquet-Chapais trunk line for a nominal sum and ensure the maintenance 
and consolidation of the CRAN subdivision in the riding of Roberval, in order to 
promote mining and forestry development in the region.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, I am taking this opportunity to put 
this motion before the House so that it can be debated by 
members of Parliament, because in my riding of Roberval, and 
especially in the Chibougamau-Chapais area where mining 
development is vitally important, rail service is to be abandoned 
pretty soon.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3119"> 3119 </A></B>
<P>
	I know that the region of Lac-Saint-Jean and 
Chibougamau-Chapais is not the only one in Quebec, and 
indeed in Canada, where rail services are being shut down. I 
know that Crown corporations need to rationalize their 
expenses. I know the various services provided to Canadian 
taxpayers are expensive. But I also know that infrastructure is 
needed to further the economic development of a region.
<P>
	Some people will say that, of course, we must shut down trunk 
lines, especially those that are not really profitable. However, as 
far as the region of Lac-Saint-Jean is concerned, and especially 
the Chibougamau area, we are talking about a crucial 
infrastructure for mining development throughout the region.
<P>
	I know that members of this House are in the habit of using 
such expressions as ``it is vital for the development of my 
region'' and we ``cannot do without it''.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	In this instance, we should realize that a railway is frequently 
the only viable alternative for moving the output of mining 
companies from a remote region like Chibougamau-Chapais or 
even Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, both of which are quite far 
from Quebec City or Montreal. Infrastructure is needed to offset 
geographical disadvantages.
<P>
	I would not raise this issue in the House if the CN did not turn 
a deaf ear to repeated pleas by people in my riding. I would not 
make representations in the House if the Minister of Transport 
proved more sensitive to this problem.
<P>
	Yes, we can all agree on reducing rail service in many regions 
o Canada. We are ready to look at the problem responsibly as 
elected representatives who want to spend public money 
sparingly. My colleagues responsible for regional development 
and transport tried to make the Minister of Transport more 
aware of the problem and get regional public hearings before 
unfortunate decisions are made that could jeopardize the future 
of a whole industry.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I was not able to convince the Minister of 
Transport that he should review these decisions. I have found 
and read reports dating from the days when those who are now 
government members or ministers were in opposition. In a paper 
those people, including the present Minister of Transport, wrote 
and signed, we read that the Conservatives set out to dismantle 
our railway network, especially in Quebec. They called for an 
end to that strategy, which was being implemented 
irresponsibly, and demanded public hearings in affected areas to 
allow people there to at least have a say and voice their 
concerns.
<P>
	One cannot make cuts in a railway system, in an infrastructure 
essential to the development of an area, and get away with it, if 
one has not previously taken the  trouble to go to listen to local 
people and determine the risks involved in dismantling it.
<P>
	It has to be understood that there are two important rail lines 
in northern Quebec, namely the Franquet-Chapais line, which is 
the object of my presentation today, and the CRAN line.
<P>
	In the case of the Franquet-Chapais line, Canadian National 
Railways, when it submitted a request for abandonment, was 
authorized to dismantle this rail line in June. You can 
understand, Madam Speaker, how important it is to deal with 
this issue today because, starting in June, CN will be at liberty to 
dismantle the Franquet-Chapais rail line, the line between 
Franquet in the Abitibi and Chapais in the 
Chibougamau-Chapais region.
<P>
	Canadian National Railways has also indicated that it 
intended to ask the Transport Commission for authorization to 
abandon its operations on the CRAN line. For the benefit of 
those who are not familiar with the local geography, the 
Franquet-Chapais trunk line is presently not in use, operations 
having been stopped for some time already. The mining 
companies are using the CRAN line for their operations.
<P>
	Just imagine the vicious circle the people of 
Chibougamau-Chapais are caught in; they need rail service to 
carry their ore, but the Franquet-Chapais trunk line was closed 
down some months ago and is about to be dismantled, and now 
CN is announcing that in an effort to streamline, it has decided 
to drop rail service through the Lac-Saint-Jean region that 
allowed the companies to carry on their operations.
<P>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	It is absolutely unthinkable to use trucks for transportation in 
the mining sector. Yet, that is what the people of 
Chibougamau-Chapais are being told to do, use trucks to 
transport the ore to where the concentrators and the necessary 
facilities are. However, this would mean a 50-per-cent increase 
in transportation costs. Given the state of the economy today, 
what business could absorb a 50-per-cent increase in operating 
costs? In some respects, this decision jeopardizes the 
development of the Chibougamau-Chapais region.
<P>
	The Franquet-Chapais line is located along a geological fault 
where new deposits are discovered nearly every day. New hopes 
arise each day along the geological fault, from the 
Chibougamau-Chapais sector all the way to Abitibi. Ore 
deposits are being discovered every day and every day, new 
projects are on the verge of being launched. However, a decision 
such as the one Canadian National is preparing to make will 
snuff out any hope that the Chibougamau-Chapais region may 
have. This is a region in desperate need of hope, given its remote 
location in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3120"> 3120 </A></B>
<P>
northern Quebec, a region which relies on the discovery of new 
mines and new deposits for its development.
<P>
	The people of Chibougamau-Chapais are proud. They depend 
neither on the Quebec government nor on the federal 
government for their livelihood. They are involved in mining 
operations, make good money and contribute to the economy of 
this country, of Quebec, of the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean 
region and of Abitibi as a whole.
<P>
	What you have here is an entire region not begging for 
hand-outs or asking the government to go out of its way to 
create temporary jobs, an entire region capable of creating real, 
productive employment to help increase Canada's gross 
domestic product. You have people willing to contribute to our 
collective wealth. Are jobs not scarce these days? When any 
initiative should be welcome and every effort should be made to 
support economic development and job development instead of 
investing in social programs, temporary programs and even 
infrastructure programs?
<P>
	Here is a suggestion. The hon. members and ministers 
opposite are out of ideas and are wondering how to pull the 
country out of this recession. They are looking for ways to 
regain the considerable number of jobs lost in Quebec since the 
beginning of the recession. Figures published this week 
revealed that-if these timid actions are all this government has 
to propose-it will take three years to restore the level of 
employment enjoyed in Quebec before the recession. But when 
the people of Chibougamau-Chapais find new mineral 
deposits, propose economic development solutions, try to 
increase the wealth of this country, they see their initiatives 
jeopardized because the Minister of Transport disowns his 
signature.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport refuses to be sensitive to the people 
of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, of Chibougamau-Chapais. The 
Minister of Transport is no longer the man of the situation and 
the government refuses. The people responsible for setting up 
the economic team which it lacks flatly refuse to see the light.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The unemployment problem is caused by people who refuse to 
seize opportunities. However, the people of 
Chibougamau-Chapais, in desperation, decided to take matters 
into their own hands, to make up for this government's 
inefficiency, to thwart CN's plans and they called for the 
privatization of this trunk line. Let the champions of private 
enterprise stand up in this House, if there are any among the 
members across the way. They wanted to privatize the network, 
to have CN transfer the Franquet-Chapais line to the people of 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean-Chibougamau-Chapais for the 
nominal sum of one dollar so that they could keep this section in 
operation until such time as it will become absolutely 
indispensable, with new mining discoveries. Let these people 
hang on to this life buoy, this line which CN wants to dismantle.
<P>
	The request was made. Our people did their job. They asked 
CN and they got this answer: ``We would get $5 million for the 
line's old steel-the railway being made of steel-, so we are 
going to sell the line to you, the people of Chapais, for $5 
million.'' Big deal! CN is acting as if it had not stayed in 
business because of the taxpayers' money, as if it was the 
railway's sole owner and had paid for it without the help of 
taxpayers. It is forgetting that the Franquet-Chapais line, like 
all other rail lines in Canada, was paid for by the hard work of 
generations and generations of Canadian workers.
<P>
	Why should we deprive people of the opportunity to take 
charge of their own lives? Could someone across the way 
explain to me in a sensible way, without partisanship, trying 
only to think that we must help people, that we were elected to 
support our people, to defend them, to help them earn a living, 
could anyone explain to me why we should refuse the request of 
people who are not asking for anything, but only to buy for a 
nominal sum a rail line which was closed down by CN? Why 
refuse that? Is it impossible to respond to these demands? I 
appeal to my colleagues on the other side. I appeal to the 
Minister of Transport. I appeal to the Minister of Finance and 
Minister Responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development. I appeal to all my colleagues on this side of the 
House and my colleagues in the Opposition. Why should the 
government not reexamine such an issue and allow people to 
take control of their lives and ensure their development? What 
else does it want? Did it ever receive a more attractive proposal 
from a group of citizens who want to live, who want to survive, 
who want to ensure their development without asking anything 
from the government? I am proposing to the government a job 
creation program that will cost only one dollar, but will bring in 
lots of money to the government and will allow people from our 
region to use that infrastructure. While the government is 
putting millions and billions of dollars into the development of 
infrastructure that does not exist, it keeps citizens from 
acquiring, for one dollar, something which already exists and 
which is necessary. Explain that to me, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Finally, I would like to tell you that this issue is very serious 
for my region and for Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. There are so 
many raiy lines in western Canada. And we agree that they are 
needed.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	We understand that for the sake of the economy in that region, 
it is necessary to use rail lines as links between urban and rural 
centres, in order to transport grain and various commodities. We 
understand that. There is no one on this side who has asked to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3121"> 3121 </A></B>
<P>
dismantle those lines. Everyone agrees that they are important 
for the economic development of that part of the country.
<P>
	But we ask that the same sensitivity been shown towards the 
East. Why should that not be the case in the East also? What 
makes Chibougameau-Chapais less remote than any other area 
in the West, say northern Manitoba or Saskatchewan? Where is 
the difference? Lines are maintained when they are important to 
development in western Canada, and we agree with that. But we 
cannot agree to the dismantling of rail lines that belong to us in 
our area.
<P>
	Moreover, we want to buy that line and keep it open. We 
simply want Canadian National to give us back the taxes we paid 
to finance the construction of those trunk lines. As I see it, the 
Canadian National is a one-way organization. They pull the 
plug to drain away the savings of Canadians but when the time 
comes to open the tap at the other end, there is nothing left. I 
think this is the way things are done.
<P>
	We would ask the government to take action on that issue in a 
non-partisan way and without using the schemes that some 
would want to see implemented in that case. There is no concept 
as reasonable and as cheap as the one that has been submitted to 
this House to guarantee the development of a region.
<P>
	Some businesses will inevitably close down if that trunk line 
is abandoned. With a 50 per cent increase in transportation 
costs, it will not be possible to ensure the economic 
development of Chibougamau-Chapais. Annual wages of 
$50,000, $60,000 and $70,000 are paid in the mining sector. Our 
people are proud of those wages, but they work very hard to earn 
them. However, we need help. Is there anyone in this House who 
would refuse to support a motion that gives one dollar to the 
government, that ensures the development and the pride of a 
region, that ensures people that their livelihood will not be taken 
away from them?
<P>
	I see that my time is up, Madam Speaker, but I would ask the 
members of this House to show solidarity. We have to save the 
Franquet-Chapais trunk line. We have to hold public hearings 
on the dismantling of the rail network in Quebec and in the rest 
of Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to speak on Motion 
M-194, presented by the member for Roberval. The motion asks 
the government to call on Canadian National Railways to sell 
the Chapais line for a nominal sum and to ensure that CN 
maintains the neighbouring CRAN subdivision.
<P>
	Concerning the first part of the motion, let me first give a 
brief summary of the present situation of the Chapais 
subdivision and to explain how it got that way.
<P>
	Parliament delegated to the National Transportation Agency 
the powers necessary to enforce the provisions of the National 
Transportation Act, 1987, on the abandonment of rail lines.
<P>
	In 1987 CN asked the Agency for the authorization to abandon 
a 90-mile section of the Chapais subdivision, between Franquet 
and Chapais, because it was losing money on it.
<P>
	After reviewing the case presented by CN and the testimony 
gathered at public hearings held in 1989 across northern 
Quebec, the Agency agreed that the line was not cost-efficient 
but that there was a reasonable probability of it becoming so in 
the foreseeable future and that its operation should be 
maintained in the public interest.
<P>
	Consequently, on January 31, 1990, the Agency rendered a 
decision ordering CN to keep operating the line.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	As provided for in the law, three years later, the agency 
reviewed CN's application for abandonment and ruled that, with 
the exception of a six-mile section, the line was not profitable 
and there was no reason to believe it could eventually turn a 
profit.
<P>
	On July 12, 1993, the agency ordered CN to continue 
operating the six-mile section between Franquet and a site near 
Grevet and allowed CN to stop operating the 91-mile 
Grevet-Chapais section as of August 12, 1993.
<P>
	I must stress that, in the last five years, the line was only used 
in November 1992 to transport Hydro-Quebec transformers.
<P>
	We must realize that the operation of this line costs CN over 
$600,000 in annual losses. Since the NTA order requires CN to 
keep the line in service, CN receives compensation for its losses 
from the federal government, or rather from taxpayers. So the 
Chapais subdivision is operational but does not handle any 
traffic.
<P>
	It is quite understandable that local communities, fearing the 
impact losing the line would have on their economic 
development, lobbied the former government, which issued an 
order delaying abandonment until May 31, 1994. The purpose of 
this nine-month delay was to allow interested parties to review 
various options to maintain the line.
<P>
	CN is ready to sell the line. However, nothing is happening 
and CN should be allowed to go ahead. But the matter is not 
necessarily closed. Once the abandonment order is in effect, CN 
can sell its right of way and facilities without any kind of federal 
regulatory approval, which it cannot do at the present time. 
Currently any interested buyer can negotiate a selling price for 
the line with CN.
<P>
	Which brings us to a very interesting aspect of this motion, 
the expression ``nominal sum''. As a commercial Crown 
corporation, CN received from Parliament the mandate to 
operate like a business in order to remain  viable. I fear that a 
business cannot 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3122"> 3122 </A></B>
<P>
remain viable if it sells land and salvageable steel rails for what 
is commonly called a ``nominal sum.'' Too often, we associate 
the concept of ``nominal sum'' with the amount of $1, instead of 
at least considering net salvage value which can amount to 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	It is therefore not necessary for the government to authorize 
CN to sell the Chapais subdivision. CN is ready to sell the line at 
a price equivalent to the value of the land and the net salvage 
value of the track facilities. It has all the necessary authority for 
this.
<P>
	Madam Speaker, if I may, I will briefly talk about the second 
part of the motion, that is to obtain a guarantee that CN will 
maintain the neighbouring CRAN subdivision, and make sure 
that it is integrated in such way as to promote mining and 
logging in the region.
<P>
	Maybe I should apologize, but I do not understand the 
meaning of the word ``integration'' in this context, and neither 
do the officials of Transport Canada. The CRAN subdivision is a 
side track to and from transfer points to lines with much heavier 
traffic. In order to be operated properly and safely, the track and 
the related infrastructure must be properly integrated.
<P>
	As for the maintenance of the CRAN subdivision, CN is 
seeing to it. CN also uses this track for rail traffic within the 
region. Railway activities and maintenance work done by CN in 
the CRAN subdivision are regulated by the government and 
supervised by railway safety inspectors designated by the 
minister.
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to insist on the fact that existing 
statutory provisions and policies allow for the purchase of the 
CN's Chapais subdivision. CN wants to sell the line. As for the 
CRAN subdivision, it is operated by CN according to operation 
and maintenance standards approved by the federal government 
under the Railway Safety Act.
<P>
<B>(1400) </B>
<P>
	For all these reasons, I cannot support the motion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am very disappointed by the answer from the 
government member to the motion of the hon. member for 
Roberval asking for the maintenance of some railroad lines in 
Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. When you listen to the government 
member, we would almost think we were hearing CN officials. I 
imagine that the member's reply was prepared by CN officials, 
because what we just heard is almost exactly the same as the 
letters sent in recent years by CN to all concerned, regarding this 
line.
<P>
	The problem with this government is its lack of sensitivity to 
regional development and its lack of vision when it comes to 
public policies. This comment has been made before, but this is 
yet another prime example of this shortcoming. The Liberals are 
merely repeating the mistakes of the previous Conservative 
government which they so vehemently criticized for years in the 
House and  elsewhere, insisting all along that it be more 
compassionate and more sensitive to the regions.
<P>
	This is a good example where residents of a region, in this 
particular case Lac-Saint-Jean and Chibougamau, are not 
asking for subsidies. They are not begging to get money from the 
government in order to maintain and preserve their economic 
development. If the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands 
gives me a few moments, I will convince him of the merits of 
this motion.
<P>
	People from Chibougamau-Chapais and from 
Lac-Saint-Jean are merely asking that we respect their desire to 
look after their own economic development in the years to come.
<P>
	In his reply, the Liberal member used CN figures when he said 
that, in recent years, the line had been used once by 
Hydro-Quebec to transport transformers.
<P>
	The hon. member for Roberval spent 20 minutes explaining 
why rail service must be maintained in this region, and he 
pointed out that, nowadays, given the crisis in the mining 
industry, the rail line is not being used as much as it would be if 
there were a boom in mining development. Who knows, in a 
week, a year or two years from now, the mining industry may 
enjoy an incredible boom. What would happen then, Madam 
Speaker, if we decide now to dismantle the rail lines and get rid 
of this infrastructure? The taxpayers will have to reach into their 
pockets once again to rebuild roads or rail lines in order to 
further the economic development of their region.
<P>
	In his speech, the hon. member for Roberval raised another 
important issue to which I want to come back, and that is the 
ownership of this rail line.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	This rail line does not belong to the private sector but to a 
public institution called Canadian National. As my colleague 
has mentioned, for many decades, in fact for more than a 
century, Quebecers and all Canadians as well were involved in 
financing and maintaining this service in all regions of Canada. 
Therefore, they are the real owners. This rail line does not 
belong to the President of Canadian National or to officials in 
the Department of Transport. It belongs to the citizens who paid 
for it over and over again.
<P>
	If we had to keep in mind only this criterion, which is the 
immediate cost effectiveness of a rail line, what would happen 
to the rail lines in western Canada which get hundreds of 
millions of dollars in subsidies for grain transportation? As my 
colleague pointed out, we, in the Bloc, are not opposed to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3123"> 3123 </A></B>
<P>
subsidizing grain transportation in the West. We want fair 
treatment.
<P>
	In this case, we are not asking for subsidies. I repeat, what we 
want is to allow the people of Lac-Saint-Jean and 
Chibougamau-Chapais, who have always shown considerable 
dynamism in their economic development, to allow these 
people, who are simply asking their government to show some 
sensitivity, to acquire this segment of the railway, which they 
will manage to make profitable.
<P>
	Does this mean, and are we to conclude from what was said by 
the Liberal member, that the only way the people of 
Lac-Saint-Jean and Chibougamau will be able to save this rail 
line and obtain ownership will be when we have a sovereign 
Quebec and own a railway network that has been paid for many 
times over? That is when the people of this region will really be 
able to take control of the development of their area.
<P>
	We are always being accused in this House of bringing up 
Quebec's sovereignty, but the technocratic and unfeeling 
response of the member from Ottawa leaves us no alternative.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to return to this government's lack 
of vision on the issue of railways. To paraphrase a common 
expression, one could well ask: Who is minding the Department 
of Transport?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead): </B>Is there 
anyone who is capable of making decisions? In the next few 
months, there will be some important changes in the railway 
sector in eastern Canada, and I am referring to the CN-CP 
merger. The government is waiting for a decision from senior 
officials to find out whether or not to recommend the merger.
<P>
	A number of decisions must be made now, including whether 
or not to proceed with the CN-CP merger, and to conduct studies 
on the viability of the rail lines, and finally to help the people of 
Lac-Saint-Jean and of Chibougamau-Chapais take control of 
the development of their economy by letting them develop this 
rail line.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I would like to raise a few points and some issues with 
regard to the motion by the hon. member for Roberval.
<P>
	I am going to be as frank and straightforward as I can possibly 
be with him. Hopefully by doing so I will be able to get closer to 
the heart of what he is proposing.
<P>
	I would welcome the opportunity to have the various doubts I 
have about the member's motion cleared up. First I should spell 
out some of the issues as I see them. To begin with let us take a 
good look at the Franquet-Chapais line that the member is in 
favour of privatizing. Let us examine the history of this trunk 
line so that we can better understand what it is that is being 
requested.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	The line in question, which is 97 miles long, is located in 
northern Quebec. This is a rather short line but it would make no 
difference to Canadian National which controls the line if this 
route were considered a profitable one. However, it is not. Let 
me make myself very clear about that because CN officials have 
stated unequivocally to me that the Franquet-Chapais line is not 
profitable and has not been for quite some time.
<P>
	CN Rail first applied to the National Transportation Agency 
for abandonment of the line in 1989. At that point, to quote the 
railroad, there was no traffic at all on the line in question.
<P>
	The NTA ruled that the line was not economical to maintain 
and operate and stated that there was no near term possibility for 
that line to become profitable. At that time the NTA also pointed 
out there was a reasonable possibility the line could be 
economically valuable at some point down the road.
<P>
	As a result of this CN Rail was told to continue operating the 
line for a period of three more years to determine beyond a doubt 
whether the line had any economic potential. As it turned out, it 
did not.
<P>
	The Franquet-Chapais line has been a drain on CN's 
resources ever since and traffic on that line has continued to be 
next to non-existent.
<P>
	In 1992 the NTA reviewed the case again and ruled that all but 
six miles of the entire 97-mile route were uneconomical with 
``no possibility that it could become feasible to operate''.
<P>
	Since that time the line has existed in a sort of railway 
hinterland. It has not been abandoned outright but this is due to 
occur on May 31, 1994, unless a private buyer can be found for 
the line.
<P>
	What should we make of this? I presume the hon. member for 
Roberval raised this motion in order to head off the unhappy 
destiny this trunk line is about to meet. I think that is both an 
honourable and just thing for him to do. After all CN has stated 
quite flatly it has no use for that line and no desire to keep it in 
service any longer.
<P>
	The member has nothing to lose by putting forward his 
privatization motion and everything to gain.
<P>
	I would like to point out a few minor things, however, which 
may run against what the member is trying to accomplish with 
his motion. Number one, allow me to say to this House that 
although the Franquet-Chapais line has been on the CN auction 
block for a good number of years not a single private or public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3124"> 3124 </A></B>
<P>
body has ever expressed a concrete interest to CN officials in 
purchasing the line, not one, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	Where then would the hon. member suggest a a real buyer be 
found for this trunk line? It may be accurate for him to say that 
such a line would allow mining and forestry development in the 
northern region of Quebec but such potential did not transpire 
overnight.
<P>
	Even when the Canadian economy was booming and prices 
were high for mineral and wood products, there was not one 
proposal put forward to CN which called for the 97-mile route to 
be taken off the railroad's hands.
<P>
	With this in mind at a time when the natural resource industry 
remained depressed I sincerely do not know how the member 
hopes to find a saviour, a white knight who will rescue the 
Franquet-Chapais line from its ultimate fate.
<P>
	Let us not be mistaken. CN Rail has not been jealously 
guarding its many trunk and feeder lines in the hope of 
preventing potential buyers from taking them away and making 
better use of them. Quite the contrary, in fact.
<P>
	For a number of years Canadian National has been making a 
strong concerted effort to sell off its smaller lines to private 
interests in hopes of concentrating more fully on the primary 
areas of operation and reducing its staff and maintenance costs. 
The sell-off has been even more actively promoted in eastern 
Canada. In fact, CN even went so far as to produce a line of all 
trunk lines that it felt had a real potential for interested buyers. 
Unfortunately the Franquet-Chapais line did not make that list. 
I believe the reason for this was simple. It has been a consistent 
money loser for years while many of CN's other trunk lines were 
managing to turn a profit.
<P>
	What is one to make of this predicament? CN Rail went even 
further to do away with lines like the one in question. It actively 
pursued sales offers not only from the private industry but also 
from other public entities such as municipalities and even the 
Quebec government. Not one of these bodies expressed an 
interest in taking on the Franquet-Chapais line.
<P>
<B>(1415 ) </B>
<P>
	Simply put, CN Rail would love someone to take the line off 
its hands but no one has approached the railroad about it and 
time is running out for anyone to do so. Therefore, what am I to 
make of the hon. member's motion? It is certainly well 
intentioned and I commend him for that but I honestly do not 
know if it is feasible. This is where my concern lies.
<P>
	That is not the end of the confusion surrounding this motion. 
Officials I have spoken with at CN expressed some concern 
about the vague terminology of the member's motion, especially 
the phrase that calls for the line to be offered to a bidder for a 
nominal sum. What is exactly meant by this unclear choice of 
words? He has cleared that up a bit today.
<P>
	In terms of what CN Rail would actually be willing to see the 
Franquet-Chapais line sold for, federal transportation policy is 
very explicit and, I might add, quite reasonable. If a company 
wishes to take over unwanted rail line from its owner at any 
point during the abandonment process and is willing to pay the 
basic salvage value of the rail line as determined by the National 
Transportation Agency then the railroad must sell the line in 
question.
<P>
	In the case of the Franquet-Chapais line this abandonment 
process has been dragging on for a period of five years but no 
potential buyers have forced CN to divest itself of this asset. I 
may point out that the concept of salvage value is important here 
because it shows that CN could not possibly be holding on to a 
money losing line because it is not getting top dollar offers from 
outside sources.
<P>
	In actual truth the railway simply has not received any 
purchase offers for the Franquet-Chapais line, period. It could 
be that in this case the total salvage value of the 97-mile route 
would turn out to be nothing more than a nominal sum. Is this 
what the hon. member is actually driving at?
<P>
	My impression is that he would be satisfied to turn the trunk 
line over to private interests for the sum of $1. Certainly this 
would accomplish his goal but it would not be a benefit to CN. It 
would open every line in its system to takeover for $1. In fact, 
CN Rail would never agree to such a proposal and this is the hard 
fact of the situation. The Franquet-Chapais line is worth more to 
CN sitting idle than it would be as a gift to private investors.
<P>
	Let me express my sincere sympathy for the member for 
Roberval because I understand very well what he is trying to 
accomplish with his motion. My riding is also facing rail 
problems similar to those that have plagued the 
Franquet-Chapais trunk line.
<P>
	In British Columbia's Slocan Valley, a rail line is being 
threatened with closure because of a variety of negative 
economic factors. I understand what the member is driving at. I 
am now trying to get abandonment proceedings delayed in my 
own riding just as has been done in the past in the hon. member's 
own area.
<P>
	If a delay in Slocan Valley is successful as it was in his own 
area with the Franquet-Chapais line, then it should be up to that 
specific area to promote rail business through local economic 
development if the people of that area want to keep the rail line 
in the long term.
<P>
	In the case of the Franquet-Chapais line the citizens of the 
region had the chance of stretching it over a five-year period to 
bring about the renewal and redevelopment of the line. 
Unfortunately, it appears that nothing was done with this 
opportunity. This suggests that there simply was no business to 
promote on the line to begin with.
<P>
	Hopefully the Slocan valley rail line that is now on the 
chopping block will be given the same chance for renewal the 
Franquet-Chapais line has already had. Hopefully we will be 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3125"> 3125 </A></B>
<P>
able to accomplish more with our opportunity  and save our line 
by making it more economically viable for private industry.
<P>
	However, I do not know how much more can be done in the 
case of the rail line advocated by motion 194. Private and public 
investors have had since 1989 to revamp and reinvest in the line 
and return it to profitability. This has not been done.
<P>
	I do sympathize with the hon. member's motion but 
unfortunately I simply do not believe there are any simple 
solutions to be gained from motion 194.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Richardson (Perth-Wellington-Waterloo):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I thank you for this opportunity to address this 
House in French. After only six weeks of French classes, I know 
I still make mistakes. I agree with the member for Roberval.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	CNR, CPR and VIA serve Canada.
<P>
	It is easy for the member for Kootenay West to get up and 
reject outright the thesis of the member for Roberval when he is 
harboured by the Western Grain Transportation Act. They get 
underwriting which is a subsidy that is not able to be taken by 
the member for Roberval's CNR track. There is also the Crows 
Nest Pass and I can go on and on.
<P>
	This whole thing is why I support the member for Roberval. 
CNR, CPR and VIA pick off whatever line they like each year 
until all they have left are very few Canadians who have access 
to public transportation which has been enormously supported 
since Confederation; billions and billions of dollars have gone 
into CPR and CNR, particularly in the west.
<P>
	Please, enough of throwing mud at each other. Let us work 
together for a national rail strategy that will serve Canada in the 
21st century and not leave one section out to the benefit of 
another.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réginald Bélair (Cochrane-Superior):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I feel compelled to take part in this debate today and 
support the motion put forward by the hon. member for Roberval 
since my riding of Cochrane-Superior, like many other rural 
ridings across Canada, is experiencing the very same problems.
<P>
	First of all, we have to remind CN that its primary mandate is 
to promote regional development by ensuring the operation of 
rail lines across the country so that remote areas in particular 
can develop economically and have access to urban 
communities in Canada.
<P>
	I find it extremely unfortunate that CN has adopted such a 
policy over the last few years. We who live in rural areas of this 
country are beginning to feel abandoned. We are seeing our 
chances of becoming self-sufficient diminish.
<P>
	Even though CN wants to abandon rail lines, the National 
Transportation Agency could intervene to save them, if only it to 
ensure the future development of our regions.
<P>
	A few moments ago, I talked about people feeling isolated. 
Once rail is gone, what are you going to replace it with? Whether 
we use a bus, a truck or anything else, it will still cost money.
<P>
	I repeat and maintain that CN has responsibilities to isolated 
areas and to its employees; it has a moral duty to ensure that all 
regions of the country have a chance to develop. Dismantling 
unprofitable branch lines is no way for CN to fulfil its mandate. 
Absolutely not.
<P>
	I strongly disagree with what my colleague from 
Carleton-Gloucester was saying a while ago. At this stage I 
would like to make a very important digression.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair: </B>I am astounded, to say the least, when I see 
members from urban areas, who have probably never seen a 
rural rail line, rise in this House to denounce or deny support for 
the concerns of their rural colleagues.
<P>
	Thank you, Madam Speaker, for granting me this opportunity 
to voice my concern.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> You still have some time 
left.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bélair:</B> Thank you, but I said what I had to say.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, hearing the 
member for Carleton-Gloucester on the profitability of the 
trunk line, which my colleague from Roberval wants to save 
from destruction, from being scrapped, I was reminded that 
some people have never travelled to the regions. Some people 
have never seen what an isolated region of Canada is.
<P>
	I am from the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region where the 
Chibougamau-Chapais area is located and I can tell you that 
this region is 150 years old. The first settlers used axes and 
two-handed saws to clear the land in the hope of finding some 
future north of Quebec City. These people worked like slaves 
and never stopped fighting to open up the area to the rest of the 
world and to get means of transportation. They fought to obtain 
a road from Charlevoix to Chicoutimi. They fought for a rail line 
from Quebec City to Chicoutimi and Roberval. They fought for 
the Chibougamau road and for a road from Chicoutimi to 
Sacré-Coeur on the North Shore. More recently, they fought for 
the road to the Far North which gives us access to the 
development of the great dams being built in northern Quebec.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3126"> 3126 </A></B>
<P>
	Today, they tell us they will close part of a rail line in the 
Chibougamau region. Of course that line is not being used at the 
moment. There is a recession, our mines are closed, our miners 
are unemployed and they are cutting their benefits so these 
people will now have to resort to welfare. They are closing the 
doors to the future for these people; they tell them their railroad 
is worthless, it is not profitable it will be closed and that they 
will make $5 million by selling the metal. It is the answer of a 
scrap dealer.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Caron:</B> It is not the answer of someone interested in 
regional development.
<P>
	Last Wednesday I took part in a symposium organized in 
Chicoutimi by people who want to plan their regional 
development. They want to draw up a strategic development 
plan for their area. Today, they will be told to forget about 
including Chibougamau-Chapais in their plan because there 
are people in the Department of Transport and at the CN who say 
that if the rail line is not profitable, it must be closed. At this 
rate, all the roads to Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean are going to be 
closed. What highway pays for itself? What is the government's 
duty?
<P>
	The duty of the government is to provide services, it is not to 
calculate their cost-effectiveness to the penny. Is the Jonquière 
Hospital cost effective? Of course not. Is the CEGEP in 
Jonquière cost effective? People will say that we spend millions 
of dollars, we train people and some of these young people are 
unemployed, because of the economic policies of past and 
present governments. It is not profitable, so close it down. At 
that rate, let us close Canada down. Is Canada profitable? 
Canada is running a $40-billion deficit, so close Canada down.
<P>
	That is why I support the previous speaker's thinking, not on 
shutting down Canada, but on closing down railways in outlying 
regions. They are extremely important, they are our arteries, our 
lifeblood, our economic development depends on them. If we 
start closing them, we will be paralysed. That is how paralysis 
occurs in the human body; blood stops circulating. If you close 
our railways and our highways, if you do not give us the 
infrastructure we need to develop, we will be paralysed and die.
<P>
	I am pleased to support the motion of my colleague from 
Roberval and I am sure that hon. members will support it too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of 
the Government in the House of Commons):</B> Madam Speaker, 
the speech of the opposition House leader was so interesting that 
I felt I had to add a few words.
<P>
	The hon. member forgot something. I remember quite well 
that during a by election in the Lac-Saint-Jean region a few 
years ago, the Conservative government spent $143 million to 
help elect the present opposition leader as member for 
Lac-Saint-Jean. Why did the hon. member not ask him to be 
generous with this project, to be its benefactor in return for all 
the money that was spent?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Really the money was spent. They should have named this 
project as one of the things they spent the money on instead of 
spending it on all of the other projects.
<P>
	The hon. member knows his leader got this money to get him 
elected into this House. They spent $143 million on one 
byelection in one riding. It is an extraordinary confession when 
he comes to this House pleading for more money for his riding 
when all that money was spent in that area just to get his leader 
elected and he did not get him to do it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> The hour provided for 
the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired. Pursuant to Standing Order 96(1), this item is dropped 
from the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m. the House stands adjourned until Monday
