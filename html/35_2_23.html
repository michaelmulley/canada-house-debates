<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADAHEALTHACT">CANADA HEALTH ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-251, an act to amend the Canada Health 
Act (conditions for contributions).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, the need for this bill arises out of the lack 
of a nationally organized and managed protocol for notification of 
infectious diseases. Although Health Canada did issue a protocol 
for notification recently, it is purely voluntary in nature and 
therefore inadequate.
<P>
	I am extremely concerned about the federal government's lack of 
action on this important issue. With each passing year the federal 
politicians fail to move on this vitally needed plan and more and 
more lives are being put in unnecessary danger.
<P>
	Canada's emergency response personnel such as firefighters 
routinely risk their lives to keep our communities safe, and yet 
government has not yet extended the courtesy of providing further 
protection for these workers in the course of carrying out their 
duties.
<P>
	Emergency response personnel may come into contact with a 
variety of contagious diseases in the course of carrying out their 
duties.
<P>
	As a result, a procedure is needed that allows hospitals to quickly 
inform these personnel when patients they have handled in a 
vehicle rescue or any other type of situation carry a communicable 
disease such as hepatitis or AIDS.
<P>
	Knowing essential facts like this quickly and efficiently is the 
first step in preventing contact with a communicable disease from 
turning into something worse. Notification procedure allows for 
testing and early treatment of communicable diseases.
<P>
	My bill advocates a notification system that is similar to 
corresponding American legislation recently passed in Washington 
which addresses concerns about formalized disease notification 
procedures for emergency personnel.
<P>
	To ease concern about patients' invasion of privacy, my bill 
incorporates confidentiality safeguards.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> We are not about to enter 
into a debate on this bill. The practice is to give a brief explanation 
of the bill. I wonder if the member could bring his intervention to a 
conclusion.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will. The last Conservative 
government was opposed to the passage of this bill for a variety of 
reasons but the Liberal opposition was staunchly in support at least 
in principle. I am hopeful that I can secure-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Clearly we are engaging into 
debate here and not an explanation of the bill. I will continue.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.)</B> moved 
for leave to introduce Bill C-252, an act to amend the Criminal 
Code (mines).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to reintroduce my 
private member's bill calling for a ban of the import, export and 
use of land mines and anti-personnel devices. These devices kill 
and maim over 25,000 people around the world every year. They 
are primarily designed to kill civilians.
<P>
	The primary argument against this has been the military 
argument. That is being shattered today by the International 
Committee for the Red Cross which is releasing a document 
dispelling those military myths.
<P>
	I hope we can work across party lines to support this important 
humanitarian bill and save thousands of lives every year.

	<B>Mr. Bill Gilmour (Comox-Alberni, Ref.)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-253, an act to amend the Access to Information 
Act (crown corporations).
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, this bill would make all crown 
corporations subject to the Access to Information Act. At present, 
crown corporations such as Canada Post are exempt from the 
Access to Information Act even though they are subsidized through 
Canadian tax dollars.
<P>
	Canadians are paying for these services and have a right to know 
that they are getting good value for their money. Last October the 
auditor general published a scathing report on the operation of 
crown corporations.
<P>
	This bill will open corporations to the public and make them 
more accountable to taxpayers. Many Canadians are demanding 
these changes and I am hopeful the House will recognize the will of 
the people and support this bill.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
pursuant to Standing Order 36, I present two petitions to the House 
today. The first is on taxation of the family.
<P>
	This petition comes from Penticton, B.C. The petitioners draw to 
the attention of the House that managing the family home and 
caring for preschool children is an honourable profession which 
has not been recognized for its value to our society.
<P>
<B>(1010 )</B>
<P>
	They also state the Income Tax Act discriminates against 
families that make the choice to provide care in the home to 
preschool children, the disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to pursue 
initiatives to eliminate tax discrimination against families that 
decide to provide care in the home to preschool children, the 
disabled, the chronically ill and the aged.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
second petition comes from Edmonton, Alberta.
<P>
	The petitioners bring to the attention of the House that 
consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health problems or 
impair one's ability; specifically, that foetal alcohol syndrome and 
other alcohol related birth defects are 100 per cent preventable by 
avoiding alcohol consumption during pregnancy.
<P>
	The petitioners therefore pray and call on Parliament to enact 
legislation to require health warning labels to be placed on the 
containers of all alcoholic beverages to caution expectant mothers 
and others of the risks associated with alcohol consumption.

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I

British Columbia who are still very upset about what is happening 
to CFB Chilliwack. Because new buildings are still opening and 
infrastructure is continuing there, they feel it is very much a waste

all provinces by refusing to designate one province a distinct 
society because such a designation confers special status or powers 
not enjoyed by all provinces. I hope the government and the

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="AGREEMENTONINTERNALTRADEIMPLEMENTATIONACT">AGREEMENT ON INTERNAL TRADE 
IMPLEMENTATION ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from March 27, 1996, consideration of Bill 
C-19, an act to implement the agreement on internal trade, as 
reported from a legislative committee, and of Motion No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is again my 
pleasure this morning to talk to Bill C-19, an act to implement the 
agreement on internal trade, and especially to Motion No. 3 that I 
moved to the House.
<P>
	During the referendum in Quebec, we talked a lot about 
economic partnership with the rest of Canada, which was part of 
our main project. We think this agreement on internal trade is a step 
in the right direction that will allow to speed up somewhat the 
concluding of this partnership agreement between Quebec and the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	I will deal with the role of the minister of industry. He plays a 
very important role with regard to economic growth, productivity, 
competitiveness and employment. There are regulations, and this 
bill on the agreement on internal trade seems very positive to us as 
far as productivity, competitiveness and employment in Quebec 
and in Canada are concerned.
<P>
	A lot of regulations these days seem to make trade between the 
provinces sometimes more difficult than trade with the United 
States, which is totally unacceptable. That is why we find this bill 
interesting.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	Deregulation sometimes causes adjustment problems, and that it 
why, in our Motion No. 3, we are asking the government not to go 
too fast in deregulating in certain cases.
<P>
	It could have a destabilizing effect on some very specific internal 
trade areas. Bankruptcies and job losses could result. Long term 
planning and a slightly longer time frame might help prevent this 
kind of problem, all these bankruptcies, job losses and so on.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 deals specifically with transportation. The 
transportation industry is very important in Canada. Various goods 
are shipped. There is a high volume of activity and the level of 
business is very important. The industry ensures that our 
interrelated industries receive their supplies on time. It plays a 
major role in our economic development and in fostering enhanced 
productivity in our small and medium size businesses.
<P>
	Motion No. 3 relates more specifically to bulk shipping by 
Quebec small businesses. I explained earlier to a government 
member how important this part of the  regulations was. I met with 
officials of the bulk hauling association, which represents small 
family companies. By family company, I mean that the father owns 
a truck, which is used for very local transportation purposes within 
the rural community, to haul gravel, grain or what not, but only in 
Quebec and within a very short radius.
<P>
	In Quebec, we already have regulations governing this kind of 
transportation. We are of course in favour of liberalizing the 
transportation industry in general, but this is a very specific 
activity, in Quebec in particular. In many cases, this activity 
supports an entire family and these people contracted loans of up to 
$100,000 or $125,000 to buy a truck. Those who just bought a truck 
are really worried at the thought that, in the future, a carrier could 
obtain a federal permit but not have to comply with Quebec's bulk 
transportation regulations.
<P>
	This would mean that transport tariffs would not apply to them. 
There are several regulations, which I shall not list here, governing 
this sector of activity. And there are four main principles. As far as 
this very particular mode of transportation is concerned, Quebec 
does not issue a permit for the company, but for the truck. There is 
one permit per truck. This means that we are really talking about a 
one person one truck business. And the trucking activities must be 
carried out whithin a very short radius.
<P>
	In bidding for contracts with municipalities or to build roads in 
the region, there is a floor price set for hauling this kind of stuff, 
but under the new arrangements, someone could hold a federal 
permit and not have to play by the same rules.
<P>
	Essentially, what we are asking for is an exemption period. We 
are asking the minister to extend the time frame to two, three or 
even four years. Perhaps then more precise calculations could be 
made to help these very local small businesses adjust, so that they 
are at least not confronted with unfair competition because of other 
types permits being issued locally.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
	This, we think, is very important because these small family 
businesses run the risk of going bankrupt. This would cause some 
major economic disruptions in remote regions, villages and small 
towns. This plays a rather significant role with regard, for example, 
to the maintenance of these trucks, and people living off this small 
business are very concerned. The economic consequences could be 
disastrous.
<P>
	All we are asking the minister through Motion No. 3 is basically 
this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to eliminate inconsistencies between the provisions of the Internal Trade 
Agreement and Quebec's laws and regulations respecting bulk trucking.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We want the law to recognize this type of business, which is very 
specific to Quebec. I think this would not hurt the liberalization of 
interprovincial transport in any way. This is directly linked to those 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1332"> 1332 </A></B>
<P>
people who provide transport services on a very local basis. We 
feel that, in this respect, the motion is very important for this kind 
of business.
<P>
	If the government does not understand how important it is, we 
are asking the minister to at least consider allowing for a transition 
period of two, three or four years before really enforcing the act, so 
that these small businesses can survive for a while.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I wish to 
say a few words today on the proposed amendment by the Bloc to 
Bill C-19, the bill which implements the agreement on internal 
trade.
<P>
	The motion the Bloc has put forth really is not unlike the 
amendment put forth by the Liberals on the Reform Party's motion 
which said that a parliamentary committee should study the 
allegations of sedition against the Bloc. The amendment the 
Liberals brought forth on that motion struck all the words before 
``that'' and all the words after ``that'' and really left nothing of the 
original motion.
<P>
	The Bloc by putting this amendment forward is saying: ``We do 
not really want to pay any attention to this agreement for internal 
trade which we have signed'' or: ``We do not trust the dispute 
settlement mechanism''. It is one or the other. Either way it is 
saying that it wants to ignore the agreement or bypass the dispute 
settlement mechanism and have new negotiations with the federal 
government in the area of bulk trucking.
<P>
	This indicates to me that the Bloc has absolutely no faith in the 
original agreement or it does not trust the dispute settlement 
mechanism. I can understand some of the Bloc members' concerns 
with that. The dispute settlement mechanism has no teeth and it 
could be a very long procedure. However, it is the mechanism that 
was agreed to when they signed the agreement and I think it is 
worth giving it a try. This mechanism has not been tried yet. It 
really cannot be fully tried until the legislation that this motion 
amends is passed. Bill C-19 will implement the agreement on 
internal trade. There is so much leeway given in the dispute 
settlement mechanism that it should be more than enough to 
protect the trucking industry which this motion deals with.
<P>
	In the agreement there is a list of legitimate objectives that a 
province can have which will allow the province to really get 
around honouring the intent of the agreement. These legitimate 
objectives are based on public security and safety; public order; the 
protection of human, animal or plant life and health; the protection 
of the environment; consumer protection; protection of the health, 
safety and well-being of workers; and the affirmative action 
program for disadvantaged groups.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Any of those so-called legitimate objectives could be presented, 
in this case by the province of Quebec in regard to its bulk trucking 
industry, and examined by a panel. Surely the Bloc should trust that 
the panel would examine the legitimate objectives and determine 
that one or more of the legitimate objectives would allow the panel 
to tell the industry that it can continue to operate in a way which is 
different from the rest of the country, or to tell it that there is no 
reason for it to be given special treatment in this area.
<P>
	The Bloc motion is really an attempt to disregard the agreement 
and to get around the dispute settlement mechanism. The dispute 
settlement mechanism, after this legislation is passed and 
implemented, will allow five panellists chosen from a pool of 65 
panellists to decide in this case whether the trucking industry in 
Quebec should honour the intent of the agreement or whether it 
should have special protection.
<P>
	Two of the panellists will come from the federal pool, two will 
come from the provincial pool, from a province other than Quebec, 
and those four panellists will choose a chair. There will be five 
panellists from the federal and provincial governments and a chair 
who will determine the issues.
<P>
	I challenge Bloc members to demonstrate why they do not have 
any faith that this process would deal with the problem which their 
amendment is trying to deal with today.
<P>
	We have to give the process which has been put forth a chance to 
see if it will work. Granted, a lot of parties, think tanks and people 
who have examined the agreement do not have a lot of faith in the 
dispute settlement mechanism as presented. I have grave doubts 
that it will work, but let us give it a chance. If we find that it does 
not work, then we should tighten it up very quickly and give it 
some teeth.
<P>
	If the Government of Quebec is concerned about the way this 
agreement will deal with its trucking industry, then it should take it 
to a panel. When the legislation is passed it could put it through the 
dispute settlement mechanism. It could put it through the 
negotiation process first. If that did not solve the problem, it could 
submit it to a panel and have the issue decided in that manner.
<P>
	The Reform Party will not support this motion. It really is a 
motion which disregards the agreement and the dispute settlement 
mechanism. I do not think it is worthy of being supported by the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, having listened to the proposed amendment of 
the hon. member from the Bloc, I can indicate that this amendment 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1333"> 1333 </A></B>
<P>
would have one effect. That effect would be to tie the government's 
hands in fulfilling its commitments under the agreement on 
internal trade. The amendment would in effect unilaterally change 
the provisions which were agreed upon by all provinces and the 
federal government.
<P>
	This is but an implementation bill. The proposed amendment 
would prevent the federal government from honouring the 
obligations that were agreed to by all parties. In fact the proposed 
amendment is intended to respond, I would suggest, to pressure 
from those within Quebec who have indicated that they wish to 
keep certain barriers in place.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	In presentations to the industry committee, the Association des 
cammionneurs artisans du Québec made it clear that it wished to 
retain current measures that restrict trucking of bulk commodities 
in the province. Those measures are based on Quebec legislation 
which depends on part III of the Motor Vehicle Transportation Act 
for its effectiveness. The federal government in the internal trade 
agreement has agreed to repeal this provision. It is interesting to 
note that the Quebec government agreed to this provision being 
repealed in the Motor Vehicle Transport Act when the agreement 
was signed.
<P>
	The Bloc is trying to have it both ways. It cannot agree to remove 
barriers on one hand and insist on keeping them on the other hand. 
That is the effect of the BQ amendment.
<P>
	Further, the amendment would, for practical purposes, require 
that the federal government not fully comply with the agreement on 
internal trade. It would not be acceptable for the government to go 
back on its agreed obligations to suit the convenience of a single 
interest group that wants to maintain internal barriers.
<P>
	If it was the desire of the Quebec government to change the 
agreement on internal trade, which it has already agreed to, then it 
would have to take that matter up with the 12 other parties to the 
agreement, not just with the federal government.
<P>
	Trying to amend this bill to avoid meeting the obligations of the 
agreement is, simply put, not an acceptable way to proceed. For 
that reason, the government is not in favour of the proposed 
amendment.

	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with respect to the motions that have 
been grouped for debate, being Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 
10, I would like to speak very briefly to inform the House these are 
technical changes and clarifications intended to ensure consistency 
between the two versions of the bill.
<P>
	As I look over the various motions it is clear they are merely of 
the nature I have described and I do not think they require any 
extensive discussion in the House this morning. Members will note 
these motions ensure consistency between the English and French 
versions. They are merely technical, clarifying and would probably 
only be of interest to practising lawyers.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> So soon, 
Mr. Speaker? I knew that the government had little to say, but 
taking only two minutes to propose ten amendments is rather short.
<P>
	At 9.15 this morning, barely one hour before the beginning of the 
debate on the amendments to Bill C-15, we learned that the 
government had decided to propose a series of ten amendments to 
its own bill.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1335"> 1335 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	We deplore this way of doing things, which has almost become 
the norm with the government, and which consists in tabling, 
literally at the last minute, a series of amendments to create 
confusion in the debate. This has happened before. This morning, 
we took a very serious look at all the amendments to make sure that 
the government was not trying to pull a fast one on us. It is 
unacceptable on the part of a responsible government to resort to 
such tactics, especially in the case of a measure like Bill C-15, 
which concerns financial institutions and which is of vital 
importance to the future of that sector, particularly securities.
<P>
	I wonder who the Secretary of State and the ministerial assistant 
think they are. I have the impression that they think they are a bit 
like Moses, but with ten amendments instead of ten 
commandments. The difference is that we are in Parliament, where 
democracy is to be respected, where public information and 
transparency must prevail. If it had not been for my colleagues' 
alertness and our research service's technical support, we would 
have been at a loss with the new amendments being systematically 
dumped on us.
<P>
	Let me recall, and this is something we discussed last year, that 
Bill C-15, previously Bill C-100, directly affects an area over 
which provinces have exclusive jurisdiction, that of securities, 
which includes liquid assets, shares, bonds and debentures.
<P>
	This is an area over which provinces have exclusive jurisdiction 
under two sections of the Canadian Constitution. The first one is 
Section 92.13, which provides for property and civil rights in the 
province. The second one is Section 92.16, dealing generally with 
all matters of a merely local or private nature in the province.
<P>
	From the beginning of this debate on the bill relating to financial 
institutions, we have received only half-answers and half-truths 
when we asked how it happens that the bill clearly infringes upon 
an exclusive provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Bill C-15, notably by implementing across Canada a system for 
the clearing and settlement of payment obligations, infringes on 
powers already exercised, for example, by the Quebec Securities 
Commission-the same applies to Ontario and British 
Columbia-, and by the Quebec inspector general of financial 
institutions.
<P>
	This situation results in costly overlaps for taxpayers. Liberals 
have become masters at it. They add overlap, particularly in the 
area of securities. Who is paying for that? The taxpayers. The 
Liberals are adding not only costly overlaps but also administrative 
inefficiencies, because Quebec financial institutions will be 
subjected to dual controls.
<P>
	Why end up controlling an area which is already very well 
controlled and which has been under Quebec's  exclusive 
jurisdiction for a long time? Why is the federal government 
showing that much paternalism? Why does the federal government 
want to monitor the various provincial institutions, particularly the 
Quebec ones?
<P>
	We have deplored it, we deplore it today and we deplore most of 
all the fact that, in these Moses' ten commandments or rather the 
ten amendments put forward by the secretary of state and assistant 
to the Minister of Finance, there is nothing that deals with the 
official opposition's requests and nothing that responds to the 
criticisms of various provinces with regard to this encroachment by 
the federal government.
<P>
	With regard to securities more specifically, the second concern 
that is not dealt with in Bill C-15 nor in the amended version put 
forward by the government with these ten amendments is the fact 
that this is not a partisan issue, an issue of sovereignty versus 
federalism, but a fundamental issue in Quebec.
<P>
	Even Daniel Johnson, in a letter dated February 16, 1994, when 
he was premier of Quebec, stated that it was out of the question for 
the federal government to encroach on the area of securities-for 
the federal government was already expected at that time to try to 
encroach on that area-and that the Government of Quebec would 
refuse to accept it and would fight tooth and nail to keep its 
prerogatives in that area.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	Daniel Johnson said so, and he is an ally of the people opposite, 
and too unquestioning an ally at times. He wrote to the 
intergovernmental affairs minister of the day to remind him of the 
Quebec consensus-because there is a consensus-on this 
exclusive jurisdiction over securities. But the government does not 
even care to respond to its own allies, and it is blatantly ignoring 
specific sections of the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Besides jurisdictional issues, a third difficulty, as I said earlier, is 
that financial institutions and even investors in Quebec will suffer 
from this duplication created by the federal government. Costs will 
rise, and the securities market will lack the consistency it requires. 
Let us not forget that all agents on the securities market, like all 
other financial markets, need clarity and consistency of rules and 
stability. Everybody knows that financial markets need stability.
<P>
	Instead of introducing the consistency and stability all financial 
markets throughout the world require, the federal government 
comes in clumsily with Bill C-15. It sets out to create its own 
institutions and let the Bank of Canada and the Canadian 
superintendent of financial institutions interfere in the securities 
sector. Such an attitude cannot be accepted.
<P>
	Last August, the secretary of state for financial institutions 
appeared before the finance committee. To all our questions on the 
federal government's infringement upon the securities industry, a 
field of  exclusive provincial jurisdiction especially in Quebec, the 
secretary of state will have to acknowledge today that he answered 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1336"> 1336 </A></B>
<P>
just about anything. He said just about anything. We even had the 
feeling that the secretary of state did not even know his own bill.
<P>
	When we referred to specific sections, we got the feeling that the 
secretary of state had senior officials draft this legislation and was 
simply providing us with a summary. Every time we told him that 
the federal government intended to get involved in the securities 
industry, he said no. Every time we told him that the federal 
government was paving the way for systematic infringement upon 
this field, he said: ``Come on, where do you see that in the bill?''
<P>
	However much we referred to specific provisions-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> Mr. Speaker I apologize for interrupting my 
colleague with a point of order, but I am somewhat confused.
<P>
	We are debating a series of motions which have been grouped by 
the Chair for debate, which are merely technical to clarify and to 
ensure consistency in nature. My hon. colleague has referred to 
there being 10 motions but there are only eight so his math is not 
very good. However, he is engaging in a debate about the general 
thrust of the act without referring to these motions at all. I 
understand that some of his concerns are the subject of motions 
which are grouped for that purpose which we will be debating a 
little later this morning.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member could clarify this.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I would hope you would be 
sympathetic to the Chair when I express that being it is a bill which 
is technical in nature, it would be difficult for me as your Chair 
occupant to apply the rules of relevance. I know the member for 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot of course has spoken often on behalf of 
his party on financial matters. If it is a matter of good faith on the 
part of the Chair, so be it. I would be hard pressed to say if there 
was or was not relevancy in terms of what the member has been 
speaking to on the motions grouped in the earlier ruling I gave to 
the House.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	So, as far as the rules of relevancy are concerned, I am not in a 
position to determine if the comments made are relevant or not to 
this very technical bill, but I rely on the good faith of the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, who has been closely 
following these financial issues for many years now.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to speak on the ten 
amendments which were put forward and divided in three groups 
by the government's representatives, because there are ten of 
them-I do not know how the hon. member came up with the 
number eight, maybe  because we are debating the first eight-but 
there are ten amendments before the House.
<P>
	What I want to point out, on behalf of my colleagues, is that not 
one of these amendments answers the many issues we have been 
raising for almost a year now. Indeed, it has been almost a year now 
since the problems surfaced, since the bill was introduced and the 
secretary of state in particular was unable, in August, during the 
finance committee's hearings, to answer our questions. Every time 
we asked him questions on some of the issues we raised and which 
remain unsolved-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grubel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am very 
disturbed. I am following the discussion and I am prepared to speak 
on Group No. 1, Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 10. I have 
counted them three times; there are eight. On what is the hon. 
member speaking?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Again, you are really putting 
the Chair in a very difficult position in terms of the relevancy of the 
motions on a bill that is very technical. I am sure if the member 
should so choose, the Chair will recognize him to engage in this 
debate on the appropriate motions.
<P>
	I would ask that we give the remaining time to the hon. member 
for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, which would be approximately two 
minutes given the interruptions that we have had on points of order, 
according to our procedures.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Loubier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would suggest to my colleague 
from the Reform Party that if he wants to understand what we say, 
he only has to listen. I think this would be a good thing, since he 
does not often listen to our arguments because he is too busy 
preparing his while we develop ours. And this has been going on 
for the last two and a half years.
<P>
	Thus, I repeat that the amendments put forward by the 
government do not in any way correct the deficiencies of the initial 
bill, that is, Bill C-100, which has been renamed Bill C-15, and that 
the secretary of state told us tall tales when he appeared before the 
committee. The secretary of state told us that his government did 
not intend to infringe upon the securities industry. Since then, we 
have been able to refine our analysis. Bill C-15 was even compared 
with the old Bill C-100. Then, there was the speech from the throne 
which spoke clearly of restoring a Canadian securities commission.
<P>
	So, this is my conclusion on the ten amendments. We will reject 
these amendments because they do not meet any of our 
expectations. These purely cosmetic amendments only add up to 
commas and periods and were put forward this morning with only 
one hour prior notice to try to destabilize the opposition and the 
debate on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1337"> 1337 </A></B>
<P>
this bill and create confusion in the population and  also force us to 
concentrate our comments on these ten proposals that are rather 
trivial considering the seriousness of the bill.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there are indeed 10 motions, but they are grouped into 
Group No. 1 and Group No. 2. The hon. member who constantly 
said there were 10 motions obviously was putting the two groups 
together. I will however follow the direction set by the Chair and 
simply discuss the motions in Group No. 1: Motions Nos. 1, 2, 3, 5, 
6, 7, 9 and 10. I had a good look at them.
<P>
	All except for one concern changes in the French translation of 
the English text. While I do understand and read French, I am not 
sufficiently expert in the legalese that is involved in here. I have 
every confidence in the competence and integrity of the writers of 
this bill in the Department of Finance that this is in order.
<P>
	Therefore, I express the Reform Party's support for these 
amendments. I hope we can get on with debate and get through this 
business. This is an expensive time to be held up at this stage and 
talk about things that are not relevant to the motions. We will have 
a chance when third reading of Bill C-15 comes up to have our 
fundamental objections to the bill registered. I hope we can 
expedite the passing of these motions today.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Clause 70 of Bill C-15 be amended by adding, immediately after line 6 
on page 62, the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(5) Subsections (2) to (4) do not apply with respect to a person or entity that 
was carrying on business in Canada under a reserved name on the day 
immediately preceding the day on which those subsections come into force.''</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Clause 115 of Bill C-15 be amended by adding, immediately after line

<BLOCKQUOTE>``(5) Subsections (2) to (4) do not apply with respect to a person or entity that 
was carrying on business in Canada under a reserved name on the day 
immediately preceding the day on which those subsections come into force.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I listened to my colleague 
opposite, the member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, I was tempted 
on moving to this second grouping of amendments to tell the House 
of a story I once heard about lawyers who were arguing a case. One 
lawyer stood up and argued for several hours and the other lawyer 
stood and said: ``I will follow the very fine example of my 
colleague and make no argument''.
<P>
	These two motions which are grouped for debate deal again with 
a fairly technical matter. The act would prohibit the use of the 
words ``trustco'' or ``lifeco'' by an unregulated parent of a 
regulated institution. This is to avoid certain confusion within the 
public and to ensure that the public is not misled concerning 
whether or not a financial institution is in fact federally regulated.
<P>
	After representations which we heard before the committee and 
in consultations held in the department it was pointed out to us that 
to flat out prohibit the use of such words by entities that had long 
used them would be  costly to the companies involved and quite 
confusing to the public throughout this country. Therefore certain 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1338"> 1338 </A></B>
<P>
grandfathering provisions were included and Motions Nos. 4 and 8 
further clarify these grandfathering provisions.
<P>
	I am sure the member opposite will now stand and engage in this 
debate and launch into a discussion of the overall thrust of the bill, 
which is interesting, but we have discussed it at other stages.
<P>
<B>(1100)</B>
<P>
	I see we have a third grouping coming up which consists of 
resolutions they have just dropped on us suddenly. Everything that 
he has said about the government's motions, just getting them with 
no time to prepare, apply to his Motions Nos. 11, 12 and 13 
grouped for debate later on.
<P>
	Lest I cross over the line of relevance I will not get into his 
motions until we are there.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in Group 
No. 2, two motions have been added. In Motion No. 4, the Minister 
of Finance proposed:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Clause 70 of Bill C-15 be amended by adding, immediately after line 6 
on page 62, the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(5) Subsections (2) to (4) do not apply with respect to a person or entity that 
was carrying on business in Canada under a reserved name on the day 
immediately preceding the day on which those subsections come into force''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The parliamentary secretary says this is only a technicality.
<P>
	Then, in Motion No. 8, the Minister of Finance proposed:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Clause 115 of Bill C-15 be amended by adding, immediately after line 
43 on page 88, the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(5) Subsections (2) to (4) do not apply with respect to a person or entity that 
was carrying on business in Canada under a reserved name on the day 
immediately preceding the day on which those subsections come into force''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are dealing with the same thing, here. Again, the 
parliamentary secretary says this is only a technicality.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, through you, I would like to ask the parliamentary 
secretary this: Why has the government waited until this morning 
to add in these technicalities? Why did it not do this before, when 
Bill C-15 was introduced? In the first session, this bill was 
introduced as Bill C-100.
<P>
	Considering that the finance department has hundreds and 
hundreds of employees at its service, why were these so-called 
technicalities not introduced at that time? How is it that the 
parliamentary secretary or the department came up with these 
amendments around 8.30 or 9 a.m., as my colleague from 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot pointed out? We were informed of these 
amendments when we arrived at our offices this morning.
<P>
	Once again, the Liberal government is not taking its 
responsibilities seriously. It is doing a sloppy job. Its goal is not to 
better inform the public, to bring forward specific technical 
amendments to improve the bill. Its only goal is to try to destabilize 
members of the official opposition at 9.15 a.m., in order to avoid 
being severely criticized by them.
<P>
	This is a very important bill we have to discuss and, suddenly, 
the government decides to move ten amendments. Then, realizing 
that he cannot respond to the objections raised by the official 
opposition, the parliamentary secretary tells us that they are not 
important amendments, that we should not worry about that, that 
they are just technicalities. Then why were they not included in the 
bill when it was introduced?
<P>
	I would also like to add that the amendments proposed by 
Liberals this morning do not respond to the repeated requests made 
by the Bloc Quebecois. Where in the second group of motions, 
Motions Nos. 4 and 8, as in the eight previous motions, can we find 
a reduction in governmental regulations? Where can we find the 
elimination of duplication and overlap that the official opposition 
has been complaining about for two years?
<P>
	For several months now, the official opposition has been asking 
the government to let Quebec's legislation play its role. But, once 
again, the federal Liberal government prefers to increase its 
interference in areas under Quebec's jurisdiction. In the end, as my 
colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot pointed out, these two 
amendments, like the previous eight, are nothing but cosmetic 
amendments.
<P>
	This morning, my colleague from Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot also 
talked about Moses' ten commandments. I think he was very 
generous in comparing these amendments to the ten 
commandments because at least, in the ten commandments, there 
was a lot of wisdom, shrewdness and insight, which I do not see in 
the parliamentary secretary's amendments. If the parliamentary 
secretary had a minimum of decency, he would withdraw his 
amendments.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I find that a strange interpretation of the way democracy 
works. It shows a lack of appreciation for how complex some of the 
technical matters are regarding financial bills of this sort.
<P>
	There are all kinds of things wrong with the bill, but there is 
criticism on it on the basis that the government has shown its 
willingness to respond to public concern about a proposal. To me it 
shows the government is listening. We have a society which takes 
into account the people who are specifically affected by legislation. 
I  praise the government for having made these modifications.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1339"> 1339 </A></B>
<P>
	The bill is not very good. However, with respect to these two 
clauses I commend what the government has done. The registration 
of names, names which have already been registered, was an item 
of contention. We heard about it in the finance committee and I am 
persuaded that this is a good move. It is for this reason that the 
Reform Party will support the two amendments placed in Group 
No. 2.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-15, in the Schedule, be amended by adding after line 2, on page

and settlement of payment obligations or preventing systemic risks in respect of 
the clearing and settlement of payment obligations.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to debate real 
amendments after having discussed a series of cosmetic 
amendments.
<P>
	As I said in my first speech, this bill systematically infringes 
upon an exclusively provincial field of jurisdiction, securities. This 
field is strictly defined in the Canadian Constitution, in section 
92.13, on property and civil rights in the province, and in section 
92.16, which includes generally all matters of a merely local or 
private nature in the province. These things are under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	We fought against the first bill, Bill C-100, because it was a 
deliberate attempt by the Liberal government to encroach upon a 
provincial field of jurisdiction, thus creating duplication and 
overlap. The three amendments we are proposing, whether the 
Reform Party likes it or not-and let us not forget that the Reform 
Party did not do its job during the last session, it did not examine 
and criticize Bill C-100-our three amendments pertain to the 
clearing system and the settlement of payments. Their aim is to 
stop the federal government from encroaching upon an exclusively 
provincial field of jurisdiction.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	In other words, through these three amendments, we say as 
clearly and simply as we can in legal terms, that the federal 
government should mind its own business.
<P>
	The first amendment strikes, in fact, the word ``securities'' from 
the original clause, so that federal jurisdiction does not extend to 
that provincial jurisdiction. The second amendment, Motion No. 
12, seeks to exclude from the application of federal guidelines 
institutions participating in clearing houses for securities.
<P>
	The first amendment takes away from the federal government 
the power to create a clearing house, and the second amendment 
takes away the power to regulate provincial clearing houses. This is 
exactly what we want, that is to remove from this bill any invasion 
of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	The third amendment relates to the system for the clearing and 
settlement of securities. This amendment limits federal regulatory 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1340"> 1340 </A></B>
<P>
power to payment settlement  activities, as opposed to institutions 
that are likely to carry out such activities.
<P>
	Furthermore, the federal government can take action only for 
reasons of management of systemic risks, as the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions and the Minister of Finance claimed, and for 
no other reason. That is what we opposed from the beginning, when 
we argued against the bill. That is what has become of Bill C-15.
<P>
	So, these are the amendments, and I would invite members of 
this House from the three parties to support these amendments that 
would be beneficial, in particular for federal-provincial relations.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Barry Campbell (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my, my, my. It is incredible. When 
we debated the first eight motions grouped by the Chair, the hon. 
member for Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot was full of indignation over 
amendments being tabled at the last minute with no chance to 
absorb them.
<P>
	That is the way it works around here. He knows that and he 
followed those exact rules and procedures in tabling his own very 
technical motions without any advance notice for us to understand 
them. Then, as he accused the government in an earlier debate, he 
stands up on these very technical motions which have been grouped 
for debate and speaks for about three minutes. I guess the saying 
goes that sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Did I get it 
wrong?
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> What is lost to Moses is lost to Judas.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Campbell:</B> We had all kinds of talk about the ten 
commandments but I will not get into that in this debate. 
Fortunately for the Secretary of State for International Financial 
Institutions he does not have to worry about religion on top of all 
his other concerns.
<P>
	Let us talk about specifics. Let me respond with some substance 
to these amendments proposed in this group by the opposition 
which which we will not support.
<P>
	If clearing and settlement systems are not properly designed they 
can result in considerable systemic risk; that is, the risk of 
problems experienced by one financial institution will spread to 
other institutions and destabilize the system as a whole. In an 
increasingly global marketplace in financial services that risk 
exists. If our systems are not properly designed problems occurring 
elsewhere may spread to the Canadian financial system.
<P>
	The hon. member opposite can rail all he wants but this is an 
appropriate role for a central bank and it is not an appropriate role 
for a securities regulator.
<P>
	Bill C-15 establishes a framework for proper risk proofing that is 
effectively designed and competitive in terms of the spread and 
cost with which payments are cleared and settled. This will enable 
Canadian financial institutions to compete more effectively. The 
proposed clearance and settlement legislation makes sense and has 
several key functions. It gives the Bank of Canada an explicit role 
in overseeing clearing and settlement systems that pose systemic 
risk. The bank already plays a key but informal role in ensuring that 
such systems are designed in a way which controls risk.
<P>
	The proposed clearing and settlement legislation provides 
formal responsibility for the bank to oversee these systems, as it 
exists throughout the world. However, the legislation aims only to 
supervise those system that pose a risk to the financial system. It 
does not seek to regulate any associated financial markets. It is 
quite properly within federal jurisdiction. Equally important, it is 
what the safety, soundness and security of our financial system 
demands and what all Canadians would expect of the federal 
government. The oversight role for the bank is consistent, as I said 
earlier, with the role being played by central banks elsewhere.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Second, Bill C-15 gives the Bank of Canada the powers it needs 
to participate in clearing systems and contribute to their safe, 
efficient and cost effective operations. These powers will be 
important in the context of the large value transfer system being 
planned by the financial sector with the Bank of Canada. This may 
ultimately replace the large value component of the paper based 
system with a system that will facilitate the electronic transfer of 
large values.
<P>
	The Bank of Canada does not currently have the power it needs 
to send and receive payments on what will be known as the LBTS. 
Under Bill C-15, the bank will be given powers allowing it to 
contribute to the operation of the system in several ways.
<P>
	There is a level of risk containment that will allow Canada to 
meet internationally agreed upon standards and contribute to the 
global competitiveness of our financial institutions. It also 
reinforces what I believe is an important role of the government, 
establishing a framework so that financial institutions have the 
ability and incentives to recognize and control the risks they face.
<P>
	Another example of a clearing and settlement system which will 
directly benefit from this risk proofing is the new system for 
clearing transactions of government debt securities known as the 
debt clearing service. It was implemented by the Canadian 
depository for securities and incorporates risk containment features 
accepted by federal and provincial authorities. Eventually placing 
all government debt on this system will reduce the cost for the 
government as issuer as well as for other participants in the 
systems.
<P>
	A third key function, and the last one I want to comment on in 
this important legislation, is to strengthen the enforcement of 
netting arrangements under bankruptcy and insolvency law. 
Clearing systems rely heavily on netting of payments to reduce 
credit exposures between participants and reduce systemic risk.
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1341"> 1341 </A></B>
<P>
Without legal certainty, netting arrangements can be called into 
question when they are needed most when a participant fails.
<P>
	Confirming that netting arrangements are legally valid and 
unsaleable in a liquidation or restructuring is an essential part of 
this legislation.
<P>
	My time is almost up. I emphasize that this aspect of the 
legislation is very much about ensuring efficiency and stability of 
the financial system and contributing to its international 
competitiveness and meeting our international obligations in 
regard to system soundness and security.
<P>
	Therefore, I urge members of the House to reject the ill-advised 
amendments proposed by the opposition.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to elaborate for a few moments-not delay 
the business of the House-on the remarks just made by the hon. 
parliamentary secretary.
<P>
	Most people in Canada do not really understand what happens 
when they write a cheque and send it to an uncle a few provinces 
away, how the bank gets the money and how it is transferred. It is 
all done on what one could compare to a super highway that 
connects all the banks, dealers and others who have access to it. 
The debits and credits flow back and forth at the speed of electronic 
signals.
<P>
	The arrangements which guide the traffic on this highway have 
to be updated periodically in light of technological innovations, 
changing economics and the development of new instruments, 
development of problems like bankruptcy and so on. These 
developments are taking place in the rest of the world and if 
Canada wants to be competitive it has to do the same thing.
<P>
	Essentially, we set rules and standards for the vehicles that are 
travelling that road. We set traffic signs that guide whatever is 
going on. It is quite clear that at the end of such a highway the 
business which takes place in no way is influenced by the rules 
guiding the traffic on the highway. The entire system is like a 
public good, it has to be protected.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	The Bloc is proposing that the setting of the rules which increase 
the efficiency of that highway and the flow of information back and 
forth is an interference with national sovereignty and an 
encroachment on the rights of provincial governments. I do not 
think this is correct. It is like having one highway stretching across 
the country. The culture developing at either end is not impeded by 
having a highway that functions efficiently and safely.
<P>
	In the same way I believe the financial institutions that are 
developing in each province have the opportunity to maintain the
<P>
local characteristic to be regulated and to be encouraged. That is up 
to the provincial government. This bill does not deal with these 
issues and I would be the first to argue against any encroachment 
by the federal government on provincial rights with respect to what 
is going on in the financial sector at the access points on this 
highway for clearing financial obligations within Canada.
<P>
	Therefore, the Reform Party opposes these amendments and will 
vote accordingly when the vote comes up.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Richard Bélisle (La Prairie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
parliamentary secretary has criticized my Bloc Quebecois 
colleague for having spoken only three minutes on our three very 
technical amendments tabled, as were his, at the last minute this 
morning. I will attempt during the next ten minutes to provide 
further clarification to the parliamentary secretary so that he may 
better understand our three amendments.
<P>
	Bill C-15 before the House today is a sort of omnibus bill, a 
collection of scattered measures, the sole objective of which is to 
tighten control and regulation of the financial services field in 
Canada. Generally speaking, the bill amends a number of Acts 
governing financial services and repeals the Investment Companies 
Act.
<P>
	We are not opposed to the principle behind the bill but to some of 
the measures proposed, because they are an outright intrusion in 
provincial areas of jurisdiction. In order to eliminate this intrusion, 
the Bloc Quebecois is proposing three amendments to the bill.
<P>
	The proposed amendments have to do with the system for 
payment clearing and settlement. Their purpose is to bar the federal 
government from this provincial area of jurisdiction. The first 
amendment proposes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-15, in the Schedule, be amended by replacing line 26, on page 124, 
with the following: ``ment of foreign ex-''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This amendment thus removes the words ``securities 
transactions'' from the original clause, so that the federal 
government's jurisdiction does not extend into this provincial area 
of responsibility.
<P>
	The second amendment also concerns the schedule to Bill C-15 
and proposes adding after line 30, on page 127, the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(2.1) A directive may not be issued under this section in respect of a 
participating institution that is a member of a system for the clearing and settlement 
of securities transactions by clearing houses.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The purpose of this technical amendment is to remove from the 
application of federal directives institutions participating in 
clearing houses for securities transactions. The first amendment, in 
fact, takes away the federal government's power to create a 
clearing 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1342"> 1342 </A></B>
<P>
house and the second amendment takes away its power to regulate 
provincial clearing houses.
<P>
	The third amendment amends Bill C-15, in the Schedule, by 
adding, after line 2, on page 136, a part III which sets out the fields 
of application of a system for the clearing and settlement of 
securities transactions and in which regulatory power is also 
limited. This amendment limits the power of the federal 
government to regulate payment settlement activities.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	Moreover, the federal government can take action only for 
purposes related to systemic risk management, and for no other 
reason. So, the objective of the last amendment is to control more 
strictly the clearing and settlement systems for securities 
transactions.
<P>
	Why did we propose these three amendments? Because Bill 
C-15 brings about changes that are totally unacceptable to the 
provinces, and, from our point of view, to Quebec.
<P>
	The most important of those changes would widen the Bank of 
Canada payment mechanisms to include securities. That action 
would duplicate the clearing mechanisms already regulated by the 
Commission des valeurs mobilières du Québec and would open the 
door to federal interference in securities regulation, which is under 
provincial jurisdiction. So, Mr. Speaker, we oppose it vigorously.
<P>
	With Bill C-15, the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation could 
base its participation premiums on the risk posed by a financial 
institution, including Quebec chartered institutions which are 
already regulated by the Régie de l'assurance-dépôts du Québec, 
which uses the value of the deposits in the institution to assess its 
premiums.
<P>
	There would therefore be two standards for evaluation, and the 
one linked to risk might place Quebec institutions at a disadvantage 
because they are relatively small-larger institutions often being 
considered less risky-and because Quebec has its own deposit 
insurance, premiums for which are not determined by risk.
<P>
	A third major change is that the Superintendent of Financial 
Institutions would have increased powers, enabling him to wind up 
Quebec-chartered institutions. We can just imagine all the conflicts 
between the various provincial and federal bodies that will ensue.
<P>
	Bill C-15 modifies nine important laws that are currently in 
effect: those governing financial institutions (banks, trust and loan 
companies, insurance companies and associations of credit 
unions), those governing winding-up and restructuring, the Office 
of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act, the Canadian 
Payments Association Act. As well it does away completely with 
the Investment Companies Act.
<P>
	Quebec is already involved in the clearing system via the 
Commission québécoise des valeurs mobilières and the Inspecteur 
général des institutions financières. Schedule I of Bill C-15 creates 
new overlaps, by placing Quebec's financial institutions wholly 
under the directives and orders of the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	Under the pretext of controlling systemic risk, Bill C-15 is 
allowing Ottawa to meddle in this area. The governor of the Bank 
of Canada reserves the right to issue directives, not just to clearing 
houses, but also to participating financial institutions, regardless of 
their charters.
<P>
	Many essentially Quebec institutions, such as la Fiducie 
Desjardins or the brokerage firm of Lévesque, Beaubien, 
Geoffrion, may be directly affected by the Bank of Canada's orders 
and directives.
<P>
	With Bill C-15, the federal government is demonstrating more of 
a desire to grasp hold of new powers than any wish to ensure the 
mobility of financial institutions and the safety of investors.
<P>
	Once again, with this bill, Ottawa is letting its centralizing 
dynamic show through. Bill C-15 constitutes an unacceptable 
interference in the securities field, something that has even been 
denounced by Daniel Johnson Jr. in February 1994, as my Bloc 
colleague has already pointed out this morning.
<P>
	These new prerogatives of the governor of the Bank of Canada 
are therefore in complete contradiction to another of Quebec's 
traditional demands. Even above and beyond the areas of 
provincial jurisdiction, Quebec's financial institutions and its 
investors will be the victims of the double supervision Ottawa 
plans to impose. The result of this will be additional costs, 
administrative inefficiency and a system that lacks cohesion.
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	To conclude, in order to minimize all of these risks in a system 
that is already too unwieldy and over regulated, in these times 
when balancing budgets requires less regulation and fewer 
resources to apply it, when all taxpayers need a chance to catch 
their financial breaths a bit, and when all of Canada's and Quebec's 
financial institutions, and business in general, need more 
flexibility, I would invite the members of this House, the 
Parliamentary Secretary included, to show good faith and to 
support the three amendments tabled by the Bloc Quebecois this 
morning.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I would also like to speak about the three amendments 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois. We know that Bill C-15 before us 
today, even if it is not a major bill like others tabled in the House, 
still brings many amendments to the whole series of existing acts, 
as my colleague said earlier.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1343"> 1343 </A></B>
<P>
	Even though we have no objection in principle to this bill, which 
actually aims to increase regulation of financial services in 
Canada, we have a lot of concerns and the amendments we 
introduced today reflect precisely these concerns.
<P>
	This bill is not a reform of the legislation governing financial 
institutions. This reform will come later on, because, as we know, a 
white book is in the makings. We believe the bill before us today is 
actually a step forward. It prepares the ground for the control of 
securities in Canada.
<P>
	What are the amendments we are proposing? My colleague has 
read some of them and I will repeat them in a few words. The first 
amendment proposes to delete the words ``securities'' in a text. By 
deleting this word, we are taking ``securities'' out of federal 
jurisdiction. We believe that this is strictly a provincial jurisdiction 
and that the act, as it presently stands, should apply to everything 
else but not directly to securities.
<P>
	The second amendment, which we have added, aims at 
excluding from federal guidelines institutions already participating 
in securities clearing houses. What purpose would it serve? 
Duplication, of course. This already exists in provinces.
<P>
	The third amendment limits the federal government's regulatory 
power to the settlement of payments and not to the institutions 
involved. As my hon. colleague pointed out, we want it limited to 
the management of systemic risk and not used for other 
considerations.
<P>
	Why exactly did we table these motions? I will go over some of 
the arguments so it will be very clear, given that the text is highly 
technical. A Canadian clearing system is currently being 
developed, set up and implemented and will eventually come under 
the control of the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	This is part of our concern, as Quebec is already involved in this 
sector through the Commission québécoise des valeurs mobilières 
and the Inspecteur général des institutions financières, like the 
other provinces. Schedule I of Bill C-15 will create costly new 
duplication, by subjecting Quebec financial institutions to orders 
and directives from the Bank of Canada.
<P>
	Bill C-15 uses the pretext-it is quite common for pretexts to be 
used, and I will come back to this at the end-of systemic risk 
control to allow Ottawa to meddle in this area. The governor of the 
Bank of Canada acknowledged, last June 20, that this risk was no 
longer a problem because of tighter control over the large value 
transfer system. In addition, under clause 6 in Schedule I, which 
will implement a Canadian clearing system, the Governor of the 
Bank of Canada retains the right to issue directives not only to 
clearing houses, but also to participating financial institutions, 
regardless of their charter. Thus, Bill C-15 will enable the governor 
to issue orders and directives to institutions such as the Fiducie 
Desjardins.
<P>
	Secondly, they are using this bill to amend the prerogatives of 
the Superintendent of Financial Institutions and the Winding-up 
Act. Bill C-15 also gives more powers to the Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions, and, as we have pointed out since our arrival 
here, in almost all federal bills, power is being concentrated more 
in the hands of those who have it-be they ministers or the 
Superintendent of Financial Institutions.
<P>
	Expanding the prerogatives of the federal Superintendent of 
Financial Institutions will mean costly duplication and 
inefficiency.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	Indeed, in Quebec the inspecteur général des institutions 
financières already exercises some control over chartered banks, 
which means that the new powers given to the federal 
superintendent will overlap existing powers at the provincial level. 
This overlap is costly for the Quebec taxpayers-as we are well 
aware, since it is constantly being raised in the House-and for the 
Quebec chartered banks faced with insolvency problems.
<P>
	Bill C-15 may lead to contradictory signals from provincial and 
federal authorities-this too has been pointed out ever since we 
came to this House. In this respect, let us remember that 
competition between governments will never be cost effective for 
the public. As for manpower training-an issue on which all 
stakeholders in Quebec have clearly been in agreement for a very 
long time, and which is not yet resolved-at least $250 million a 
year is wasted on this. The extension of the prerogatives of the 
superintendent may also lead to legal wrangling between Ottawa 
and Quebec, while the financial institutions facing problems and 
the people who have invested money will be forgotten.
<P>
	In summary, if this bill does not take into account the 
amendments proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, there will definitely 
be-and I repeat the two or three points I made-overlap with 
provincial jurisdiction-and even the federalists in Quebec 
recommend that the Government of Canada not do this-costly 
duplication and overlap, and the system will, of course, be less 
efficient.
<P>
	We can only lament the fact that, in most bills introduced in the 
House, we are always led to condemn the same things. The 
government uses all kinds of means to try to centralize ever more. 
All kinds of reasons are raised-market globalization, systemic 
risks, international competition. Technological inventiveness was 
just raised as a reason, implying that, for technological reasons, we 
will now have to centralize ever more. It is extremely sad to see 
that, at a time when the government claims publicly it is possible to 
reach settlements with provinces, it is doing exactly the opposite in 
the legislation. In Ottawa, greater centralization is the order of the 
day.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1344"> 1344 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to reply to my hon. colleague from the 
Reform Party, who said that this highway being constructed must 
be more closely regulated and further centralized, and that, at both 
ends of that highway, culture will not be affected. Culture starts 
with the full control of all the economic levers. If Quebec gives 
up that much each time a bill is passed in the House, if there are 
no tools to protect Quebec's traditional positions, even within the 
constitutional limits, culture will eventually disappear.

	She said: Mr. Speaker, in speaking to my proposed amendments 
to Bill C-11, I will address them in their groupings and begin with 
Group No. 1. Reform's amendments, Motions Nos. 1, 2, 4 and 6, all 
address the new position of minister of labour and his or her 
department.
<P>
	With respect to Reform's Motion No. 1, clause 4 of the bill 
allows the Prime Minister to appoint a minister of labour. We 
oppose this clause. The only reason we have a minister of labour is 
that the Prime Minister felt he needed to find a place in cabinet for 
the hon. member for Saint-Henri-Westmount.
<P>
	The government found it unnecessary for the first two years of 
its mandate to have a minister of labour. In effect there is no need 
for this position. This clause allows the Prime Minister the pleasure 
of appointing or not appointing one. Quite simply, this new 
ministry is expensive and unnecessary. The responsibilities could 
be maintained within the human resources development 
department.
<P>
<B>(1145)</B>
<P>
	I am aware that there have been ministries of labour in the past. 
However, cabinets have been huge. Today Canadians want to see 
less government, not more.
<P>
	Motion No. 2 refers to clause 5(3). Our amendment is to delete 
subclause (3). This subclause allows for a deputy minister of 
labour, an unnecessary position if there is no need for a minister of 
labour.
<P>
	Moving to clause 21, which is Motion No. 4 of Group No. 1, the 
amendment would remove the minister of labour from the clause. 
There is no need for the minister of labour to be mentioned at all in 
the bill. There is certainly no need to give the minister of labour the 
power to act in the place of the minister of human resources.
<P>
	I propose that clause 21 be amended to read as follows: ``The 
minister may authorize the commission, any other body or member 
of a class of bodies, or a person, or a member of a class of persons 
to exercise any power or perform any duty or function of the 
minister''.
<P>
	In keeping with Motion No. 1, given that we oppose the creation 
of the ministry of labour, we oppose such a minister's having 
delegatory powers.
<P>
	Group No. 1 contains Motion No. 6. This clause provides for 
cases when no minister of labour is appointed. The said duties are 
redistributed by this clause.
<P>
	If there is no need for a minister of labour, there should be no 
explicit need to reallocate the minister's responsibilities. They 
should normally be absorbed by the department without being 
included in the enabling legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I enter this 
debate to talk a little about Bill C-11 and what it means for the 
government's labour programs.
<P>
	I will deal with it right off the bat because the main thrust of the 
Reform Party's amendments is that there is no need for a minister 
of labour, that the role of a minister of labour in the Government of 
Canada and in the overall lives of people in the country who relate 
to federal jurisdiction is not important.
<P>
	Members have probably heard me say this bill will allow us to 
take giant strides in helping Canadians with the employment 
challenges the entire country currently faces. It will combine the 
human resource functions of several departments under one roof, 
the Department of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	There is the Minister of Human Resources Development at the 
helm to control and lead the new department. It might seem 
puzzling to some that there also needs to be a minister of labour. 
After all, the department of labour is one of the departments being 
integrated into HRDC.
<P>
	Let us look at the duties of the Minister of Labour before we 
suggest or accept the amendments proposed by the Reform Party. 
These duties are described in clause 4 of the bill: ``A minister of 
labour may be appointed by commission under the great seal to 
hold office during pleasure''. Clause 4(2) states: ``The minister of 
labour will be given all the powers, duties and functions related to 
labour matters under federal jurisdiction''.
<P>
	This means that one of the main responsibilities of the minister 
is the Canada Labour Code. The code governs industrial relations, 
occupational safety and health and labour standards, but only in 
those areas under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	The code is an important part of Canada's economic fabric. It 
affects the working lives of 1 million Canadians. It applies to train 
engineers-I have to include conductors in that because that is 
what I was in my previous profession-longshoremen and truckers, 
to grain handlers and telephone operators, to the persons who 
cashed people's cheques at the bank today. These people turn to us 
for stable industrial relations, for safety and health and for fair and 
productive workplaces.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1346"> 1346 </A></B>
<P>
	Applying the Canada Labour Code is an important 
responsibility but the Minister of Labour also has other pieces of 
legislation. One of these is the Canadian Centre for Occupational 
Health and Safety Act. The centre produces and disseminates 
occupational health and safety information and helps to protect 
the lives and health of Canadian workers.
<P>
<B>(1150 )</B>
<P>
	There are many different pieces of legislation that fall under the 
responsibility of the Minister of Labour, acts which deal with 
security, justice, equity and other matters. All of this was under the 
old department of labour. Not much has changed there. Except for 
the program for older worker adjustment, the Minister of Labour 
holds on to all the same responsibilities and might even add a few.
<P>
	Everything the Minister of Labour needs to do, the job can be 
found within the framework of restructured, unified and effective 
organization. This keeps costs down without depriving the Minister 
of Labour of services or facilities needed to tend to important 
matters. Remember, these matters include the Canadian union 
movement, labour management relations, conditions in the 
workplace, equity for all workers and many more.
<P>
	That is a lot for anybody's plate but the Minister of Human 
Resources Development has an even fuller plate. Therefore it 
makes sense to have somebody dedicated full time to such a tightly 
defined set of issues. This bill sets those definitions and makes 
those distinctions.
<P>
	If anything, the past year has shown that there is more than 
enough work there to keep the Minister of Labour very busy. The 
minister is working to better harmonize federal occupational health 
and safety legislation and regulations with those of the provinces 
and territories. The minister has also been very active on industrial 
relations.
<P>
	Last May the minister appointed an industrial inquiry 
commission to study industrial relations in longshoring, grain 
handling and other federally regulated industries on the west coast.
<P>
	In June the minister established a task force to review the part of 
the Canada Labour Code which deals with labour relations. This is 
part I, but the minister also wants to modernize the other two parts 
of the code, and work is continuing in that regard.
<P>
	The minister is reviewing the labour program so that it works 
better and is more cost effective while at the same time working on 
a North American agreement on labour co-operation.
<P>
	As members can see, the restructuring has not interfered with the 
labour program. I would argue that the restructuring has energized 
the labour program. We have seen a healthy continuity between the 
new and the old. We have also seen how an integrated approach can  
lead to improvements in the economic and social well-being of 
Canadian citizens: industrial relations, job creation and training. 
All of these issues are related and all should be considered within 
the same holistic framework.
<P>
	Removing the labour program from HRCD would therefore be a 
very serious mistake. After all, the Department of Human 
Resources Development has been with us since 1993 and we know 
it works. We also know the labour programs work. The department 
saves money. It offers a cohesive vision of Canada's human 
resources needs. At the same time, when technology changes 
almost everything we do, we need that kind of vision more than 
ever.
<P>
	I am not asking my colleagues to leap into the unknown when I 
ask them to support this bill. Instead, I ask them to believe the 
evidence before their own eyes. I am asking them to understand the 
importance of a minister of labour in the overall scheme of things.
<P>
	It is a very shallow argument by the Reform Party that because 
the government did not have a minister of labour for the first two it 
obviously did it for political reasons. My argument is that after two 
years it realized, as governments do, that it made a mistake and it 
did need a minister of labour because that area of expertise is very 
specific and needs to be looked after on a daily basis by an 
individual whose main job is to look after the rights of workers in 
the federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	I applaud the Prime Minister and the new Minister of Labour. 
We now have gone back as far as the 1900s to one of the first four 
departments created by the government, the labour department. We 
have recognized over the years that labour is very important. We 
recognize that a minister is very important.
<P>
	I recommend to members that they reject out of hand the 
opposition's suggestion that there is no need for a minister of 
labour in the Human Resources Development Department.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was provoked into speaking on this group of 
amendments by the thought that someone wanted to eliminate the 
position of minister of labour.
<P>
	I want to speak to the tremendous qualifications of the individual 
who presently holds the position. I am sure all Canadians will be 
impressed.
<P>
	I have to ask myself why one would want to remove the position 
of the minister responsible for the working people? Why would we 
not want to have a minister of labour? Let us look at the issue.
<P>
	This amendment, if passed, would eliminate the representation 
of the working people of Canada from the cabinet table. Think of 
the impact of that. This is a proposal from the Reform Party, the 
party that says it is  grassrooty, that it comes from the salt of the 
earth and represents ordinary, working Canadians. It depends on 
what day we speak to those members. They pretend to represent a 
variety of things. At least on occasion they pretend to be the party 
of the average person.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1347"> 1347 </A></B>
<P>
	What are those members proposing to the House today? What 
are they asking Parliament to do? They are asking to eliminate the 
position of the minister responsible for working people, the person 
who sits at the cabinet table to represent them. I hope all workers in 
the next election campaign get copies of this amendment and 
distribute it widely.
<P>
	Whether a person is unionized or otherwise, the principle is the 
same. They are trying to eliminate that representation from the 
cabinet table. Whether working for a railway under federal 
jurisdiction, an airport, a TV station, a radio station, a crown 
corporation in any position, the Government of Canada or the 
wheat pool, the member from Kenora will know that all these 
people are covered by acts of Parliament as opposed to provincial 
legislatures. The Minister of Labour is the representative of all 
these people at the cabinet table.
<P>
	I know the hon. member spoke cannot speak again on her 
amendments, but perhaps others in her caucus who have assisted 
with the drafting of these amendments can enlighten the House on 
why it is appropriate and desirable to abolish the position of 
minister of labour, the representative of the working person at the 
cabinet table. I have some difficulty with that.
<P>
	They also want to remove the provision whereby cabinet could 
decide to have a deputy minister of labour. That is optional. It is not 
compulsory. It is an option the government has. They want to 
restrict or remove that option in addition to abolishing the position 
of the minister.
<P>
	I do not know how long the Reform Party had to think about all 
this. I suspect it was probably done on the back of an envelope with 
not much thought. I say this respectfully. I ask all hon. members in 
the House why they would want to eliminate the position of the 
minister of labour, to deprive the working people of Canada of a 
voice at the cabinet table.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wonder if workers from all over the country who voted when 
byelections were held a few days ago knew that the Reform Party 
wanted to remove their representative from the cabinet table. And 
when they do become aware of this fact-and they will certainly 
find out when they hear about the amendments being debated 
today-I wonder if those few who were tempted to vote for the 
Reform Party will still be inclined to do so, knowing that their 
representative would no longer sit at the cabinet table. Imagine 
making the member for Saint-Léonard-not the person but the 
position-disappear; the Reform Party would want to see  the 
Minister of Labour dropped from cabinet and not be replaced.
<P>
<B>(1200)</B>
<P>
	Workers would not be represented by anyone. Zero 
representation, that is what the Reform Party wants. Does that 
make any sense like the member says? It is appalling.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Let us take a minute and look at the extremely good and well 
qualified individual that presently holds the position, the hon. 
member for Saint-Léonard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Until recently the member for Saint-Léonard was Secretary of 
State for Parliamentary Affairs. He has very extensive experience. 
He studied at the Sir George Williams campus of Concordia 
University and had a career in accounting. He is a chartered 
accountant. He also had a very elegant and interesting political 
career. He was a school trustee and was president of a very large 
school board. He was elected as member of Parliament in 1984, 
re-elected in 1988 and also in 1993. And now, they would want that 
person removed from the cabinet table. As I said before, it is not 
the member himself they want to get rid of, but his presence in 
cabinet.
<P>
	I can hear some hon. members heckling from the other side and I 
am almost tempted to answer myself this proposition of the Reform 
Party to make the hon. member from Saint-Léonard disappear from 
the cabinet table. No, it is not done, and it will not be done, 
fortunately, because workers in Canada, when they hear later today 
or early tomorrow, that Reform members want to do away with the 
position of Minister of Labour will call Reform members to order.
<P>
	When Reform members board their plane to go home this 
afternoon, tomorrow or whenever, I am sure that airline employees 
will greet them a little less warmly, knowing that they want to do 
away with their representative in cabinet.
<P>
	This is what the Reform Party wants to do and it is a shame. I tell 
you it is a shame. From one end of the country to the other, people 
will rebel against this suggestion, especially since Canadians hold 
the member responsible for this portfolio, the hon. member for 
Saint-Léonard, in such high regard, as he is very qualified and 
elegant. They would like to remove this great speaker in the House 
of Commons, this great defender of workers, from cabinet. Can you 
imagine that. It is a shame and Canadians will never accept that we 
do away with their representative in cabinet, especially someone 
with the qualities of the hon. member for Saint-Léonard.

<P>
amendments to Bill C-11, to remind the House of the initial 
purpose of the bill, which is to create  a Department of Human 
Resources Development. Incidentally, this department has already 
been in operation for three years, but the government went ahead 
without parliamentary approval and we are now trying to regularize 
the situation.
<P>
	What is important to know is that this bill will, in short, 
formalize systematic encroachment in the areas of education and 
manpower and will, for the first time, make it possible for the 
federal government to legally interfere as much as it wants in all 
areas that have long been recognized as provincial jurisdictions.
<P>
<B>(1205)</B>
<P>
	Second, this department is, I believe, a bureaucratic monster that 
will encompass very different sectors. One may be a little surprised 
by the amendment put forth by the Reform Party, since not 
appointing a Minister of Labour would bring about this 
bureaucratic world. This, I think, goes against Reform policy, 
against giving members of Parliament and ministers more say in 
what the government does. Because of the size of this department, 
the minister must very often rely on the positions advocated by 
senior officials.
<P>
	The best proof of this is the department's stubborn determination 
to go ahead with a UI reform no one in Quebec and Canada wants. 
After being told stories by bureaucrats and perhaps also by other 
groups that would benefit from a deterioration in people's working 
conditions, we must now deal with today's reality. We must not 
make the problem worse. I think the Reform amendment should be 
rejected.
<P>
	Let us consider the consequences of no longer having a Minister 
of Labour. Let us not forget that some emergency situations may 
require special legislation, as when the government felt we needed 
a special law in the area of rail transport. Not having a Minister of 
Labour per se could create some very difficult situations. The 
Minister of Human Resources Development cannot spend all the 
time needed on those activities. There must be some independent 
thinking on issues that are closely related.
<P>
	The Department of Human Resources Development deals with 
pension issues. The Minister of Labour often has to appoint people 
as negotiators or conciliators to intervene in labour conflicts 
involving this kind of situation, and he could be placed in a conflict 
of interest position. It would therefore be better for the government 
to appoint a Minister of Labour.
<P>
	Another major reason to proceed like this in the future is that we 
must go ahead with the reform of the Canada Labour Code that has 
been promised for so long and on which the government is 
dragging its feet. If passed, the amendment put forward by the 
Reform Party would just give the government one more excuse to 
delay amending the labour code for another six, eight, twelve or 
eighteen months. But if, on the other hand, there was someone in  
cabinet who was identified as responsible for this, we could check 
with this person, in April, May or June, if indeed the consultations 
under way will result in changes to the labour code. Will 
anti-strikebreaking legislation covering federal areas of 
jurisdiction finally be introduced, yes or no? Only a minister can 
answer this kind of question.
<P>
	If the responsibility rests with someone else in cabinet, this 
could be will just one issue among others and any delay, like those 
experienced in amending the labour code, will seem more normal 
or acceptable.
<P>
	Let me give you another example. In the past weeks, a bill 
authorizing nuclear industries to be subject to provincial labour 
laws, if need be, was considered in committee.
<P>
	If there were only one minister responsible, it would be more 
difficult to get things done, like having a sub-committee look into a 
matter. Should we need the minister to appear before the human 
resources development committee and the labour committee at the 
same time, it would be physically impossible for him to be at both 
places at the same time. This goes to show that the proposed 
amendment would have a very negative effect on labour relations 
in Quebec and Canada. I do not think that we will be able to support 
it.
<P>
	Why is the Minister of Labour important? Why is it necessary to 
have one all the time and to be able to appoint one when the 
government sees fit? To make sure that action can be taken. The 
anti-scab legislation I referred to earlier is a very important issue in 
our society. There are two realities. There are workers who are 
covered by provisions ensuring that their labour relations with their 
employers are much healthier and on a more equal footing. The are 
also workers who have no protection in that respect.
<P>
	Unless the federal government takes a strong stand, clearly 
showing his commitment to resolving this problem and actually 
resolving it, this will result in a repetition of situations like the 
dispute at Ogilvie Mills.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	Remember the strike, not the one in 1920, but in 1995. Workers 
on the picket lines had to contend with bullies hired by the 
company to let non-union workers go in. Such a deplorable 
situation-the use of scabs-is very bad for labour relations. The 
malaise persists long after the signing of a collective agreement, 
sometimes forever. This type of situation greatly affects labour 
relations. If we do not have a labour minister who is accountable, it 
will be even harder to settle such conflicts.
<P>
	What is the purpose of the Reform Party's amendment? It may 
simply be a matter of reducing costs. However, we have to make 
sure that it is indeed the case and that we are not in fact killing 
investments. If we come to the conclusion that there is no need for 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1349"> 1349 </A></B>
<P>
a labour  minister, we will also conclude that this is not an 
important sector.
<P>
	There may another reason behind this amendment. Perhaps the 
Reform Party realized that-and the government is partly to blame 
for that-after the new human resources development minister 
took office, the first person appointed as labour minister was 
someone who was not a cabinet member. That person was to be 
responsible for the referendum issue, and we had the impression 
that the government had created this position strictly to allow her to 
come on board.
<P>
	This left a very negative impression. That person has since been 
replaced. It goes without saying that, during the months when she 
was in charge of the labour portfolio, the former minister spent 
most of her time working on the referendum. Several issues that 
should have been taken care of were left untouched, and it may be 
that the Reform Party feels that the same situation could happen 
over and over again, and that we will never have someone who will 
put all his energy into dealing with this issue.
<P>
	I feel that we will be better able to solve the issue by working in 
this House, asking questions and criticizing the labour minister's 
performance. If, in fact, the current minister is spending the bulk of 
his time on political organizing because he is the minister 
responsible for electoral organization in Quebec for the Liberal 
Party of Canada, then we will be able to judge whether he has 
devoted more time to the political organization of his party than to 
workers, who will have to look at his performance and see whether 
he has been effective.
<P>
	Not just workers, but employers as well, because we are 
increasingly realizing that for Canada and Quebec to be 
competitive, it is important that there be more joint action, more 
pooling of ideas with respect to objectives in order to be able to 
secure a good position on world markets and keep up with the 
competition.
<P>
	For these reasons, it seems to me that the Reform Party 
amendment, however good the intentions behind it, does not 
correspond to the needs of Quebec and of Canada because we need 
a labour minister, and in the short term, we need a reform of the 
labour code and new anti-scab legislation.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Shaughnessy Cohen (Windsor-St. Clair, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I am from Windsor which is a union town. The people of 
Windsor are watching the Reform Party very closely. Of course it 
does not have much hope there. It received about 4,500 votes in my 
riding in the last election. However, I heard by the grapevine that 
Reformers think they may have an opportunity there. Let me tell 
them that in the next campaign the Liberal members from Windsor 
will be sure to tell our citizens that the Reform Party wants to 
eliminate labour's only representative at the cabinet table.
<P>
	I do not know why anyone should be surprised. The Reform 
Party stands opposed to most of the goals of organized labour.
<P>
	Organized labour wants better conditions for working men and 
women. The Reform Party is opposed. Organized labour wants 
employment equity. The Reform Party is opposed. Organized 
labour, indeed all working men and women in Canada, want parity 
for men and women in the labour force. The Reform Party is 
opposed. Organized labour would like some form of protection 
during strikes, some form of anti-scab legislation. The Reform 
Party is opposed.
<P>
<B>(1215 )</B>
<P>
	Reform just does not limit itself in its opposition to issues of 
specific concern to labour but issues of general concern in our 
society where labour has taken a lead. On the Canada Health Act 
and the principles of the Canada Health Act, Reform is opposed. 
On gun control, which Canadian labour spoke out clearly on, 
Reform is opposed. On Canada pension plan reform, Reform is 
opposed; it wants to eliminate CPP. On employment insurance 
reform, the Reform Party is opposed. On human rights 
amendments, the Reform Party is opposed. On humane and careful 
deficit reduction, Reform is opposed to that as well.
<P>
	These guys, and most of them are guys, remain opposed to 
almost everything that this government has tried to do for the 
working people of Canada. Indeed we ought to change the name of 
their leader from leader of the third party to Dr. No when it comes 
to labour related initiatives.
<P>
	I have a message for Dr. No. Working men and women in Canada 
are watching him. Indeed, working men and women in Windsor are 
watching him very closely. This motion is simply a symptom of the 
greater disease in the Reform Party, the disease I call the ``I'm all 
right Jack'' syndrome. What happens with this syndrome is they 
say: ``I've got mine, I did okay and I am not responsible for anyone 
else''. This government does not operate that way and it is just not 
good enough for us.
<P>
	This government wants labour to have representation at the table 
when cabinet decisions are made and when policy initiatives are 
taken. It is important to this government to have someone there 
who has had experience in labour, who understands working men 
and women and who wants to do the best for them. It is important 
that this government has someone there particularly during this 
crucial period who will consult with and bring the views of labour 
to the table.
<P>
	Who better could have been chosen but the former Minister of 
Labour and the present Minister of Labour? My colleague, the 
chief government whip, indicated some of his qualifications. One 
of the things he left out was that this minister's first job when we 
came to Canada was as a union organizer in the garment district in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1350"> 1350 </A></B>
<P>
Montreal.  What better person could we have to speak for the 
working men and women of Canada at the cabinet table than this 
minister?
<P>
	The human resources development department is one that I and 
others became familiar with during the last session of Parliament. I 
sat on that committee. It is a huge department. Frankly, it requires 
more than one hand at the tiller. It seems to me that when the Prime 
Minister took a hard look at the development of that department 
and how it was moving along, he was wise to single in on labour as 
the one area that needed special attention. As a result of that we 
now have this minister who has established himself well within the 
labour community and who is going to move forward with the kind 
of labour code and other initiatives that we require.
<P>
	The powers of the Minister of Labour are not changing in terms 
of program statutes that existed prior to the human resources 
development act. The Minister of Labour will continue to be named 
in federal labour legislation, such as the Canada Labour Code, the 
Fair Wages and Hours of Labour Act, the Government Employees 
Compensation Act and the Non-smokers' Health Act which is part 
of that mandate.
<P>
	The human resources act requires as well that the minister make 
use of services and facilities within the human resources 
development department and that he use employees from that 
department. This is not a case of the government creating a new 
department. This is a case of the government making sure that there 
is someone there, someone who is dedicating his attention full time 
to the concerns of the working men and women of Canada.
<P>
	Why would Reform oppose that? I do not know. I suppose it was 
Dr. No's idea.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I thought I should get up and answer a few of the more preposterous 
things that are coming from the government whip and some of the 
other members on the other side of the House. They would know 
that the reason we proposed our amendments is that we are 
concerned about wasteful government spending and we are trying 
to save the Canadian taxpayer some dollars. That was the basis of 
our argument and our motion on the position of minister of labour.
<P>
<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	I must say that we in the Reform Party have absolutely nothing 
to learn from the federal Liberal Party and the government when it 
comes to labour relations and how to treat people. Our policies 
clearly state that we recognize the right of workers to organize 
unions, to strike peacefully, and to carry out the business of 
collective bargaining. We fully understand and recognize that. It is 
in our policies. Any words to the contrary are words dreamed up in 
the minds of the Liberal spin doctors.
<P>
	What we are getting at today is that the position of the minister 
of labour was left vacant in the first cabinet of our Prime Minister. 
He put together a cabinet with no post of minister of labour. The 
reason was clear. It had been eliminated previously by Kim 
Campbell and had been seen as part and parcel of human resources 
development and of managing that portfolio. Suddenly the Liberals 
needed someone from Quebec supposedly to run their unity 
campaign. So they created the post and stuck a person in there in 
order to give them a profile and a position to supposedly fight the 
national unity campaign.
<P>
	By the looks of how that went, I would suggest it was a double 
barrelled failure all around but still, they muddled through that. 
That is why the post was created. It was strictly a political post 
created to give a newcomer to the House a position, some way to 
get them close to cabinet and give them a profile in Quebec.
<P>
	On the general issues of how the government is behaving or 
handling the labour relations side, has it improved since they got 
the position of minister of labour filled? As I mentioned, there is 
something to learn here, but there are no positive lessons about 
labour management relations from the government. If ever there 
was a government that speaks out of both sides of its mouth on the 
issue, this government has raised it to a new level.
<P>
	I would like to know how many members opposite campaigned 
on a promise to cancel the workforce adjustment directive for 
public service workers. I wonder how many over there campaigned 
on a promise to lay off 45,000 federal civil servants because they 
cannot get their ducks in a row as far as the debt and deficit are 
concerned. I wonder how many of them campaigned on that 
promise.
<P>
	I wonder how many said: ``You have the right to a collective 
bargaining process but as soon as there is a strike in the port 
system, we will legislate you back to work. In other words, you 
have the right, but of course we will not let you use it''. I wonder 
how many Liberals campaigned on that.
<P>
	I wonder how many people in the labour movement know that 
the Minister of Human Resource Development will not even talk to 
the head of the Canadian Labour Congress. He says: ``We have 
nothing to discuss so take a powder Bob''. I wonder how many 
people in the Liberal Party campaigned on that in Windsor. I 
wonder how many of them go to Hamilton and say: ``I am proud to 
say that our minister will not talk to the head of the Canadian 
Labour Congress''.
<P>
	It is just a little far fetched to say that the Reform Party is 
anti-labour. The Reform Party says it needs to find solutions to 
work together to find ways to make the collective bargaining 
system work well. As we all know, there are places in Canada 
where the strike system does not work, where there are essential 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1351"> 1351 </A></B>
<P>
services, where there  are no checks and balances and where neither 
the workers nor the Canadian taxpayers are protected.
<P>
	We have proposed binding final offer arbitration for those areas. 
We are up front about that. It is far better to be up front about that 
than to say: ``We will let you bargain, then at the last minute we 
will come in with the heavy hammer of the federal government and 
legislate you back to work. So you have no rights and even the 
rights you do bargain collectively for, we will cancel them when we 
want to''.
<P>
	The government has a dismal record on labour issues. It is 
pitiful.
<P>
<B>(1225 )</B>
<P>
	When the government says that the people in organized labour 
are clamouring for employment equity it probably may be true that 
the head of some of those organizations are. If the Liberals got off 
their high horse, got their heads out of the upper echelons of the 
theoretical, got down to the grassroots and asked the people there 
how many they thought should be hired on the basis of the colour of 
their skin, their gender or to fill a quota of certain categories in the 
workplace, how many would say that? The answer is hardly 
anybody. Certainly people who are in the affected categories will 
not even say that is a good thing.
<P>
	It is a case of the government saying it will listen when it wants 
to. It has very selective hearing. That is part of the problem when 
you are in Ottawa for too long: your ears go numb and your tongue 
starts flapping. The government has been guilty of that time and 
again. The government has not listened well to what Canadians 
really want on labour issues. Instead it plays the charade, talks out 
of both sides of its mouth and tries to blame the Reform Party for 
what is a very weak record on labour issues.
<P>
	This motion to eliminate the position of the minister of labour is 
not because the position of labour is not important. Of course 
labour issues are critical to the economic success of our country. 
The ability to work well together, to look after grievances in the 
workplace, to be able to put forward things of importance to the 
grassroots in the workplace, by all means these are good things. 
But to say that none of this can happen unless we have another 
ministry with all the hangers on and the money that goes with it is 
just not true.
<P>
	As a matter of fact the very first cabinet the government brought 
in did not have a minister of labour. What happened then? Did the 
world collapse? Did the labour movement suddenly come under the 
jackboot of authority? It is just not true. That position is not 
necessary. It can save considerable money. It can save another 
political appointment position. It would not hurt the Canadian 
labour movement at all to know that its concerns on health, 
unemployment insurance, all these  issues were being looked after 
by the minister who administers those programs.
<P>
	What we have now is a minister in HRD who says he will not 
talk to the president of the Canadian Labour Congress. What is the 
other minister supposed to do? Ask him please to talk? It is his job 
to talk. One wonders where the Liberals are coming from on this. It 
seems to me that they must have more positions to fill, more 
favours to hand out than they have positions available and so they 
created another.
<P>
	In order to look after the labour movement it is not necessary to 
have that position. That is why our proposal would eliminate it. It 
would save the taxpayers considerable dollars and would still allow 
the labour market to function very well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to set the record straight on 
an issue that was raised a moment ago by the hon. member across 
the way that the Minister of Labour will not meet with the president 
of the Canadian Labour Congress. The Minister of Labour has met 
on many occasions with the president of the Canadian Labour 
Congress. In fact this morning they met at 8 a.m.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> The minister of HRD.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Proud:</B> That is on a different issue.
<P>
	It is ridiculous that a party in this House would stand up and say 
that 750,000 workers in this country should not have a minister 
designated to administer the act that they come under. This has 
always been the case. In recent times we did not have a minister but 
I cannot understand anybody getting up in this House and saying 
that these people do not deserve to have a minister to represent 
them.
<P>
	The Ministry of Labour has existed for a long time. It has now 
been rolled in with Human Resources Development Canada. We 
have other organizations in this country that have ministers and 
departments responsible for them.
<P>
	The reason for the minister is that the department was one of the 
four founding departments which helped create human resources 
development in 1993. Until the first minister, the member for 
Saint-Henri-Westmount, assumed the office, the human resources 
development minister acted in that capacity.
<P>
<B>(1230 )</B>
<P>
	I believe that under the Canada Labour Code, which has been 
reviewed just recently and to which changes are imminent, a 
minister of labour must be on the scene to look after things. 
Situations also arise from time to time in the stevedoring industry, 
the rail industry and the airline industry that are best handled by 
individuals dealing directly with those situations as they arise.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1352"> 1352 </A></B>
<P>
	I find it hard to believe that people would suggest that this is 
a waste of money. I do not believe it is. The matters being dealt 
with in this specific case under the Canada Labour Code are 
working conditions, safety and health and the jurisdiction of 
labour negotiations. With a such large group of Canadians, it is 
really irresponsible for parties to recommend that this ministry 
should not exist.
<P>
	With the proposals that will be coming forward dealing with 
amendments to parts I, II and III of the Canada Labour Code, the 
ministry will be very busy over the next number of weeks and 
months. As well, other situations might arise.
<P>
	If one looks today at the number of contracts that are expiring 
and the negotiations that are going on in various industries which 
fall under the jurisdiction of the Minister of Labour, one would find 
that some problems will exist before the year is out where the 
services of the department will be needed. It is very important 
when there are situations like this that the leaders of both sides can 
sit down with a minister designated for that specific department.
<P>
	This is very necessary. I do not know the full reason behind what 
the members of the Reform Party are saying. It appears that they 
are seeking to eliminate the post but the rationale for it seems 
somewhat unclear. The member who just spoke a moment ago was 
referring to our ability to create good labour relations. The Liberal 
Party has been in power for many years over the last century and 
labour relations in this country have not suffered greatly because of 
that.
<P>
	I do not think I need to take any lessons from the party across the 
way on how to administer labour legislation. I am sure that any 
time any of the labour unions in Canada want to hear my voice on 
any of the issues that are before it I have never ever failed to speak 
to it and I will never do that as long as I am in public life.
<P>
	I have served in government for the last number of years and 
have never been anti-labour. I have certainly helped to bring people 
together in whatever capacity I was in. I served in another 
jurisdiction as minister of labour. I happen to believe that by 
continuing to work with these parties, situations can be brought to 
final solutions. It probably would not happen if it was a huge 
department and the minister had many other areas to look after.
<P>
	Therefore, I think a very necessary thing came about when the 
Prime Minister appointed a Minister of Labour last year. We have 
to continue to keep that and build on it. Probably some days I 
would argue for a specific department. However, with the situation 
the way it is now with the amalgamation of the four departments 
into one, I am still quite confident that we can go forward with the 
ministries in place and the people, the assistants, the deputy 
ministers and the staff to make this a very workable and great 
administration for the Canada  Labour Code. To me the Canada 
Labour Code is very important legislation.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	The Sims report was recently given to the minister and there will 
be consultations across the land in the not too distant future on 
what parties believe needs to be changed or if any changes need to 
be made. When things have been around for a long time some think 
they should be changed. Sometimes they have worked so well that 
it may not be necessary to make any major changes.
<P>
	It is necessary to have a minister of labour. That has been proven 
in the past number of days with the legislation put through the 
House. It was a good effort on the part of the three parties involved 
in it. That was brought forward by the minister. This must continue. 
The people under this legislation need an individual, whomever he 
or she may be, to see to air their problems, their situations and their 
suggestions as we move forward.
<P>
	Labour management at the best of times is mostly 
confrontational. That is the way it is. There is no other way to put 
it. We all talk of ways to change it to make it more compatible. 
Usually when it comes down to the nuts and bolts of a contract or a 
dispute of whatever magnitude, it does become very 
confrontational. These are the reasons for ministers, these are the 
reasons for conciliation officers who are responsible to that 
minister.
<P>
	I have said enough on this issue. For the life of me I cannot see 
why any party in the House would say at this time that this ministry 
is not needed. It is a very important ministry which should be 
continued and built upon.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, when 
we saw Bill 96-which became Bill C-111-for the first time, we 
were very concerned, because this bill, which sets up a new 
department, the Department of Human Resources Development, in 
fact institutionalizes the overlap with all of the provinces, 
including, of course, Quebec. The way it is done makes it 
extremely difficult to amend this bill.
<P>
	The Apostle Paul said: ``For the letter killeth, but the spirit 
giveth life''. It is extremely difficult to amend this legislation, 
because the words in it translate a spirit, which is the Department 
of Human Resources Development, but without defining it, give a 
minister of the federal government jurisdiction over all human 
resources development in Canada, when, as we know, the 
Constitution of 1867 made it the general responsibility of the 
provinces, which was then amended very precisely to provide for 
old age pensions, family allowances and an unemployment 
insurance scheme.
<P>
	Apart from these three constitutional amendments, provincial 
responsibility remains intact. The effect of the bill then is to wipe 
out the responsibility of the provinces and enable a federal
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1353"> 1353 </A></B>
<P>
 minister to take it over with everybody's money. So the problem 
with Bill C-96 is not that the Minister of Human Resources 
Development may designate a minister of labour. No, the problem 
is the Minister of Human Resources Development. The Department 
of Human Resources Development is a Conservative holdover.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	I know that not many of our colleagues across the way or beside 
us will admit it. But without Kim Campbell, whose government 
that lasted about 100 days decided to merge several departments 
for the avowed purpose-which cost her dearly-of carrying out a 
general reform of social programs, something the Liberals swore 
they would never do, I am convinced there would never have been a 
Department of Human Resources Development because it was a 
major upheaval.
<P>
	Yet, the senior officials who submitted this proposal to Ms. 
Campbell are still there. I would like to tell my colleagues on this 
side, who are now on my left-this is but one way of referring to 
them, otherwise it would be improper-that the fewer ministers 
there are, the more senior officials lead the way; we must be very 
clear on this.
<P>
	I think there is a very clear link between what came out in the 
last days of the Tory government and what the Liberal government 
came up with. I am sure the Conservatives could have done the 
same thing with social program reform, except that the Liberals, 
had they been in opposition, would have been vigorously opposed 
because this reform is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	Let us look at the Department of Labour. There is a Canadian 
Department of Labour. Even if the Minister of Human Resources 
Development were not allowed to appoint a Minister of Labour, the 
Prime Minister could appoint one. In my opinion, this amendment 
would only prevent the Minister of Human Resources 
Development from appointing a designated minister. This is the 
only effect it might have. It would not prevent the Prime Minister 
from appointing a Minister of Labour.
<P>
	Let us look at the Department of Labour, which is also the result 
of history. Federalists should perhaps be reminded that, had the 
London Privy Council not returned labour relations to provincial 
jurisdiction in 1925, labour relations would now come under 
federal jurisdiction. Fortunately, it is not the case, except for those 
employees who, without getting technical, work for the federal 
government or for organizations whose function is considered of 
national interest and therefore extends beyond the confines of a 
single province.
<P>
	From a social point of view, Labour Canada is lagging behind 
now. We have no problem with there being a Department of Labour 
and no problem with there being a Minister of Labour, but we do 
have a problem with the positions she has taken. In the rail dispute, 
the Minister  of Labour could have seized the opportunity to boost 
ideas of joint labour-management action.
<P>
	Instead, she preferred boosting labour relations based on the 
primary interest of employers. Too bad, but just the same, it is sad. 
It is sad because Canada will never get out of the situation it is in 
right now if the current Minister of Labour and the government as a 
whole, including the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
do not stop displaying the attitude they have been displaying 
recently regarding employees.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	This attitude is unworthy of a so-called Liberal government, but 
above all it is counter-productive if what their goal is indeed to 
improve the social and economic situation.
<P>
	It is important to have a labour minister provided the minister 
sees to it that labour relations in organizations falling under his 
jurisdiction abide by rules allowing a certain power relationship 
between the parties. To replace the words ``power relationship'', 
we could talk about the ability the parties should have to talk to and 
listen to one another.
<P>
	When one side, that is when employers are so strong that they do 
not care about workers-because the reverse is very rare-it is 
always dangerous, including from an economic point of view, 
because workers can resort to a measure that can have terrible 
consequences. Let us not forget that, while workers can be forced 
to work, they cannot be forced to work well. They cannot be forced 
to use all their imagination and motivation.
<P>
	And without that imagination, that motivation and that 
commitment from workers, any economy is bound to suffer. In 
Canada, the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and the government should be much more concerned 
about ensuring that workers have decent working conditions and 
social security, precisely to promote that socio-economic 
productivity.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, as a member 
of the human resources development committee and a member of 
the official opposition, I oppose the amendment brought forward 
by the Reform Party. This amendment seeks to abolish-as the 
government whip pointed out-the position of labour minister. It 
seeks to eliminate the possibility of appointing such a minister.
<P>
	Through magic or a simple amendment, an important position 
would thus disappear. The hon. member for Mercier mentioned all 
the things that a labour minister in Canada could do to settle certain 
disputes. She alluded to the role that the former labour minister 
could have played in the railway conflict. In my riding, there are 
500 CN employees working at the Charny yard. They were very 
dissatisfied with the performance of the then labour minister.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1354"> 1354 </A></B>
<P>
	However, this does not mean that we should eliminate that 
position. If you exclude the amount that is used to pay interest, 
almost half of the federal government's budget goes to the 
Department of Human Resources Development. The human 
resources minister already has enough on his hands without having 
to assume the duties of labour minister.
<P>
	If we eliminated the position of labour minister and transferred 
the responsibilities to the Minister of Human Resources 
Development, the latter would sometimes find himself in awkward 
or difficult situations.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	The human resources development minister manages not only 
money, but also human resources everywhere in Canada, as well as 
financial resources which are allocated to organizations and 
businesses. The minister might not find himself in a conflict of 
interest situation, but it would put him in an awkward position.
<P>
	It is good and also important to keep the position of labour 
minister separate. This is what I had to say on the issue.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is the House 
ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Is it the 
pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those in 
favour will please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> All those 
opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> In my opinion 
the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> Call in the 
members.
<P>
	<I>And the division bells having rung:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Ringuette-Maltais):</B> The recorded 
division on the motion stands deferred.
<P>
	We now go on to Group No. 2, Motion No. 3.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 3</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-11, in Clause 20, be amended by replacing lines 8 to 16, on page 
6, with the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``20. For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, coordination and 
implementation of any program or policy relating to the powers, duties and 
functions referred to in section 6, the Minister may enter into an agreement with 
an agency of a province, after obtaining the approval of the lieutenant governor 
in council of the province, and may enter into agreements with a province or 
group of provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies, 
other than an agency of the province, as the Minister considers appropriate.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, we are now on group no. 2, Motion 
No. 3, an amendment to clause 20. The clause as presently written 
gives the federal government the power to bypass provincial 
governments, giving grants and so on the emanations of these 
governments, without first seeking approval of the provincial 
governments. This is unacceptable. The minister should not be able 
to circumvent provincial governments.
<P>
	If this government believes in decentralization, as it says it does, 
it should be willing to consult with provincial governments rather 
than be involved in asking for legislation which allows it to give 
provincial governments the bypass.
<P>
	Under such a clause the minister may choose to privatize or to 
contract out certain human resources department services. If this is 
to happen it should happen in direct relation to provincial 
governments, not leave open a door to go to some other agencies. 
Power should go directly to provincial governments and not 
through a roundabout route to one of these agencies as the bill 
would allow.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	Therefore my amendment would change clause 20 to read:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, co-ordination and 
implementation of any program or policy relating to the powers, duties and 
functions referred to in section 6, the minister may enter into an agreement with 
an agency of a province, after obtaining the approval of the lieutenant governor 
in council of the province, and may enter into agreements with a province or 
group of provinces, financial institutions and such other persons or bodies, 
other an an agency of the province, as the minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I believe this amendment is a reasonable compromise. Is it not? 
The federal government has direct input into the lieutenant 
governors of each province. Surely consulting them is not too much 
to ask. I believe again this is more than a reasonable compromise.
<P>
	I also believe the government is misleading Canadians and not 
dealing honestly with the provinces. I remind the government of a 
recent visit by the new minister of human resources to metro 
Toronto. The minister bypassed the provincial government, went 
straight to an agency or a group and announced a $4 million grant 
to child care. What is the federal government saying to the 
provinces? ``We will give you less in transfer payments, but we still 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1355"> 1355 </A></B>
<P>
want to look like the good guys so we will independently bypass 
provincial governments and play  Santa Clause. Rather than work 
with our provincial governments, we will portray them in a very 
poor light. We will portray them as Scrooge''.
<P>
	Even worse, the appropriate minister involved in the Ontario 
government, Mr. Tsubouchi, did not even know about this. He read 
the announcement in the newspapers.
<P>
	The government is always making great noise about how it 
works with the provinces, how it gets along so well and how it 
discusses things. I wonder if Mr. Tsubouchi would agree.
<P>
	This clause, which allows the minister to bypass negotiating 
with the provinces for services delivery and enables him to deal 
with lower level agencies, should be changed. We are not asking 
for anything unreasonable from the government. The lieutenant 
governor is very closely associated with the federal government. 
This is most reasonable. This a compromise we could work 
together.
<P>
	The Reform Party wants to work with the government when it 
can. If the government has legislation we feel is good, we will work 
to pass it. If it is legislation we feel needs to be amended, we will 
work to amend it and still pass it. The government must show that it 
too is willing to work with the elected representatives of the people 
of Canada. To date we have not seen that in the House.
<P>
	As it stands, this clause amounts to a federal tax grab, a power 
grab, if you will. We believe power should be left in the hands of 
the provinces. This clause allows the government to avoid dealing 
directly with provincial governments, especially those that may not 
be sympathetic to some federal initiatives. Therein lies the 
problem. I do not think the government is being honest. If there is a 
problem with some governments, and it knows ahead of time that 
the governments may opposed federal initiatives, this is one way it 
can get around that problem. I do not think that is being honest. It is 
something we should address and the compromise addresses it.
<P>
	If the government is adamant that it does not have this intention 
and that they are more than willing to work with all provincial 
governments, not worried that some provincial governments may 
disagree with it and therefore not go ahead with the legislation, all 
it has to do is go along with the Reform Party on this good 
amendment. Go along with the compromise and show provincial 
governments that it does trust them and that it does want to work 
with them and that it will not attempt to bypass them in such a 
shoddy method.
<P>
<B>(1300 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure to have the opportunity to speak to this motion.
<P>
	I will start out by asking where the member has been. She must 
have been away for the last number of weeks since the speech from 
the throne and the budget which outlined the commitment of the 
government as it relates to negotiations with the provinces in areas 
of provincial jurisdiction, for example in training and education. 
Not too many days ago we sent every member of Parliament a copy 
of a letter that we sent to every province which indicates what we 
would like to get into negotiating about as it relates to these 
agreements which help men and women get back to work.
<P>
	It seems passing strange that the Reform Party presented the 
previous amendment under the first grouping which dealt with the 
issue of trying to save money. Its argument to get rid of the 
Minister of Labour and the Deputy Minister of Labour was that 
they were a waste of taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Under the next amendment, the Reform Party wants to create a 
whole new bureaucracy under the lieutenant governor in council. 
This means that some committee or group of bureaucrats being 
paid by the provincial governments will have to get together to 
review every single agreement, which are in the thousands, by the 
human resources development department that we enter into with 
agencies in provinces across the country.
<P>
	I am not quite sure I understand where the Reform Party is 
coming from. That party believes in the elimination of duplication 
and overlap. That party asks why it is taking so long. Reformers 
keep telling us: ``You take so long to do anything no wonder we do 
not get anything done''. The Reform Party wants us to be very 
quick about what we do and then it presents an amendment that 
would take us months and months to try to get any discussion going 
on an issue. Obviously, this adds another step to the process and I 
hazard a guess it would be a very lengthy one to negotiate certain 
agreements on almost every issue. The member should clarify this.
<P>
	We said in the speech from the throne, and the Minister of 
Human Resources Development has been very clear in his letters to 
the provinces, that we will be entering into framework agreements. 
These framework agreements would be for those who are not in the 
labour movement and who may not have had the opportunity to 
enter into an agreement that has a broad general consensus of the 
provinces and the federal government to deal with issues and either 
transfer the responsibility to the province or to allow the federal 
government to enter into an agreement with agencies on an ad hoc 
basis based on a particular framework agreement.
<P>
	That is what we are proposing to do. That is how we save money. 
That is how we allow governments to work more efficiently. If the 
member and other members of her party are suggesting that we will 
create a whole new bureaucracy and a whole new level of 
duplication because of somebody's mystical belief that the federal  
government is trying to shaft the provinces or does not care, that it 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1356"> 1356 </A></B>
<P>
is trying to get political mileage out of an issue, I do not think they 
have been listening to the debate.
<P>
	I really want to emphasize that I am having difficulty today 
listening to the Reform Party's arguments. As mentioned before, 
the first amendment said that we should get rid of some of the costs 
and the Minister of Labour, that he does not do anything. We know 
how important he is to the overall workings of government and to 
the Canadian men and women who fall under federal jurisdiction.
<P>
	Then we get an amendment that suggests we should put a whole 
pile of money into a process which there is no need to have. Once 
we are finished negotiating with the provinces-and we agree that 
each province will be different and we accept that-then we will 
get on with the job we have been given, which is to help people get 
back to work, to give them the tools and abilities to be successful.
<P>
<B>(1305 )</B>
<P>
	I want to emphasize that we enter into literally thousands of 
agreements every year in every province with different agencies. 
Imagine the kind of bureaucratic nightmare the Reform Party is 
suggesting we create with this amendment. I suggest we totally 
reject the amendment.
<P>
	The fact remains that the speech from the throne and the letters 
that have been written by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development to the different provinces speak for themselves as to 
the intent of the federal government in regard to its relations with 
the provinces. We do not need another level of bureaucracy to help 
us do that job.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, the Reform's amendment is not so much intended 
to create a nightmare situation, as has just been suggested, but 
rather to maintain an existing nightmare. If we look at it carefully, 
the first part appears worthwhile; they want the minister to be able 
to enter into an agreement with an agency of a province after 
obtaining the approval of the lieutenant governor in council of the 
province. One's reaction is: ``Fine. That will respect provincial 
jurisdictions, and the jurisdiction of Quebec''.
<P>
	But then comes another part, ``may enter into agreements with a 
province or group of provinces, financial institutions and such 
other persons or bodies, other than an agency of the province, as the 
Minister considers appropriate''. This, then, is an agreement aimed 
at concretizing the current muddle that exists where manpower 
training is concerned. All is does is offer a snapshot of what the 
federal government is already doing. It is a somewhat useless 
amendment.
<P>
	Now, for some concrete examples. This would mean that an 
organization such as the Société québécoise de développement de 
la main-d'oeuvre, a public provincial body, could not enter into an 
agreement with the federal government without the authorization 
of its province. This can perhaps be defended, but it also means that 
a financial institution, such as the Bank of Montreal or the 
Mouvement Desjardins, or any other, could also sign this type of 
agreement without necessarily having Quebec's agreement.
<P>
	This would recreate exactly the situation that currently exists. 
All kinds of organizations get involved in training, with more or 
less recognition, with criteria, paying more or less attention to the 
objectives of the education department. This creates the chaos that 
we have now with two levels of government being involved. The 
government responsible for manpower training and education does 
not have control over how training is provided.
<P>
	Some people arrive on the labour market with a senior 
matriculation in office technology, for instance, while others have 
taken a course of one name or another that is not officially 
recognized by the department of education. When these people 
arrive on the labour market with their credentials, they are often in 
for a shock. They were told they were getting an education that 
would give them access to the labour market, but all of a sudden 
they discover that something is missing. Since they do not have the 
training required by the department of education, they cannot get 
equivalent certificates or diplomas, which creates all kinds of 
problems.
<P>
	This is exactly what the Reform Party is proposing with the 
amendment before us, especially where it says: ``financial 
institutions and such other persons or bodies-''.
<P>
	Nothing would prevent the federal government from signing a 
contract with an individual, whether or not the training to be 
provided is in line with the priorities of a Quebec region regarding 
manpower development. Such is the situation now. Quebec set up 
manpower committees to plan manpower requirements in each 
region, with a view to maximize job creation.
<P>
	By contrast, under the current situation, which would be 
formalized under the Reform Party's amendment, the federal 
government can award training contracts to people in a given 
region, even though this initiative may not be in line with the 
priorities set by the region's stakeholders.
<P>
	This will result in the useless spending that currently exists in 
that sector. A federalist minister from Quebec, as well as the 
Quebec Liberal government that preceded the Parti Quebecois in 
office, both recognized that $250 million are wasted in this fashion. 
This money is lost because two different networks are set up to 
train people for the same labour market. The result is that, in the 
end, we train people who have no jobs.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1357"> 1357 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	Everybody acted in good faith, including the people who 
purchased the federal program and those who received the training. 
The latter attend classes for a year full time and when they try to 
find a job they are told: ``It is unfortunate, but we have decided to 
give priority to other applicants who completed three years of 
vocational training.'' The opposite is also true, but many times we 
have provided training for people who, in the end, have no job 
opportunities.
<P>
	This is today's harsh reality. There are so many jobs available 
and people out of work, but we do not seem to be able to match 
them. According to a study made by the OECD, an international 
organization which enjoys a certain credibility when it comes to 
employment, Canada does not have a good manpower training 
system. This is one of the main reasons why we have a lot of 
trouble competing against other countries.
<P>
	In our day-to-day lives, we also have to face this situation. If you 
go to an employment centre and say that you are unemployed and 
wish to get some training, you are invited to join a group of people 
with the same goals. You register, attend classes for a year and, in 
the end, find yourself in a dead-end because the training you got 
did not give you the qualifications you need to re-enter the labour 
force.
<P>
	This also leads to undue competition between workers. This is 
why it is important to find another way to deal with this situation. 
The type of amendment put forward by the Reform Party will not 
solve the problem. The problem could have been solved if the 
current federal government had accepted the referendum results 
and come to understand what even the Director General of the 
Conseil du patronat du Québec told them, which is that the federal 
government should withdraw from manpower training and realize 
that Quebec's federalists and sovereignists all agree that the 
provincial government should be the only one responsible for any 
proactive employment measure and the only one empowered to act 
in this field.
<P>
	So, we will need more than this kind of amendment to solve the 
problem, especially since this amendment only reflects what we 
have already. This is why we will vote against this type of 
amendment which is only a smoke screen. We would ask the 
government, instead, to reconsider its position and finally 
recognize the consensus in Quebec in terms of manpower training, 
to realize that the only efficient solution is to have the government 
closest to the people provide the appropriate training so that, in the 
future, we will no longer make a difference between welfare 
recipients and the unemployed, between those who get a 
government cheque and those who do not, but we will have instead 
an overall proactive employment policy.
<P>
	The first thing to do is to ensure that we do not have two levels of 
government involved in the same jurisdiction. This is why we will 
vote against the Reform amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to echo 
the very relevant remarks made by the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup because what we are studying 
today is the bill that officially creates the Department of Human 
Resources Development.
<P>
	I have to remind members that this bill has been around for quite 
some time, since it was before the House last fall as Bill C-96. 
Today, because of the prorogation, it is Bill C-11. In fact, it is an 
old bill that has already been discussed in Parliament. Members 
will recall that, halfway through its mandate, the government 
wanted to give the impression that it had new projects, new 
programs to offer to Canadians.
<P>
	It shuffled the Cabinet, came in with a new speech from the 
throne and made a lot of noise to create the illusion of a change 
when in fact there is nothing new in the bills we have been 
discussing since the beginning of the new session. They are all old 
bills. The one now before us has even gone through clause by 
clause study in committee-and I remember it well since I am a 
member of the human resources development committee.
<P>
	We, in the official opposition, had fought hard at that time 
because we felt the government was taking the opportunity to make 
official its new Department of Human Resources Development, 
which brings together services that existed previously in other 
departments and which will manage half of the available budget 
once the interest on the debt has been paid. The Department of 
Human Resources Development is huge. What is worse, and the 
reason why the opposition criticized it, is the increased government 
meddling in areas of provincial jurisdiction. The Reform 
amendment reflects part of our objective but not enough, because it 
leaves the government with the possibility of yet again meddling in 
provincial affairs.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	I am the training and youth critic, so the educational sector 
interests me. We know that vocational training is the subject of a 
big discussion in Quebec, and especially of a consensus. There is 
nothing in this bill, however, even with the proposed amendment, 
to prevent the Minister of Human Resources Development from 
intervening in vocational training. As the bill says: ``-may enter 
into agreements with a province or group of provinces, financial 
institutions and such other persons or bodies-'' and then they talk 
about ``agencies of provinces- as the minister considers 
appropriate''. It still gives the Minister of Human Resources 
Development too much latitude to intervene in areas of provincial 
jurisdiction, especially in vocational training.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1358"> 1358 </A></B>
<P>
	So, of course, we expended a lot of energy during clause by 
clause consideration and we are continuing to do so today, because 
these amendments give us the opportunity to discuss this issue and 
to tell the people of Quebec clearly that we must object. For us, 
education is of the utmost importance, as is training, and we 
realize that, if these debates drag on and excuses are found to 
waste time, a kind of lassitude will set in. People say that it is 
always the same debates, always the same things. We let time go 
by, and, in the end, people get tired; they get fed up with this sort 
of debate.
<P>
	However, this is vital. We do not want to talk constitution, and 
the government said the Bloc just wants to talk about the 
Constitution. But by presenting this bill, by continuing to work for 
its passage, the government is drawing us into a constitutional 
debate, because it wants the support of Parliament and the House of 
Commons to meddle further in provincial affairs. We oppose that.
<P>
	Recently, someone took stock of the vocational training 
programs. Altogether, there were 108 different ones-both federal 
and provincial. Thousands of people are waiting for vocational 
training courses. Because resources are dispersed, there are people 
who may not be entitled to vocational training, because the money 
available in a province, in Quebec, in a sector or in a region has 
dried up.
<P>
	In the meantime, the federal government is continuing along 
opposite. Despite the fact that there are those who are excluded or 
who fall between the cracks. The present system is a double 
system. The federal government wants to cut the number of UI 
recipients. It then looks at vocational training or job readiness 
programs to get people off unemployment insurance without 
guaranteeing them a job.
<P>
<B>(1320)</B>
<P>
	During this time, the provincial government saw the 
consequences of cuts in unemployment insurance, to name just one 
area, which lead to an immediate increase in the number of people 
on welfare. As a result, the government finds itself performing a 
sort of balancing act. It must come up with training programs that 
will get employable welfare recipients off welfare. Sometimes this 
helps them to find a little job, something part time, but then they 
find themselves back on unemployment insurance. This is what 
happens in many cases.
<P>
	A constituent in my riding told me of his personal experience 
over a period of five years, how he was caught in an endless cycle 
of job training, unemployment insurance, welfare and uncertain 
employment. That is one thing.
<P>
	There are also those who now fall between the cracks, between 
the various levels of government, and do not qualify for assistance. 
I am thinking here of women who want to get back into the labour 
force, after staying at  home for years with young children, who 
have had two or three children and, in their forties or earlier, would 
like to return to work. Not having drawn unemployment insurance 
benefits latterly, they are not eligible for these courses.
<P>
	The system excludes many people. Once again, we in the official 
opposition are fighting for something that is extremely important. 
We are trying to explain to the people of Canada, to government 
members, that they should not go so far, that the government 
should not keep trying to interfere in something that does not 
concern it, because it is not in the Constitution, and then go directly 
against the Prime Minister's promises. At the time of the 
referendum, he said he was withdrawing from manpower training.
<P>
	Despite what we saw last week, not only the members of the 
National Assembly, but important representatives of the 
socio-economic sector at the Quebec City summit, despite the 
people representing the Conseil du patronat-the motion was even 
presented by Ghislain Dufour, the president of the Conseil du 
patronat-despite all that, the federal government continues along 
its merry way, counting on the lassitude of Canadians and of the 
media, who are giving this debate less attention. It thinks that, over 
time, people will be lose interest. It is just as dangerous for the 
future of Quebec.
<P>
	That is why we in the official opposition are joining forces and 
we hope that organizations will express their opposition to this, 
while there is still time. Despite the efforts of the Reform Party, the 
amendment will not reduce the federal government's meddling. On 
the contrary. The federal government has just said, through those of 
its members who spoke earlier, that it intends to continue in this 
area by making the Department of Human Resources official. In 
my opinion, it is almost a monster. It includes vocational training 
along with employment services; it has a say in old age pensions, 
child and family benefits and day care services. It is considerable.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, quite frankly I find it incredible that the Bloc is opposing 
this motion.
<P>
	Reform members have looked at this clause and feel that our 
motion is very appropriate and quite reasonable. I will go back over 
this clause so that the people back home who are watching can 
understand exactly what it is we are talking about. Clause 20 states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>For the purpose of facilitating the formulation, co-ordination and 
implementation of any program or policy relating to the powers, duties and 
functions referred to in section 6, the Minister may enter into agreements with a 
province or group of provinces, agencies of provinces, financial institutions 
and such other persons or bodies as the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1359"> 1359 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	On the surface it would seem quite reasonable to allow the 
minister to have that type of power and authority. However, as has 
already been articulated by my hon. colleague, we felt-call us a 
bit gun-shy or perhaps call us paranoid at times-we would like to 
see, especially in areas like this, as the Bloc has been articulating, 
that these are primarily areas of provincial responsibility. There has 
to be a proper check and balance put into place.
<P>
	My hon. colleague has proposed a quite reasonable amendment 
to this clause merely by inserting ``after obtaining the approval of 
the lieutenant-governor in council of the province''. That is all we 
are talking about, not some lengthy legalistic mumbo-jumbo but 
just a very basic amendment that would see the government held in 
check by the provinces. I might add it is the provinces that the 
government is always saying it is consulting and in ongoing 
discussions, and with which it has excellent working relationships.
<P>
	My party has difficulty with that. Unlike the member for 
Kenora-Rainy River, Reformers have very strong recent memories 
of some of the bills that this government has enacted over the 
course of the 35th Parliament, just one of which is Bill C-68, the 
gun legislation.
<P>
	I would question whether the government had the support of the 
provinces when five of the provinces and both territories were very 
outspoken against that legislation. I need not remind the House that 
legislation is going to have a direct impact on the financial 
well-being of the provinces when they are called on by the federal 
government to enact the registration scheme for all long guns in 
this country.
<P>
	That type of program has a very strong and definite economic 
impact on the provinces. Yet the government just arbitrarily 
declares it law and forges ahead. That is our fear in this area as 
well. The minister, when he runs up against some resistance from 
certain provinces, may just by-pass them and just forge ahead, 
putting the programs in place expecting the provinces to pick up 
the administrative costs or what have you.
<P>
	Another incident of note for members of Parliament from British 
Columbia is what happened last November and December. This 
government decided to bring forward a constitutional veto for the 
regions of the country. In its wisdom it decided, arbitrarily once 
again, on very short notice that British Columbia did not constitute 
a region. The government was just going to lump British Columbia 
in with the three prairie provinces, in with the west, when it was 
doling out this constitutional veto.
<P>
	Therefore, the provinces are more than a little gun-shy when it 
comes to these types of clauses, clauses that on the surface seem 
quite reasonable. Reformers feel that some appropriate check is 
necessary. We do not understand in this particular case at least why 
the Bloc Quebecois would not support it.
<P>
	This is the party that is always concerned about the provinces 
having some authority. This amendment would see that before the 
minister could forge ahead and enact certain programs that would 
have a definite impact on the provinces, the minister would have to 
clear those programs with the lieutenant-governor. Obviously it 
would have to be cleared with the lieutenant-governor of Quebec 
where that program would be a bilateral agreement between 
Quebec and the Government of Canada. Yet a couple of members 
from the Bloc have indicated they are going to be voting against 
this amendment. Quite frankly I find it amazing that a party that is 
always seeking to have more control for its province is going to 
vote against an amendment that would do exactly that.
<P>
<B>(1330 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. George S. Baker (Gander-Grand Falls, Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I have a couple of words concerning this amendment and 
the assumption that the Reform Party of Canada is the party that 
will protect provincial rights, that it will promote the non-intrusion 
of the federal government into provincial rights.
<P>
	It is very strange to hear the Reform Party of Canada chastising 
the Liberals and chastising the Bloc on this question. In its policy it 
interferes with provincial jurisdiction. Reformers are the ones who 
claim in their bible, in their budget of last year, that not only would 
the air and airports be privatized, not only would the ocean, the 
seaways be privatized, but also roads and bridges. If that is not 
provincial jurisdiction I would like to know what is. That is not 
only an intrusion into provincial affairs but an intrusion into 
Canadians' affairs.
<P>
	Imagine, as they suggest in black and white, having large 
businesses build highways; they would have to be large to build 
roads. Then we would have to pay to drive on those highways. That 
is their policy.
<P>
	The party that says it does not want the Government of Canada 
intruding into provincial jurisdiction is the same party that suggests 
in its policy booklet to cut equalization by 35 per cent. Imagine, 
coming from Atlantic Canada, what kind of intrusion that would be 
to the provincial governments; that 35 per cent cut in the bible of 
the Reform Party of Canada, in its so-called taxpayers budget.
<P>
	Imagine the cut of 34 per cent the Reform Party advocates to the 
Canada assistance plan. Is that not an intrusion into provincial 
jurisdiction? That is the plan the provinces use to pay for their own 
programs, 50:50. The Reform Party of Canada says slash that by 34 
per cent and slash equalization by 35 per cent.
<P>
	That is not all. Look at the intrusion into provincial jurisdiction 
when Reform Party members attack our  medicare system. We 
know what words they use on medicare. The words used in 
reference to Reform Party policy are ``intolerably expensive and 
unnecessary''. Those are the words used in its policy booklet, in its 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1360"> 1360 </A></B>
<P>
so-called taxpayers budget, its bible, not the authorized version but 
the unauthorized version because nobody apart from the Reform 
Party would authorize it.
<P>
	Is it not an intrusion into provincial jurisdiction to be telling the 
provinces that medicare, the very thing we depend on, is 
intolerably expensive and unnecessary? Is that not an intrusion into 
provincial jurisdiction, then to say misrepresentation? That is in its 
policy booklet, the taxpayers budget. I look at it almost every day. I 
have it right here.
<P>
	Reformers say they would have private enterprise build the roads 
and the highways and charge the public for it, build the bridges and 
charge the public for it. Is that not an intrusion? They would cut 
equalization by 35 per cent and CAP by 34 per cent. They say our 
medicare system should be thrown out the window because it is 
intolerably expensive.
<P>
	Then they turn around and do what? What do they approve of? 
What they approve of are all the big tax breaks they can give to the 
biggest corporations operating in the country.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	They jumped up and down with joy when the Senate sent a bill 
here recently which talked about a 50 per cent tax cut for the largest 
foreign controlled multinationals in the country. They jumped for 
joy when there was a 30 per cent tax cut on interest that flows out of 
the country across the border. They said: ``Come on, Senate, give 
us some more because we love this. We loved to do away with the 
royalties on all the taxes that go out of the country''.
<P>
	Here they are cutting things from the provinces, cutting things in 
provincial jurisdictions. Then they stand up in the House of 
Commons and say this bill is really an intrusion into provincial 
government jurisdiction. They should go back to their own 
handbook, to their own policies. They should have a little charity 
when they think about Canadians.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, the 
Reform Party's amendment is surprising. I would have supported it 
if it had preceded any agreement drawn up by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development with respect to a province. This is 
not the case.
<P>
	This bill is an illustration of what ails Canada. Canada suffers 
from the application of more than one strategy to the same people 
and the same areas of the country. There is a human resources 
development strategy, a development strategy period, because 
there can be no  development unless human resources are 
developed. Quebec has one strategy and Canada has another for the 
same group of people, and that does not work. This is no surprise. 
You cannot have two separate strategies involving the same people 
and the same objectives.
<P>
	A business with two different strategies would not last long. A 
public body with two strategies is doomed to failure. A couple 
using two different strategies to raise their children will also run 
into insurmountable problems and is guaranteed to fail. You cannot 
have two different strategies.
<P>
	The bill before us further institutionalizes these two conflicting 
strategies, each with the same objectives for the same people. How 
can we sort out these powers the minister assumes for himself, by 
using an expression that is not defined anywhere, that encompasses 
human resources development? Human resources means people, as 
long as they are considered to be resources, that is as long as they 
contribute to development.
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is giving 
himself jurisdiction over the development of human resources in 
Canada with the objective of enhancing employment, encouraging 
equality and promoting social security.
<P>
	What is left for Quebec? Nothing. The minister is giving himself 
all related powers, the power to develop policies, to make 
regulations, to delegate responsibilities to whomever he wants, and 
to extend his ability to enter into contracts with any organization or 
any financial institution in the pursuit of these objectives.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development becomes the 
minister of total human resources development. He leaves no room 
for anybody else. He is the one who will negotiate. And his main 
instrument of negotiation is the fact that, with the cuts he made in 
the unemployment insurance program, he has accumulated a 
surplus which, by the way, without Bill C-12, will be $10 billion 
next year. However, he has made cuts in education, health and 
welfare programs, which will force the provinces, including 
Quebec, to make drastic cuts this year and next year.
<P>
	It is no surprise that the minister, using his powers, through the 
UI reform project, plans to get involved in providing assistance, 
training grants, what we call active measures, to self-employed 
workers, and do people who have already been on UI for three 
years. This broadens his client base. In five years, let me tell you, 
this will involve a large proportion of people needing UI, and so his 
jurisdiction will keep on spreading out.
<P>
	What is involved here is not a little squabble between levels of 
government but, far more tragically, those governments' inability 
to attain their objectives. That is where the real problem lies. The 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1361"> 1361 </A></B>
<P>
real problem lies  precisely in what action the federal government 
considers it should be taking.
<P>
	The federal government does not trust the provinces. That is 
obvious, and because of that lack of trust, it is trying to take over 
from Quebec. In Quebec, however, the consensus on a large 
number of issues, and the will of the majority on a large number of 
others, is that we are far from trusting the federal government to 
attain our objectives for us.
<P>
	On October 30, as you well know, we came very close, within 
52,000 votes, to attaining Quebec sovereignty. For a large number 
of Quebecers, the reason they wanted sovereignty was the necessity 
to organize ourselves so that, for once, all of these resources 
needing only to be developed, all of these people with needs, will 
have the means of doing so.
<P>
	This bill is, unfortunately, the expression of an inability to 
adequately divide the work up for the well being of the people. The 
federal government decides it is going to do something or have the 
final say and at what cost and in what way. The Government of 
Quebec, with the people behind it, feels that, as a people and a 
nation, it must decide these things and how they are carried out.
<P>
	I would have hoped that, after October 30, the government 
would understand, regardless of what the future brings, that the 
welfare of the ordinary folk and the people as a whole, in Quebec, 
requires that limited resources be put to good use.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	For them to be put to good use, there cannot be two strategies for 
their utilization, because it would mean significant waste, waste in 
terms of public servants. They may have to administer programs 
that run at cross purposes, that go in different directions. They can 
waste an enormous amount of time just getting things co-ordinated, 
instead of having money help people and provide them with clear 
support.
<P>
	I would have hoped this would be possible, regardless of the 
outcome. I would not think that the Government of Canada could 
play with people's welfare in order to give precedence to political 
and constitutional imperatives. Unfortunately, what has happened 
with this bill has shown me that government cynicism is 
widespread and that government decisions come before the welfare 
of the people.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to address Motion No. 3 on Bill C-11. In particular, I 
wish to discuss the Reform Party proposal that would allow the 
provinces to continue to have a say in how things are administered 
at the provincial level when particular policies issue forth from the 
federal government.
<P>
	I also wish to discuss and answer some of the concerns from the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls who made some rather hysterical 
remarks about the Reform Party and what it would propose to do 
should it become government. I feel we must set the record straight 
in addressing Bill C-11.
<P>
	The hon. member and many members from Atlantic Canada are 
frightened after the showing of the Reform Party in the recent 
byelections, and they have good cause to be. They saw a party that 
had little support there in the 1993 election and now all of a sudden 
it is threatening the members across the way in their seats. They 
have good cause to be concerned because the people in Atlantic 
Canada know very well the system has not served them well. They 
are tired of having 20 per cent and 25 per cent unemployment. They 
are tired of not having prosperity. They are tired of not having the 
infrastructure enjoyed by the rest of the country.
<P>
	The member for Gander-Grand Falls stood up and talked about 
how the Reform Party wanted to put tolls on all the roads. That is 
an absolute fairy tale. I think he is getting mixed up with trolls 
under the bridges.
<P>
	What our party has said is that the people in Labrador should 
have a decent road. Instead of sending money to countries around 
the world so that they can build roads, we are saying the people of 
Labrador deserve a decent road between their two biggest centres. 
We are saying that the federal government should not spend money 
on sky boxes in hockey arenas, that it should not be building bocci 
courts for ministers in downtown Toronto. We are saying that when 
we have infrastructure money we should spend it on infrastructure. 
That is not so radical.
<P>
	I want to set the record straight on some of the remarks the 
member for Gander-Grand Falls made with respect to the Reform 
Party approach to reducing spending. The hon. member said we 
would gut health care. Let me remind the House and the hon. 
member that the government is cutting four times as much out of 
health care as our party ever said it would cut. The government is 
cutting $3.2 billion in health care. It is closing hospitals and 
hospital beds across the country today because it did not have the 
nerve to act in its first budget and reduce spending. Had it, we 
would have a much healthier economy today. We would have 
sustainable social programs.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	I also want to address the issue of higher education. Not only 
would the government cut far deeper in health care but far deeper in 
higher education. It would cut six times as much as the Reform 
Party when it comes to higher education, 600 per cent.
<P>
	In our taxpayers budget in 1995 we said we would cut $200 
million. The government is cutting $1.2 billion. That is 
unbelievable. Again it points to the cost of delay. Had it attacked 
the deficit more aggressively, it would not  have to make those cuts 
today. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1362"> 1362 </A></B>
<P>
Now people across the country are paying the price in a very heavy 
way for its delay.
<P>
	I also want to address what the hon. member for Gander-Grand 
Falls has said recently about banks. We had a debate about that this 
morning. He touched on that issue. He talked about the need to hold 
financial institutions accountable.
<P>
	Why did he not mention that he has sat idly by while his party 
took $250,000 from the banks? Why did he sit idly by when that 
was being done? I do not recall his speaking out against his own 
party's taking all that money. Where is his sanctimonious attitude 
when that happens? I did not see it.
<P>
	I did not see him standing up and speaking against the Reform 
Party motion the other day when we proposed to set things right in 
Labrador, when our party moved a motion to revisit the agreement 
on Churchill Falls so that the people of Labrador could enjoy some 
of the fruits of their own labour as opposed to sending it into 
Quebec.
<P>
	I did not hear the member for Gander-Grand Falls then. Where 
was he? Why was he not standing up for the people of 
Newfoundland and Labrador? He claims to be somebody who 
defends his province. Where was he? He was absent. He had 
absolutely nothing to say.
<P>
	On the issue of defending the provinces, the member has nothing 
to boast about. He has let his people down. That was reflected in 
Labrador the other day. It was also reflected in Humber. We are 
starting to see some hon. members opposite panic about the next 
election.
<P>
	Frankly, it looks good on them. It is time people in Atlantic 
Canada were served well. That is not happening today. To the hon. 
member opposite, stand up and be counted the next time. When 
people come to the defence of his own province, next time vote 
with Reform.

<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 5</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-11 be amended by adding after line 29, on page 10, the following 
new Clause:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``32.1 The Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of Parliament, 
not later than the fifth sitting day of that House after January 31 next following 
the end of each fiscal year, a report showing the operations of the Department of 
Human Resources Development for that fiscal year.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Madam Speaker, this amendment would require the 
Minister of Human Resources Development to table an annual 
report in the House.
<P>
	Bill C-11 as s presented does not require an annual report to be 
made from the department. I am concerned that this may be just 
another way for the government to withhold information from the 
House of Commons and the people of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	I believe it should be mandatory for all government departments 
to publish annual reports, and for the purpose of accountability 
they should be placed before Parliament.
<P>
	As part of the new program review the federal government is 
changing the production of the estimates. It suggests that in a few 
years it will make the estimates more user friendly and that more 
useful and practical information will be included in the estimates. 
The government suggests that annual reports are so general that 
they border on being useless.
<P>
	Every bill which has been introduced to create a new department 
has been deleted. The government has deleted the requirement for 
the production of departmental annual reports. Our amendment 
would require the government to continue producing annual reports 
for that department.
<P>
	We are sceptical of the process for improving the estimates. At 
minimum, until such improvements have been made, annual 
reports should be continued. Until the estimates are improved, the 
lack of annual reports will cause the Canadian public to be in a 
position to receive less information from government.
<P>
	We all know about the red book promises which said there would 
be more open government. This is open government? No more 
annual reports is open government? I do not think so.
<P>
	Reform exists to change the government. Liberals have an 
opportunity to demonstrate to Canadians they are willing to open 
up government to allow Canadians greater access to all information 
about how it operates. It  should not be a secret. What is the 
government trying to hide?
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1363"> 1363 </A></B>
<P>
	It is taxpayer money that the Liberals are spending. Canadians 
should know how and where their money is going. The 
government, by opposing our amendment, will prove to Canadians 
that it does not care about accountability or openness. What is it 
trying to hide? Again there seems to be something fishy here.
<P>
	Is this just another way for the Liberals to hide their dismal 
failure on the deficit fight? They will not make public or even 
produce an annual report for this department.
<P>
	This department is huge. Canadians, thanks to the Liberals, will 
not be able to keep track of the developments. Sure, the 
government says the estimates will be improved, but it said it 
would scrap the GST, so why should we believe it now?
<P>
	Is this a case of what we do not know will not hurt us? Maybe 
that is why the government did not mention the debt in the budget 
speech. Ignore it and it will go away. The Liberals should talk about 
it. They should admit that they have been responsible for the 
growth in the debt since 1968 and honestly attack the debt problem. 
We are seeing nothing.
<P>
	I insist we need an annual account of this department. I believe 
with the inclusion of the amendments the Reform Party suggested 
Bill C-11 will be a much better bill. The amendments will make the 
department more forward in its approach to problems and more 
accountable to Parliament.

	<B>Mrs. Rose-Marie Ur (Lambton-Middlesex, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, excellence in the areas of science, technology and 
mathematics is essential to building and sustaining a more 
innovative Canadian economy. Canada's future depends on our 
ability to show innovative technology leadership.
<P>
	Both the speech from the throne and the March 6 budget 
highlighted the importance of establishing guiding principles to 
improve the effectiveness and focus of the federal science and 
technology effort.
<P>
	I believe Canada will guarantee its success in these areas if we 
ensure that our children are taught the skills they will need to meet 
the challenges.
<P>
	Last month the Prime Minister announced the winners of the 
1995 Prime Minister's Awards for Teaching Excellence in Science, 
Technology and Mathematics. The awards recognize elementary 
and secondary school  teachers who have had a major impact on 
their students in these areas.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in automating B.C. light stations the Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans is reducing marine safety on the west coast.
<P>
<B>(1400 )</B>
<P>
	The B.C. coastline has long deep fiords, turbulent, dangerous 
waters and extensive uninhabited areas. It is unique and studies of 
other coastlines do not necessarily apply to B.C.
<P>
	A constant flow of cruise ships, freighters, ferries, commercial 
and sports fishermen, tourists and pleasure boats passes through the 
inside passage between west coast islands and mainland B.C. More 
than 15,000 tankers passed through B.C. waters in 1995.
<P>
	Human staff provide accurate and timely marine aviation 
weather reports and can observe coastal activity, while automated 
stations can only transmit a mechanically derived narrower range 
of data. Should the system malfunction or fail, which has already 
happened, we court loss of life and/or ecological disasters.
<P>
	Spending reductions are important but unjustified when they 
come at the expense of available safety measures on our 
waterways. In time of danger there is no substitute for a human 
operated lighthouse.

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today in my 
riding of Rosedale in Toronto, Ryerson Polytechnic University is 
celebrating the completion of an infrastructure project which will 
create 47 person years of employment.
<P>
	Ryerson is a special institution of learning which offers a unique 
educational experience to its students. It is a tremendous asset to 
the city of Toronto and to the country at large.
<P>
	The ceremony taking place today also illustrates how the 
infrastructure program initiated by the government has enabled a 
wide range of institutions to create or upgrade needed facilities. 
The program which has been criticized by some for being a bricks 
and mortar program has proven to be much more than that. This 
particular example shows how the program contributes in a 
meaningful way to the education of the citizens of this country. The

successful completion of this important program.

	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Canadian 
Heritage announced, together with heads of Canadian broadcasting 
corporations, the launch of a national campaign against violence 
under the theme ``Violence, You Can Make a Difference''.
<P>
	This campaign will last throughout the year and emphasize 
violence against women and children. This multimedia project is 
aimed at making people aware of the impact of violence on 
viewers, and of the means available to us to put an end to it.
<P>
	This project was made possible thanks to the cooperation of a 
number of federal departments, radio and television networks, 
community organisations, and Cossette 
Communication-Marketing. We are pleased to be part of this 
important initiative, and we urge people to join us in this vast 
operation to stamp out violence.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, recently the group Pastors for Peace attempted to 
transport humanitarian aid, namely medical supplies, computers 
and modems from Canada to Cuba via the United States. The 
computers were for a humanitarian Cuban medical project, 
INFOMED.
<P>
	Last month these goods were seized by U.S. law enforcement 
personnel using totally unacceptable force under a U.S. law 
banning trading with the enemy. Five members of Pastors for Peace 
have been fasting for life since February 21, including Canadian 
Brian Rohatyn to protest this outrageous U.S. thuggery.
<P>
	I call on our foreign minister to end his silence and demand the 
release of these Canadian donated medical supplies, to strongly 
condemn the illegal and immoral U.S. blockade of Cuba and the 
illegal Helms-Burton Bill.
<P>
	The people of Canada must stand in solidarity with the people of 
Cuba at this very difficult time.

Speaker, the transport minister stated in this House that the 
problems of Montreal airports were not his concern since their 
management had been transferred to ADM. This is an easy answer 
to avoid getting involved.
<P>
	The minister is abdicating his political responsibilities, hiding 
behind a management agreement he himself negotiated. However, 
the difficulties faced by Montreal airports are, to a large extent, due 
to the bad decisions Ottawa has been making on this issue since the 
1970s.
<P>
	In Canada, air transportation comes under federal jurisdiction. 
Consequently, it is this the government which negotiated and 
signed the present lease with ADM, thereby giving it certain 
responsibilities. The government must ask ADM to hold real 
consultations before making any decision.

citizen was to conclude this case on behalf of her late husband, the 
justice minister threw a cloak of immunity over John Desotti. This 
newly appointed judge was removed from the jurisdiction of the 
law society and moved beyond the reach of the Robert family.
<P>
	What did the justice minister have to say about this 
reprehensible abuse of his power? ``If Mrs. Robert doesn't like it, 
take Desotti to court'', was his reply. It is time the Prime Minister 
stepped in and set things right for the Robert family and dealt with

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when we questioned the government on May 12, 1995, on 
the events in Somalia, the Minister of Defence stated as follows: 
``This government wants to make sure that all of the troubling 
accusations surrounding the Canadian forces deployment to 
Somalia are brought to light. This government has nothing to hide. 
This government wants the truth''. Now, less than a year later, the 
information commissioner informs us that certain military officers 
deliberately falsified or eliminated information concerning this 
affair.
<P>
	My question, a very simple one, is directed to the Minister of 
National Defence. What we want to know is: Who are the DND 
personnel who falsified documents, what are their ranks, under 
whose orders were they operating, and what sanctions were 
imposed for these actions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I said 
yesterday, the facts in Mr. Grace's letter parallel the facts that have 
been raised by a military police investigation. Certainly we view 
these allegations with severity.
<P>
	In fact it was the departmental officials, the deputy minister and 
the former chief of defence staff who alerted Mr. Grace, the 
information commissioner, to this problem. It was the department 
that did it once it found out about these irregularities.
<P>
	We are certainly concerned with what he has found out in his 
letter, but given the fact there is a military police investigation with 
all it entails, and given that the facts in the military police 
investigation are consistent with those outlined in Mr. Grace's 
letter, it would be very wrong for me, in case I were to prejudice the 
jurisdiction  and the legal proceedings of any individuals, to answer 
the hon. member's question as he has posed it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, it is always like pulling teeth to get information in this 
Parliament on anything involving the armed forces. We would 
really like to see evidence from the government, once in a while, 
that it is in charge.
<P>
	Now that we know documents have been falsified by Canadian 
army personnel to cover up the truth, what credibility can we give 
to the 450,000 pages of documents DND provided to the Somalia 
commission? What credibility indeed?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can give you 
and members of the House the assurance that the Department of 
National Defence has and will do everything in its power to make 
sure that every single document relevant to the inquiry is handed 
over to the inquiry.
<P>
	There is a bit of an information overflow because there are tens 
of thousands of pages of such documents. It has caused difficulty 
for the department in collating them and getting them to the 
commission. It has caused difficulty for the commission, but we 
are working with the commission to surmount these obstacles.
<P>
	The hon. member has talked about not getting information out of 
the department of defence and being dissatisfied with my previous 
answer. This government is concerned with the fundamental 
principles of justice and we have to be concerned that none of those 
principles of justice are transgressed with respect to any 
individuals who may be involved in this matter.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Leader of the Opposition, BQ): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I understand the government is concerned, but so are we 
all when the government's concerns have no effect on what is going 
on in the armed forces. The minister ought to be aware of that.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	We want to know, because it is the public which pays for the 
Canadian Armed Forces, whether extremely reprehensible actions 
have taken place, as this is a very serious matter.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister not realize that there is a problem of 
credibility, the credibility of his government even, when the 
Minister of Defence refuses systematically to reveal any 
information whatsoever concerning events of this gravity, 
particularly when one considers that absolutely every time we have 
raised any question here in the House concerning DND we have 
just about had to hold a parliamentary inquiry to get things 
moving? The  minister is always talking about his serious concerns, 
but never does 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1368"> 1368 </A></B>
<P>
anything concrete about those concerns. There are never any real 
steps taken to remedy matters.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if we are talking 
about credibility, let us put the facts on the table.
<P>
	It was the minister of fisheries in April 1993, when the Liberal 
Party was in opposition, who called for an inquiry into the whole 
question of the deployment to Somalia. This government delivered 
on that particular promise once it came into office and once we 
were assured that any commission would not interfere with the 
judicial process that we inherited and that was under way with the 
courts martial.
<P>
	On the incident that has recently come to light, how can the hon. 
member talk about the credibility of the government when it was 
the officials in the government, the deputy minister and the chief of 
the defence staff, who drew these very troubling matters to the 
attention of the information commissioner? There was an internal 
investigation by the military police.
<P>
	If that is not good enough for the hon. member, there has been an 
investigation by a third party, the information commissioner. He 
has rendered his judgment. It was made public yesterday and action 
will be taken. Those matters in his report parallel the facts in the 
military police report. The military police report is with the 
department's lawyers. That is all I can say on the matter at this 
point so as not to injure anyone who may be involved.

	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
August 1994, the federal government announced with great pomp 
that it would ask 26 federal departments and agencies to implement 
action plans to meet the needs of francophones outside Quebec. 
However, the  Commissioner of Official Languages himself said 
that this initiative was a failure.
<P>
	My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Minister 
of Canadian Heritage finally realize that, by not fulfilling her 
obligations under the Official Languages Act, she is condoning the 
assimilation of French speaking people, to the tune of 38 per cent in 
Ontario and 75 per cent in British Columbia?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the best protection 
against assimilation is to have a country which is called Canada 
and which protects minority rights from coast to coast.
<P>
<B>(1430)</B>
<P>
	This morning, here in Ottawa, the Franco-Ontarian theatre was 
inaugurated to allow us to see French plays. Also, in the context of 
41-42, I have already contacted the new President of the Treasury 
Board, to make sure that the level of recognition, as mentioned by 
Mr. Goldbloom, which was already at 80 per cent will go up to 100 
per cent. This is the objective of 41-42.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Canada is the one responsible for the current assimilation rate. 
Instead of crowing over makeshift measures, will the heritage 
minister follow up on the most recent report of the official 
languages commissioner, who states that, since the implementation 
of the government initiative, French speaking people have lost 
services instead of gaining new ones?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first, I already met with 
the official languages commissioner. The truth is-and I know it 
hurts the Bloc Quebecois-that there are currently more young 
Canadians who speak both languages than at any other time in our 
history.
<P>
	Will you recognize the work done by the hon. member for 
Ottawa-Vanier? Will you recognize the work done by the hon. 
member for Madawaska-Victoria? Will you recognize the work 
done by the hon. member for Timiskaming-French River? Will 
you recognize that, in this House, there are 16 French speaking 
members from outside Quebec who proudly represent their 
constituents in their language? French is spoken everywhere in 
Canada.

reputation of our military and step down so that new leadership can 
set things right?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and

Minister answered that question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Solberg:</B> I would not be that cocky if I were you, Dave.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as a former member of the armed forces I know the importance of 
leadership. I know the importance of morale and I know that 
morale has been crushed this past year by a lack of leadership. Still, 
most of our troops are dedicated professionals as evidenced by the 
courageous work of those who realized that what they were being 
told to do was wrong, and at great personal risk, did the right thing.
<P>
	Will the minister also do the right thing? Will he show true 
leadership by example, accept responsibility for what has gone 
wrong on his watch and resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not want to 
repeat the same answer.
<P>
	The hon. member talks about taking politics out of the issue. I 
think that is very good advice. I ask that the Reform Party do it. 
This has nothing to do with the men and women who are serving in 
Bosnia or in Haiti.
<P>
	This has to do with a very difficult problem that occurred before 
the government was elected. It has been a very difficult problem to 
handle, to make sure that we are fair to the institution and to the 
principles of basic justice.
<P>
	I am as concerned as the members on that side about recent 
events, especially in the facts outlined in Mr. Grace's letter. If the 
hon. member were to read Mr. Grace's letter he would see that in 
this case the department has acted extremely responsibly by getting 
outside opinions, by having an outside investigation as well as a 
military police investigation. If there is wrongdoing, it will be dealt 
with in the appropriate way.
<P>
	As a former member of the military, the hon. member should 
know about the military justice system and respect it because he 
supported it for years while he was a member of the armed forces.

assure us that it will recognize neighbouring rights in a real and

a reaction from the hon. member across the way, who should

<P>
	In any event, no matter how the hon. member tries to squirm out

getting close to finding a smoking gun, suddenly he was ordered by

<P>
	Yesterday, acting in good faith, the Minister of Industry stated 
that the order on foreign ownership in telecommunications and 
broadcasting companies had been passed. This is not the case.
<P>
	Four months ago now, the government announced in an official

has not yet adopted that order in council?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Nic Leblanc (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, is the minister 
aware that her longstanding inaction has created injustices within 
the telecommunications industry, placing it at an advantage over 
the broadcasters?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

<P>
	I trust that the hon. member does not wish to endanger Canadian 
culture with a policy which could indeed place the 
telecommunications and broadcasting industries in a situation 
which would place Canadian content at risk. I hope that does not

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
let us re-examine the situation regarding the Minister of National 
Defence and this whole incident about destroying documents. Look 
at the timing.
<P>
	This cover-up first came to light in October 1995. At that time 
the minister said to the House: ``As soon as we get to know why 
this happened, we will certainly make it public''. We had all that 
time. The minister has not made it public. We have to learn the 
details of this whole thing from an outside agency and still do not 
know what the minister has done to punish the offenders and 
correct the problem.
<P>
	Instead he is once again burying his failures under a cloak of 
closed door administrative action. Documents are destroyed and 
altered and the minister continues to cover up.
<P>
	Will he take the responsibility required here and resign in order 
to restore public confidence?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, first it is the 
Leader of the Reform Party talking about routing out those who 
have created the problem and the infractions as if he knows more 
than the information commissioner, that he has evidence and 
knows the facts better than the information commissioner.
<P>
	Now it is the hon. member saying that in Reform's eyes, because 
I said in the House that we would get to the bottom of the matter, it 
has to be done the next day.
<P>
	What we are seeing here is Reform justice, which is make the 
charge, do not get the facts and come to the conclusions.
<P>
<B>(1445 )</B>
<P>
	The department, the CDS, the deputy minister and I behaved in 
the responsible way. When we needed outside help, I said on the 
floor of the House of Commons that if we were not satisfied with 
internal review mechanisms we would go to an outside agency.
<P>
	We took this to Mr. Grace. He initiated the investigation. He has 
now made it public. Let the course of justice, which has been called 
for by Mr. Grace and the military police report, take effect.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
was not the Department of National Defence nor the minister who 
went outside for this information. It was Mr. McAuliffe of the 
CBC. This is pretty important stuff. What the information 
commissioner wrote yesterday about the destruction and alteration 
of  documents in national defence strikes to the heart of our system 
not just in national defence but in government.
<P>
	The Somalia commissioners must be able to trust the documents 
they receive from the Department of National Defence. The media 
relies on access to information to do its job, as do members of 
Parliament and Canadians across the country.
<P>
	The minister's mismanagement of his department has placed this 
whole trust in jeopardy. He is responsible for his officials. He has 
had clear warning of the problems. Will he resign?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David M. Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not intend 
to respond to that particular tirade except to say unequivocally, and 
I can document this and I will put these documents on the table of 
the House, that it was the deputy minister of defence who alerted 
the information commissioner to these problems and therefore the 
investigation ensued as a result of the department's initiative, not 
as a result of the initiative of that person, the person who required 
the information under access to information law.

choices. One of the things I find most disconcerting about the

that will cost billions of dollars. Ontario and B.C alone would be 
$3.2 billion. That is how much the government is cutting out of 
health care.
<P>
	Is the finance minister saying he is willing to spend $3.2 billion 
so that he can save the Deputy Prime Minister and at the same time 
cut the same amount of money out of health care? Is that what he is 
saying?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
there is indeed a very important debate to have in the House as one 
proceeds on profound structural change. In the case of the GST, the

engaged in structural change in other areas. There will be 
adjustment policies that may well be necessary to pay

bring over $100 million and 4,000 person years in contracts to

position of the Reform Party is to privatize the CBC, not to get rid 
of it. We want to maintain a viable commercial operation.
<P>
	The minister seems to be acting a little like a shopaholic in her 
overall portfolio. She has found $6 million for a fly a flag program 
her deputies do not know where from, $150,000 for lacrosse, but 
the most instructive one is what she did with respect to 
Radio-Canada International. Of the $16 million she found for 
Radio-Canada International, she picked the pocket of the CBC by 
$8 million. She removed $8 million from the CBC.
<P>
	She has no plan. Will she admit she has no plan to save the CBC?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I suppose I should not be 
surprised at being accused of being a shopaholic, which of course is 
a term that one would only offer to a woman, by the member who 
only this morning attended a program by the Canadian Association 
of Broadcasters to stamp out stereotyping.
<P>
<B>(1500 )</B>
<P>
	The CBC's board of directors was not only happy, it was excited 
about the possibility of investing again in Radio Canada 
International, because like the Government of Canada, it believes 
that it will be an important and a crucial voice for Canada into the 
21st century.

	<B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby-Kingsway, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister for International 
Trade.
<P>
	The United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, has 
issued a very dangerous interpretation of annex 2 of NAFTA's 
impact on Canadians not for profit health providers.
<P>
	In light of the fact that Kantor's position would throw open our 
medicare system to U.S. corporate health care giants, I want to ask 
the Minister for International Trade, if he will now join with B.C. 
health minister Andrew Petter and other provinces in clearly 
repudiating this U.S. position? Will he stand up for Canada's 
medicare system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister for International Trade, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, indeed we have stood up for Canada's health 
care system. In annex 2 of the NAFTA agreement we have said that 
this health care system is protected.
<P>
	We have looked at it carefully with our legal advisors and we 
believe that all the protection necessary exists.
<P>
	However, if the provinces have specific programs they wish to 
give additional protection, these can be listed in annex l by the end 
of this month. They have every opportunity to do that.
<P>
	We feel that the health care system should be and will be 
protected.

	<B>Mr. John Finlay (Oxford, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, two recent

the fore the problem of Arctic pollution and the need to promote 
sustainable development in the Arctic region.
<P>
	Can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of the 
Environment explain what the minister will do to make sure these 
conferences achieve results?

to have the answer.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Kraft Sloan:</B> I just happen to have the answer. You bet I 
do.
<P>
	As members of the House should be aware, the Arctic ecosystem 
is very fragile. It is beset by toxic pollutants from within the Arctic 
region and countries of the south.
<P>
	The member and I both participated at the Yellowknife 
Conference for Arctic Parliamentarians and later that week the 
Minister of the Environment and the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development participated at the Conference for Arctic 
Ministers in Inuvik.
<P>
	I am very pleased to say that as a result of these two conferences, 
the Minister of the Environment has made an announcement about 
the establishment of an Arctic council that will occur this summer. 
This council will address the problems faced by circumpolar 
nations in the Arctic.
<P>
	As Canadians we should be very proud of this international 
co-operative effort.

	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
has obviously occurred to a number of us during the course of 
debate when tempers fray or when emotions get away with us that 
we say certain things which are not true or which we regret. It has 
certainly happened to me.
<P>
	Under those circumstances, when the error of the statement is 
pointed out, it is normal that one would stand and withdraw it. I 
would ask that the member for Medicine Hat to withdraw the 
statement he made in the preamble to his question. I can tell him 
that the statement is not true, is inaccurate and has no foundation in 
fact. I ask the hon. member to withdraw the statement.
<P>
<B>(1505 )</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member is in the House now. If he would 
like to take the request of the Minister of Finance under 
advisement, I would give him the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this is 
not a question of privilege. I would like to point out also that there 
were many promises made on the GST. On behalf of the Canadian 
people I would like to raise that as a question of privilege.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It is true, as the hon. minister pointed out, that in 
the course of debate sometimes we make statements we believe to 
be accurate that are not totally accurate.
<P>
	Situations such as this have occurred on a number of occasions. 
With regard to the minister rising on a question of privilege, I 
would say that this is a point of debate surely. The minister is on the 
record as clarifying this statement from his perspective.

	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am listening to the point of order by the hon. 
House leader. He is raising a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, the words complained of by the 
Minister of Finance are clearly unparliamentary and are words that 
should, therefore, be withdrawn.
<P>
	I cite in that regard in support of what I said, citation 484 of 
Beauchesne:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) In the House of Commons a Member will not be permitted by the Speaker 
to indulge in any reflections on the House itself as a political institution; or-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I draw your attention to this, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-to impute to any Member or Members unworthy motives for their actions in a 
particular case;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	I submit that this is clearly what the member for Medicine Hat 
did in a most improper and unacceptable manner.
<P>
	I further point out that our rules clearly say that when a member 
of the House states something within his own knowledge as being 
true or untrue, then that member's word must be accepted. The hon. 
Minister of Finance made a statement of matters within his own 
knowledge which, I submit, has to be accepted not just by this 
House but, in particular, by the hon. member for Medicine Hat.
<P>
	On the clear precedent established in this Chamber over the 
years, the hon. member for Medicine Hat has used language which 
is clearly unparliamentary and which, therefore, must be 
withdrawn by him. Otherwise, he should suffer the appropriate 
sanction imposed by you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of 
order, you have ruled on this matter. You have ruled on the House 
leader.
<P>
<B>(1510)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Please take your seats. On the same point of order, 
the hon. member for Lethbridge.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order on what is happening here. I would refer to page 6 of 
Beauchesne in terms of Speakers' rulings.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, you made a ruling that there was not a point of 
privilege. You then followed that by saying the matter was one of 
debate and that is where you left it.
<P>
	The House leader for the Liberal Party has stood in his place and 
challenged the Speaker on a ruling. According to Beauchesne, it is 
very clear, Mr. Speaker, that you are the authority. You are the 
person elected by the House and once a decision has been made that 
is the decision of the House.
<P>
	If the House leader for the Liberal Party wishes to challenge your 
authority, then he had better do it on that basis and under no other 
guise.
<P>
	The decision has been made and it should stand as is.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I believe that when you render your decision on this issue 
there are three points to consider in the matter of the point of order.
<P>
	As the hon. House leader has indicated, unparliamentary 
language is a point of order. I could have argued as well that in the 
case of the hon. member it constituted a point of privilege, but that 
has been ruled on. But that does not negate the fact that there is an 
outstanding point of order.
<P>
	First, it was brought to the attention of the House by the House 
leader the issue of causing disorder by using unparliamentary 
language; second, that imputing motive is not correct in any 
circumstance and; third, an allegation was made whereby the hon. 
minister was accused of committing something which certainly 
could be said to have been, at its worst, a criminal act of not paying 
the taxes of this country.
<P>
	The combination of all of these things is unacceptable for the 
Parliament of a modern democracy. I ask Mr. Speaker to rule that 
this is unparliamentary language under any definition we have and 
all of the instances that we have had before.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker has ruled in the past that making fun of another 
member's use of words in the House has been a point of order and 
has had to be withdrawn. Alleging that another member of 
Parliament in the past, for instance,  had made untrue statements 
has been 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1377"> 1377 </A></B>
<P>
asked to be withdrawn. Inflammatory language has been asked to 
be withdrawn. Finally, even members who have seen fit to mimic 
the voice intonation of others have been asked to be withdrawn.
<P>
	If all of these things are out of order, surely making that kind of 
an accusation against the Minister of Finance of this country should 
be withdrawn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gray:</B> Mr. Speaker, I just want to-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Sit down.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am going to listen to members on this point of 
order. I am going to now turn to the hon. member for Medicine Hat 
on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, on a 
point of order, I would like to bring this whole issue to an end, if we 
could.
<P>
	I would like to, if I could for a moment, quote from documents 
that I believe to be true that will give the Chair some understanding 
of why I used the statements I used when question period was under 
way. If I might do that, perhaps it will then bring some 
understanding to members across the way who object to the 
language that I used.
<P>
<B>(1515)</B>
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I think we are getting more and more into 
debating the whole issue rather than sticking to the point of order.
<P>
	We are in a rather ticklish situation, especially for your Speaker. 
I have ruled that what the hon. Minister of Finance brought up in 
the House is not a point of privilege and I want to put that to one 
side.
<P>
	I have in front of me now a point of order on what is claimed to 
be unparliamentary language of one member to another. I have 
citations from both sides seemingly to support a particular 
argument.
<P>
	I think it is regrettable, my colleagues, that in the course of the 
question period we deviate and we go from the administrative 
responsibilities of members to delving into areas which are not 
exclusively in that area. I have asked the House on a number of 
occasions, both the questioners and the people who are answering 
the questions, to try to contain their answers so that there is no 
overflow into matters which are more personal in nature.
<P>
	I think, at least up to this point, if you would give your Speaker 
time, I will go back and review not only <I>Hansard</I>, but I will look at 
it for myself on television. If, as it is claimed but which I did not 
feel at the time, unparliamentary language was used, if indeed it 
was used, I ask the House to permit me to at least look at the 
evidence, to ponder it for a little while and if it is necessary I will 
come back to the House.
<P>
	Therefore, on this particular point of order, unless there is more 
information that you would like to offer for me to consider, I would 
prefer to take the matter under advisement, reread <I>Hansard</I>, look at 
the tapes and if it is necessary I will get back to the House. Is that 
agreeable to the House?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wonder if the hon. member would be kind 
enough, if there is information he wants me to have, surely he 
could inform me privately and I will consider that.
<P>
	I have another point of order on an entirely different matter from 
the hon. member for Kootenay East.

	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a

Prime Minister today, she accused me of sexism. I think it is highly 
unfortunate that on a day like today when the Canadian Association 
of Broadcasters is coming forward with their violence program that 
she would do that. She clearly does not understand that shopaholics 
can also be men.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, often in 
these points of debate, privilege and order there are a number of 
shots that are sent back and forth across the House. Unfortunately I 
heard the member for Okanagan-Shuswap refer to our chief 
government whip as a jackass.
<P>
<B>(1520)</B>
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> I do not think that is appropriate.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I think we are going back and forth. 
Your Speaker cannot possibly hear everything that is said during 
the course of question period or during the course of debate.
<P>
	I implore you, if words such as the one that was mentioned by 
the member for Burlington were used, they were surely used out of 
earshot of your Speaker. Again, I would implore you, do not use 
that kind of language with one another. All it does is inflame 
members on both sides.
<P>
	The point has been made by the member for Burlington. I did not 
hear the comment. I think we are going to go back and forth today 
with accusations and counter-accusations which I do not think will 
be very profitable for any of us.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Torsney:</B> Mr. Speaker, in the last campaign a lot was made 
about the decorum in this House by the third party. I think it is 
telling that the response of the  members opposite when I raised the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1378"> 1378 </A></B>
<P>
point of order with you acknowledges that they knew the member 
used that word and they continued to use it and that terminology.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Colleagues, I would again urge you not to use any 
language like that, if indeed it was used. It would be 
unparliamentary and we could not condone that in this House.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFHUMANRESOURCESDEVELOPMENTACT">DEPARTMENT OF HUMAN RESOURCES 
DEVELOPMENT ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-11, an act to 
establish the Department of Human Resources Development and to 
repeal certain related acts, as reported (with amendment) from the 
committee; and of Motion No. 5.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are in 
the process of debating an amendment by the Reform Party which 
is Motion No. 5 under the third group. What the member is asking 
in this motion is that we go back to the old process of the issue of 
annual reports to the House.
<P>
	I would like to suggest to the House that the proposal put 
forward by the Reformers is somewhat bizarre in that they located 
this particular amendment in part II of the bill. Part II of the bill 
refers to the Canada Employment Insurance Commission. I am not 
quite sure of the rationale of why it is in part II. Nonetheless, we 
find it a little strange.
<P>
	Members will be aware that annual reports are generally being 
eliminated due to the fact that the information is contained in part 
III of the estimates. Members will also be aware that one of the 
most important parts of this whole reform we are dealing with as it 
relates to part III of the estimates is that in most cases by the time 
we get the annual report it is outdated and not applicable to what 
we are doing in this place.
<P>
	The member for Mission-Coquitlam mentioned the reason for 
putting this in place. However, as opposition members they think 
there is a Russian spy under every rock, that the Government of 
Canada cannot be trusted and that it will renege on its promise to 
improve the estimates. They feel they have to protect themselves 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1379"> 1379 </A></B>
<P>
by  having annual reports which nobody reads and which are so 
outdated that it is a waste of money for the Government of Canada.
<P>
	Again that is another motion Reform has put forward. On the one 
hand the members of the Reform talk about trying to save money 
and then they present a motion that will cost us money. We can do it 
better by revising the process to better reflect the needs of 
parliamentarians and by making part III of the estimates more 
applicable.
<P>
	I want to end my remarks by saying what I have said about some 
of the other more unique proposals of the Reform Party. This 
government has very little choice but to reject this proposal which 
only serves to duplicate information readily available from other 
sources. Just how much information do these folks need? Either 
they can read or they cannot. We cannot just continue to give them 
document after document and they still say that somehow all these 
Russian moles are running around spying on us and the Liberals are 
part of the problem.
<P>
	I would suggest to the Reform members not to be so paranoid. I 
can say from experience that most people in the House are here for 
good, solid reasons. They care about the country and they want to 
keep the country together. There really is no conspiracy theory 
necessary. The sooner they get used to the fact that we are all very 
interested in helping the country, the less nonsense we will have 
with motions like this one.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to debate this 
amendment.
<P>
	First, we can ask ourselves why the Reform Party felt the need to 
move this kind of an amendment. There is a very good reason for 
that.
<P>
<B>(1530)</B>
<P>
	The fact is that, as plentiful as the information available from 
Human Resources Development Canada may be, it is not very 
clear. More often than not, you get a pile of information, but the 
way this information is presented or interpreted, you cannot make 
much sense of it. And if ever there was an area in which things have 
to be set out clearly, this is it.
<P>
	Take for example the statements made by the minister yesterday 
about those who misuse the UI system, in which he puts in the same 
basket abusers and people who simply misunderstood a rule. I 
doubt that any one of us understands every single rule set in the UI 
Act. At present, the available information can be used to 
substantiate just about any statement on the subject.
<P>
	That is why it is important that clearer information be provided, 
so that our decisions can be based on facts and actual results, 
instead of using information to support individual perceptions, 
which may or may not be accurate.
<P>
	It may be important to be able to look at a piece of legislation 
like the UI Act and ask ourselves: ``In this whole thing, what have 
we done about money, about labour force participation? How 
efficient have these measures been and what positive results did 
they have?'' It is especially important to answer these questions as 
early as possible in the process, because this factual information is 
needed not only to report on how things went, but also to make 
appropriate changes to our approaches and attitudes and to develop 
more pro-active policies.
<P>
	In our present economic context, there are many indications of 
the fact that economic growth does result, as would be expected, in 
job creation. In order for the government to adjust quickly and for 
Parliament to be able to make interesting suggestions in this 
regard, information must be made available as soon as possible. 
With the electronic tools that are available today, it should be 
possible to produce information more quickly.
<P>
	There is more. The system used by Human Resources 
Development Canada is very complicated. It is very difficult and 
hard to evaluate actual effectiveness. It goes without saying that 
this is partly due to the fact that the federal government gets 
involved in all sorts of areas which do not directly come under its 
jurisdiction and that a lot of money is paid in transfer payments to 
other levels of government. In the end, the public has a hard time 
assessing the situation. This is currently the case with all the 
information and perceptions that shape public opinion regarding 
unemployment insurance reform.
<P>
	Those who are currently experiencing the reality of 
unemployment insurance, who are unemployed, who found out 
that, this year, they will not have the required number of weeks to 
complete the cycle and have a decent income throughout the year 
know very well what it means, because their income, the money 
they require for their daily needs, is affected.
<P>
	On the other hand, people can say from these figures, as the 
minister did yesterday, that there are over 100,000 cheaters taking 
advantage of the UI program. Who does that group include? Who 
are these people? What proportion is made up of people who acted 
in good faith? It would be interesting to know if these people are 
real cheaters or if they are simply guilty of misinterpretation.
<P>
	Let me give you an example. Last year, the issue of insurability 
was raised. As you know, people who have a business or a company 
are insurable under certain conditions, if the employee is not too 
closely involved in the decisions of the company, etc.
<P>
	For one year now, we have been asking what the government's 
position is on this issue. Is the government doing something about 
this issue? Will it correct some situations? We were told: ``Indeed, 
there is a problem; there is a backlog''. However, we can never get 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1380"> 1380 </A></B>
<P>
accurate data on it. This is the type of information we should have  
in a report, so that the problem can be solved once and for all.
<P>
	This issue is not one of a political nature; it has nothing to do 
with partisanship or political ideology. It is merely a matter of 
looking into something that does not work from an administrative 
point of view and finding a solution. The way to do that is to have 
the necessary information.
<P>
	When you know that there is a backlog of hundreds of cases in a 
region, in the offices of Revenue Canada, and that these cases could 
be dealt with, through a decentralizing process, in the offices of the 
Department of Human Resources Development, when you have the 
figures and the reports, then it simply becomes a matter of having 
the political courage to apply the necessary solutions and to make 
the required changes.
<P>
<B>(1535)</B>
<P>
	In this respect, the amendment proposed by the Reform Party at 
least expresses the frustration of having to deal with a huge 
bureaucracy full of information but which is very sparing with this 
information.
<P>
	Let us take another example. We are now considering a number 
of very minor amendments that will not change much to the 
unfairness of UI reform, but we are unable to find out from the 
department what the economic impact of these amendments would 
be. This kind of long-delayed information leaves room for a lot of 
useless interpretation.
<P>
	It can be said that this amendment is legitimate, that we should 
be given the information needed so that people can find out without 
delay how effective a department is, so that parliamentarians and 
members of the human resources committee can respond as quickly 
as possible.
<P>
	Let us look at the impact of deadlines. If the report is tabled early 
enough, we can interpret the results, see right away the impact on 
the next budget year and make the required corrections. If the 
information comes a year late every time, by the time we try to 
address it, the problem is already elsewhere. So there is something 
to be done in this respect.
<P>
	Also, the federal government should tell us clearly what its 
vision is in terms of numbers, given what has been said in the last 
few years on duplication, on the costs generated by two levels of 
government getting involved in the area of manpower.
<P>
	Why is this not clearly specified in the department's annual 
report? Is it because the costs confirm what the Bloc Quebecois is 
denouncing, that the federal government should withdraw? Or is it 
because the information was never sought, which would be even 
more serious? This amounts to closing one's eyes to a reality that is 
intolerable and should be changed. Closing one's eyes and saying: 
``We are staying the course  simply because we think we are right 
and because we are the federal government''.
<P>
	This kind of attitude would surprise me. It must be because they 
have not succeeded in setting up mechanisms to obtain information 
more quickly, and in today's society, information is power. 
Information allows us to make changes, to adjust our programs to 
the reality people are experiencing. In this regard, the amendment 
is interesting.
<P>
	Will the government pay attention to this amendment? I hope so, 
and I hope for at least some changes in the way information is made 
available to us, so that we can be assured that our information is as 
accurate as possible before making decisions.
<P>
	Let us think, for example, about all the studies commissioned by 
the government with regard to UI reform. Of 23 studies, 8 were 
made public. Where are the other 15? What is in those studies? Did 
they, in fact, contain nothing of interest, or were they not in line 
with the government's reform?
<P>
	These are questions that we are asking ourselves, questions that 
we are entitled to ask, and, once again, that explain why we are 
looking for clearer information so that we may understand the 
reasoning behind the Reform Party's amendment. We want to see 
the government come up with more effective tools for managing 
information so that we can treat people better, ultimately, and so 
that Quebecers and Canadians, whether they are employed, 
unemployed or looking for work, have the greatest chance possible 
of receiving top service.
<P>
	We still do not see this information in Bill C-96, and we would 
like to have the necessary information to be able to do something 
about the reality we face. We would like to be able to identify, 
among the 750,000 unemployed people in Canada today, those able 
to complete their training and move into the available jobs, and 
eliminate unemployment in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
	In short, the amendment seems interesting. It should be 
considered by the government, and I hope that, afterwards, we can 
have the most satisfactory management information system 
possible.

	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are now 
on Group No. 4.
<P>
	I would like to give everyone in the House an explanation and 
general remarks as they relate to the amendments to Bill C-11, an 
act to establish the Department of Human Resources Development 
now being considered at report stage.
<P>
	Bill C-11 had a life before prorogation. It was Bill C-96 which 
was introduced during the first session of Parliament on June 7, 
1995. The bill received second reading on November 28, 1995 and 
was subsequently referred to the Standing Committee on Human 
Resources Development. The committee studied the bill last 
December and January. Then, as we all know, the House prorogued.
<P>
	The HRD bill was subsequently reinstated and on March 7, the 
bill received its new number, Bill C-11, which we are debating 
today. Reinstatement of the bill means that it is at the same stage 
and contains exactly the same words it did in the previous session. 
It also means that it was necessary for the bill to be reviewed by its 
drafters to determine whether amendments were required due to 
prorogation.
<P>
	That review was done and it was determined that amendments 
are necessary because Bill C-11 must now take into account the 
fact that certain pieces of legislation which were proposed in the 
last session are now law. In other words, the conditional clauses in 
the HRD bill, for example those that indicate ``if this bill passes 
before that bill'' must now be changed to reflect actual laws and not 
proposed laws.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1382"> 1382 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1545 )</B>
<P>
	In this context 11 amendments are being proposed to the HRD 
act. All the amendments relate to the fact that Bill C-11 must be 
updated to take into account the passage of certain bills in the 
previous session.
<P>
	In some cases this means that the amendments will work in 
pairs. One amendment will update the HRD bill to reflect passage 
of a previous bill; another amendment will delete the reference to 
the HRD bill to the conditional ``if this bill passes'' clause to reflect 
the fact that the bill passed where appropriate. If any of the 
members in the House are interested in the very technical and 
somewhat complex and dry issue of just what those particular 
changes are, I would be willing to relate that to them in this House. 
That is the general gist of the different motions; it is very much a 
technical nature and is very general.
<P>
	Based on that I want to make some remarks this afternoon about 
the bill itself. We are getting down to the end of our discussion at 
report stage and all the different motions that were put before the 
House. At the same time I want to try to put to bed some of the 
myths that have been debated in this House especially by the Bloc 
members who have spent a lot of time talking about what is not in 
the bill versus what is in the bill. I thought it would be nice if we 
spent some time talking about what is in the bill.
<P>
	We are not talking about new organizational changes or new 
statutory powers or changes in federal-provincial relations. We are 
dealing with a simple housekeeping bill to create the legislative 
foundation for a department that has been hard at work since 1993. 
That is Human Resources Development Canada.
<P>
	Some people will bend themselves right out of shape trying to 
describe Bill C-11 as some kind of elaborate ploy hatched with the 
intent of robbing provinces of constitutional power. Believe me, 
the government has no such plans up its sleeve.
<P>
	Bill C-11 does just one thing. This bill assembles related 
functions that used to belong to several different departments into 
one department which is now known as Human Resources 
Development Canada.
<P>
	I urge all members to recognize Human Resources Development 
Canada as a streamlined, efficient organization focused on service 
to its clients. After all, Canadians need and deserve the most highly 
integrated focused human resources efforts this House and our 
public service can muster. The old system worked against this type 
of innovative action plan.
<P>
	For example, Labour Canada handled workplace relations and 
standards while Employment and Immigration Canada took care of 
providing income support to unemployed workers and matching 
job openings with available and qualified people. At the same time, 
the Secretary of State dealt with equity issues and  Health and 
Welfare Canada handled long term income security. That means 
four large complex organizations working in different and 
sometimes conflicting ways on interrelated issues which touch on 
the very fabric of the working and home lives of Canadians.
<P>
	This bill consolidates all of those roles into one streamlined 
department. Let us not forget that this department already exists. 
All this bill does is it simply and clearly sets out what HRDC 
already does every day.
<P>
	Bill C-11 also means that it will cost less to develop the flexible, 
imaginative and innovative approaches we need. We cannot afford 
to delay the reorganization any longer. We owe it to Canadians to 
find new approaches to jobs and training that will help them in 
these difficult and unpredictable times.
<P>
	As an example, years ago factory workers generally needed 
much less knowledge and skills to do their jobs. Today however, 
relatively higher knowledge and skill levels are required for many 
factory jobs. In fact, higher knowledge and skill levels are an 
integral part of a growing number of jobs in all sectors. In response 
to this new reality, the new HRDC brings together the pieces we 
need to flourish in a global knowledge economy. The new HRDC 
takes a holistic approach to social, economic and training issues.
<P>
	This bill has another exciting dimension which will serve to 
enhance Canada's ability to deal with the challenges of the modern 
economy. Bill C-11 builds new structures that the federal 
government can use to work in partnership with the provinces on 
resolving some of the issues that have bedevilled us all in the past.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	Although HRDC has yet to be officially legislated into existence, 
it is already working on using these co-operative structures to 
provide in partnership with the provinces innovative and effective 
services to Canadians across the country. I will share a few 
examples with my hon. colleagues.
<P>
	In Newfoundland and Labrador a program is providing training 
vouchers to allow disadvantaged youth to continue their education. 
So far, nearly 3,000 young people have taken advantage of this 
assistance, about one-third of whom were previously receiving 
social assistance. Many of these young Canadians would have been 
unable to continue their education without our help. By ``our'' I 
mean both HRDC and the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.
<P>
	In the past two years HRDC has helped 300,000 students pay for 
their education. It has assisted 24,000 young people in finding jobs 
that pay decent living wages and have some potential for the future. 
With provincial help, another 60,000 marginalized Canadians have 
learned new skills and have landed jobs. These programs help 
Canadians prepare for the new economic realities which affect so 
many of us today.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1383"> 1383 </A></B>
<P>
	HRDC is also intent on providing improved service and has 
already achieved some very impressive results. Seniors can now 
get personal service at four times as many places as they could 
have before 1993. It takes half as long to process some claims 
and there are almost twice as many points of service.
<P>
	That is the kind of service and those are the kinds of programs 
which HRDC is offering and which Canadians want and need. Bill 
C-11 and HRDC do not concern new powers. They are new ways to 
use the familiar established powers to provide in conjunction with 
our partners highly integrated and cost effective services in the 
most efficient way possible.
<P>
	HRDC is the sentinel which protects the fairness, equity and 
opportunities that everyone in Canada treasures. Bill C-11 will 
keep that sentinel on the job.
<P>
	In one form or another, this bill has been under intense scrutiny 
for some time now. It is time to recognize that any and all lingering 
concerns have been addressed. It is time to move on. I suggest it is 
time to pass Bill C-11. We have had a long afternoon. We have 
talked about a lot of Russians and moles under the rocks and all the 
paranoias of the opposition.
<P>
	I want to assure the House that this is a revamped department 
with one function in mind and that is to make sure that we deliver 
services to Canadians to the best of our ability, as efficiently and as 
cost effectively as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to comment briefly on what the hon. member 
said.
<P>
	I accept that Motions Nos. 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17, 
which are in Group No. 4 are government amendments and they 
basically involve the technicalities of Bill C-11. I appreciate that 
the remarks of the hon. member were valid in that these motions 
are very much of a technical nature. While I agree that Bill C-11 is 
basically a housekeeping bill establishing the Department of 
Human Resources Development, I am concerned about the method 
and the process we used with respect to the latest amendments.
<P>
	We do have a democratic process in the House. I wish that we 
could extend it a bit more to give opposition members time to take 
a look at these amendments before the ninth hour. In order for 
democracy to work we have to have time to take an honest look. 
Regardless of whether the government says they are only 
housekeeping technicalities, we really do have a right as elected 
members to be given enough time to study them, to look at their 
impact and to make sure that what the hon. member on the 
government side has said is the case.
<P>
<B>(1555)</B>
<P>
	I would say that overall, without having the time to look at these 
amendments in depth, I would be prepared to agree with the Group 
No. 4 amendments put forward by the government at this time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Group No. 4 in fact resembles the bill itself. Just a while 
ago, the parliamentary secretary had some nice things to say about 
the bill as a whole. He said that the Bloc had spoken about things 
that were not in the bill.
<P>
	Still, one should be aware of what the federal government has 
done for a number of years now, which is to interfere in the 
provinces' jurisdiction over manpower training without any 
statutory basis, and to table a bill and put forward a motion creating 
the equivalent of a federal department of education.
<P>
	This is not just a housekeeping bill, this is not a bill that merely 
sets out the existing situation. It is an attempt to legitimize an 
approach that does not accurately reflect the division of powers 
between the provinces and the federal government.
<P>
	This leeway in the bill comes up again in Group No. 4 and is just 
as confusing. The question the public should be asking itself about 
the amendments proposed is the following: Just how far should the 
government be allowed to go in obtaining personal information?
<P>
	In Motion No. 8 they want to add the departments of national 
revenue, finance, and supply and services. In Motion No. 11, they 
talk about the justice department and the Attorney General of 
Canada, for the purposes of investigations in relation to war 
crimes.
<P>
	There are important elements involved, with an impact on 
confidentiality. Having been a member of parliament for two and a 
half years, I have really seen the weight of the bureaucracy brought 
to bear on individuals. I have seen how, when there is an 
investigation with respect to the Unemployment Insurance Act, for 
instance, it is the reverse of what we usually see in the courts. 
People are declared guilty until they prove otherwise, the opposite 
of the approach taken in the legal system.
<P>
	Let us not forget the amendments to the legislation the last time 
to prevent people from receiving unemployment insurance 
benefits, such as the case of the beneficiary who had to prove that 
he had not been let go for whatever reason. We might have a lot of 
questions to ask about the government's objectives in seeking to 
broaden the scope of investigations in this manner.
<P>
	Was the idea to go after unemployment rather than the 
unemployed? They think that they can solve unemployment by 
heaping further penalties on people who find themselves in 
difficult 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1384"> 1384 </A></B>
<P>
situations, whose  circumstances are such that they are not always 
aware of the complexity of legislation.
<P>
	It is for that reason that, before passing an amendment 
authorizing the government to cross-reference information with 
National Revenue and Finance, Supply and Services, and in other 
cases with the Department of Justice, the Attorney General of 
Canada, we must be certain that these actions will be carried out 
with respect for the right to confidentiality of certain information.
<P>
	If similar information requirements were applied to individuals 
who have family trusts or benefit from any other tax avoidance 
scheme, would their rate of non-compliance not be considerably 
higher that what is currently observed among the unemployed, 
those who use this particular social program?
<P>
	Does this kind of amendment not create a double standard?
<P>
<B>(1600)</B>
<P>
	These are questions we can ask ourselves. The same way we can 
ask ourselves if this is not the government's roundabout way of 
completing the job it has been doing on the UI reform, creating a 
climate where users of the system are penalized and nit-picking 
relentlessly, even if it means going too far sometimes in looking for 
information.
<P>
	We in Canada have had experience with this kind of approach in 
other areas. We have seen the effect it has on social assistance when 
the government assumes the right to intervene, to go looking for all 
sorts of information concerning an individual. At some certain 
point, it becomes immoral. Knowing how easily this kind of 
information can be retrieved by powerful computer systems, we are 
certainly very reluctant to vote in favour of such an amendment.
<P>
	I would therefore urge the government and the Reform Party to 
think twice before passing this amendment. All the hon. members 
of this House have had, in their ridings, people walk in their office 
and explain how powerless they feel when dealing with the 
bureaucracy, how difficult it is to handle a letter informing you that 
you are not eligible to UI benefits when you have had the same job 
for three full years, just because all of a sudden someone 
somewhere has decided to interpret a rule differently. When they 
are denied a cheque and this is their only source of income, 
individuals are not equipped to face the government and work their 
way up the government channels.
<P>
	I think individual citizens should have a fair chance to argue 
their points and make sure that information provided in confidence 
to one party or the other will not be used indiscriminately, because 
that creates a climate of distrust which is unhealthy, is not fair to 
the citizens and contributes to making our society very wary about 
any government action. The government should give some thought 
to this before passing this kind of amendment.

	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not 
spend a lot of time on these two motions because they are exactly 
the same as the last grouping we considered.
<P>
<B>(1605 )</B>
<P>
	These are again just technical amendments. I want to read for the 
record what they are and give a short explanation of Motions Nos. 9 
and 10. That will explain to opposition members what they are for. 
If they would like a discussion a little more far ranging than these 
two motions, I suppose that is their prerogative. However, I do not 
want to delay the passage of the bill any further.
<P>
	Clause 50 is being amended in order to take into account a 
change made to a section of the Children's Special Allowances Act 
due to the passage of Bill C-54.
<P>
	The House will recall that Bill C-54 is a technical amendments 
bill passed in the last session which amended the Old Age Security 
Act, the Canada pension plan, the Children's Special Allowances 
Act and the Unemployment Insurance Act. Bill C-54, adopted by 
Parliament in the last session, already incorporates this wording 
change. This is another instance of pairing. When we get there, 
clause 104, which contains conditional aspects of this wording 
change to the HRD bill, will be deleted. We did that under the 
previous group. We have already done that.
<P>
	In Motion No. 10 clause 76 is being amended in three places. It 
calls for the addition of a subclause to clause 76 to reflect the fact 
that there will now be two sections to clause 76 rather than a single 
clause.
<P>
	Proposal (b) incorporates a change made to the section of the Old 
Age Security Act due to the passage of Bill C-54, the same 
technical bill I mentioned earlier.
<P>
	Proposal (c) incorporates a further change to the Old Age 
Security Act due to the passage of Bill C-54 as well. Since Bill 
C-54 predates the HRD bill, this proposal also  updates the title of 
the responsible minister to reflect the title of the Minister of 
Human Resources Development.
<P>
	All of the above proposals reflect an instance of pairing again. 
The conditional aspect of this change is included in section 104 of 
the HRD bill. Section 104 will be deleted when we get there.
<P>
	There we have it, the very dry and somewhat complex discussion 
of why we have had to make some changes. In defence of the 
government as it relates to the comments of my colleague from the 
Reform Party, it is pretty difficult to give her these amendments too 
far in advance because when the House prorogued it took time for 
the bill to be looked at technically by the experts in the department 
to make sure it reflected the new reality.
<P>
	It is not our intention to be secretive or to be undemocratic. 
These things take on a life of their own. I assure the member that 
she can take my word for it and the word of the government that 
these are just technical in nature and do not have any implication 
with regard to the solid content of the bill and what the department 
will be all about.
<P>
	I take this opportunity to thank the House for taking the time and 
being patient in listening to the explanation of these amendments, 
which are necessary to make the bill reflective of reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the two amendments are very special in their effect. On 
the one hand, they will be reducing the available information that 
could be given to people on such matters as the amount of a benefit 
or the status of a recipient. On the other hand, they are increasing 
the number of people to whom information may be made available 
in the government. There is even talk of adding Canada Post to 
those with access to records.
<P>
	Canada Post, it must be kept in mind, is no longer a government 
body per se, but rather a crown agency with considerable leeway, 
and its mandate is in the process of being reviewed. We could find 
ourselves in the situation of giving access to a virtually privatized 
organization, which could surely create significant problems.
<P>
	What is involved here is the ability to trace mail, am item sent to 
an individual, where there was a need to find out from Canada Post 
why it had not been deliverable, or to what address it had finally 
been delivered. There is something a bit dangerous in this, I think.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	As well, the delegation to the provinces of access to certain 
information is being removed. The door is being slammed in the 
provinces' faces, while at the same time being opened to a number 
of organizations. The public is being denied the right to certain 
information, while it is being granted to a number of federal 
bodies.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="1386"> 1386 </A></B>
<P>
	I think amendments of this type are along the same line as the 
ones discussed previously, or in other words that the government 
is giving itself even more opportunities, and the individual is 
seeing the confidentiality of certain information concerning him 
or her being eroded a little bit more. We must always be on guard 
in such situations. With modern communications technology, we 
are intruding on people's privacy more and more, and it is not 
necessarily appropriate to do so.
<P>
	The official opposition will be opposing this proposed 
amendment.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, with these two amendments I have the same problem I had 
with the initial clauses. That is why Reform put forward 
amendments to begin with.
<P>
	A concern I have is that certain things are done and we do not 
know about them. I put forward the amendment that we would have 
an annual report for a very good reason. I hope the government 
considers that in Bill C-11.
<P>
	As well, I feel strongly that we do not bypass provinces or appear 
to bypass provinces. The legislation appears to do that. The 
wording of it is definitely there. Those are my concerns.
<P>
	With these two, the government has more opportunity to 
intervene. This is the concern I as a member of Parliament should 
be raising. Motion No. 9 adds Canada Post to the list.
<P>
	I have not yet been answered by the member from the 
government on what impact this would have. We have had no 
explanation in the House on how it would impact on us. This 
should be explained to the House. It concerns me.
<P>
	Until I hear the explanations clearly, I hesitate to speak in favour 
of Motions Nos. 9 and 10. In this case the Reform Party would 
oppose them.

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 1</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-18, in Clause 4, be amended by striking out line 7, on page 2, and 
substituting the following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(<I>a</I>) the administration of such Acts of Parliament and of orders or 
regulations of the Government of Canada as are not by law assigned to any 
other department of the Government of Canada or any minister of that 
Government relating in any way to the health of the people of Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>.1) the promotion and the preservation of the''.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to propose an amendment to 
clause 4 of Bill C-18, formerly Bill C-95. The amendment basically 
reincorporates a clause from the current Department of National 
Health and Welfare Act, an act that dates back to 1944 and has 
served Canadians well for half a century.
<P>
	As the House knows, over time drafting styles of legislation 
change. That is why Bill C-95, as it was originally tabled, adopted a 
more contemporary way of describing the Minister of Health's 
responsibilities.
<P>
	The drafters of the legislation on many occasions have argued to 
me and others that basically Bill C-95 as it was tabled at second 
reading would not have changed the responsibilities of the Minister 
of Health for the administration of acts of Parliament. However, 
others are less convinced.
<P>
	First, I will establish exactly what it is that this amendment 
proposes to do. It would insert in subclause 4(2) after ``without 
restricting the generality of subsection (1) the minister's powers, 
duties and functions relating to health include the following 
matters'', I would be inserting ``the administration of such acts of 
Parliament and of orders or regulations of the Government of 
Canada as are not by law assigned to any other department of the 
Government of Canada or any minister of that Government relating 
in any way to the health of the people of Canada''.
<P>
	The amendment is proposed in order to eliminate any 
apprehension that the government is trying to avoid being held 
accountable for its actions in administering legislation. A similar 
provision already exists in the current department of National 
Health and Welfare Act.
<P>
	The reference to social security and the welfare of the people of 
Canada has been eliminated in view of the creation of the 
Department of Human Resources Development. This provision had 
been eliminated to improve the drafting of the bill. It was 
considered redundant because subclause 4(1) already had 
established the general mandate of the minister with regard to 
health and moreover specific legislation such as the Food and 
Drugs Act states that the minister is also responsible for its 
application.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1388"> 1388 </A></B>
<P>
	However, many Canadians who have contacted HIV through 
blood transfusions have indicated that they fear that the effect of 
this omission will be to reduce the accountability of the minister 
with regard to the legislation it administers and in particular with 
regard to the Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	In fact, Ms. Lori Stoltz, a lawyer who represented HIV blood 
transfused patients at the Krever inquiry has pointed out to me that 
in her opinion the bill would remove responsibility from the 
Minister of Health.
<P>
	We must be very sensitive to the concerns of people who have 
become ill after using a product that they had all reason to believe 
was absolutely safe. Rather than entering into a legal debate of 
whether the elimination of the previous clause would have in fact 
reduced the accountability of the minister, it is much more 
constructive, in my opinion, to take the action to alleviate their 
concerns.
<P>
	The purpose of Bill C-18 is to confirm the creation of the 
Department of Health and define the mandate of the minister 
responsible for the department, not to limit the risk of liability of 
the government.
<P>
	The pith and substance of the bill is contained in subclause 4(1). 
It provides that the Minister of Health is responsible for all matters 
over which Parliament has jurisdiction relating to the promotion 
and preservation of the health of Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	The bill recognizes the crucial role played by the Department of 
Health in protecting the public against risks to health. This includes 
the evaluation of drugs and medical devices, ensuring these 
therapeutic products are safe for public consumption and that they 
do what the manufacturers claim they will do.
<P>
	The disastrous situation which resulted from the transmission of 
HIV through the blood system must not be allowed to occur again. 
Our efforts to maintain a high quality, responsive and affordable 
health system is being strengthened by the creation of the new 
Department of Health and the implementing legislation for Health 
Canada ensures that the department's resources and activities are 
devoted to the policy and funding challenges facing our national 
health protection system.
<P>
	The bill ensures that the department will continue to work 
closely with all health stakeholders and the people of Canada. 
Health Canada will provide national leadership and remain a full 
and active partner in all matters concerning the health of 
Canadians. For these reasons it is proposed to make it clear that the 
responsibilities of the Minister of Health include the administration 
of legislation that is related to health.
<P>
	The amendment is put forward to reassure Canadians that where 
a debate existed whether the removal of certain provisions in the 
old act would have the effect of  removing responsibility from the
<P>
minister. Rather than debate which opinion is right, the government 
has decided appropriately to defer to the safer position and reinsert 
the original wording from the National Health and Welfare Act. I 
am pleased to make this amendment.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I omitted to mention at the beginning of debate 
that all interventions will be 10 minutes with no questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, Bill C-95, as it 
was originally brought to the House, seemed to me a very 
straightforward bill. I wondered why we would spend a lot of time 
debating what seemed like a name change.
<P>
	As the watchdog for this bill I had already gone over it very 
carefully and felt the minister had full accountability and full 
responsibility for all matters relating to health. However, concerns 
were brought to my attention by the fine tooth comb experts. They 
came up with a potential concern, a potential problem that related 
to ministerial accountability. The motion by the member for 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury would take care of any question on 
that issue.
<P>
	Ministerial accountability is not redundant. It is absolutely 
mandatory. Anyone who tried to change that would be on very 
shaky ground. The Krever inquiry has brought to the fore the 
concern about ministerial accountability. This inquiry shows that 
our regulatory system can have flaws, that those dispensing to the 
Canadian public can have flaws. We are actually at a state now 
where the Krever inquiry is being held up by legal challenges 
coming from a host of sources.
<P>
	Ministerial accountability is profoundly important. For that 
reason I support the inclusion of this clause in Bill C-95, and I will 
be so recommending to my caucus.

<BLOCKQUOTE>Motion No. 4</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-18 be amended by deleting Clause 36.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, these are purely technical amendments to 
Bill C-18. As other colleagues have indicated, it was formerly 
known as Bill C-95. These two amendments have become 
necessary primarily due to the reintroduction of the bill following 
the prorogation of Parliament.
<P>
	The Government Organization Act has now become law and as a 
result it requires two amendments to Bill C-18. It is proposed that a 
new clause, subsection 23.3, be added to indicate that in the 
Government Organization Act, the word ``minister'' does in fact 
mean the Minister of Health.
<P>
	As you will know, Mr. Speaker, previously the department was 
known as the department of national health and welfare and the 
minister was known as the minister thereof. This amendment is 
changes the name of the minister to be consistent with the rest of 
the bill.
<P>
	Motion No. 4 deletes clause 36, which is a conditional 
amendment that has the same effect when referring to former Bill 
C-65. The Government Organization Act amends the statutes that 
establish 15 federal agencies and dissolves 7 federal organizations. 
As far as Health Canada is concerned, this dissolves the board of 
trustees of the Queen Elizabeth II Canadian fund to aid in research 
on the diseases of children. It does not eliminate the funding. That 
continues under the administration of the Medical Research 
Council. It does eliminate the board of trustees.

look forward to speedy passage thereof.

	He said: Mr. Speaker, these two motions are like the previous 
two. They are purely technical amendments to Bill C-18, again 
prompted by the reintroduction of the former Bill C-95, following 
the prorogation of Parliament.
<P>
	Clause 35 proposes to replace the reference to former Bill C-7 
otherwise known as the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. The 
number of Bill C-7 has been changed to Bill C-8 and the reference 
must now be changed.
<P>
	As well, clause 37 proposes to eliminate the reference to Bill 
C-84, the Regulations Act and to simply refer to a bill.

Parliament before the regulations bill,  the numbering of the latter

	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (for the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-13, an act to provide for the establishment and 
operation of a program to enable certain persons to receive 
protection in relation to certain inquiries, investigations or 
prosecutions, be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Nick Discepola (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to 
participate in the debate on third reading of Bill C-13, the witness 
protection program act.
<P>
	I am sure that most hon. members are aware that the intent of the 
witness protection program act is to ensure that our federal witness 
protection program will provide the best possible protection to both 
witnesses and sources.
<P>
	The legislation proposed by the bill creates for the first time a 
statutory foundation for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
source witness protection program.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On behalf of the Solicitor General, I would like to thank all the 
members of the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs 
for the time and energy they put into consideration of this bill last 
fall.
<P>
	During this period, the committee heard people from various 
backgrounds, including the police, representatives of victim 
support groups, legal experts and a former witness.
<P>
	It also heard my hon. colleague, the member for Scarborough 
West, whose interest in the matter of witness protection is well 
known, and who stimulated discussions significantly on this 
important question.
<P>
	The government has taken careful note of the legitimate 
concerns expressed during the hearings of the committee, and they 
are reflected in the amendments made to the original bill.
<P>
	Thus, the bill before you today is better and more solid than the 
one tabled at first reading.
<P>
	The committee deserves our thanks for this.
<P>
	The proposed changes will improve the transparency and the 
efficiency of the RCMP's source and witness protection program, 
which has existed as an administrative program since 1984, by 
giving it a solid statutory and regulatory basis.
<P>
	We are creating a witness protection program with a basis in law.
<P>
	This legislation will have the important effect of giving the 
RCMP's source and witness protection program a higher profile. 
The need to report on the operations of this program will be 
specified.
<P>
	Of course, the identity of the sources and witness will remain 
secret, but the selection criteria and the scope of protection will be 
clear and transparent.
<P>
	Thanks to these statutory provisions, the participants in the 
program and the RCMP administering it will be clear as to their 
rights and obligations and the scope of the protection and benefits 
provided. This should also eliminate any misunderstanding 
between the RCMP and the people being protected.
<P>
	In all, the changes to this RCMP program will meet the needs of 
both the police and the witnesses and sources requiring protection.
<P>
	The proposed changes will ensure that the eligibility criteria for 
witnesses are clearly defined; they will ensure standard case 
handling across the country; a clear definition of the 
responsibilities and obligations of the program administrators and 
participants; a better defined management structure within the 
RCMP for day to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1391"> 1391 </A></B>
<P>
day program operation, which will reinforce the reporting 
requirement; a complaint resolution mechanism and the 
presentation of an annual report on the operation of the program by 
the commissioner of the RCMP to the  Solicitor General, which 
will be tabled in the House of Commons.
<P>
	Provincial and municipal law enforcement agencies may still 
make use of the RCMP source and witness protection program, as 
they did in the past, on a cost recovery basis.
<P>
<B>(1655)</B>
<P>
	However, the bill does not seek to replace witness protection 
programs administered by provinces or municipalities, nor does it 
seek to set up a national program.
<P>
	Through these brief comments, I tried to present as clearly as 
possible the key components of the bill. I am convinced that hon. 
members know that the source witness protection program is a very 
powerful tool for law enforcement purposes.
<P>
	However, I am aware that there are lingering concerns over 
certain aspects of the program. I will discuss some of these now, 
particularly those raised by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert. 
During the debate at second reading, the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert asked the government to clarify three basic points.
<P>
	The first one is the budget allocated for the new program; the 
second one is the time required to put the program in place, once 
the bill is passed; and the third one is the number of people who 
should take part in the program. These are important issues and I 
will begin with the budget.
<P>
	The annual costs of the RCMP source witness protection 
program currently stand at $3.4 million. I am pleased to tell the 
House that the bill will not result in any additional costs. The 
average cost per case is $30,000, and in about 60 per cent of the 
cases it is under $20,000.
<P>
	The second issue raised by the hon. member for Saint-Hubert is 
the time required, once the bill is passed, for the new program to 
become operational.
<P>
	The RCMP assures us that the new program could be operational 
a few weeks after the bill is passed. It is to be noted that the current 
source witness protection program will be maintained until the 
proposed changes are implemented.
<P>
	The third and last point raised by the hon. member for 
Saint-Hubert is the number of people who should take part in the 
program every year. There are, at any one time, between 80 and 100 
people, including family members, actively participating in the 
program. This average figure should not change in the foreseeable 
future.
<P>
	I want to point out that protecting sources and witnesses will not 
eliminate violent crime, or even organized crime. However, the 
program is an important investigation tool for law enforcement 
authorities. It  greatly helps police in its constant fight against 
organized crime and major criminal activities in Canada.
<P>
	We must make sure that the program continues to be such a 
useful instrument.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	When the government was elected it made a commitment in its 
election platform to a safer homes and safer streets agenda. Since 
taking office we have honoured that commitment.
<P>
	To date we have brought about the reform of the corrections and 
conditional release system through the passage of Bill C-45 which 
became law in January of this year. Improvements were equally 
made to the Canadian Police Information Centre data banks to help 
screen out child sexual abusers as potential employees and 
volunteers working with children.
<P>
	We established a national flagging system to help crown 
attorneys deal more effectively with high risk offenders. We 
equally passed comprehensive gun control. We created a National 
Crime Prevention Council and passed amendments to the Young 
Offenders Act.
<P>
	The witness protection program act is yet another important 
component in our overall effort to improve safety and security for 
all Canadians. I believe that all hon. members recognize the 
importance of and endorse the changes proposed in the witness 
protection program act.
<P>
	I would like to thank once again all members of all parties for 
their past support of the bill. I hope we can count on their continued 
support to ensure speedy passage of Bill C-13 at third reading.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard St-Laurent (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to rise in the House today to speak to Bill C-13, 
concerning the protection of witnesses. This is a topic of some 
interest to the police, naturally, and it is also an important factor in 
helping the judicial system not just to track down criminals, but 
also to pursue individuals involved in organized crime. It is also a 
very sensitive topic, open to controversy. By its definition, 
organized crime involves a number of people, a very close-knit 
group that it is extremely difficult for RCMP or CSIS agents or 
anyone else to penetrate.
<P>
	One of our duties is to assist the judicial process, to facilitate 
legislation and the application of legislation for those who must 
apply it on the front line, in most cases, police officers, of course.
<P>
	It is important in 1996 that Canada have such a law. It has been 
needed for a long time, but whatever the reasons for the delay, we 
are finally debating it today.
<P>
	The objective, let it be remembered, is to improve the quality of 
life. You do not pass a law for the sheer  pleasure of it, you pass a 
law to facilitate the process, and Bill C-13 is ultimately about 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1392"> 1392 </A></B>
<P>
improving the quality of life and improving respect for the law, 
which becomes more effective as a result. It is simply a work tool, 
not a revolution in itself, as we have seen elsewhere.
<P>
	Experience has shown that turning to witnesses to provide 
elements of proof or help with police investigations at the risk of 
endangering themselves or their families, is often one of the most 
effective means available to our justice system in the fight against 
crime, particularly organized crime. The objective of the witness 
protection program act is to ensure that our federal witness 
protection program continues to offer the best protection possible 
to sources and potential witnesses.
<P>
	It is hardly surprising that Bill C-13, which itself flows from Bill 
C-78 tabled by the Solicitor General, is to all intents and purposes 
the same as a bill already passed by this House on September 26, 
Bill C-206, tabled by the hon. member for Scarborough West, and 
passed at first reading on February 1, 1995.
<P>
	In fact, the only noticeable changes are that witnesses can be 
better compensated under a bill as introduced. Also, under Bill 
C-13, the commissioner of the RCMP will now have to make the 
necessary arrangements with witnesses, or their solicitor, to ensure 
their protection.
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, under Bill C-206, as passed on 
December 26, the solicitor general had the authority to reach 
agreements with witnesses. That, of course, made it easier, under 
our parliamentary system, to ensure control of government 
activities through ministerial accountability.
<P>
	We lagged considerably behind others, in particular our 
American neighbours, who have had witness protection legislation 
applying to all 50 states of the union for 25 years now. That 
legislation is well known by the general public, which is thus aware 
of its rights.
<P>
	The system was made necessary because what is happening 
today is that police authorities are using a piecemeal approach, 
dealing separately with each informant they want to see testify in 
court.
<P>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	This makes things somewhat ambiguous for these people, who 
have a law to enforce, for a variety of reasons, including the media 
aspect. But on what basis are they going to negotiate these 
piecemeal agreements?
<P>
	I do not believe we can settle for a piecemeal approach, with 
decisions depending on the whims of whoever is responsible for 
policing at a specific time. I feel that instead we need to have 
legislation that will apply all across Canada as this will improve the 
situation of witnesses, particularly in criminal cases, and more 
particularly in cases involving serious crimes.
<P>
	The process, as it is currently applied, does have a few flaws. 
These events are always surrounded by publicity, which taints the 
true purpose of the mandate outlined in Bill C-13.
<P>
	Law enforcement officers bargain with criminals, often for 
money, but also for reduced sentences. On the subject of reduced 
sentences, there was a case recently in Ontario, in Toronto to be 
more precise, that draw a great deal of media attention for all kinds 
of reasons. Naturally, in this matter-this is as good an example as 
any, since it is often how it works-it is quite clear that, without the 
help of the informer witness-in this case, a woman-it would 
have been almost impossible for the judicial system to get a 
conviction for extremely serious crimes.
<P>
	Witness protection is not afforded indiscriminately either. It has 
been used in many instances. I think that every member of this 
House has learned about such cases through the media or through 
personal experience. The problem is it could be subject to 
interpretation. Will giving informer witnesses money or reduced 
sentences have the effect of encouraging crime? That is one way of 
looking at it, but we must look a little further than that, we must 
take a slightly more serious attitude and admit that, ultimately, it 
has the effect of encouraging informers to come forward, which, in 
turn, leads to the arrest and conviction of individuals and often 
groups of individuals.
<P>
	Some would say this is rooting out individuals whose sole reason 
for belonging to our society is to abuse the system, certain 
advantages or the kindness of some organizations, but that is part of 
a bigger picture. Let us not kid ourselves here. Without the 
protection afforded by the law, informers would just not come 
forward.
<P>
	Big time criminals never operate alone, or only very 
exceptionally. As for those who operate alone and are still out 
there, have not been caught yet, we do not hear much about them 
either. They are therefore of no great concern to us. But those who 
operate in gangs, the big time criminals involved in drug 
trafficking or money laundering, to name but a few of their 
activities, they are the ones that worry us. This is the kind of cases 
that are reported on almost every week on television.
<P>
	And every week, there is all this information on all sorts of 
crimes: currency counterfeiting, card counterfeiting, large scale 
credit card theft. Land is bought in foreign countries with money to 
be laundered and then resold. The list goes on and on.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	We are talking about organizations. These activities cannot be 
conducted by a single individual. A person alone cannot go out and 
buy equipment with clean money while carrying dirty money 
obtained from a drug deal. This is simply not possible. There are 
steps to follow. There are a number of people involved and,  among 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1393"> 1393 </A></B>
<P>
these, we sometimes find informers, who deserve to be protected 
when they testify.
<P>
	Let me tell you about a case on the North Shore, in my riding, 
more specifically in Sept-îles. Several tonnes of hashish were 
seized. At the time, a big wig was arrested, namely Vito Rizutto, 
the mafia boss. An informer was involved. As I recall, 18 people, 
from sailors on the ship to the big boss himself were in that small 
jail, in Sept-îles, which has room for 23 people in total. Needless to 
say that this group of 18 pretty well filled up the place.
<P>
	There was also an informer inside, a ship captain. I remember 
him very well. Since then, he has been keeping a very low profile, 
particularly in view of the fact that the investigation fizzled out for 
all sorts of reasons that would be too long to explain.
<P>
	I remember that, at the time, the informer was offered police 
protection, including a new identity and possibly some money. 
Because of this arrangement, he was prepared to testify. He 
confessed. At the time, I was a correctional services officer and had 
the opportunity to speak with him, with all of them, but I asked him 
the following question: Would you give yourself up if you did not 
have this system?
<P>
	Naturally, they offered to protect his family, him as well, give 
him a new identity and so on. He was adamant, it was out of the 
question. He would say nothing at all, if nothing else was offered, if 
this protection system was not offered, which is not surprising in 
the times we live in, if we want to catch the big criminals.
<P>
	All the more so as we are not looking at 100,000 people wanting 
money to talk, 100,000 people to protect, who need new identities. 
I listened to the remarks of my colleague across the way earlier, 
and he said, if my memory is correct, that the average was $30,000 
per person, and often $20,000. It is very unusual. I once saw 
approximately $100,000 in British Columbia a few years back. I 
think that this idea dies hard.
<P>
	The deputy across the way was right to point out that the 
majority averaged $30,000. Do we say this is good, or not? This is, 
after all, being given to someone who has committed a crime, let us 
not forget that. Nor should we stick our heads in the sand. I say it is 
a compromise we have to make if we want to improve the legal 
system as it now stands, and particularly its application.
<P>
	Improving the legal system, legislating for the fun of it, these are 
things anyone can do. In order to get elected, we create laws, but 
these laws must be easy to apply for those on the front line, the 
police officers who make arrests and conduct investigations. They 
must be given the legislative means authorizing them to do so, so 
that they will no longer find themselves stuck in situations as they 
are today, where there is a considerable risk of finding their 
pictures on the front page of some tabloid, with the claim that they 
offered some criminal this, that or the other.
<P>
	There must be better protection than there is at present. I feel that 
C-13 goes a long way toward providing that protection.
<P>
	When we speak of witness protection, it has been pointed out, 
and I repeat, that this involves some 80 to 100 individuals, a figure 
which includes family members.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	It must be kept in mind that, like the rest of us, these people have 
families. If we commit some act, we do not want our families to 
pay for it. Of course, we need to have a sense of responsibility, but 
nobody is perfect. We must face up to our responsibilities.
<P>
	A criminal who has been informed on will automatically get at 
the informant where he or she is vulnerable, if at all possible, so if 
only the individual is protected and not the family, the whole 
protection process is useless. At this time, among of the 80 to 100 
individuals protected, and justifiably so, by the criminal justice 
system in this way , there are family members, children, wives and 
husbands.
<P>
	The system is not perfect, I will admit, but it is a pretty good one. 
It is not perfect because it was created by people, and none of us is 
perfect, no matter who we are. But our lack of perfection is 
compensated for considerably by our efforts to improve.
<P>
	Problems often arise in the period immediately following the 
commission of the crime. When someone is arrested, a lot of things 
go on in his or her head. This is logical and normal considering 
what is going on. The person is questioned by the police, offers 
information, a million questions are asked. It is not hard to imagine 
the panic such people can be in. It is absolutely incredible.
<P>
	But, careful, time is a factor. If individuals were not given 
protection, the criminal world would eventually get to them, 
directly or indirectly, and they could be asked perhaps to simply 
forget certain facts when it came time to testify in court.
<P>
	Let us say that Bill C-13 is a memory booster. It is a bit odd to 
put it that way, but if the witness protection system were dropped, I 
am sure people would forget a lot. However, when they are 
protected, they forget less quickly and co-operate more, and the 
legal system is better protected.
<P>
	It is also important to realize that this society has to be protected 
by the laws we make, and there is nothing wrong with using the 
same methods as the criminal world, which works on weaknesses 
in finding these people and stops at nothing to achieve its ends.
<P>
	Therefore, and I will conclude on this point, we support Bill 
C-13. It is not perfect, of course, but it is a significant step forward, 
which helps us catch up with other countries that have already 
incorporated this sort of measure in their legislation.
<P>

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Randy White (Fraser Valley West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to stand before the House today to address Bill C-13, 
the witness protection program act.
<P>
	My understanding is this bill would establish for the first time a 
legislative base for the RCMP's witness protection program, a 
program which has been in place as a series of internal guidelines 
and policies since 1984.
<P>
	The Reform Party recognizes there is a need for this type of 
legislation. Witnesses need the protection from potential harm, 
particularly when their testimonies relate to organized criminal 
activity such as illicit drug, tobacco and alcohol smuggling, 
firearms peddling, trafficking or other conspiracies to commit 
capital crimes.
<P>
<B>(1720 )</B>
<P>
	The decision to turn in criminals can be difficult. If justice is to 
be served we must take strong measures to protect from any 
potential harm those witnesses who step forward. Simply put, 
without the testimony of the person who comes forward to present 
their knowledge or experience of a criminal activity or conspiracy 
to a police officer and eventually a court of law there would be no 
charges and ultimately no convictions.
<P>
	Since 1962 violent and organized crimes have exploded in 
Canada. No longer can politicians live in denial of this reality. 
Wherever there is a dollar to be made illegally the criminal element 
will organize to beat the law. A prime example of this organized 
criminal activity is motor cycle gang violence and the resulting turf 
war spilling out on the streets in our country.
<P>
	It is no secret in law enforcement circles that the Hell's Angels 
are in an all out war with the Outlaws over control of the lucrative 
drug trade, the prostitution industry and the massive contraband 
smuggling and distribution industry. A recent spat of bombings in 
Montreal and elsewhere continue as crime kingpins make money. 
Meanwhile people die. The carnage must stop if law and order are 
to be restored on Canadian streets.
<P>
	The Reform Party is committed to restoring law and order. We 
have critically examined Bill C-13 with this objective in mind. We 
see some problems and we have proposed some amendments which 
would strengthen the bill. I trust our observations and proposals 
will not fall on deaf ears.
<P>
	Consider that the budget for the witness protection program in 
Canada will accommodate approximately 70 to 80 protectees in 
any given year. The budget established by the solicitor general, a 
paltry $3.4 million, is fundamentally inadequate given the 
resources required to penetrate the culture of organized crime and 
to properly identify and recruit criminals willing to inform on their 
own kind. The RCMP would intensify its efforts in this regard if 
more resources were available.
<P>
	Reform's chief concern is not only the deficiency of the witness 
protection funding program but also the lack of vision on the part 
of the solicitor general's office and the whole of the Liberal 
government's administration of Canada's affairs, in particular on 
crime.
<P>
	Instead of funding special interest lobbies advocating criminals' 
rights, the solicitor general would be well advised to consider 
public safety and channel resources into law enforcement programs 
and victims' rights for a change.
<P>
	Bill C-13 is a step toward strengthening the RCMP witness 
protection program. However, there are certain problems which 
must also receive the consideration of the House. In effect, Bill 
C-13 would continue the convention of past internal guidelines and 
policies of the RCMP's witness protection program, whereby the 
RCMP commissioner is granted the absolute power and authority 
for the following issues.
<P>
	He is granted the absolute power and authority to determine 
whether a witness should be admitted to the program, clause 5 of 
Bill C-13. He is granted absolute power and authority to terminate 
the protection of a witness if in the opinion of the commissioner it 
is warranted, clause 9; or to disclose the identity and location of a 
witness or protectee, clause 11; to make agreements with other law 
enforcement agencies, attorneys general of provinces or any 
provincial agencies, clause 14.
<P>
	I urge all members of the House to consider these powers and the 
necessity to continue such broad authority granted to the 
commissioner of the RCMP. In addition, with respect to 
agreements struck between the parties involved in the witness 
protection program, as it stands with this bill there is no resolution 
mechanism or appeal procedures for agencies, agents or protectees 
to air their concerns.
<P>
	It is crucial that a resolution mechanism become part of this bill. 
Take, for example, the concerns expressed by the two witnesses 
who came before the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal 
Affairs. One was a serving police officer representing dozens of 
police agencies and officers cross the country.
<P>
<B>(1725)</B>
<P>
	As it stands, the individual witness under protection is restricted 
in taking up matters of concern regarding the conditions of 
protection to the public complaints commission but not to the 
office of the solicitor general. This process is totally inadequate.
<P>
	Most police departments have an informant control officer, an 
ICO, who regulates the handling of an informant for the 
appropriate department. This type of arrangement allows the 
process of appeal in the event of an unsatisfactory decision on the 
part of the 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1395"> 1395 </A></B>
<P>
commissioner and would be available to disagreements  between 
individual police agencies and the RCMP via the ICO.
<P>
	I urge members to support the motion of November 20, 1995, at 
report stage, that Bill C-13 in clause 5 be amended (a) by replacing 
line 32 on page 2 with the following: ``Subject to this act, the 
commissioner'', and also (b) by adding after line 36, on page 2, the 
following: ``Any decision made by the commissioner, or by a 
member of the force on behalf of the commissioner, under sections 
5, 9, 11 or 14 of this act may be reviewed by the minister on 
application by a law enforcement agency''. This amendment would 
make the program much more effective, thus enabling these 
agencies greater flexibility in their investigation of organized

	Now for Reform's second proposed amendment which deals 
with the submission of the annual report on the operation of the 
program as it applies to the preceding year. We are without any 
provision for having the report sent before the Standing Committee 
on Justice and Legal Affairs and it does not mention the content of 
what the report should include. This approach is ridiculous.
<P>
	How many times have my Liberal friends across the way stood 
in the House and railed against past administrations on matters of 
accountability and responsibility? How many times has the 
government, acting as-

	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> These Liberals are picking on 
me over here, Madam Speaker. We are talking about the witness 
protection act and they are picking on me. It must have been a bad 
day in question period.
<P>
	How many times did the government, acting as Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition, attack others for passing legislation that was 
inadequate and totally wrong? It happened a lot of times. I suggest 
the answer to both of these questions is a great many times.
<P>
	When the Liberals were in opposition a couple of years ago they 
criticized the same thing we are criticizing today. Congratulations.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hypocrisy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> I am not sure how to spell the 
word hypocrite. I am sure it is somewhere in the dictionary.

	<B>An hon. member:</B> Hypogrit.
<P>
	<B>Mr. White (Fraser Valley West):</B> Hypogrit. Liberal, Tory, same 
old story. I present, therefore, an opportunity to my friends 
opposite to learn from past mistakes. This is not easy for them to 
understand.
<P>
	Let us make sure that Bill C-13 does not miss its mark. Let us 
support Reform's proposed amendment that Bill C-13, in clause 16, 
be amended to allow for the following of each report that: (a) the 
number of agreements entered into and the law enforcement 
agencies involved; (b) the number of applications made; (c) the 
average amount spent on each agreement entered into; (d) the 
number of agreements terminated and the reasons for their 
termination; (e) the number and types of offences committed by 
protectees; (f) the total amount of all money from the consolidated 
revenue fund spent in relation to the operation of this act; (g) 
co-operative measures between the force and other law 
enforcement agencies with respect to witness protection; (h) the 
number of foreign witnesses admitted to Canada and the number of 
Canadian witnesses relocated outside Canada.

	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-204, an act to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act 
(qualifications of directors), be read a second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Madam Speaker, in the first session of Parliament I had 
introduced Bill C-345, an act to amend the Canada Business 
Corporations Act. This bill did not have an opportunity to come 
before the House but it has been resubmitted and now appears 
before the House as Bill C-204.
<P>
	About a year and half ago I had the opportunity to attend the 
president's dinner of the Mississauga Board of Trade. The guest 
speaker was someone I know very well. The guest speaker was 
introduced as a senator of Canada; he was introduced as the 
chairman and chief executive officer of one of Canada's largest and 
most influential companies; and he was introduced as a director of 
some 26 different corporations. At the time I thought that surely 
this was a very busy person.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1396"> 1396 </A></B>
<P>
	In the life of the corporate world, boards of directors do play 
an extremely important role. There is a lot of responsibility. A lot 
has been written in the newspapers about director's liability. There 
have been many, many articles about the difficulty of trying to 
find qualified people who are prepared to take on directorships 
because of the onerous work and the serious liability.
<P>
	If a director knew or ought to have known that there was a 
problem with a corporation which resulted in damages to a 
shareholder or another stakeholder group, the director could be 
held personally liable to the full extent of their own personal assets. 
It is not a situation to be taken lightly.
<P>
	With that background and as a chartered accountant, I had been 
involved with the former Canada Corporations Act which has been 
replaced by the new Canada Business Corporations Act. We have a 
federal act and there are also provincial acts but the rules are much 
the same. It depends on the jurisdiction in which a corporation has 
been incorporated, but they must serve the same purpose. The 
corporations acts, be they federal or provincial, are there to provide 
the guidelines and rules under which corporations must deal with 
their affairs.
<P>
	Directors have very specific and important responsibilities. They 
have a responsibility to actively take on these responsibilities. Of 
course, there is the ever present risk of conflict of interest, either 
deliberate or inadvertent. Surely one would understand that the 
question is, how many directorships could an individual hold at any 
one time and still satisfactorily discharge all the responsibilities at 
least to a reasonable extent?
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Companies are of varying degrees and sizes. Some are very 
complicated for example, Bell Canada. Others are very small, 
incorporated companies which are for the sole purpose of an 
individual. It would be very difficult to establish a number.
<P>
	Having heard the introduction of the guest speaker at the 
Mississauga Board of Trade president's dinner, it struck me that for 
someone who was a senator of Canada and who had work to do as a 
senator, and someone who was the chairman and CEO of a major 
Canadian corporation, for him also to be a director of some 26 
other corporations led me to believe there may have been a 
situation developing that I did not understand. Maybe there was a 
problem. That is the rationale for Bill C-204.
<P>
	Let me briefly outline some of the duties and responsibilities of a 
director. In both senses of the word, directors have an obligation or 
duty to see that everything is done in accordance with the law. They 
must accept blame or liability if things are not done in accordance 
with the law, especially if someone suffers a loss or damages as a 
result.
<P>
	I could go through this in tremendous detail, but there are many 
points I want to raise. There are certainly things like the duty of 
honesty, the duty of loyalty and the duty of diligence.
<P>
	With regard to diligence, diligence involves attending meetings. 
A director is not bound to attend all meetings of the board. He or 
she ought to attend as often as possible as they may be held liable 
for transactions over which they have no knowledge.
<P>
	Directors also have a duty of diligence to rely on co-directors. 
Directors cannot shirk, I stress they cannot shirk their 
responsibilities by leaving everything to others. Directors rely on 
other directors at their own risk. Reliance on co-directors or 
officers should not be unquestioned. Reliance on other officers is 
another area. Directors who rely on officers do so at their own risk 
and should not abdicate their duties to manage the corporation.
<P>
	There is the issue of relying on outside experts. Directors are not 
expected to be experts in all fields of endeavour and must 
frequently rely on the advice of specialists. They have a 
responsibility to go beyond their own expertise to make sure that 
they can discharge their responsibilities as directors in the conduct 
of their duties.
<P>
	Dummy director is a term which is used. Being a dummy 
director, an honorary, accommodation or part time director does 
not lessen the responsibility or duty unless he is relieved by 
unanimous shareholder agreement.
<P>
	If the member for Broadview-Greenwood were in the House 
today to speak on this bill, I know he would want to talk about the 
issue of concentration of corporate power. The circle of 
corporations which have linkages among their boards, a number of 
people who are members of the same board and who seem to 
perpetuate each other and support each other is an issue that has 
concerned a lot of people.
<P>
	Dummy directors or what I refer to as marquis directors would 
receive signing bonuses and stock options simply to have their 
names associated with the business. They would have absolutely no 
interest or intent of participating in the affairs of the business. That 
is an issue which is their own responsibility. They do so at their 
own risk. But who speaks on behalf of the shareholder or the other 
stakeholders such as the banks or credit unions that lend funds, or 
the creditors who make advances to a corporation when directors 
are there not to participate and discharge those responsibilities but 
simply to have their names used for the symbolism, importance and 
the self-gratification of a board? I do not make these indictments 
lightly; they do occur.
<P>
	Moving down the list to the issue of doing nothing, inaction is no 
excuse. Even if a director has not participated in an illegal act, that 
director is not necessarily excused under the law.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1397"> 1397 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1740 )</B>
<P>
	There is the issue of seeing no evil. A director who acquires 
knowledge of an illegal act on the part of their cohort directors 
must honour their duty to the company and do whatever is 
necessary under the circumstances to correct the wrong or bring it 
to the attention of the shareholders. If a director is a marquis 
director or a dummy director how could they possibly discharge 
that responsibility?
<P>
	The duty of skill. A director need not exhibit in the performance 
of their duties a greater skill than may be reasonably expected from 
a person of their knowledge or experience. If the director is not 
there but was selected for skill or expertise but is not applying that 
skill or expertise, how can they discharge this responsibility or duty 
of skill?
<P>
	Finally there is the duty of prudence. The duty of prudence 
requires that directors use common sense.
<P>
	Having looked at those, I wanted to talk to the Minister of 
Industry and industry officials who have responsibility for the 
Canada Business Corporations Act.
<P>
	I was involved with the industry committee when it dealt with 
Bill C-12, an act to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act. 
The proposed amendment under Bill C-12 was the elimination of 
clause 16. The Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants, of 
which I am a member, has consulted with committees of this House 
on many occasions. It had a big problem with the elimination of 
clause 16.
<P>
	Clause 16 basically exempts corporations, specifically large 
federally incorporated private companies, from their obligation to 
file financial statements pursuant to their incorporating documents 
under the Canada Business Corporations Act, more often known as 
the CBCA. This was of concern to the institute because it gave an 
unfair advantage to private corporations over public corporations 
but somehow the officials of the day decided that this was okay to 
do. We looked at some of the corporations that might take 
advantage of this and why this may happen.
<P>
	Under provincial jurisdiction some jurisdictions do not require 
filing of financial statements nor the appointment of auditors. This 
was of concern to the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants 
simply because its members are in the business of auditing and they 
wanted to protect the integrity of their industry as well and I do not 
blame them for doing that. More important, by not filing financial 
statements there was an unfair advantage extended to private 
companies over public companies.
<P>
	What does that mean in real life? It means that a corporation 
such as Wal-Mart comes to Canada, takes over a major chain and 
makes a big play in Canada for their organization. Where does it 
incorporate? It incorporates in New Brunswick. Why? Because the 
New  Brunswick corporations act does not require the filing of 
corporate statements for private companies.
<P>
	Clearly this was a situation where the federal jurisdiction, the 
CBCA, was not getting its share of incorporations. A company that 
incorporates in New Brunswick can operate right across Canada. 
There is no restriction on that. It does not have to incorporate in 
each and every province. There are some differences in the 
jurisdictional reporting requirements but Wal-Mart operates right 
across Canada but is incorporated in New Brunswick.
<P>
	I raise this as an example of the kind of thinking that is going on 
with some of the department officials in industry. I want to raise it 
because I think that the same kind of thinking is occurring with 
regard to presently considered amendments to the Canada Business 
Corporations Act.
<P>
	I did receive a letter on behalf of the Ministry of Industry. I had 
raised some questions and some answers came back, but for me 
more questions were raised.
<P>
	My Bill C-204 would be the first in Canadian history with this 
requirement to have a limit on the number of directorships that 
someone could hold concurrently. It does not exist anywhere in any 
of the other provincial jurisdictions. It would be a first. That does 
not cause me any problem. If it is the right thing to do, it should be 
done.
<P>
	The second point raised was that the Canada Business 
Corporations Act presupposes that corporations and their investors, 
many of whom are now large institutions, are capable of 
determining the appropriate qualifications which their directors 
should have. That is absolutely true. They do. They have the ability 
to determine whether or not a director is appropriate for their board 
but it depends on what the objectives are.
<P>
<B>(1745 )</B>
<P>
	If the objective of a corporation is to attract a marquis director to 
enhance or ingratiate its board of directors in the eyes of the public, 
it can do it, but who is it representing? I say it is representing the 
board members and the officers of the corporation for its 
self-interest. Where is it in the interests of the ordinary 
shareholder? Where is it in the interests of the stakeholders who 
extend credit and financing? Where is it in the interests of those 
who compete where there may be conflicts of interest unforeseen 
or undetected at the time?
<P>
	The issue of self-regulation and let us not have rules any more 
concerns me. There is a major review going on now within the 
Department of Industry, and the Senate finance and banking 
committee is starting to look at some of the rules and regulations 
because director liability is a serious issue. As I outlined some of 
the reasons why a director should have certain diligence, due care, 
honesty, et cetera, they are there for a reason. This is the standard 
that has been established.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1398"> 1398 </A></B>
<P>
	I see the move now within the corporate community, the 
corporate governance community and within the Senate banking 
and finance committee to somehow soften or fuzzy up those 
responsibilities to make it much easier for more people to become 
dummy directors. I do not know that, but if the standards are not 
imposed, if we do not have good, firm rules on the responsibilities 
of corporate directors, what assurances can stakeholders, 
shareholders, investors, et cetera have that their interests are being 
protected every time something happens within that corporation?
<P>
	Let me raise an example. Confederation Life is a major financial 
institution with major problems. It will take years to sort that out. 
Every member in this Chamber has received communications from 
employees of Bell Canada with regard to their retirement plans. We 
received the story and allegations that there was board 
representation on Confederation Life by officers of Bell Canada 
and that the retirement plans were amended to move or shift a 
portion of the investment of funds from one institution into 
Confederation Life, apparently at the time when there was a Bell 
officer on the board.
<P>
	Now that Confederation Life has lost a great deal of money and a 
great deal of loss is now being extended or shared among all of 
those stakeholders who are now the employees, they are coming to 
members of Parliament saying: ``Please help us. We went on good 
faith that the board of directors, and particularly an officer of our 
company who was a member of the board of Confederation Life at 
the time, would have taken care of our interests, but he did not. So 
we want Bell Canada to keep us whole''.
<P>
	I have no direct knowledge of the details and the facts here and I 
do not for a moment suggest there were any improprieties on behalf 
of anybody. However, I raise it as a concrete example of the kinds 
of things we have to be vigilant on. It means we have to depend on 
boards of directors to do the right thing at the right time and to be 
there when we really need them.
<P>
	We do not have to look to the experience in Canada and say that 
we have never had a problem and therefore we do not need rules. 
That is not the issue. We need rules to make sure there are no 
problems and that is the point.
<P>
	Is this an important issue? Of course it is. There is an 
organization called the Canadian Comprehensive Auditing 
Foundation which now has an active task force looking into 
governance issues of public and private bodies. The Auditor 
General of Canada is a member of that task force for one reason 
and one reason only: The whole issue of the governance and the 
control of our corporations and public and private bodies is of 
serious concern. There are risks that have been identified which 
must be addressed.
<P>
	I do not accept for a moment the premise of the industry officials 
that corporations should be self-regulating, that we should let them 
do their own  thing and they do so at their own peril. I do not 
believe those corporations in each and every instance are always 
thinking about their shareholders. They are not always thinking 
about their creditors. They are not always thinking about the 
employees whose jobs would be lost if they went belly up. From 
time to time issues arise, such as: Who is the director this time and 
can we get this guy to make us look good? These are the kinds of 
things I think Canadians want to ask.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Is there another indication that this is of interest and importance 
to Canadian business and those who are involved? The Canadian 
Institute of Chartered Accountants in December 1995 prepared a 
document called <I>Guidance for Directors-Governance Processes 
for Control</I>.
<P>
	Basically the forward and the purpose of this document, in 
addition to looking at corporate management, was to assess the 
board's effectiveness on deals and on how well the board assessed 
and discharged its role and responsibilities as part of the 
organization's overall control.
<P>
	I have looked through the document and I have studied it to some 
extent. It refers to issues such as the formulating of policies for 
selected candidates for directorship, reviewing the qualifications of 
candidates and assessing the performance of the board and 
eventually the individual directors often assigned to a committee, 
such as a nominating committee or governance committee.
<P>
	Even in this document the Canadian Institute of Chartered 
Accountants has raised some interesting issues. They have also 
mentioned the values and the ethical values of the corporation and 
whether it was unclear or perhaps inappropriate that somebody 
should be on a board. They wanted to deal with issues for the 
individual director, whether that director had the information, the 
ability or the forthright manner that they needed. They dealt with 
the qualifications of a board.
<P>
	In conclusion, how can these be relevant to a dummy director, to 
a marquis director? Conflict of interest is really the issue here. This 
bill basically proposes the number of directorships one can 
concurrently hold, which I suggest would be approximately 10, 
given the number of times the average board meets and given the 
number of other responsibilities and preparatory time necessary.
<P>
	This bill however does not extend to corporations where 
someone holds a vested interest in excess of 5 per cent. If it is their 
own corporation or they have a major stake in it, I am not 
interested. It is those where people are directors of corporations in 
which they have no vested equity interest to speak of, where they 
are in fact simply dummy directors.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1399"> 1399 </A></B>
<P>
	On that note I would simply like to say that although this is 
not a votable bill, I hope I have raised some questions with 
members in this House with regard to the issue of corporate 
directorships and whether or not those responsibilities are being 
discharged and protected under the Canada Business Corporations 
Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, BQ):</B> 
Madam Speaker, since it is the first time that I rise in this House 
while you are in the Chair, let me congratulate you on your 
appointment.
<P>
	I am pleased to speak today to Bill C-204, which was introduced 
by my colleague opposite, the hon. member for Mississauga-South. 
My colleague began his speech by telling us that he decided to 
propose this amendment to the bill because he had met a senator 
who was apparently sitting on 26 boards of directors. My colleague 
inferred that the senator probably wanted to enhance his reputation, 
but perhaps there are other premises that are just as valid. Given the 
nature of a senator's work, he had ample time to sit on 26 boards of 
directors.
<P>
	The purpose of the bill introduced by my colleague, an act to 
amend the Canada Business Corporations Act, is to prohibit any 
person from holding a directorship in more than 10 companies in 
which the person holds less than 5 per cent of the voting shares. My 
colleague seems to base his bill on the premise that a person who is 
a director in more than 10 companies cannot properly carry out his 
mandate.
<P>
	True, as my colleague pointed out, company directors have a 
number of responsibilities that are very important and very serious. 
They are required by law to assume many of these responsibilities 
and to perform very specific duties.
<P>
	My colleague who introduced this bill is asking the following 
question: At what point can a director or administrator no longer 
properly fulfil his responsibilities?
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	He seems to think that one can no longer properly fulfil one's 
responsibilities if one holds a directorship in more than 10 
companies. I do not know on what basis the hon. member can make 
that claim. Why would a director of 9 companies be able to perform 
his duties, but not a director of 12 companies? That question 
remains unanswered.
<P>
	When someone is mandated by shareholders to sit on the board 
of directors of a business corporation, he is required by law to meet 
certain obligations. He has a duty to do so. He must look after the 
interests of the company, as he would after those of his own family. 
By law, he is accountable to shareholders for his actions.
<P>
	A director may be held personally responsible if, for example, he 
misuses or embezzles company funds or if he makes the company 
insolvent.
<P>
	The director must be honest, loyal, careful and diligent. Of 
course, his personal interests must not conflict with those of the 
company he administers. It goes without saying that he must attend 
meetings of the board of directors. I will not start listing everything 
a director must do or not do. I think everybody here has a pretty 
good general idea.
<P>
	Frankly, I really do not see the use of my hon. colleague's bill. 
Why propose to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act by 
amending only one section, namely section 105, by adding a detail 
that, as far as I am concerned, is basically useless? Why prevent 
someone from being a director of more than ten corporations? The 
same person can sit on the board of directors of 13 corporations and 
do a very fine job, the same way that another individual could be a 
director of a single corporation and fail in his duties and 
responsibilities. It all depends. Some people can handle it, others 
not.
<P>
	The directors of a corporation are responsible and accountable to 
the shareholders. If the shareholders are dissatisfied, all they have 
to do is to remove them from office by a vote of non-confidence.
<P>
	The Canada Business Corporations Act is also quite clear on 
that. A director who commits an illegal act or who works against 
the interests of the company is liable to very harsh penalties and 
fines. It is definitely not in his best interests to break the law or to 
commit acts for which he would be held accountable.
<P>
	Any reasonable person who is sound of mind-maybe some are 
not-knows what he is able to do and accomplish. A director 
knows the duties and responsibilities related to his directorship. It 
would not be in his best interests to fail in his duties, because he 
knows what the consequences would be. So, I say: Why would he 
take a chance and sit on several boards if he knows that he not able 
to do the job?
<P>
	Let me show you that the arguments used by the hon. member in 
his memo to support his bill are far from justifying the inclusion of 
his proposed amendment in the Canada Business Corporations Act.
<P>
	First, the member says:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``A director is not bound to attend all meetings of the board. He 
ought to attend as often as possible as he may be held liable for 
transactions of which he has no knowledge''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	An occasion will undoubtedly arise when a director is unable to 
attend a meeting of the board of directors. However, in any 
reasonably well organized company, an agenda and minutes are 
distributed to directors.  Normally, when someone takes a decision 
involving a company, those responsible are informed. I dare say 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1400"> 1400 </A></B>
<P>
that anyone unable to attend such a meeting would have the sense 
to ask his colleagues what was said or done. Directors of 
companies are aware of that.
<P>
	The second argument put forward by my colleague is the 
following:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``A director cannot shirk his responsibilities by leaving 
everything to others. He relies on other directors at his own risk. 
The reliance on his co-directors and officers should not be 
unquestioning''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	When you sit on a board of directors, you are part of a team. A 
director must trust his colleagues. Otherwise, the entire team 
suffers.
<P>
<B>(1800)</B>
<P>
	Imagine what it would be like if the directors did not trust each 
other? Imagine the acrimonious atmosphere. If board members do 
not agree, the company or corporation will suffer, and this will lead 
to shareholder dissatisfaction. The shareholders can then dissolve 
the board of directors. It is therefore not in the best interests of a 
director to start off by doubting his fellow directors.
<P>
	Another argument used by my colleague is the following:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Directors rely on officers at their own risk and should not 
abdicate their duties to manage the corporation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Usually, the board of directors makes the decisions on the 
company, and the executive directors or the operational managers 
effect them on site. The executive director, who looks after the day 
to day running of the company, sits on the board of directors and 
must report on company activities to the directors.
<P>
	Usually someone whom everyone trusts is chosen to head the 
company. If there are risks involved in relying on the executive 
director, they are normal risks. People can be dishonest; but that 
can happen any time and any place. It is impossible to know 
whether a person is honest at the start. My colleague's argument 
does not hold.
<P>
	I could go on at length like this, but it would serve no purpose. 
None of my colleague's arguments has convinced me of the 
absolute need to amend the law as he proposes.
<P>
	I will read you the recommendation that led him to propose this 
bill, which begins as follows:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In an effort to protect and/or emphasize the importance of 
director's duties and responsibilities, to  minimize the potential for 
conflict of interest, to protect investors, companies and employees, 
that no person may be director of more than 10 corporations in 
which the person holds less than 5 per cent of the voting shares.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The duties and responsibilities of directors are clearly defined in 
the Canada Business Corporations Act. People who hold 
directorships know very well what their duties and responsibilities 
are. They know what are the consequences of their actions or lack 
of action because this is also provided in the legislation.
<P>
	I completely fail to see how Bill C-204 will reduce conflicts of 
interest within a company. Unfortunately, there will always be 
conflicts of interest. My colleague from Mississauga-South made a 
worthwhile effort and analyzed the situation carefully before 
putting this bill forward. I am convinced he spent a lot of time on 
this, but I must say I do not see the use of amending the Canada 
Business Corporations Act in a way that would basically have no 
positive impact.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to address Bill C-204 presented by the member for Mississauga 
South. I find myself in considerable agreement with my colleague 
from the Bloc and in dubious understanding of what Bill C-204 is 
actually intended to achieve.
<P>
	On one hand it seems the member is more preoccupied with 
whether directors exercise the responsibilities they have been 
elected to carry out and whether they are responsible and acting in a 
manner that is consistent with what is entrusted to them rather than 
on whether they are competent.
<P>
	There is a fundamental difference between doing what one is 
supposed to be doing and what is expected of that person, rather 
than if the person does not do those things, it is a function of the 
person's having too many directorships. That does not follow.
<P>
	This bill adds a tiny detail to section 105 that says if somebody is 
a director of 10 companies in which they own less than 5 per cent of 
the shares, that person cannot be appointed to an additional 
directorship.
<P>
	It seems the current act is clear. It lists the things that disqualify 
a director. One is anyone under age 18. That is reasonable. If they 
are to manage millions of dollars in some cases, they should be at 
least of voting age.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	Second, anyone who is of unsound mind and who has been so 
found by a court in Canada or elsewhere. Obviously we would want 
a director to have a sound mind. Third, a person who is not an 
individual cannot sit. I am not sure what that means but 
nevertheless that is what it says here.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1401"> 1401 </A></B>
<P>
	It says that anyone shall not be disqualified if he has no shares 
in a particular company. In other words, a director can be 
appointed, according to the act, who has no shares in a particular 
corporation. He is appointed to a particular corporation or to a 
board of directors because he is judged by someone to have the 
competence or the ability to do the job.
<P>
	We need to look at some of the duties a director is supposed to 
carry out. I think these are rather significant duties. They are not 
many but they are onerous in terms of carrying them out.
<P>
	``Every director and officer of a corporation in exercising his 
power and discharging his duties shall act honestly, in good faith 
and with a view to the best interests of the corporation; and 
exercise the care, diligence and skill that a reasonably prudent 
person would exercise in comparable circumstances. Every 
director and officer of a corporation shall comply with this act, the 
regulations, articles, bylaws and any unanimous shareholder 
agreement''.
<P>
	It is very clear what a director shall do. A director shall act 
honestly, prudently and shall exercise the appropriate skill a 
prudent person would exercise in a similar situation.
<P>
	Can one person do those kinds of things for more than one 
corporation or one company? Of course he can, especially if the 
series of companies is small. Someone can be a director of a variety 
of companies because the role and function of a board of directors 
is not necessarily to manage a company. Its role and primary 
function is that of determining direction, the overall policy that 
shall give to that particular corporation its meaning, its raison 
d'être, and its mission in the kinds of things it wants to perform in 
that society or in that particular community.
<P>
	What is the situation if a corporation is large? Let us take a 
company that we all know, a corporation that is rather mammoth in 
Canada, Canadian Pacific. This is a major corporation. I remember 
so clearly that this corporation was supposed to have an evaluation 
placed on it. A lot of people said what is the word of Canadian 
Pacific?
<P>
	About 10 years ago a group of chartered accountants was 
designated to ask this question and determine the value. It took five 
years to actually go through all of the books, the assets and 
liabilities to determine the net value of Canadian Pacific Railway.
<P>
	The things it discovered in the first five years had no value after 
five years because they were dated. They were either of greater 
value or lessor value depending on what happened in spending and 
what happened in the economy. It came to the conclusion that it 
was really a judgment call as to the real value.
<P>
	How can one director, even if he is only a director of Canadian 
Pacific, determine in detail what is happening in that corporation? 
He cannot, obviously.
<P>
	This act makes it very clear that these kinds of things have to be 
delegated. The hon. member knows this full well. He said we 
wanted as professional accountants to conduct audits so that we can 
give true direction and meaning to a particular corporation.
<P>
	That was made very clear in the provisions of the existing act. A 
board of directors is not liable. A director is not liable under 
sections 118, 119 or 122 if he relies in good faith on financial 
statements of the corporation represented to him by an officer of 
the corporation or in a written report of the auditor or the 
corporation fairly to reflect the financial condition of the 
corporation, or a report of a lawyer, accountant, engineer, appraiser 
or other person whose profession lends credibility to a statement 
made by him.
<P>
<B>(1810 )</B>
<P>
	It is pretty clear that a board of directors that listens to the advice 
of its professional people is probably acting more prudently, more 
responsibly, more honestly, more in the interests of the corporation 
than a director who assumes all that responsibility and says: ``I 
know because I have the duty to exercise prudence and to exercise 
honesty''. It would not be honest for a director to take the position 
of knowing everything that goes on in a corporation. If he is really 
to do the job he is to rely on the professionals who know what is 
happening and whose job it is to come to him with information he 
can evaluate.
<P>
	They have to be competent in order to do that. The act tells us 
very clearly that is precisely what is expected of a board of 
directors. The implication that somehow the director should do this 
is simply misleading.
<P>
	The suggestion made is that somehow an individual who owns 5 
per cent or more of the stock of a particular company could have an 
unlimited number of directorships. The only determining factor 
seems to be owning less than 5 per cent. There seems to be a 
connection between the ability to direct and the amount of shares or 
ownership a person has in a particular company.
<P>
	That is ludicrous. It does not make any sense. I do not think the 
amount of shares a person owns in a company will make them any 
more or any less competent. There is a pecuniary interest. There 
may be a vested interest. However, that does not make a person 
competent to make good decisions. It is a completely different 
issue. We need to recognize those kinds of differences.
<P>
	There was also a point made about liability, that a director can be 
held liable. He should be. If a director is not exercising the 
responsibilities accorded to him, if he is not delivering on the 
duties extended to him by the corporation or by the act, he should 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="1402"> 1402 </A></B>
<P>
be held liable.  However, he cannot be held liable if he is getting the 
best advice, as he knows it and understands it, and then makes 
decisions.
<P>
	Does that mean he will always get the right advice? No. Does it 
mean he will always make the right decisions? No. Does it mean he 
can make a mistake in the sense that acting on the best advice 
available to him he still made a mistake? Yes.
<P>
	The responsibility is whether he acted in the best interests of the 
corporation, as he saw it, on the best advice available. If that is the 
case, it does not matter how many directorships he has.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Minister for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities 
Agency and Minister of Western Economic Diversification, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to respond to Bill C-204 today, an 
act to amend the Canada Business Corporations Act.
<P>
	The hon. member for Mississauga South has presented this 
private member's bill to prohibit any person from being a director 
of more than 10 federally incorporated business corporations in 
which such person holds less than 5 per cent of the voting stock.
<P>
	I appreciate the ideals that motivated the hon. member. Investors 
in federally incorporated companies want to be assured that 
directors are doing their duty.
<P>
	No matter how effective and dedicated a person might be, there 
is a limit to how much energy or attention an individual can give to 
an enterprise when there are too many responsibilities conflicting 
for a director's time. The hon. member for Mississauga South 
believes that a director is unlikely to satisfy adequately the duties 
and obligations of more than 10 directorships.
<P>
	The hon. member wants to address these concerns through 
legislation. This law would prohibit a director from holding more 
than 10 directorships for which he holds less than 5 per cent of the 
stock. Moreover, it would impose heavy fines, up to $25,000 for 
the first breach of the law and up to $50,000 for the second offence.
<P>
	I have two major concerns about this legislation. First, is 
legislation the route to go in trying to create a corporate governance 
system that discourages directors from assuming more 
responsibilities than they could reasonably be expected to handle? 
Second, is the hon. member's bill the appropriate vehicle and is this 
the appropriate time to raise this issue?
<P>
	Let me deal with both of these concerns. First, should we 
legislate how many directorships an individual can hold? This 
would be a first in Canadian corporate law. No other Canadian 
jurisdiction directly limits the number of directorships that an 
individual may hold so this is a question that should not be taken 
lightly. None of the provinces has seen fit to limit the number of  
directorships. Provinces may also be concerned about the ability of 
directors to attend to their responsibilities if they are overloaded 
with work because they have taken on too much.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	Instead, they have allowed the same approach that the Canada 
Business Corporations Act has taken. The CBCA favours a 
self-enforcement approach to corporate governance. The 
philosophy behind the act is that corporations and their investors 
are in a better position than legislators to determine the appropriate 
qualifications which their directors should have.
<P>
	I think this is sound. Corporate governance laws provide a 
foundation through which management directors, investors and 
creditors can have confidence that the system works fairly and 
openly.
<P>
	I am not alone in believing that it would be inappropriate to 
legislate limits to the number of directorships an individual can 
hold. In December 1994 the Toronto Stock Exchange committee on 
corporate governance in Canada issued its report entitled Where 
Were the Directors. The report emphasizes that not only must 
corporate governance be enhanced but it must be perceived by the 
public to be enhanced and it offered a number of recommendations 
for assessing existing directors and identifying, recruiting, 
nominating, appointing and orienting new directors.
<P>
	According to this report, how should directors be chosen? It 
recommends that the board of every corporation appoint a 
committee of directors composed exclusively of outside directors, 
the majority of whom are unrelated directors. This committee 
would then be given the responsibility for proposing new nominees 
to the board and for assessing directors on an ongoing basis. The 
actual decision on who should be nominated would then be the 
responsibility of the full board after considering the 
recommendations of the nominating committee.
<P>
	This view appears to be widely held. The committee included 
not only representatives from the business community but also 
from institutional investors, the academic community and other 
groups interested in corporate governance. In other words, the 
private sector should put in place a careful process for choosing 
board members.
<P>
	The Toronto Stock Exchange has implemented the report's 
guidelines for disclosure of corporate governance practices as a 
listing requirement.
<P>
	In compiling this report of the TSE, the authors received 
suggestions that a guideline be adopted limiting the number of 
board appointments an individual can hold. This is what the authors 
had to say on the issue: ``While we agree there must be a limit to 
the number of appointments, we have concluded that a specific 
guideline is unnecessary. The nominating committee in  assessing 
the suitability of an individual to be elected to a board will take into 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1403"> 1403 </A></B>
<P>
account the individual's other commitments, resources and time 
available for input to the board''.
<P>
	If the TSE reports shies away from issuing guidelines on this 
topic, I think it would be very inappropriate for this House to take 
the much more draconian step of enacting legislation. Let the 
corporation decide what is most appropriate. A legislated rule 
limiting the number of directorships would be arbitrary. Why do 
we set the limit at 10 directorships? Why not 5 or 15? How are we 
in this House to decide what is the appropriate number? It is a 
matter best left to those who choose the members of their 
individual boards.
<P>
	Let me now turn to my second concern regarding this legislation. 
Is Bill C-204 the appropriate vehicle and is this the appropriate 
time to raise this issue? As the House is aware, the government is 
now in the process of undertaking a wide ranging review of the 
Canada Business Corporations Act. We saw technical changes 
implemented in the last session of Parliament through Bill C-12. 
The Minister of Industry told us at that time those changes were but 
the first phase of a process that would reform the CBCA for the 
first time in 20 years.
<P>
	In preparing for phase 2 of the reform the government has 
consulted extensively with all elements of the business community, 
shareholders, managers, board members and corporate counsels to 
determine what needs to be changed and how it should be changed.
<P>
<B>(1820 )</B>
<P>
	These consultations have taken several forms. First, Industry 
Canada began in 1994 to meet business people, investors and 
corporate counsel across Canada. These were preliminary 
consultations. From the input Industry Canada received, it could 
begin to focus on those areas thought by the business community to 
be in most need of reform.
<P>
	As a result of these preliminary consultations, nine discussion 
papers were prepared, examining in considerable detail the issues 
of the CBCA that were considered to be priorities. These included 
directors' liability, insider trading, shareholder communication, 
takeover bids, financial assistance to directors and officers, 
directors' residency requirements, unanimous shareholder 
agreements, going private, transactions and technical amendments.
<P>
	I would have to advise the House, however, that the issue of 
excessive numbers of directorships was not raised as a concern.
<P>
	Industry Canada has received a number of responses to the 
suggested reforms contained in these discussion papers. The 
department plans to consult with clients once again to discuss the 
papers in detail. The responses will help the government prepare 
the amendments to the CBCA.
<P>
	I would remind the House that Bill C-12 requires the Minister of 
Industry to submit recommendations on further, more substantive 
changes to the law to Parliament by June 1997.
<P>
	Meanwhile, there has been another process of consultation to 
help focus on the areas where we must reform corporate 
governance in this country. Members of the Senate committee on 
banking, trade and commerce recently conducted hearings across 
the country on ways to reform corporate governance laws and are 
currently preparing a report. Senator Michael Kirby's committee 
has met with chief executive officers or chairpersons, board 
members and investors. These senior representatives of the 
business community have been asked to discuss corporate 
governance issues in general and to respond to key strategic 
questions on the issues under consideration by Industry Canada.
<P>
	The other place is performing a valuable service in using the 
skills and knowledge of the senators to help explore the options 
available to the government in its reform of corporate governance. 
This is an excellent example of how this House and the other place 
can work together for a more efficient legislative process.
<P>
	The result will be legislation that the Minister of Industry will 
table some time next year. At that time a committee of this House 
will be able to study the legislation carefully and make its 
recommendations for amendments. In other words, we have a very 
thorough process already in place to provide a detailed assessment 
of the issue that the hon. member from Mississauga South raises in 
this legislation.
<P>
	The question of whether there should be limits placed on the 
number of directorates an individual can hold is a suitable topic for 
discussion, for Industry Canada's consultations, the inquiries by 
the other place and eventually by the Standing Committee on 
industry.
<P>
	I am confident that the issue will receive the attention it 
deserves. However, I do not think this is the appropriate time to 
pass a law that would run counter to the corporate governance 
practices in other jurisdictions.
<P>
	Let the hon. member for Mississauga South bring his concerns to 
the other forums I have mentioned but I do not believe that this 
House should support this bill.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Since no further member wishes to speak, 
the hon. member for Mississauga South may sum up and close the 
debate. Normally there would be two or three minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Szabo:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all hon. members who 
participated in the debate. It is very important that issues and 
questions are raised in this place even if there is not a clear 
understanding of some of the specific points.
<P>
	However, I would like to address a couple of points that were 
raised by members. First, a question was raised  about the magic of 
<P>

<B><A NAME="1404"> 1404 </A></B>
<P>
5 per cent. If somebody held more than 5 per cent equity interest, 
this would be exempt from the number of companies.
<P>
	Members will know that the issue of a threshold, whether it is 5, 
10, 15 or 20 per cent is not substantive to the bill. The issue is that 
there must be a point at which one would have sufficient equity 
interest and that would be subject to amendment. Therefore, it is 
inconsequential. There is no meaning to 5 per cent. Although on the 
recommendation of the private members' office, this is consistent 
with the kind of threshold which has been set for similar bills 
where there is some involvement. It came as a recommendations 
from the House of Commons private members' staff.
<P>
<B>(1825 )</B>
<P>
	The second issue was why limit the number of directors to 10 
companies? Again 10 is just a number. It could be 15, it could be 
20, it could be 100. One thing we can be sure of is that the number 
cannot be 1,000. Nobody in this place would agree anybody could 
discharge the responsibilities of a member of the board of directors 
of 1,000 different corporations in which he did not a hold a 5 per 
cent or greater interest. If that is the case, the premise of my bill is 
absolutely correct.
<P>
	There must be a limit at which one cannot discharge even one's 
most fundamental responsibilities. If hon. members, the members 
of the industry committee and the parliamentary secretary from 
Saskatoon-Dundurn who spoke so very well, have a problem with 
the number, let us propose a number. We now know it is somewhere 
between 5 and 1,000. It is subject to amendment.
<P>
	A good portion of the argument raised by the parliamentary 
secretary was why is a member raising this issue now because we 
are in the midst of all this other work. The member is absolutely 
right. I am here at the wrong time.
<P>
	I do not have control over when my private member's bill gets 
elected in the lottery and goes on the Order Paper. It has been there 
for almost two years. It finally came to the top. I have to take the 
time when I get it. I understand the point raised by the member but 
it is beyond my control. I certainly do intend to raise it.
<P>
	I remind hon. members there is a major major case before the 
Canadian people, before the department of financial institutions, 
which has to do with Confederation Life. I have been advised that 
there is now a lawsuit against a director in the amount of $1 billion. 
This is a very serious issue. It will no doubt be the subject matter of 
study, analysis and assessment for many years to come.
<P>
	I will repeat what I said concerning why this bill came up. I was 
in attendance at a dinner of the Mississauga Board of Trade. The 
guest speaker was from the other place. That senator was 
introduced as a very busy senator of Canada, as the chairman and 
CEO of one of Canada's  largest and most prestigious firms and 
also the director of 26 different corporations, all at the same time.
<P>
	When I heard that introduction, although I was impressed, my 
first reaction was how could one individual who had a senate job, a 
chairman and CEO job, also discharge all of those responsibilities
<P>
that everybody is studying because they are so serious? It is a 
rhetorical question. I do not know whether there is an answer, but it 
strikes me as odd when even the parliamentary secretary admits 
that after nine discussion papers, after consultations with business 
people, investors, corporate councils and everybody else, this issue 
has not yet been raised.
<P>
	It gives me great pleasure to have raised this issue for the first 
time in Bill C-204.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, the hour provided for the 
consideration of private members' business has now expired. This 
item is dropped from the Order Paper.
