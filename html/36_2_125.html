<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>THE LATE RIGHT HON. PIERRE ELLIOTT TRUDEAU 
</H3><P align=left>

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> This is a sad day for us as parliamentarians and as 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK2"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Pierre Trudeau was a man like no other: a man of brilliance and 
learning, a man of action, a man of grace and style, a man of 
wit and playfulness, a man of extraordinary courage, and a complex 
man, whose love of Canada was pure and simple. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau wrote about “a man who never learned patriotism 
in school but who acquired that virtue when he felt in his 
bones the vastness of his land and the greatness of its 
founders”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre, too, came to love this land as he climbed the mountain 
peaks, conquered the rapids of its rivers and wandered the 
streets of its cities:  Whistler and Mont-Tremblant, the Nahanni 
and the St. Lawrence, Yonge Street, et la rue St-Denis. These 
Canadian places he felt in his bones and knew in his heart. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once he told me that after reading the great novel <I>Maria 
Chapdelaine</I>, he wanted to follow the journey of François 
Paradis.  He departed from La Tuque.  Alone, he travelled the 
northern forest of La Mauricie to Lac Saint Jean.  This shows 
how much he loved the story and the soil of his country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau was a colleague, a mentor and a friend.  He set 
in motion forces of change that are still shaping the soul of a 
people and a nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau's motto was reason over passion, but it was 
his passion for Canada that defined him.  It was his dream of a 
just society that captured the imagination of the country and 
made the entire world sit up and take notice, that inspired so 
many young people to public service, that forever changed an 
entire generation of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau was an architect of the Quiet Revolution and the 
modern Quebec.  He also dreamed of a modern Canada, and he made 
that dream come true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He came to the House of Commons to build a country in which 
French speaking Canadians have their rightful place, from sea to 
sea: a Canada of two official languages: a Canada that 
celebrates diversity; a compassionate Canada, that affords all 
of its citizens an equal opportunity to succeed in life, 
whatever their background or beliefs, whether rich or poor; a 
Canada that is active in the world, engaged in the cause of 
freedom, peace and justice; a champion of developing countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His political legacy is enormous, and the centrepiece, the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, made him most proud 
and allowed me, as Minister of Justice at the time, the 
opportunity to have many very personal discussions with him on a 
subject that fired his passions. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau was a giant of our time and a great Canadian. 
Today Canadians share the grief of his family.  We prayed with 
them during during those sad says after Michel died and during 
Pierre's final illness.  Now that magnificent eloquent voice is 
silent, but his deeds and thoughts will last as long as people 
cherish courage, commitment and Canada, the country he so loved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre, you made us young, you made us proud and you made us 
dream. 
Thank you, dear friend, and farewell.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day (Leader of the Opposition, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I wish to tell the members of the Trudeau family that 
they are in our hearts and in our prayers, and to extend our 
condolences to them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to express our thanks to Mr. Trudeau's family for 
sharing a father and a husband with us and with the nation 
during his lifetime and now as we mourn his death. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through you Mr. Speaker, to the Prime Minister, I recognize the 
friendship and the long years in which you have spent with your 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could stand and attempt to give a list of the historical 
achievements of Mr. Trudeau but there are historians who will do 
that far better than I could.  I could stand and attempt to give 
a list of his policies but there are policy makers who will do 
far better than I could.  Of those policies there were many with 
which I agreed and many which the record will show I did not. 
I could stand and attempt to do comparisons between Mr. Trudeau 
and other elected people but he is a man who defies comparison, 
and I will not try to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to give a simple reflection on the impact he had on 
my life, and I think on the life of a generation.  I was 17 years 
old and involved in my first federal political election as a 
volunteer, but not with the party represented by our present 
Prime Minister, I say with great respect.  The strategists were 
saying many things.  I looked at this person on the political 
scene, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, and I said to the older 
strategists “We are not going to beat this guy”. There was 
something that shone through, that grabbed a generation of which 
I was a part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that generation there were many of us who were protesting the 
things that were.  I think at times, and being honest, we 
protested because we enjoyed the protest more than the hope of 
actually achieving a goal.  We were searching for truth and yet 
at times I think we were enjoying the search more than the 
thought of finding the truth itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days, when Pierre Elliott Trudeau was embarking upon 
the scene, there were many in my generation who were flirting 
with the thought of totally disbanding hope for the institutions 
of the day and possibly democracy itself.  We saw that manifested 
throughout a continent and around the world.  Many of us were 
flirting with dangerous approaches to the very things that had 
built strength in our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was at that moment for us in our generation of greatest 
danger, a time of crisis in our country, in which we saw for the 
first time as Canadians turmoil and crisis like we had never 
seen before.  It was Pierre Elliott Trudeau who stood and faced 
that.  In a way, in his standing and in his facing that, as he 
did on so many issues, he grabbed a generation of us and brought 
us to the precipice.  In his way he invited us to look into the 
abyss of anarchy.  We stared into the face of the results of 
anarchy and we did not like what we saw.  In his way he was 
saying to us, to that generation, “join me now in standing 
against what is wrong and standing for what is right”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us were profoundly influenced by that and realized that 
the institutions of our society were in fact the very 
institutions that would bring the peace, the hope and the truth 
that we were looking for.  Imperfect as those institutions are, 
as Winston Churchill and others have commented, they are far 
better than any alternative.

<A HREF="#LINKT2"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through his life he continued to challenge us to be people who 
would stand and speak with courage on the things in which we 
believed.  He did that.  He went through his winters, he went 
through his summertimes and he went through his springtimes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know what a winter of unpopularity can be and even in 
those times he stood firmly knowing what was right.  He let the 
seasons pass and he let them come.  We need to thank him for his 
courage, for his love for this country which no one can debate, 
for his commitment and service and for his love for his family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close my remarks as I opened them, with thoughts to his family 
today.  To those of us who have children—I have three sons—we 
know that the life of politics can be important to us, but when 
it all comes down to it, it is about the ones we love and the 
ones who love us.  Our thoughts are with them today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I honour those who wear the rose today as a sign of respect and 
a trademark.  I never knew him and I do not feel that closeness. 
However, please allow me a slight breach of protocol as I present 
a rose to a page to take and place before the portrait of Mr. 
Trudeau.  His family members have seen the seasons, and this is a 
time of sadness.  I will quote the words of a song: “Just 
remember in the winter far beneath those bitter snows lies the 
seed that with the sun's love in the spring becomes the rose”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Trudeau has brought the rose to us and Mr. Trudeau makes us 
realize that this country is worth loving, is worth fighting for 
and is worth standing for.  We present this to his family members 
today.  Our hearts are with them.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
his passing yesterday, Pierre Elliott Trudeau has left us with 
an indelible impression. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he could never imagine the day would come when the 
leader of a sovereignist political party would rise in the House 
to add his contribution to those of all the parliamentarians who 
are paying tribute to his memory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tribute to Pierre Elliott Trudeau is a tribute to a man 
admired by many across Canada and throughout the world for 
his intelligence, envied for his impressive calibre, and 
recognized for his great strength of character. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mere fact that we are all here today in this Chamber to 
underscore his public contribution, while newspapers all across 
Canada are also paying tribute to him, marks the importance of 
this great public figure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The former Prime Minister, whose frank and direct manner 
captured the Canadian imagination, would certainly not fault me 
for my honesty.  For those who, like me, promote the sovereignty 
project for Quebec, Mr. Trudeau represented a major adversary. 
An adversary for two reasons: as a great intellectual and 
brilliant orator, he defended his profound convictions with 
passion and intelligence.  An adversary as well because he 
championed a certain concept of Canada which we could not 
accept, nor do we to this day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Elliott Trudeau was an idealist driven by a political 
vision, a vision of Canada.  It was around that concept of what 
his country ought to become that he built his political career. 
That concept changed Quebec-Canada relations forever.  The 
determination of Pierre Elliott Trudeau changed not just 
mentalities, but Canadian institutions as well, by forcing 
constitutional changes that reflected his convictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His heritage is not merely a constitutional one, however. 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau impacted heavily on what our societies, 
both Quebec and Canadian, have become.  His influence has been a 
determining factor in the way we perceive ourselves today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He modernized Canadian law. He led Canadians on the road to a 
modern day state which reflected the evolution of our societies. 
No one will forget the impact he had when, as Minister of 
Justice, he introduced what is still known, more than 30 years 
later, as the omnibus bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After he became Prime Minister, he pushed for the adoption of 
the charter of rights and freedoms, which is the foundation of 
any fair, compassionate and democratic society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not the only thing we will remember about Mr. Trudeau. 
During the fifties, he had already begun to build a reputation 
as one of the great intellectuals of the day. 
Mr. Trudeau, who was a fierce opponent of what became known as 
the dark ages, showed his beliefs through concrete action, 
including supporting strikers during the strike in Asbestos and 
founding <I>Cité libre</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tributes that are coming from capitals all over the world 
today also stress the role played at the international level by 
the former Prime Minister. After taking over from Lester B. 
Pearson, Mr. Trudeau worked to make Canada a modern state. 
Opening up relations with China and eastern European countries 
gave a new meaning to Canada's foreign policy and was a portent 
of the major changes that were to take place in the world during 
the eighties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mikhail Gorbatchev probably gave a full measure of the man when 
he said that Pierre Elliott Trudeau was the one person who 
opened up the possibility of developing ties with the western 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a sovereignist and a Quebecer, I recognize the importance of 
the man. I wish to offer my condolences to his family, his dear 
children, his friends and to all those who are truly saddened by 
his loss. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My condolences also go out to the Prime Minister, because I know 
the man he is mourning is more of a friend than a former Prime 
Minister. 
<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Alexa McDonough (Halifax, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, today, I join 
with millions of Canadians in mourning the passing of Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau and in honouring the life of this remarkable, 
but complex man.  A public personage, but a private man, his 
life and his work transformed a generation and fashioned the 
future of an entire country. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Across Canada, Pierre Elliott Trudeau's last illness and his 
death prompted an outpouring of memories and reflections of an 
era marked by vigorous debate of ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His enthusiasm, his vision, his unique sense of style and flair 
and his chutzpah made him ideally suited to be the first Prime 
Minister of the television generation.  He represented a time 
when many of us in the House of Commons came of age, a time when 
we began our involvement in public life.  That was one of Pierre 
Trudeau's gifts to us.  Whatever part of the political spectrum 
we came from, he challenged us.  He galvanized us.  He forced us 
to examine our beliefs and to act on those beliefs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau showed us that political life could combine 
intellectual discipline and the passionate pursuit of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He firmly believed in a strong, active and proud federal 
government.  He modernized the public service.  He proved that a 
career in the public sector could be honourable and respectable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He strengthened Canada as a multicultural and bilingual country. 
He promoted cultural diversity and its richness. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pierre Trudeau's international work, particularly in slowing 
down the nuclear arms race, earned him the Albert Einstein Peace 
Prize.

</I></B></P><P align=left>For 16 years, he was Prime Minister.  We loved him or we did 
not, but we always admired him.  Today and tomorrow there will 
be vigorous debate over his greatest legacy.  Was it the charter 
of rights and freedoms?  Was it the War Measures Act?  Was it 
his devoted work for the country?  Was it the patriation of the 
constitution?  Or, was it his efforts to create a just society 
during the years he headed a minority government? 
History and time alone will decide.

people across this country he already has his place as a proud

competitive debater; a statesman and showman, pirouetting in

whom he loved so passionately, in pictures we recalled in tragedy 
years later.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
first like to offer my condolences to the family of the late 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The loss of one so strong is almost impossible to believe.  We 
share the family's sorrow and their pride for what he was, for 
what he did and for what he gave to a generation of Canadians in 
terms of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We knew Mr. Trudeau was ill.  We knew even that he was suffering 
from a terminal illness.  And yet, the news of his passing was a 
shock to us all, because this passing represents more than the 
disappearance of a man.  Pierre Elliott Trudeau represented a 
bold new page in the nation's history, and now the page has been 
turned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We may each draw from his experience, but our purpose today, in 
this parliament that he towered above, is to express our respect 
for and our recognition of the talents and devotion of this 
extraordinary man. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel particularly fortunate to be able to pay my final tribute 
to Pierre Elliott Trudeau from the floor of the House of Commons. 
He was an enigmatic man, tough and kind, cold-blooded and 
sympathetic.  While I never thought I knew him well, it was here 
that I knew him best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was Prime Minister when I first entered parliament and then 
for seven years we stood directly across this aisle from one 
another, two sword lengths apart.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Our parliamentary system requires that the Prime Minister and 
the Leader of the Opposition disagree.  I did not need the 
prompting of the system.  On the issues for which Mr. Trudeau is 
most admired, including particularly his view of Quebec and 
Canada, I profoundly disagreed.  Yet everyone who served here 
during those times knew we were in the presence of a man of high 
intellect, of great and unquestioned integrity, of deep 
substance, and of real dedication to his concept of the public 
good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not every politician is lucky in his timing.  Pierre Trudeau 
was.  He burst into the Canadian consciousness when the country 
was confident and stretching, ready to change, ready to soar.  He 
became Prime Minister in that incandescent year of our 
centennial.  He came out of the city of our great Expo and he 
used those talents and that timing and those origins to change 
Canadian society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadians whom those changes suited applauded him and will 
feel forever grateful.  For example, whatever his motive in 
bringing forward the charter of rights and freedoms, the impact 
of that initiative was profound on those Canadians who came here 
from regimes where respect for rights was not part of the natural 
fabric of society.  Those Canadians now feel more comfortable, 
more equal, here in their own country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time many of those Canadians whom Mr. Trudeau's 
changes offended became estranged from their own country.  That 
happened in Quebec with the 1982 constitutional changes.  It 
happened in the west with the national energy program.  It is 
ironic that a Prime Minister whose mobilizing purpose was the 
unity of his country should have so exacerbated the differences 
within our own family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think there is a reason for that.  His intellect guided him 
more than his intuition did.  In a sense, he was too rational for 
this country which, after all, was formed and grew against logic. 
Pierre Trudeau had a clear view of what he thought our country 
should be.  He used his powers of office and of persuasion to 
make us that kind of country, whether we were or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite content to let history judge the legacy of his 
governments.  That will not be a narrow accounting of laws and 
popularity.  It will be an assessment of how a leader changed a 
society and, critic though I was of his signature initiatives, I 
expect that assessment will be positive and strong.  He changed 
more than laws.  He changed our image of ourselves at home and in 
the wider world, where he modernized and extended the 
international vocation of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would want us to remember today, hours after the passing 
of this extraordinary man, is precisely Pierre Trudeau's impact 
as a leader, his determination to be an agent of change, his 
capacity to transform society.  People who would never vote for 
him or rarely agree with him admired his passion, his intellect, 
his courage.  He became a symbol, almost an incarnation of what 
many Canadians hoped we could be.  No one can dispute the 
positive power of his example.  He was a force who, for better 
and for worse, transformed our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that famous 1968 election I was on the other side with Robert 
Stanfield.  I will never forget the eloquence with which Pierre 
Trudeau invoked and mobilized the spirit of this country in that 
first campaign, but he moved beyond eloquence to action, bold 
action.  Like our first controversial Prime Minister, Sir John A. 
Macdonald, Pierre Trudeau would have built the railway.

shoulder with him or behind him in his back benches, and those of

Trudeau and what he meant to us personally.  Witness what has 
been said by the five party leaders today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for us at this point to make great judgments about our 
colleague, and I address myself now to you, my colleagues and 
fellow parliamentarians.  Remember on the difficult days when you 
sit in this Chamber that you did have a colleague, a 
comrade-in-arms, who went through the same ups and downs as you 
do now.  We are the political gladiators of the day and we have 
lost a comrade-in-arms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To our fellow Canadians across the land, we as Canadians have 
lost a brother, a very dear brother. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We grieve with the family of Mr. Trudeau, but you see, we were 
all part of his family.  We are the Canadian family and he stood 
with us in the times when we needed his leadership most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For you my colleagues who are here, for you in the galleries, 
for all Canadians watching, I ask you now to stand for one minute 
of silence to remember Pierre Elliott Trudeau.
