	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
between 1885 and 1923, immigrants from China had to pay a tax 
to enter Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	By 1923 the Canadian government collected approximately 
$23 million from Chinese immigrants. After the tax was 
removed the government enacted the Chinese Immigration 
Exclusion Act which forbid the immigration of Chinese to 
Canada and as a result less than 50 Chinese entered Canada 
between 1923 and 1947.
<P>
	The legislation applied only to Chinese separated families 
and imposed immense hardship on a community that built the 
railway, the national dream.
<P>
	Both the Chinese Canadian National Council and the National 
Congress of Chinese Canadians have called upon successive 
Canadian governments to acknowledge the grave injustices and 
racial discrimination inherent in the head tax of the exclusion 
act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I encourage the Canadian government to recognize the 
enormous contribution made by the Chinese to Canada and to 
resolve the problem of the tax and the Chinese Immigration 
Exclusion Act as soon as possible.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
this National Patriots Day, Quebecers pay tribute to the 
thousands of men and women known as Patriots, who believed 
in the need for their people to be recognized as a nation able to 
take charge of its own destiny and who demanded that truly 
democratic and responsible institutions be created and 
fundamental freedoms granted.
<P>
	Whatever our views today of the appropriateness of the means 
some of them used, we must recognize that their actions led to 
the establishment of responsible government, on which are 
founded our democratic institutions.
<P>
	When we pay tribute to the Patriots, we are also recognizing 
the determination and strength of conviction of well-known 
politicians such as Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, Louis Joseph 
Papineau and George Étienne Cartier, all of whom were first and 
foremost Patriots. It is my hope that this House will take note of 
the lessons of history when, in the very near future, it considers a 
motion recognizing the true role of the Patriots.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, hostilities in Bosnia have recently increased. 
Canadians are concerned for the safety of our troops in the 
region.
<P>
	The United Nations laid down restrictions to prohibit local air 
force intervention in the conflict. We support the recent NATO 
air strikes enforcing the no fly zone.
<P>
	A rule laid down and not enforced is worse than no rule at all; 
it is important that all combatants understand that the UN means 
what it says. Thus, this action has advanced the cause of 
protecting declared safe zones and allowing the provision of 
humanitarian aid to continue. Once again we want to express our 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8166"> 8166 </A></B>
<P>
admiration of and support for our Canadian forces in that 
theatre.
<P>
	Now that the United States has lifted its participation in the 
arms embargo, there is concern for how this will affect the 
situation in Bosnia. The Prime Minister has on several occasions 
stated that if the arms embargo is lifted Canadian forces will be 
withdrawn. Britain and France have voiced similar policies.
<P>
	We hope the Canadian government will soon provide an 
update as to what negotiations are taking place and what actions 
are being considered.

	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Vancouver Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
term wine and dine has taken on new meaning in my home 
province of British Columbia. Going out are the French 
Burgundies and California Chardonnays. Coming in are the 
British Columbia Pinot Blancs, Pinot Noirs, Gewurtraminers 
and Merlots.
<P>
	B.C. wine industry sales climbed to nearly $20 million in the 
last year and a national export committee has been created to 
market abroad. Although the acreage used for viticulture in B.C. 
is a fraction of that of France, Australia or California, B.C. 
wines have won numerous awards over the past few years.
<P>
	Through the tireless work of the Vintner's Quality Alliance 
and local growers the quality of B.C. wines has improved 
dramatically over the past decade. Concentration on German 
style wines and higher quality vinifera grape varietals has 
contributed to this success.
<P>
	Many B.C. wines, including Cedar Creek of Kelowna, have 
won international awards. However the crowning glory came 
with the recent award of the coveted British Avery trophy to 
Mission Hill Winery of Kelowna. This prestigious gold medal 
heralds the maturity of Canada's wine industry. At last our wines 
can enjoy the international reputation-

	<B>Mr. Bill Graham (Rosedale, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many of my 
constituents have contacted me recently regarding the 
advisability of taxing RRSPs. Many of them oppose taxing 
RRSPs because they are aware of the importance of RRSPs to 
individuals who are not employed by institutions and who have 
no other way of saving for their retirement. Taxing RRSPs 
would afford such people less protection than those who work 
for government, large corporations or other institutions. As a 
matter of principle such unequal treatment is unfair.
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	Taxing RRSPs runs counter to our government's active 
encouragement of the growth of small and medium size 
enterprises. Entrepreneurs running these businesses rely on the 
RRSP system to save for their futures.
<P>
	Finally the Canadian savings rate is low. Investments in 
RRSPs may reduce immediate government tax revenue  but 
create pools of capital for the benefit of all Canadians. This 
source of capital must not be forsaken merely to encourage 
immediate government consumption.

<P>
	It is important for all members to remember what a precious 
resource our children are and for us to be mindful of their 
interests in our policy decisions. We must remember that the 
future that we are helping to create is their future.
<P>
	We need to support children in our rural communities by 
ensuring that they have access to child care. We need to ensure 
that they continue to have access to quality health care and 
education. We also need to support continued diversification of 
our rural communities to ensure that rural children can have 
bright futures in their home communities.

will always be thankful.

Mr. Speaker, Sunday night, on the television program ``Soirée

Minister of Canadian Heritage told viewers that he liked theatre, 
in fact, he attended it regularly at the House of Commons.
<P>
	I would like to remind the minister that the House of 
Commons is not like the Compagnons de Saint-Laurent. This is 
the real thing. When the Official Opposition asked for his 
resignation after he intervened with the CRTC, it was for real.
<P>
	It is reprehensible that our heritage minister casts discredit on 
an institution such as Parliament with his inept jokes that amuse 
no one, implying that what goes on in this place has more to do 
with playacting than with real life.

<P>

	Since the Minister of Canadian Heritage is unable to see the

ensuring the survival and development of the francophone and

for Kingston and the Islands in response to Tory patronage

<P>
	It is amazing how going from opposition to government 
shortens the memory. I guess that explains the decision to 
appoint two more senators for nothing more than pure

friendship centre program.
<P>
	On behalf of the Minister of Canadian Heritage, last Friday I

Centres and had an opportunity to listen to NAFC concerns 
about the program review exercise and the impact on their

<P>

of native people who leave their reserves to settle, whether on a 
permanent or a temporary basis, in the city.

[<I>English</I>]

<P>
	The Liberals did not do anything to collect the $6.5 billion 
owed in back taxes. They would rather cut social programs 
indiscriminately.
<P>
	The Auditor General's report shows that the government does 
not know how effective its programs are, as it prepares to axe 
them.
<P>
	Instead, the Liberals should have the courage to cut the 
department of defence. Mismanagement of real property causes 
annual losses of $100 million, while $700 million could be 
saved on information technology projects. But that is something 
they leave alone.

is obvious that the Auditor General is making value judgments, 
policy judgments, and policy prescriptions that are the purview

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, last Friday, the Cree chief Matthew Coon Come 
was in Washington continuing his smear campaign against 
Quebec in the United States, using insulting terms and accusing 
the Quebec government of pursuing a racist policy toward the 
Crees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8169"> 8169 </A></B>
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. After finding out what 
Cree Chief Matthew Coon Come said, did he instruct the 
Canadian embassy in Washington to set the record straight with 
the American authorities?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I obtained information from the Canadian embassy in 
the United States. Mr. Coon Come addressed an audience in a 
debate in which Quebec and other parts of Canada were 
represented and what he said was debated. The other side was 
presented publicly at that time. Since it was a debate, the record 
was set straight by the people there, who had been invited by a 
group of academics. So the embassy did not think that it had to 
intervene. Opinions are expressed everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	As I said yesterday, people whom I know very well and even 
see in my riding often say things about me that I do not like. But 
in a democracy, we have to live with it. I see that Premier 
Parizeau, who was accused, defended himself. Later the Indian 
chief said that he did not want to attribute those words to Mr. 
Parizeau. According to the information I have, he issued a 
correction.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I think that the Prime Minister is minimizing the 
situation. Keep in mind that in this case a Canadian province and 
one of Canada's two main language communities are being 
attacked and accused of a very serious charge of racism. 
Therefore I think that the Prime Minister should take this matter 
more seriously.
<P>
	How does he explain, for example, that the Canadian embassy 
did not intervene to set the record straight the day after Mr. Coon 
Come made his remarks, while in the case of clear cutting, for 
example, the embassy did a very fine job and quite legitimately 
intervened with the American authorities to correct the 
information going around Europe on the clear cutting done by 
Canadian paper companies, and even spent $4.5 million for this 
purpose? Why did it not show the same vigilance, since this 
embassy has just demanded the exclusive right to represent 
Quebec's interests in Washington?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have just given a very clear explanation. It was a 
debate. Someone reportedly expressed an opinion that was 
contradicted by other people who were there. Today, that person 
says he was misinterpreted and did not want to attack Mr. 
Parizeau. Mr. Parizeau defended himself. In a democratic 
society, that is normal.
<P>
	Expressing an opinion is one thing. When dealing with forests 
or something else, as the Leader of the Opposition raised this 
issue in his question- When the Government of Quebec wanted 
to go ahead with the new James Bay project for hydro-electric 
power, the Canadian government's representative always 
defended Quebec's interests against American 
environmentalists. But if a Canadian citizen makes untrue 
statements about a politician-that has happened to me so often. 
If the Leader of the Opposition took the initiative to defend me  
every time nasty things were said about the Prime Minister of 
Canada in his presence, I would be pleasantly surprised.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition, BQ):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the exaggeration in political discussions when a 
politician is attacked is one thing, but these discussions must be 
level-headed and respect people's reputations. Vilifying a 
whole people is something else. I say to the Prime Minister that 
as Prime Minister of Canada, if he claims to defend Canada-if 
Quebec is vilified everywhere and charged with racism, Canada 
as a whole suffers.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bouchard:</B> That was the preamble to my question, Mr. 
Speaker. Are we to understand that the federal government 
refuses to set the record straight in this serious matter, because 
in the pre-referendum environment it suits the government to 
have the image of Quebec and its pro-sovereignty government 
discredited in the United States?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have to repeat what I said.
<P>
	There was a debate in Washington among Canadians invited 
by a group to debate the situation of Quebec and Canada. The 
native leader spoke strongly. He claimed today that he did not 
attribute his words to the premier of Quebec. The premier 
defended himself today. We have debates like that all the time. 
The situation was rectified that very moment by the people 
there. The embassy felt there was nothing to do at the moment 
because other Canadian citizens had defended the Canadian 
population and in particular the Quebec population.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his 
report, the Auditor General mentions the lack of thoroughness 
and the weakness of the data used to justify the closure of 
military bases. He refers, among other examples, to the base in 
Portage-La Prairie, Manitoba, where the costs related to the 
closure were significantly underestimated by the Department of 
National Defence. In the end, this measure resulted in savings of 
$170 million, instead of the anticipated $411 million.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs aware that the 
very same scenario is being repeated with the closure of the 
military college in Saint-Jean, because he significantly 
underestimates the costs of transferring the operations to 
Kingston, and does the minister realize that he will never reach 
the

<P>
	In discussing the base closures at Portage la Prairie and 
Summerside the Auditor General certainly had good reasons for 
the claims he made. We did not repeat those mistakes when we 
closed bases earlier this year. We were much more meticulous 
about the cost savings that would accrue. Of course we have 
stood by those figures as they particularly apply to the question 
raised by the hon. member for the Collège militaire royal de 
Saint-Jean.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since 
the Auditor General of Canada has demonstrated that the 
Department of National Defence mismanages all of its capital 
assets and has a poor record regarding the closure of military 
bases, does the minister recognize that his only argument to 
justify the closing of the military college in Saint-Jean, namely 
to make savings, is no longer valid, and does he agree that he 
should review his decision and take into account the 
constructive suggestions made by stakeholders?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, obviously 
the hon. member did not hear my previous answer. I stated this 
yesterday and we have stated it before. We believe absolutely 
that the financial reasons certainly justify the closure of the two

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in a few short months the contest between federalism 
and separatism will begin in earnest. Surely the Prime Minister 
would agree that now is the time for federalism to put its best 
foot forward, not its worst. Federalism does not put its best foot 
forward through partisan, patronage appointments to key 
federal institutions, such as Rideau Hall and the Canadian 
Senate.
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that continuation of the 
Mulroney practice of high level patronage appointments to 
federal offices discredits the federal system? Will he promise to 
abandon this practice before it infects his entire government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know if I should reply to an attack on the 
Governor General designate. The man served his country for 
about 23 years and is highly respected everywhere. He is the 
first Atlantic Canadian to be appointed as Governor General.
<P>
	Ask anybody to look at the quality of the people I have 
appointed. For example this morning I named Jean-Robert 
Gauthier, who is not a member of Parliament any more, as a 
senator. He served for 22 years as a member of Parliament. He is 
the one who proposed a bill to have the Auditor General report 
four times a year. I was somewhat sorry he accepted the offer I 
made to him because I think he still would have been very good 
serving here, but after 22 years he accepted that appointment.
<P>
	This man had a great contest in the House. It was good for you, 
Mr. Speaker, that it was by two votes he did not become the 
Speaker. A lot of people thought we had two great candidates 
and he lost by only two votes. He is a very respected Canadian 
who will make a great senator.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I did not know that I had won by two votes.
<P>
	My colleagues, may I very gently remind you, and this is not 
in the form of a lecture in any way, that some of our institutions 
should not be reflected upon negatively, nor I believe should we 
attack each other's character. I wonder if we might keep this in 
mind with both the questions and answers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister defends partisan patronage 
appointments to the highest political offices. In so doing he is 
sending all the wrong signals to his ministers responsible for 
lower level appointments. He is saying it is okay for the 
immigration minister to make patronage appointments to the 
IRB. He is saying it is okay for the Solicitor General to make 
patronage appointments to the National Parole Board.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
	Will the Prime Minister change the signals he is sending to 
those ministers and rescind his latest patronage appointments so 
that Canadians can believe he is serious about restoring integrity 
to government?

<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Constitution of Canada has vested the Prime 
Minister of Canada with the responsibility to fill the jobs in the 
Senate. Of course when I name someone, I make a decision. It is 
always a patronage appointment.
<P>
	When my predecessor, Mr. Trudeau, selected the father of the 
leader of the Reform Party, it was a political patronage 
appointment when he became a senator. If the leader of the 
Reform Party does not want me to keep that privilege, he had a 
great occasion, when we voted in the referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord, to make the Senate elected. This 
gentleman voted against having an elected Senate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister appears to believe that continued 
use of partisan patronage at the highest levels of government is 
somehow compatible with his pledge to integrity in government. 
He appears to believe that patronage and integrity can live in the 
same government and dine at the same table.
<P>
	My question is for the Prime Minister. Who, if anyone, has he 
consulted on the ethics of this matter? Has he consulted the 
ethics counsellor? Did he call former Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney on the phone? Who, if anyone, has advised him that 
patronage and integrity can coexist within a government?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have a little problem. If someone is a Liberal or 
supports the Liberal Party he is disqualified. Then 63 per cent of 
the Canadian people are disqualified because they are Liberal.
<P>
	It is not very good for my humility, but if I were to discard all 
the people who have expressed confidence in this Prime 
Minister, then 75 per cent of the Canadian people would be 
disqualified.
<P>
	I ask everybody to look at the quality of the people I have 
appointed. That is the criteria. Each one is a great citizen of 
Canada, making a contribution in his or her own province. 
Jean-Robert Gauthier has been one of the greatest defenders of 
the French fact in Canada. The Governor General will prove to 
be a great choice that the Queen has accepted.

	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is directed to the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The Auditor General is critical of the Department of National 
Defence because of its ad hoc approach to closing military 
bases, and I quote: ``The budgetary process provides no 
opportunity to prepare the labour force or the communities for 
change, and to plan a strategy for government assistance''. That 
was a reference  to the 1994 Budget, not the budget of the 
previous government.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	Will the Minister for National Defence admit that these 
closings are the result of ad hoc political decision-making that 
is having a harsh impact on local communities, since it does not 
include a strategy to help them diversify their economy?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I beg to 
differ.
<P>
	First, the Liberal Party in its red book called for a cut in 
defence spending. We acted on that in the budget. It was done in 
the budget because we felt we had to discharge our promise right 
away for the tax year beginning April 1, 1994.
<P>
	The Auditor General is a very eminent individual and has 
done a lot of work. We work with him closely at national 
defence. I believe he acknowledges the fact that we are trying to 
improve on the suggestions he makes.
<P>
	Without being disrespectful, I would say that the choice of 
whether or not we enact certain military expenditures in the 
budget or otherwise is a political decision made by the 
Government of Canada and not by the Auditor General.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Marc Jacob (Charlesbourg, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
may remind the minister that the red book also talked about 
defence conversion and diversification, neither of which has 
been done.
<P>
	Instead of being criticized again next year by the Auditor 
General's office for his ad hoc decision to close the Collège 
militaire royal de Saint-Jean, would the minister not agree he 
should support the proposal by the mayor of Saint-Jean which 
provides for a transition period, in order to avoid repeating the 
mistakes of the past?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal, Lib.): 
</B>Mr. Speaker, I met the mayor of Saint-Jean today at noon to 
discuss his proposal. We agreed on the two main proposals: first, 
that CMR should be converted to civilian use, and second, that a 
period of transition is necessary to make CMR a post-secondary 
institution.
<P>
	Having agreed on the principles, we concluded that the same 
principles formed the basis for the July 19 agreement. We both 
urge the Government of Quebec to accept the July 19 agreement 
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday's Auditor General's report 
pointed out serious flaws within Correctional Service Canada.
<P>
	One hundred and sixty violent offenders have slipped through 
the cracks and ended up on the street; those behind bars are 
costing Canadian taxpayers up to $80,000 per year each. 
Canadians are not getting good value for their tax dollars in a 
system that has serious and occasionally fatal flaws.
<P>
	I ask the parliamentary secretary when Canadians can expect 
a corrections system that works for them instead of for the 
criminals.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I answered yesterday, we 
welcome the recommendations of the Auditor General. We have 
already started to implement some of them.
<P>
	Even though we admit that some persons have escaped from 
prison, we would like it if nobody escaped. However from April 
1994 until today we have had only 76 escapees. Over the same 
period last year we had 147 escapees. I know that is 76 too many. 
We would like that figure to be zero. We are working toward that 
and I hope the member will co-operate with us.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a supplementary question. According 
to the Auditor General, the appointment process for the National 
Parole Board seems to put Canadians at even greater risk than 
corrections. Many full time appointees are ill prepared to do the 
job, much less the part time appointees.
<P>
	Will the parliamentary secretary promise to put an end to 
political patronage on the National Parole Board and introduce a 
system based solely on professional skills and merit?
<P>
<B>(1440 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary 
Affairs) and Deputy Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as we promised in the red 
book we have acted. The case is clear. Concerning the 
appointment of the chairman, the Solicitor General has gazetted 
the position. There was a special experienced panel that 
reviewed the candidate and the Solicitor General made the final 
review which resulted in a good appointment.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the Auditor General states in his report 
that it is a good system. We intend to continue with this new 
system which was implemented according to our red book 
promise.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	The Auditor General finds it regrettable that the government 
is about to conduct a social program reform without first 
gathering all the information required to make informed 
choices. While the results of social programs cannot be 
prejudged, he said, available data is insufficient to use as a basis 
for a proper evaluation.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Human Resources Development 
claim that Canadians can participate in a real debate on social 
program reform, while at the same time providing them with 
only partial, incomplete and insufficient information?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member would 
look carefully at what the Auditor General said was a 
requirement for additional information, things on impact of 
seasonal work, premium reduction, the impact of various forms 
of cross subsidization and look at the paper that we tabled on 
November 14, she would find that all the information requested 
by the Auditor General, is contained in that report.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the 
minister is prepared to conduct his social program reform on the 
basis of incomplete information, does he recognize that his sole 
objective, rather than to improve social programs, is in fact to 
make cuts in assistance programs for the disadvantaged?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have dealt with this 
question many times in the past.
<P>
	If one looks clearly at the objectives set forward in the green 
book, in the various supplementary papers that we put forward, 
we are challenging members of Parliament, as we are 
challenging Canadians, to find a better way of delivering social 
programs, particularly to improve employment opportunities.
<P>
	The whole purpose of revising and modernizing the 
unemployment insurance program and the Canada assistance 
program is to give unemployed Canadians, those on social 
benefits, a much better set of tools to help them get back into the 
workplace. That is the primary basis of reform.
<P>
	The best way of dealing with a fiscal crisis is to have more 
people back at work.

<P>
	The Canadian Race Relations Foundation will cost taxpayers 
$24 million. Of this, $3 million will go to pay the salaries of the 
30 governor in council appointments.
<P>
	When in opposition, the Liberal member from 
Scarborough-Agincourt challenged these appointments. He 
criticized their partisan nature by suggesting that the 
government would appoint only those people who support it and 
that the government would probably place as president of the 
foundation somebody who has raised funds for the government.
<P>
	Given that the Prime Minister has recently made more 
patronage appointments, how can he guarantee that he will not 
fill the 30-odd appointments for this board with more Liberal 
hacks and bagmen?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State

remarks were without understanding of the wonderful 
appointments that our leader has made in the past. I am so proud 
of what he has already done that I was moved to a wrong 
observation in that regard of the character of the person.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Is there a withdrawal in there? Will the 
secretary of state withdraw?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Finestone:</B> With the greatest of respect to you, Mr. 
Speaker, of course I withdraw.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Jan Brown (Calgary Southeast, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would really like an answer to my question today, but I will 
continue with my supplementary question.
<P>
	The government appears bound and determined to spend more 
tax dollars on multiculturalism. During debate on the issue in 
1990 the president of Canadian municipalities stated that social 
harmony cannot be created by posters, proclamations or literary 
contests or even by co-operation between business and 
government or by directed government action.
<P>
	The real challenge is in the hearts and minds of each of us as 
individuals. When will the Prime Minister recognize the truth of 
that statement, terminate the Race Relations Foundation and 
save Canadian taxpayers $24 million?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Finestone (Secretary of State 
(Multiculturalism) (Status of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
the hon. member, while we have not proclaimed the Race 
Relations Foundation as yet, we are a party and a government 
that believes in its commitment to the people of Canada and is 
committed to its word.
<P>
	The member will find in the red book a strong undertaking 
about the Race Relations Foundation. The Prime Minister 
announced it in his speech from the throne. It was included in the 
finance minister's speech in the budget. We are committed and 
we will proclaim en temps et lieu.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Auditor General reminds us that recording revenue 
and expenditures of the UI account with those of the federal 
government distorts the government's budget results, since 
Ottawa has not contributed to the UI account since 1990. The 
account is financed entirely by workers and employers.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance admit that, without the net 
surplus of $2.7 billion in the UI account, his deficit for the 
current year would not be $39.7 billion, as he claims, but about 
$42 billion?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, the federal 
government is responsible for any deficit in the UI account. 
True, the money comes from the private sector. However, since 
we are responsible for the deficit, if there is one, these figures 
must really be included in our budget. It is very clear that we are 
responsible.
<P>
	Also, I must tell you that the Auditor General himself insists 
on this accounting policy.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would remind the Minister of Finance that the 
Auditor General is not the only one denouncing this procedure. 
A recent report by the Canadian Institute of Actuaries stated that 
since the UI program is totally self-financed, the current 
mechanism distorts the government's budget results.
<P>
	My supplementary question is for the Minister of Finance. 
Instead of using this questionable procedure to hide the 
government's disastrous financial situation and make himself 
look good as a manager of public funds, why does the Minister 
of Finance not use the UI account surplus to reduce employers' 
and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8174"> 8174 </A></B>
<P>
employees' premiums, thus creating thousands of jobs? He 
should cut the rhetoric and take action.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I repeat, the 
accounting procedure used by the government is the one that is 
suggested and on which the Auditor General himself insists. We 
are simply following his directives.
<P>
	Second, about the government's ability to reduce UI 
premiums, the Minister of Human Resources Development, the 
Minister of Industry and myself all agree that it must be done.
<P>
<B>(1450) </B>
<P>
	That said, what the business community wants, really, is 
stable premiums. As soon as we have a surplus, as soon as we are

do so.

<P>

force on the study of high risk offenders. This report will be 
brought to our attention early in the new year.
<P>
	I should add that last week the Solicitor General also 
announced the creation of the Canadian police information 
centre which will screen out various individuals who wish to 
work with youth organizations across Canada. We will be sure 
that no sexual abusers are allowed to work with children.

that the government has promised civil servants that it would 
honour the workforce adjustment policy which says in essence 
that civil servants cannot be laid off. Yet the minister has

<P>
	Understanding the points that are made by the hon. member, 
matters are under discussion at the present time and will 
subsequently be reported as the negotiations are completed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my supplementary question is for the President of the Treasury 
Board.
<P>
	The Auditor General's report says that the purpose of the 
workforce adjustment directive, which is preserving jobs, 
stands directly contrary to the government's purpose of 
reducing the size of the public service. If the minister is not able

unions, is he prepared to bring in legislation to change that 
directive?

	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board

would negotiate with the bargaining agents. It is a matter that is 
subject to collective bargaining as it is part of the agreements 
with our unions and we will negotiate with them.

yesterday, the Minister of Transport attempted to trivialize the 
generous interest-free loan of $300,000 granted to Mr. Paul 
Tellier by Canadian National toward the purchase of a home in 
Westmount. The minister tried to explain this loan by saying it 
was in line with so-called similar practices in the private sector.

	At a time when the CN is cutting 10,000 positions as part of its 
rationalization plan and the government is asking all its 
employees to make sacrifices, what is the Minister of Transport 
waiting for, as sole shareholder, to step in and put a stop to this

most highly paid by the Canadian taxpayers?
<P>
<B>(1455) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Young (Minister of Transport, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday, I indicated in my answer that the practice 
with regard to the president of CN was one for which there were 
precedents at CN with previous presidents. I also explained that 
this was a situation that was commonplace in the private sector, 
given that CN is a Crown corporation.
<P>
	Certainly, we are all aware of the upcoming changes at CN 
and elsewhere in the Canadian railway system. The salary of the 
president of CN was set by order in council before this 
government came to power. There is no doubt that the situation 
identified by the hon. member is of great concern to us. I can

officers?

<P>

	As I indicated, the salary paid to the president of CN is set by

Ontario an individual apprehended with a fully automatic 
sub-machine gun received a $1,000 fine.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Justice explain to Canadians demanding 
sentences that would prove to be a real deterrent why the penalty 
for the theft of firearms or the possession of prohibited weapons 
is so lenient under the government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will not comment on 
the sentences in those specific cases because I do not know the 
facts beyond what the hon. member has said.
<P>
	The hon. member and I are on common ground in terms of the 
need for stern and certain punishment for the kinds of offences 
he has described.
<P>
	The government will be introducing in the House during the 
coming weeks specific proposals in relation to firearms that will 
include very significant changes to the penalty provisions for 
the kinds of crime he has described.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a young man in my riding had his .22 stored under the 
seat of his truck as the current storage regulations call for. When 
he lent his truck to a friend who was stopped for speeding the 
young owner was charged with lending a firearm to someone 
who did not have a valid FAC. This can be an indictable offence 
punishable by up to two years in jail.
<P>
	While it seems harder to get a straight answer from this 
minister than it is blood from a stone, would he care to comment 
on the gross inequity whereby a criminal possessing stolen or 
prohibited firearms receives a slap on the wrist yet this young 
man is facing a criminal record because he lent his truck to a 
friend?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, rather than comment 
on specific cases that have been selected for the member's own 
purposes I would like to speak about the criminal law in general.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8176"> 8176 </A></B>
<P>
	We are in the course of preparing for presentation to the 
House of Commons comprehensive proposals with respect to 
firearms that will disclose the government's priorities in 
relation to safety and criminal law.
<P>
	The hon. member will find, when they are presented, that they 
are entirely consistent with the public interest which is safety in 
Canadian society.

	<B>Ms. Paddy Torsney (Burlington, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there 
are nearly 1.3 million poor children in Canada.
<P>
	When releasing his discussion paper the Minister of Human 
Resources Development said that reducing child poverty would 
be a central objective of social security reform.
<P>
	What measures is the minister considering to ensure that 
Canadian children, our national resource, no longer go hungry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly the eradication or 
elimination of child poverty is a major objective in the proposed 
social security reform.
<P>
	As the hon. member knows, one of the most important ways of 
doing that is to change the conditions under which people can 
get back to work and to provide much better child care and 
employment assistance services, particularly for single mothers 
faced with the most serious child poverty situations.
<P>
	In the last several months under the strategic initiatives 
program of the government over 20,000 Canadians have been 
given direct assistance in an innovative, flexible, creative way 
to enable them to get back into the work market, the job market, 
so we can ensure that their children have a proper income and 
proper upbringing.

<P>
	The petition addresses the serious decline we have

Keep Mining in Canada has developed a 10-point plan to 
address this concern.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to take action that will 
create employment in this sector, promote exploration, rebuild 
Canada's mineral reserves, sustain mining communities and 
most of all keep mining in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Peter Thalheimer (Timmins-Chapleau, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today pursuant to Standing Order 36 to draw to 
the attention of this House that mining is an important industry 
to Canada. Over 150 communities in every province and 
territory contribute to Canada's export to the tune of over $20 
billion a year. Canada is an important mining country and 
hundreds of thousands of Canadians depend on a healthy 
investment climate to continue with this important industry.
<P>
	The petitioners call upon Parliament to take action to improve 
the climate, increase reserves, preserve our communities and 
keep mining in Canada. I support the petition and the 358 
Canadians who have signed it.

People from Calgary, Grande Prairie and Slave Lake, Alberta, as 
well as several other communities in western Canada, have also

<P>

possession of a firearm in the commission of a violent crime.

forcing its mineral industry to look for new opportunities 
elsewhere, a trend which has eroded industry employment 
substantially in this decade and threatens the long term viability 
of mining in Canada.

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="DEPARTMENTOFNATURALRESOURCESACT">DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Anne McLellan (Minister of Natural Resources, Lib.)</B> 
moved that Bill C-48, an act to establish the Department of 
Natural Resources and to amend related acts, be read the third 
time and passed.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, it is a great pleasure for me this 
afternoon to speak on the occasion of the third reading of Bill 
C-48, a bill to establish the Department of Natural Resources.
<P>
	This afternoon I wish to focus my brief comments on the 
important role of research and development as these concepts 
relate to the resource sectors and my department.
<P>
	In the red book of the Liberal Party of Canada we stated our 
commitment to encourage progress toward the concept of 
sustainable development by integrating economic and 
environmental values and objectives.
<P>
	One of our key challenges as a government in meeting this 
commitment is to create resource production and processing 
technologies that are less harmful to the environment and 
government and industry must meet this challenge by working 
in collaboration and partnership.
<P>
	Government research facilities will continue to make an 
important contribution to R and D but the involvement of 
industry, universities, colleges and levels of government other 
than federal is essential.
<P>
	The role of the federal government in the natural resources 
sectors is that of partner and that of a natural bridge between 
industry, other levels of government and the academy.
<P>
	Natural Resources Canada has a lead role to play in the way 
our natural resources are managed. NRCAN, along with other 
science and technology departments, is responsible for ensuring 
that the Canadian taxpayers' investment of approximately $7 
billion in science and technology is focused on areas that have 
the highest priority in terms of meeting our important economic, 
social and environmental goals.
<P>
	By facilitating co-operation between all stakeholders 
government can ensure that the science and technology at work 
in these sectors contributes to the wealth of our economy and the 
health of our natural resources.
<P>
	NRCAN has four main scientific branches: the Canadian 
Forest Service, the Geological Survey of Canada, the Canada 
Centre for Mineral and Energy Technology, otherwise known as 
CANMET, and Geomatics Canada. All these branches make 
important contributions to research and development in 
partnership with others.
<P>
<B>(1535 ) </B>
<P>
	Let me now give some specific examples of how my 
department fulfils this important role. In mining let us look to 
the problem of acid mine drainage, an environmental liability 
for the Canadian mining industry, with a potential price tag of 
between $3 billion to $5 billion.
<P>
	To address this challenge the mine environmental neutral 
drainage program, otherwise known as MEND, unites the efforts 
of four federal government departments, eight provincial 
governments, seventeen mining companies and a number of 
academic institutions. It has developed new leading edge 
technology that can be transferred and marketed around the 
world. The program has also saved to date hundreds of millions 
of dollars for Canadian mining companies.
<P>
	Let me move to the area of geomatics. When it comes to a 
discussion of innovative technology I believe that some of the 
most remarkable and innovative technological developments 
have occurred in the field of geomatics. Integrating economic 
and environmental objectives for resource development begins 
with accurate information. Working in partnership our 
geomatics  industry and the Government of Canada have been 
instrumental in developing, applying and transferring both 
innovative 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8182"> 8182 </A></B>
<P>
technology and expertise to Canada's resource industries and to 
countries around the world.
<P>
	For example, we can receive images at the Prince Albert 
satellite receiving station, a world class Canadian built facility, 
which is located in Saskatchewan. Then we can digitize this 
information and use it in computer based tools to explore for 
new resources, to develop new mines or to monitor changes in 
our environment. Those are only a few of the uses of geomatics 
technology.
<P>
	Let me move to the forestry sector, one of the single most 
important areas of Canada's industrial strength. In the forestry 
sector advanced technologies based on remote sensing and 
computer science are giving us new techniques for managing the 
forest resource and its ecosystems.
<P>
	Canada has developed highly successful forest health 
monitoring systems including the forest insect and disease 
survey, a partnership between the federal and provincial 
governments and the acid rain national early warning system. 
Canada also leads the world in the development of forest fire 
danger rating systems and related decision support systems. 
These are just a few examples of the valuable partnerships that 
exist between government, industries and universities.
<P>
	However the challenge is clear. We can no longer tackle 
problems in traditional ways and government must continue to 
find innovative solutions through our partnerships and through 
science and technology which is the key to progress toward 
sustainable development. My department, NRCAN, is in the 
process of drawing the road map for natural resources 
development in the 21st century. It is a map for success because 
of the consensus that we have achieved by bringing together key 
stakeholders in the resource sectors.
<P>
	NRCAN is a major federal force behind science and 
technology and is the leading federal agency responsible for 
natural resource issues. These roles provide NRCAN with the 
capacity to help address the challenges industry faces and to 
contribute to the fulfilment of the government's policy 
priorities.
<P>
	Increasingly the department's policy and science and 
technology efforts focus on two interrelated objectives, helping 
the resource industry to maintain its international 
competitiveness and doing so in a way that is environmentally 
sustainable. Together these two objectives capture the essence 
of the concept of sustainable development, the integration of 
economic and environmental objectives and values.
<P>
	In conclusion, it was a pleasure to address the House this 
afternoon on the occasion of the third reading of Bill C-48, a bill 
that will when enacted provide the legal framework for the new 
Department of Natural Resources.
<P>
<B>(1540) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I will have to repeat a number of points I raised previously, since 
I find myself in the position of a teacher faced with a student 
who is the opposite of a quick study. This certainly does not 
apply to the minister but it does to her government.
<P>
	They should start making a serious attempt at understanding 
what is at stake, because this is a very complex issue. Yesterday, 
we presented a number of amendments that I feel were entirely 
appropriate and justified, but they did not pass. They were 
defeated.
<P>
	I will go back to what we proposed yesterday to explain why 
normally, these amendments should have been accepted by 
everyone.
<P>
	We should recall that Bill C-48 was introduced as part of the 
present government's plan to restructure the federal public 
service. The purpose of the bill before the House today is to 
legislate the creation of the Department of Natural Resources. 
Once the bill is passed, one minister will have the powers and 
duties that today are vested in the ministers referred to in the 
Department of Forestry Act and the Department of Energy, 
Mines and Resources Act. As far as this bill is concerned, 
obviously we cannot object to bringing Forestry and Energy, 
Mines and Resources together in a single department. Of course 
not.
<P>
	As such, this is a laudable objective. Regrouping certain 
duties to provide a better service may be justified, provided they 
are ours to regroup. That would not seem to be the case when we 
are talking about natural resources. I will get back to this later 
on, because I feel the present government failed to take 
advantage of this opportunity to reach an understanding with 
Quebec and the other Canadian provinces.
<P>
	I also feel that if this government had done what it should 
have done, today we would be able to say that it fully intends to 
respect its partners. That is not the case, and unfortunately, I see 
no sign of it in this bill. In fact, I see more duplication.
<P>
	According to the bill before the House today, the term natural 
resources is applied to all resources mentioned in the 
Department of Forestry Act and the Department of Energy, 
Mines and Resources Act. This means that anything connected 
with natural resources is affected by this bill.
<P>
	Furthermore, and this is very important, the bill refers to 
integrated management and sustainable development, which we 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8183"> 8183 </A></B>
<P>
fully endorse. Those are principles we in the Bloc are prepared 
to support, because, as I said before,  this is very important for 
the future of our children and grandchildren.
<P>
	These principles are already being applied in my riding, in 
Matapédia-Matane, and more specifically in connection with 
forest management. We did not invent these principles but we 
support them wholeheartedly. In the last 20 years, we have 
really invested in our forests, and there are some wonderful 
things to see and some wonderful things are happening as a 
result of our efforts.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	In my opinion, it is no longer possible to speak about 
development of natural resources without speaking about 
sustainable development. The bill before us therefore has the 
advantage, and we support this, of applying the principle of 
integrated management and sustainable development to all 
natural resources.
<P>
	This being said, I and my colleagues in the Bloc Quebecois 
understand perfectly well that the objective of the present bill is 
to formalize what is actually taking place.
<P>
	I hope that our colleagues in the Liberal Party do not expect us 
to support this bill to establish the Department of Natural 
Resources. It is a bill to which we have no trouble speaking. 
Quebecers elected us, a sovereignist party, to defend the 
interests of Quebec and, at the same time, to initiate dialogue 
with the rest of Canada, with a view to laying the groundwork 
for our eventual sovereignty.
<P>
	I note, however, that the present Liberal government seems to 
has absolutely no intention of respecting the jurisdiction of 
Quebec or even that of the other provinces, although this 
jurisdiction was conferred under the Constitution that governs 
us. I would remind the government that natural resources are a 
provincial responsibility, under the Constitution of 1867, and 
that this right was reaffirmed by the 1982 Liberal coup.
<P>
	So much for this government's respect for its partners. By 
establishing this department, the government repudiates the 
basic principles which should govern efficient management of 
this country. It also creates a new bone of contention between 
the provinces, the territories and itself.
<P>
	I will never lay enough stress on this issue. I have said it 
before and I repeat: Natural resources are a provincial area of 
jurisdiction in which the federal government has no business. 
We have to defend Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction over natural 
resources and will always do so.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, would renege on our promises and 
most of all neglect the mandate our constituents have given us, if 
we were to keep quiet about the federal government's 
involvement in an exclusively provincial area of jurisdiction. 
We cannot stand idly by in the face of such an attack and a bill 
which, as it stands now, is an affront to the politicians in Quebec 
and the other Canadian provinces.
<P>
	I do not understand how they can boast that they are acting in 
the best interests of the country, when they do not even abide by 
their own Constitution. If the government really wanted to 
respect the terms of the Constitution of Canada, it would abolish 
the Department of Natural Resources and let the provinces 
manage this area which comes under their own jurisdiction.
<P>
	Since the very beginning, every successive Quebec 
government has defended the provincial areas of jurisdiction 
defined in the Canadian Constitution, starting with Mr. Lesage, 
``Masters in our own house'', and then Mr. Johnson, 
``Sovereignty or Independence'', but even before their time, 
Quebec had always requested provincial autonomy.
<P>
	Even the more federalist of the Quebec premiers have insisted 
that the Constitution be fully applied, especially in the area of 
natural resources.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	As is, this bill allows the government to enter into agreements 
with organizations as well as individuals and companies. It 
allows the government to award contracts in the natural 
resources and forestry sectors, even to individuals. Yet, the 
achievement of 1982, the 1982 Constitution Act, defines very 
clearly the provincial areas of jurisdiction enshrined in section 
92(a) concerning the development, conservation and 
management of forest resources, including laws in relation to 
the rate of primary production therefrom.
<P>
	Every successive Quebec government has asked that Quebec 
jurisdiction over natural resources be respected and now this bill 
negates these repeated requests.
<P>
	Just one year ago, a known federalist, Quebec minister Sirros, 
stated in the National Assembly Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction 
over the management of natural resources over the Quebec 
territory. It seems that this government did not pay heed to his 
call, since we have here an Act to establish the Department of 
Natural Resources, which, if this bill is passed, will have full 
jurisdiction in this area.
<P>
	With this bill, the Canadian government assumes powers and 
rights that directly infringe upon the exclusive jurisdiction of 
the provinces in terms of natural resources and this, to us, is 
unacceptable.
<P>
	Clause 27.3(1)(<I>c</I>) of Bill C-48 is a very good example. It 
reads:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) may enter into agreements with the government of any</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>province or with any person-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is where the problem lies:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-for forest protection and management or forest utilization, for the conduct 
of research related thereto or for forestry publicity or education;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8184"> 8184 </A></B>
<P>
	If there is an area in which we, Quebecers, have excelled, it is 
forestry. If there is an area which is truly ours since 1867, it is 
also forestry. And yet, Bill C-48 allows the Canadian 
government to put Quebec's jurisdiction aside and to enter into 
agreements with individuals, organizations and companies.
<P>
	If at least the government had included an obligation to 
consult the governments of Quebec or the other provinces 
concerned, Bill C-48 would not have been acceptable, but it 
could have been less offensive, less detrimental to 
federal-provincial relations.
<P>
	Clause 35 is a good example of this desire to interfere in an 
area under provincial jurisdiction. In order to understand the 
significance of this clause, I think it is worth reading it again. It 
reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>5. The Minister may cause distribution to be made of duplicate specimens to 
scientific, literary and educational institutions in Canada and other countries, and 
may authorize the distribution or sale of publications, maps and other documents 
issued by the Department.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	There is nothing too serious up to that point. I will continue:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>6. Subject to section 4 of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources Act 
respecting the powers, duties and functions of the Minister in relation to matters 
mentioned in that section over which Parliament has jurisdiction, the Minister 
shall be responsible for coordinating, promoting and recommending national 
policies and programs with respect to energy, mines and minerals, water and 
other resources-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	All this in an area under provincial jurisdiction. Clause 35 of 
the bill goes on as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-and, in carrying out his responsibilities under this section, the Minister may</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) conduct applied and basic research programs and investigations and economic 
studies in relation to those resources, and for that purpose maintain and operate 
research institutes, laboratories, observatories and other facilities for exploration 
and research related to the source, origin, properties, development or use of those 
resources;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, all this in an area under provincial jurisdiction. Let us 
move on. The Minister can:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) study, keep under review and consider recommendations with respect to matters 
relating to the exploration for, or the production, recovery, manufacture, processing, 
transmission, transportation, distribution, sale, purchase, exchange or disposition of 
any of those resources, and with respect to matters relating to the sources of those 
resources within or outside Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are still in an area of provincial jurisdiction as recognized 
by the Canadian Constitution. But the highlight of the bill is 
undoubtedly the following paragraph.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>7.(1) The Minister may, in exercising the powers and carrying out the duties and 
functions mentioned in section 6, formulate plans for the conservation, development 
and use of the resources specified in that section and for related research and the 
Minister may carry out those plans in cooperation with other  departments, branches 
and agencies of the Government of Canada.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The federal government assumes all powers in an area which 
comes entirely under provincial jurisdiction. Allow me to draw 
to your attention the fact that provincial governments have not 
been mentioned once since the beginning of clause 35. Clause 35 
concludes in these terms:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In formulating and carrying out any plans under subsection (1), the Minister 
may:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) cooperate with the provinces and with municipalities;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) enter into agreements with any person or body, including the government 
of any province or any department, branch or agency of such a government, 
respecting the carrying out of those plans; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) make grants and contributions and, with the approval of the Governor in 
Council, provide other forms of financial assistance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) The Minister may, in exercising the powers and carrying out the duties and 
functions mentioned in this section, including in relations to technical 
surveys, consult with, and inaugurate conferences of representatives of 
producers, industry, the universities, labour and provincial and municipal 
authorities.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	That means the Minister can even go directly to 
municipalities without consulting the provincial authorities. In 
my opinion, clause 35 represents one of the worst attacks this 
government has ever made against powers handed down to 
provinces since it came to office. Voting against this bill is of the 
utmost importance.
<P>
	Since when can the federal government enter into agreements 
with municipalities without the province's consent? Since when 
does the federal government have the right to invade a field of 
provincial jurisdiction without the province's agreement or 
without even having to consult it? Such an attitude leads me to 
believe that no understanding, no harmony is possible in a 
country where the central government acts without the 
agreement of its main partners. One would think that this 
government cannot read its own Constitution, that of Canada. 
One would think that it is deaf when it comes to Quebec's and 
the provinces' claims.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	What we see with Bill C-48 is a government insisting on 
trespassing on an area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction 
without the legitimacy that the explicit agreement of Quebec 
would confer on its action. A government which is getting 
involved in the writing of Canada-wide standards regarding 
natural resources. A government which has not learned from 
past mistakes and still believes that coast-to-coast policies are 
the key to collective wealth. This is completely false.
<P>
	It is also a government which is harbouring the very same 
illusions it denounced in the past. This government is giving 
itself the means to act directly, without anybody's agreement, 
particularly that of the main stakeholders, the provinces, by 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8185"> 8185 </A></B>
<P>
financing agencies or individuals directly. It is also a 
government which is  bypassing the provinces, dealing directly 
with municipal governments, even though, under the 1867 
Constitution, they come under the authority of provincial 
governments.
<P>
	Finally, Bill C-48 confirms that this government could not 
care less about the claims of Quebec and the provinces and that 
it intends, as much as possible, to disregard the Constitution 
which governs us, in order to act as it pleases and achieve its 
ends, no matter what the cost to taxpayers in Quebec and this 
country.
<P>
	I will bet that many of my colleagues from the other provinces 
agree with me. I will bet that many of my colleagues opposite 
think the same way but will never dare come out into the open 
about it, for fear of being repudiated by their own government. 
Let me tell them any way that such unsolicited federal 
interventions in a provincial area of jurisdiction cause awful 
overlapping all over the place.
<P>
	We are going through difficult economic times. The provinces 
already have long-established natural resources strategies. 
What is the federal government doing if not duplicating 
whatever is already there? I am sure that Canadian taxpayers, to 
whom this government is so committed, would not approve of 
this. If they were asked tomorrow if they agreed with paying 
double for the sake of satisfying this government's centralizing 
designs, I know what they would say. Their answer would be a 
clear one. I am sure that they would never agree that the current 
Liberal government act this way. As far as we, in Quebec, are 
concerned, it goes without saying that we will not accept this 
disgraceful luxury of paying double all the time.
<P>
	Let me give you an example with respect to forest 
management, over which this government is unduly assuming 
power by establishing the Department of Natural Resources. 
The provincial strategy tabled by the government of Quebec in 
May 1994 illustrates my point. This strategy is well and truly 
independent from the National Forest Strategy developed by the 
federal government and the Canadian Council of Forest 
Ministers. The people of Quebec have to pay for both strategies. 
The people from my riding have to pay for both. We are sick and 
tired of that.
<P>
	This government completely disregards the Constitution that 
governs it. It has also completely disregarded the very 
legitimate demands of all Quebecers for at least 30 years. The 
time has come for Quebecers to make a decision that will allow 
them to finally exercise the powers they are entitled to.
<P>
<B>(1605) </B>
<P>
	In November 1990, the House Standing Committee on 
Forestry and Fisheries, although made up of hard-core 
federalists, said that in the 20th century, the government tried 
several times to influence national forestry policies, but that it 
encountered provincial resistance to any potential interference 
in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. Committee 
members felt that the federal  government clearly had to play a 
much more serious role in guaranteeing the success of any 
national forestry policy.
<P>
	We must come to the conclusion that the current government 
has not learned anything from the past. We also note that, 
although many observers recommended that the federal 
government take the Constitution into account in dealing with 
natural resources, this government continues to display the 
same interfering and contemptuous attitude toward a level of 
government which nonetheless has jurisdiction over natural 
resources. Quebec has always demanded the same powers over 
natural resources and forestry. Quebec was opposed to creating 
the Department of Forestry, which it rightly saw as federal 
interference in an area of provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	Quebec also did not ratify the National Forest Strategy. Since 
1991, after the resounding failure of the Meech Lake Accord, no 
Quebec minister has participated in the activities of the 
Canadian Council of Forest Ministers. In fact, Quebec just 
recently released its own strategy on forest management. It is 
certainly its prerogative, considering that this sector falls under 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	We will never support Bill C-48. We will never tolerate this 
undue and unacceptable interference in a field of provincial 
jurisdiction. I am not just referring to Quebec but also to the 
other provinces. We will never tolerate this unjustifiable desire 
to deprive another level of government of its vested powers. As 
Bloc Quebecois members, we will never support this kind of 
action.
<P>
	Nor will taxpayers, and particularly those in my riding of 
Matapédia-Matane, ever let those who govern waste public 
money by duplicating services. As the elected representatives of 
Quebecers, we will never let the government ruin the efforts of 
generations of Quebecers to develop their natural resources the 
way they wanted to do it.
<P>
	I hope that members will seriously consider the implications 
of this bill and will send the government back to the drawing 
board. If necessary, I will be pleased to make my plea again and 
again, because the government does not have the right to resort 
to useless duplication in order to gain some specific power. 
Since it took office, this government has been centralizing over 
and over. This legislation is yet another attempt to gnaw away at 
the powers of Quebec and the other provinces. The government 
is increasingly bent on gaining power, instead of trying to 
manage taxpayers' money. The Bloc Quebecois will oppose any 
such attempt to gain power.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak on Bill 
C-48, an act to establish the Department of Natural Resources 
and related acts.
<P>
	We do not have any significant problems with the bill at 
present, so I will use this time to expand on some ideas on 
natural resource management that our party would like to put 
forward to help improve this very important aspect of our 
country.
<P>
	Canada has a number of resources, both human and natural. 
Being so large and so rich in so many of these resources, it is 
critically important that we manage them properly. Our natural 
resources, including fish, lumber, mining and water, are 
extensive. Few countries in the world can claim to be as rich as 
we are in natural resources. In fact the standard of living of all 
Canadians is intimately associated with these resources.
<P>
	Natural resources are under siege, as they are in every other 
country in the world. What we do now is critically important in 
how these resources survive in the future. I would first like to 
deal with the latter, our natural resources, and go through some 
of the specific principles that we need to apply to them to ensure 
they will survive in the future for coming generations. I would 
also like to deal with some specific problems, in particular some 
of the problems affecting where I live in British Columbia.
<P>
	First and foremost, the most important principle in natural 
resources is sustainable development. Much damage has already 
been done by the generations that preceded us and the current 
generation in dealing with our natural resources.
<P>
	Everybody hears much about the ozone depletion, about the 
decrease in biodiversity that has occurred all over the world, 
from the flora and the fauna, the well known animals and plants 
now being affected such as the tigers and black rhino to the 
lesser known plants that are being decimated and wiped off the 
face of the planet every day.
<P>
	As an aside, this lack of biodiversity is a huge loss to us as a 
species. For within that wealth of biodiversity exists a potential 
for those species that have become extinct that will never be 
explored, a potential we can use in industry, in medicine to save 
lives, to help our species and other species on the planet.
<P>
	Desertification has occurred as a result of the 
mismanagement of our natural resources. A wide swath is gone 
all over our world that has rendered arable land into deserts. 
Land that was once productive now is not and never will be 
again, at least not in our lifetimes. It will never be able to 
produce the food stuffs, the agriculture, the homes that the 
people of the world need and that our burgeoning population 
will require.
<P>
	As a country we have been very guilty of deforestation in the 
past. We have criticized Brazil for its deforestation practices, 
but we have been as guilty as them. Much has been done over the 
last few years to undo this, in part because of the loud outcry and 
the interest of the Canadian people, but also because of special 
interest and environmental groups that have comes on side to 
help be watchdogs for what has gone on in our natural resources.
<P>
	Pollution plays a very important part because various aspects 
of pollution are decimating areas that we will forever have to 
live with on land, in lakes, water bodies and in the Arctic. All we 
need do is talk to the aboriginal people that live in the north to 
know what horrible things have happened to the pristine areas 
that once existed in our north.
<P>
<B>(1615) </B>
<P>
	This is not something that is only specific to our country, but 
to all of the countries that share the Arctic borders. Pollution is 
rampant. Foodstuffs are going down and they too are being 
polluted. It is happening all over. Toxic wastes are being 
dumped. All these things are occurring now and need to be 
addressed now for, as I said before, what we do at this moment 
will forever impart on future generations. Things are not getting 
better.
<P>
	Look at the acidification that has been occurring in the Great 
Lakes. Where I used to live in Ontario, thousands and thousands 
of beautiful lakes that used to have such an enormous resource 
of fish are dying. There is a wasteland of lakes in Ontario and in 
Quebec that has been rendered useless because of the 
acidification and the dumping of acid rain into these lakes, a 
profound tragedy, lakes that now it is too late to do anything 
about.
<P>
	Perhaps if we address this problem now, in the future we can 
get a handle on it and prevent this from happening and do things 
to bring them back to the state that they were once in.
<P>
	We should also like to address another aspect that is not often 
discussed in natural resources, that is the burgeoning world 
population, a population that now stands at 5.7 billion and in a 
mere 37 years will double to over 10 billion people. It is 
interesting to note that it has taken the entire history of man to 
get to our current stage of 5.7 billion but it will only take 37 
years to double that.
<P>
	I ask everybody to consider what will happen to the future of 
our population and our world when that population doubles. 
When that happens we will have an increase in the demand on 
our resources, an increase in the demand on our natural 
resources, on our environment and on our security. A broadened 
definition of security, we are now finding, will include our 
military security, our environmental security and our social 
security.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8187"> 8187 </A></B>
<P>
	These increasing demands on our limited resources will result 
in conflicts among people, which will result in migration of 
people from areas that have not to areas that have, which will 
impact on every country in the world. Do not think because we 
might live a half a world away that it will not because it certainly 
will. There are recent historical precedents to support that.
<P>
	I would like to put forth some constructive solutions that we 
can all work together to fulfil. First, I support and urge the 
government to engage in fulfilling transboundary agreements 
throughout countries over areas such as pollution, in particular 
with the United States, and with the transboundary agreements 
that we will need to fulfil with countries bounding the Arctic.
<P>
	We need common rules on trade and the environment that will 
enable us to fulfil a rules based free trade agreement that will 
provide us, a relatively small country, with the powers to fulfil 
and protect our own environmental areas.
<P>
	I would also like to see a larger emphasis from our dwindling 
foreign aid dollar to be put on providing for education and safe, 
effective birth control measures for all people no matter where 
they live.
<P>
	We need to have education for the public for, as members of 
the House know, 80 per cent of the world's resources are 
consumed by a mere 20 per cent of the people. Not only must we 
address what goes on half a world away, but we must look into 
our own areas, our own spheres of influence to address these 
problems in our own home. Without doing this we cannot 
credibly ask other countries to do the same.
<P>
	We must aggressively market our natural resources in a 
sustainable fashion. I would suggest that we put an increased 
emphasis on our value added product.
<P>
	One of the great accomplishments in recent times of our 
country has been the ability of our country to negotiate the 
World Trade Organization, an enormous accomplishment for a 
country as small as ours. I hope this will improve the links 
between trade and sustainable development that will occur 
among a number of countries and we as a country can actually 
act.
<P>
	On the World Trade Organization, I hope we can enter into 
this rules based system. This brings to mind one of the enormous 
strengths that our country has that we as Canadians tend to 
downplay.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I have said this before in the House. We are one of the few 
countries in the world that has the ability in terms of diplomacy, 
in terms of international respect, to bring countries together, 
bring them to the table, bring them to negotiate problems before 
they happen and to engage in discussions and agreements that 
will help to provide for sustainable development aspects and 
controls over pollution for a number of countries.
<P>
	I do not have very much time but I would like to address a 
couple of aspects that affect in particular the west coast of 
British Columbia. One is the fisheries department.
<P>
	We have on the west coast a horrible situation with the 
widespread decimation of fish which is definitely a sustainable 
resource, one that has been recently decimated, one that is on the 
verge of going the way the east coast fishery has tragically gone. 
I hope our minister of fisheries will accept some of the 
suggestions we have made and look at some of the solutions that 
we have put forth.
<P>
	The problems occurring on the west coast are not merely 
environmental. There is terrible poaching occurring by all facets 
of the fishing industry, by commercial fishermen, 
non-commercial fishermen, sports fishermen, Canadians, 
Americans, aboriginals and non-aboriginals. All people within 
these sectors are responsible in part for this terrible decimation.
<P>
	I would encourage strongly the minister of fisheries to engage 
in a judicial inquiry to determine once and for all what the root 
cause is and to root out the terrible things that have occurred in 
our west coast fishery. We cannot hide our head in the sand any 
longer to what is occurring.
<P>
	Within the context of fisheries I know that we are constrained 
very much by fiscal restraints. I would suggest that the minister 
streamline the administration of the department of fisheries, 
there is a study that was done some years ago to this extent, but 
on the other hand to buttress up the department of fisheries 
officers who do an incredible job to try to save and help the west 
coast and east coast fisheries.
<P>
	Another aspect is the forestry industry. Half of all the money 
that we actually earn on Vancouver Island comes from forestry. 
Recently we have come to an agreement that will enable us to 
have a sustainable west coast industry. I hope we will be able to 
use the expertise from that to teach other countries what we have 
learned from our mistakes.
<P>
	Certainly there are terrible miscalculations and forestry 
practices that have occurred in the past in British Columbia. I 
think we are on the way to mending those. I hope in the future we 
will not lose sight of the recent accomplishments that we have 
made in this area and that we will be able to go ahead and expand 
these to not only involve forestry but also to involve the mining 
industry and other industries.
<P>
	I would make a few suggestions about the division of natural 
resources. In these days of fiscal restraint does it not make sense 
for us to further divide the areas of responsibility? Clearly most 
of the responsibility lies with the provinces. I would encourage 
this government to give some of the federal responsibilities to 
provincial jurisdictions where they truly belong. In this way we 
could streamline the administration, streamline the 
responsibilities, decrease the administration and save the 
taxpayer a great deal of money.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8188"> 8188 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, we are faced with a balancing act between the 
needs and demands of an economy and a people who have to earn 
a living and must provide for themselves and on the other hand a 
need to balance the needs of our environment. Without a 
sustainable resource, without a safe, effective environment for 
ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren we will not 
be in a world that we will want to live in.
<P>
	I hope we will take these principles and apply sustainable 
development to our beautiful natural resources so that we and 
future generations will be able to enjoy them.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leonard Hopkins (Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to say a few words on the bill which 
sets up the Department of Natural Resources. It is a very 
important one. It amalgamates the old Department of Energy 
Mines and Resources and Forestry Canada. Forestry Canada has 
been of extreme importance to this nation as a whole since day 
one of Canadian colonial history. I have said before in the House 
that the three things that were the economic foundation of 
pioneer days in Canada and certainly since Confederation were 
the fisheries, forestry and agriculture. All of them certainly have 
their challenges in today's world.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Bill C-48, the bill before us today, makes explicit reference to 
the minister's duty to foster the sustainable development of 
Canada's energy, mineral and forest resources. This means that 
the government's economic, social and environmental 
objectives will be factored into all decisions about resource 
development management and use.
<P>
	One way the new department will pursue sustainable 
development is through the work of its scientific branches. 
Natural Resources Canada will continue to have vibrant science 
and technology arms in the form of the Canadian Forest Service, 
the Geological Survey of Canada, the Canada Centre for Mineral 
and Energy Technology, and Geomatics Canada.
<P>
	Much has been said in the House today about the rights of the 
provinces. We are all very well aware that the provinces have a 
big say in natural resources. I, coming from Ontario, also know 
how some of those resources have been managed over the years. 
It is time for a co-ordinated and sustainable development 
program in co-operation with both provincial and federal 
governments.
<P>
	There are many examples of partnerships between the federal 
government and the provinces. Great efforts have been made to 
build a bridge for the two. For instance, the Canadian Council of 
Forest Ministers from across Canada has recently agreed on a 
framework for future co-operation in the areas of science and 
technology, international trade issues, regional development, 
aboriginal forestry and national co-ordination.
<P>
	In the energy area the department is working closely with 
Environment Canada officials, the provinces and other 
stakeholders to develop a national action program on climate 
change. This is in keeping with Canada's commitment to 
stabilize greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 
2000.
<P>
	This commitment follows our international obligation under 
the convention on climate change which Canada signed at the 
1992 earth summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The reason I raise 
this matter is that in today's world it is not as simple as in past 
Canadian history to say this little compartment belongs to the 
provinces, this belongs to the federal government, and so on. 
With new technology, new demands and our outlook in the 
global world today we have to have more co-operation and 
bridge building between federal and provincial governments at 
home if we are going to compete effectively and efficiently.
<P>
	Across the country we have several research and development 
institutions with regard to the forest industry. In my own 
constituency we have a national forestry institute located near 
Chalk River. It is called the Petawawa National Forestry 
Institute because it is actually located on property owned by the 
Department of National Defence.
<P>
	It is very important because of the fire research. What is better 
for sustainable development than to have expertise in fire 
research out there? How many hectares of property, how many 
square miles of forest is destroyed every year by forest fires? 
Therefore the more we know about controlling fire the better it 
is for sustainable development.
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	What better program can we have than for example the 
research and development on the rapid growth of trees that goes 
on at the Petawawa National Forestry Institute? It has 
experimental plantations which date back to 1917.
<P>
	Base Petawawa itself was first set up by the Laurier 
government in 1905. Twelve years later, what is called Forestry 
Canada today had its roots-if I may use that term-on 41 
square miles of that territory which was purchased by the 
Government of Canada in 1905 for a military base. The 
Department of National Defence has honoured the research 
going on in that 41 square mile area. Research cannot be turned 
off overnight. Some of the ongoing experiments there are 
decades old. It is a very important institute.
<P>
	Other institutes across Canada, in western Canada, Quebec 
and Atlantic Canada also have a tremendous amount of work 
going on of a positive nature for the country's forestry industry. 
I have no problems with the Department of Natural Resources 
promoting forestry research in Canada. It has always been a 
federal responsibility in Canada to do part of forestry research. 
The provinces do part of forestry research. There is no big 
conflict. They are talking to each other and  co-operating. That 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8189"> 8189 </A></B>
<P>
is what Canadian federalism and the Canadian national spirit is 
all about.
<P>
	Some other very important institutions are attached to the 
Department of Natural Resources. I want to talk about one of my 
favourite subjects today. That is Atomic Energy of Canada 
Limited which reports through the Minister of Natural 
Resources to the House of Commons.
<P>
	I was quite concerned one day not too long ago. I was sitting in 
the House listening to a speaker from across the way talk about 
the waste and lack of productivity in crown corporations and so 
on. I was trying to get the floor but time ran out so I am going to 
say now what I wanted to say then.
<P>
	Atomic Energy of Canada Limited is a crown corporation and 
has been around as a corporation since 1952. It was started by 
the National Research Council of Canada in about 1945. I will 
give some very revealing highlights of this crown corporation 
which has been a success to the country.
<P>
	Research and development is the force that drives the 
economy in any nation and I will give some facts. In developing 
Canada's nuclear energy capability, the federal government has 
appropriated $4.7 billion to Atomic Energy of Canada Limited 
since 1952. That is for the last 42 years. After putting $4.7 
billion into it, what is our return?
<P>
	Ernst &amp; Young, a well-known consulting firm, has made a 
report on that very issue and has come up with this evidence. At 
least $23 billion was contributed to Canada's gross domestic 
product by the nuclear industry from 1962 to 1992. Within a 
30-year period $23 billion came back into the gross domestic 
product of this country from an investment by the Canadian 
taxpayers of $4.7 billion over the 40-year period from 1952 to 
1992. If we simply subtract $4.7 billion from $23 billion there is 
a gross net gain of $18.3 billion for Canada's economy. And 
someone has the nerve to stand in the House and state that it has 
been a drain on the Canadian economy.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	Let me give another fact. Ontario has a large industrial 
community. Yes it was hurt by free trade for a while but it is 
coming back. A rather interesting statistic is that today 60 per 
cent of the energy supplied for industrial and domestic use in the 
province of Ontario comes from CANDU reactors. If we did not 
have them we would have to use more coal.
<P>
	Because of geography, the coal for the southern Ontario coal 
burning plants has been imported from the United States. 
Ontario Hydro estimates that from 1965 to 1989 nuclear energy 
has saved the Canadian economy approximately $17 billion on 
foreign exchange. That is because we are not shipping money 
out of Canada to Pennsylvania and other areas in the United 
States to buy hard coal for coal powered plants. Think of what 
the saving is on environmental issues in the province of Ontario 
alone.
<P>
	These facts have to be put on the record because there are too 
many statements made which attack Canadian organizations and 
other traditions and institutions of the country without having 
the proper facts to back them up.
<P>
	In the 1990s foreign exchange savings will amount to 
approximately $1 billion a year.
<P>
	We recently sold two reactors to China. That will mean a lot of 
money to businesses in this country. One thing was not highly 
emphasized during the recent trade negotiations with China. An 
important event that happened during the visit of the Prime 
Minister, the nine premiers and approximately 375 business 
people to China was the signing of a nuclear non-proliferation 
treaty between Canada and China.
<P>
	Once again Canada is leading the way in putting in place those 
cornerstones of international necessity with this agreement 
between our two countries. That reminds us of something else. It 
was Canada that first recognized Red China, as it was then 
called, and recognized China as an official state. That opened 
the door for the U.S. to follow. That opened the door for 
President Nixon's visit to China. That opened the door for some 
communication which was absolutely necessary during those 
cold war days. It has fallen upon Canada to bridge the gap 
between ourselves and China and other nations can follow 
thereafter.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	Direct employment in Canada's nuclear industry in 1992 was 
estimated at 30,000 jobs. Direct employment increased 
approximately 9 per cent in a three-year period alone. A 
minimum of 10,000 jobs in other sectors indirectly depend on 
the nuclear industry, another contribution. Nuclear energy 
supplied 15 per cent of the total electricity across the whole of 
Canada in 1992 which was valued at $3.7 billion.
<P>
	Private sector companies which supply nuclear products and 
services had total sales of $9.4 billion between 1988 and 1992. 
The federal government receives approximately $700 million 
annually from the nuclear industry in the form of income and 
sales taxes. Canada's nuclear industry had a trade surplus of 
approximately $500 million individually in recent years.
<P>
	Those are some of the facts of the tremendous contribution to 
economic growth that I wanted to put on the record today.
<P>
	The problem with research and development in Canada over 
the years has simply been that people look for a return the 
morning after investing their money. That cannot be done with R 
and D.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8190"> 8190 </A></B>
<P>
	In the future we have to encourage private enterprise in 
Canada to do more and more R and D on its own. However 
government will always have a place in Canadian research and 
development. Certain areas of development would not take 
place if they were not started by the government itself. Then 
private enterprise moves in and there are spinoff industries and a 
bigger return.
<P>
	Let me give one more example of something I certainly want 
members of the House to know. There are 690 hospitals across 
Canada. I doubt very much if there is a single member in this 
House who is not affected by the fact that those 690 hospitals are 
licensed by the Atomic Energy Control Board to receive medical 
radioisotopes for their hospitals for sterilization for example.
<P>
	Where do we get medical radioisotopes? From a nuclear 
reactor. One thing the Tories did badly when they were in power 
was that they sold the radiochemical part of AECL to the 
company that eventually became Nordion International. The 
whole incident has resulted in a dispute between Nordion and 
Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. A facilitator is trying to put that 
together today.
<P>
	Canada controls 88 per cent of the world's market in 
radioisotopes. The Americans heard that the former president of 
AECL had cancelled the Maple-X reactor which was in the 
process of being built. The Americans got into the act and 
hauled one of their old reactors out of Los Alamos. They tried to 
build it up so that they could produce medical radioisotopes.
<P>
<B>(1645 ) </B>
<P>
	One of the greatest contributions that can be made to Canada 
today is getting the medical radio isotope dispute settled quickly 
and getting on with the business of retaining the 88 per cent of 
world trade in radio isotopes. It has been a great contribution to 
medicine. A considerable amount of research into cancer and 
many other medical problems has been done by Atomic Energy 
of Canada Limited.
<P>
	I wish the minister well in the administration of natural 
resources and those organizations that are attached to her 
department because the natural resources department means a 
great deal to the future of the country. We need research and 
development, new science and technology and a good 
management system for our natural resources. That means 
sustainable development.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It is my duty, pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be raised 
tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the hon. 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake-Grain 
Transportation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are 
presently on third reading of Bill C-48, which will 
unfortunately end up in the bill being passed as is by the Liberal 
majority in this House.
<P>
	Relevant suggestions were made by my colleagues and myself 
at second reading to bring it more into line with the spirit of the 
Canadian Constitution, but our efforts have been in vain.
<P>
	In committee, we tried again to have certain clauses of Bill 
C-48 changed, so that the leading role of the provinces with 
respect to natural resources would be recognized. But again, the 
Liberal majority systematically rejected any proposal along 
those lines.
<P>
	Hon. members are well aware by now of all our reasons for not 
supporting this bill, but it is important to repeat what these are 
for the benefit of those who are watching the proceedings on 
television. The public must understand what this debate is really 
about and why the Bloc Quebecois is against Bill C-48, which is 
not flawed in its structure, but in its very essence.
<P>
	On behalf of the people of Quebec, who have elected us to 
look after their interests, I would like to go over once again the 
reasons, albeit obvious, why we are asking that the bill, as it 
stands, be purely and simply withdrawn.
<P>
	As my hon. colleague from Matapédia-Matane said earlier, 
anything having to do with natural resources is affected by this 
bill. The bill does not recognize the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
provinces over natural resources and, therefore, is in 
contravention of Section 92(<I>a</I>) of the Constitution Act, 1867, 
which clearly states that mines and forest fall under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction, and this was confirmed by the patriation 
of the Canadian Constitution in 1982.
<P>
	Such interference maintains redundancy among all natural 
resources ministries and departments in this country, hence the 
risk of contradiction, duplication and overlap in many regards.
<P>
	We must conclude that the federal government's lack of 
co-operation is not a healthy way to manage this country, 
because it does not look for ways to eliminate overlap and 
duplication at the Department of Natural Resources and is 
unwilling to recognize the provinces' predominance by staying 
in the background and letting the provinces design their own 
programs.
<P>
	The issue of mining and the environment is a good example. 
Contrary to common sense, the federal government is set to 
proclaim the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act and will 
soon table amendments to this 1992 act. It wants to create a 
Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency to replace the 
Federal Environmental Assessment Review Office.
<P>
	As usual, this environmental bill is not bad per se, but not 
bringing it into line with the various provincial programs will 
cause often unjustified delays because it will be cumbersome to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8191"> 8191 </A></B>
<P>
deal with two administrations instead of one. The only 
acceptable administration is that of the province concerned.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	In this regard, the mining industry is very worried about 
possible delays in processing mining licence applications. 
Decisions already take too long-often more than one 
year-and jeopardize projects because of the amounts involved 
that must be frozen over long periods of time, thus reducing 
profitability.
<P>
	For example, the Grevet mining project in my riding, which 
involves potential investments exceeding $100 million, was put 
in great jeopardy by the wait for the mining licence, in particular 
for the environmental permit. This example shows that Bill 
C-48, by failing to recognize provincial predominance, opens 
the door to interference that could seriously harm the industry, 
thus endangering jobs we all need.
<P>
	The federal government knows that the provinces have long 
had their own natural resources strategies. The provinces 
already carry out environmental assessments of projects, and 
the process that the federal government wants to put in place 
will increase overlap and duplication. The federal government 
refuses to recognize the provinces' legitimate rights; its 
assessment and review process is outrageous. It will cost 
everyone very dearly and will continue to do so if we do not find 
ways to have a ``single window'' where industry will be able to 
obtain information and where the projects will be accepted in as 
little time as possible.
<P>
	Unfortunately for the industry, which wants to be efficient 
and profitable, the federal government has new requirements. It 
wants new regulations. It wants more projects to be subject to a 
thorough review. Clearly, this means a waste of time and money, 
confusion and long delays in approving and implementing these 
projects.
<P>
	As an aside, I would like to give a specific example of the 
slowness of government bureaucracy, in particular in the 
Department of National Health and Welfare, to which I wrote on 
May 24, 1994 on behalf of several of my constituents; I received 
a reply only on October 27, 1994. If it took five months for a 
department to answer something relatively simple, Mr. Speaker, 
imagine the delays that more complex issues, like 
environmental assessments, will involve.
<P>
	In the present economic environment, we must streamline, 
and Bill C-48 would have been a good chance to do that. 
Increasing the number of structures and the amount of 
duplication must stop before it is too late. In our work on the 
parliamentary committee studying Bill C-48, we could with 
simple amendments have made several clauses reflect the 
provinces' primary jurisdiction over their natural resources.
<P>
	For example, in clause 5 on the powers, duties and functions 
of the Minister of Natural Resources, it would have been enough 
to say that these powers, duties and functions are subject to the 
principle of provincial predominance in the field of natural 
resources. This would not have reduced the powers, duties and 
functions  of the minister, but it would have reasonably put them 
in relation to provincial priorities.
<P>
	As regards clause 7, the Bloc Quebecois wanted an annual 
report to be tabled by the minister, so as to make her department 
accountable for its mandate and objectives. In his most recent 
report tabled yesterday, the Auditor General of Canada states 
clearly, on page 8 of the booklet on main points: ``7.1 Two years 
ago we called for government to reform its departmental 
reporting to be more transparent. We suggested that Parliament 
should expect and receive a regular accounting for the exercise 
of the entire business of government: in a phrase, global 
stewardship. This year, we continue this theme of transparency 
by following up on our 1992 Report, and extend it to the sectoral 
activities of government''.
<P>
	``7.4 We believe that there should be better sectoral reporting. 
This means that when a sectoral activity is identified, one 
department has to be given the lead responsibility to provide a 
summary-level report to Parliament for the entire sector''.
<P>
	I should point out, Mr. Speaker, that we did not ask for an 
extensive report: we simply wanted an internal report on the 
quality of services.
<P>
	Here is one last excerpt from the Auditor General's report: 
``7.5 But in the end, reporting of any kind will not change soon 
unless Parliament is explicit in letting government know that 
current reporting is inadequate and that it wants it changed''. 
The Auditor General's report seems to confirm that it was not 
such a bad idea to ask that Bill C-48 be amended so that a clear 
and concise report be submitted at least once a year.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	It was certainly legitimate to table this amendment so that 
parliamentarians and Canadians could monitor the usefulness 
and the efficiency of the programs developed by the Department 
of Natural Resources.
<P>
	As regards clause 27 of Bill C-48, we wanted the minister to 
have the authority to enter into agreements only with the 
provinces and not with any person or body of her choice, since 
only the provinces can define their policy on natural resources. 
Clearly, overlapping and duplication could resurface if, for 
some reason, the minister decided to promote a specific policy.
<P>
	Finally, clause 35 of Bill C-48 not only suggests overlapping 
and duplication but also federal interference in a field of 
provincial jurisdiction, as stated in the Canadian Constitution.
<P>
	Indeed, through clause 35, the minister is giving herself the 
power to enter into agreements with any person or body in a 
province, without that province having any say. As I mentioned 
earlier, the issue is not the quality of the federal government's 
action. The member who spoke just before me noted that it is 
sometimes necessary to have a national policy as, for example, 
in the case of nuclear energy. No province has a  concrete 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8192"> 8192 </A></B>
<P>
nuclear energy policy, although many provinces have policies in 
terms of forestry and mining.
<P>
	The issue here is not to control the quality of federal 
measures, but to ensure that the federal government acts within 
its jurisdiction and respects the agreements and policies 
elaborated by the provinces.
<P>
	In fact, Quebec has never signed the National Forest Strategy 
nor the Whitehorse Work Group Agreement concerning the 
mining industry. Quebec wants the federal government to 
recognize the predominance of provinces in the area of natural 
resources before signing any document appointing the federal 
government as the national director whose decisions provinces 
would have to follow in order to get tax money.
<P>
	This is why Quebec wants the right to opt out, that is to 
withdraw from a federal program with full financial 
compensation.
<P>
	Given the financial crisis we are going through, we are 
entitled to ask politicians and legislators to focus on efficiency. 
It is possible.
<P>
	Right now, all the members sitting on the Standing Committee 
on Natural Resources are examining briefs concerning the 
mining industry which were submitted by witnesses from 
various provincial governments and the industry. Their goal is 
to prepare the most accurate report possible on the tools needed 
to promote the mining industry and job creation in this area. 
This type of co-operation is a credit to the members. Efficiency 
could have been the main concern during the drafting of Bill 
C-48, as in the case of any other bill.
<P>
	In concluding, I would like to mention the position of the 
Quebec Minister of Natural Resources, presented by Mr. 
Jacques Robitaille at the annual meeting of the Canadian 
Council of Forestry Ministers on October 4 and 5, 1994, and I 
quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Regarding the main point on the agenda, Quebec's position is as follows: We 
will not be a party to preparing and ratifying a framework agreement whose 
purpose would be to assign a role to the federal government in an area over 
which the provinces have exclusive jurisdiction.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Both Constitution Acts are perfectly clear on the forestry sector, in that 
management of forest resources is the exclusive jurisdiction of the legislatures 
of the provinces. In this context, we could not consider approving any 
intervention in this sector by the federal government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Furthermore, as far as financing is concerned, Quebec favours bilateral 
agreements that identify funding procedures for programs based on the 
priorities of the provinces and administered and delivered by the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This position is clear and ought to be reflected in the spirit of 
Bill C-48. Considering that the principle of provincial priorities 
is not reflected in Bill C-48, we will vote against the bill.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to speak to Bill C-48, a bill on natural 
resources. This is particularly important to my constituency of 
Kootenay East because many of its people are directly employed 
in the resource industry.
<P>
	I would like to speak briefly about mining and about forestry. 
In my constituency I have Canada's largest operating mine. In 
1991 over 5,200 British Columbians were employed directly by 
the coal industry. These jobs represent 12,500 jobs in the service 
sector. As a matter of fact, over 15,000 workers in the 
transportation and service sectors rely on the coal industry for 
their livelihoods.
<P>
	My constituency office is in the town of Cranbrook and is as 
directly related to that as is the Elk Valley. The House should 
also recognize that coal accounts fully for 20 per cent of all rail 
traffic in Canada. Therefore coal is a very important issue to 
Canada and to our natural resources.
<P>
	One of the difficulties I have had in coming to Ottawa, indeed 
in coming to the House, is that there is very frequently the 
impression left that natural resources somehow are a sunset 
industry, that is that industries related to natural resources are 
somehow in sunset and that the information highway is going to 
carry us off into the future.
<P>
	Truly we do have to be working on the high tech side of our 
economy but as I see it we continue to be in Canada, whether we 
want to be or not, very dependent on natural resources. In 1991 
B.C. coal producers exported 22 million tonnes of metallurgical 
coal and 2.8 million tonnes of thermal coal. These sales were 
worth $1.6 billion. That is a lot of money. When I combine that 
together with the international sales of forestry of $22 billion, 
we get an idea of the importance of natural resources.
<P>
	The problem particularly in the case of the mining industry is 
that the multilevel of Canadian governments is basically taxing 
the business out of existence in Canada. Between 1987 and 1991 
the B.C. coal producers combined earned only $8 million, but 
they were taxed $454 million. Let me repeat that because I think 
it is very significant. Combined over a five-year period the B.C. 
coal producers earned only $8 million but in the same period of 
time paid taxes of $454 million. For every $1 of profit these 
producers were taxed $57.
<P>
	Since 1991 tax increases in B.C. have added $12 million to 
$15 million a year to the coal producers' costs. The B.C. coal 
industry is facing a grim future. The choice is between coal 
output and reducing employment. Unfortunately for the workers 
in the Elk Valley they are too familiar with the choices that are 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8193"> 8193 </A></B>
<P>
currently having to be made. The cost of increased production is 
unmanageable. The only choice in order to remain solvent is to 
reduce jobs.
<P>
	In 1992 two of the coal mines in my constituency closed, 
causing the loss of 1,900 jobs in an area with a population of 
approximately 10,000. We can see the significance of this. 
Although the mines have reopened, they now only employ half 
the original number of employees. The House should also also 
be aware of the fact that human resources development currently 
has decided to go against a ruling by Revenue Canada and is 
going after registered retirement pension funds of the former 
employees in an attempt to regain overpayments of UI.
<P>
	I am currently fighting that on behalf of the workers in the 
area. We get an idea of how far we have gone. Some of these 
people are losing their homes and the government, right now 
with two departments in conflict with each other, is going after 
these people's registered pension funds. I find that absolutely, 
totally unacceptable.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Back to the issue at hand, the Canadian mining industry is 
already taxed higher than any of its international counterparts 
and because of the larger tax burden Canadian coal has become 
less competitive in international markets. The fact is that 
international prices have plunged 35 per cent in metallurgical 
coal and thermal coal has plunged 20 per cent since 1987. Yet 
what has happened to taxes? We know what has happened to 
taxes. They have increased.
<P>
	Another problem for the coal miners in my area is that mineral 
minimum taxes are more than three times higher for coal mines 
and hard rock mines in British Columbia. Property taxes are 
more than three times higher for coal industry than residential 
rates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> Tory times were hard times.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> If Tory times were hard times it would be very 
advantageous if the Liberals would learn from the hard times of 
the Tories and do something about the situation in my 
constituency. The simplest way to describe taxes is confiscation 
of capital, confiscation of the capital required by the companies 
to be able to do the job.
<P>
	When the GST was introduced it was sold to industries as a tax 
that would benefit the export industry because it removed 
hidden taxes. The $100,000 of federal sales taxes the GST 
removed from the average mine was overshadowed by $600,000 
to $1 million created in fuel taxes. Coal producers paid $4.4 
million in federal fuel taxes and another $5.4 million in 
provincial taxes.
<P>
	Furthermore, to move the coal from the coalfield in the 
southeast corner of British Columbia to port, those fuel taxes are 
yet another factor that puts them at a severe disadvantage to 
other producers around the world.
<P>
	It was interesting that the member for 
Renfrew-Nipissing-Pembroke was referring to the fact that 
the thermal plants operated by Ontario Hydro are powered by 
coal imported from the U.S. He said it very well. What this 
basically means is that the coal miners, the workers in Canada, 
do not have the jobs. Furthermore the coal imported from 
Kentucky has a significantly higher sulphur content than the 
coal that is currently available in my constituency.
<P>
	Why are we not using a more benign coal, the B.C. coal, at 
Ontario Hydro? Why are we not employing the people in British 
Columbia to mine and refine the coal and deliver it to Ontario 
Hydro? Why are we sending the dollars to the United States? It 
is because taxes cost jobs. The taxes on the transportation of the 
coal from the southeast corner of British Columbia to Ontario 
means that we use a dirtier coal, coal from Kentucky, we send 
them our money and we let their workers work. Taxes cost jobs.
<P>
	The country was founded on its abundance of natural 
resources. Our rich mineral deposits have sustained the quality 
of life which Canadians have become accustomed to. We only 
need to take a look at what has happened in the fishing industry, 
particularly on the east coast and now under the current minister 
of fisheries. I should call him the oceans minister. We are 
coming to much the same kind of situation on the west coast. 
The difference is that due to the mismanagement by the 
department of Canadian oceans we have lost our resources. In 
the case of the west coast due to the continuing mismanagement 
our resources are under threat.
<P>
	The difference is that in this case, in mining, the resources are 
still available but the mining is being taxed out of existence 
rather than the resources going away. We need to make sure that 
we have the ability to continue to draw on this resource. The 
mineral resources in British Columbia, the current proven 
mineral resources, show us that at the current rate of production 
there is another 500 years of production available.
<P>
	The European governments provide $14.8 billion U.S. in 
subsidies to their domestic coal producers. I am not suggesting 
that we should subsidize our coal producers but I am saying that 
we must stop taxing the life out of Canadian mines.
<P>
<B>(1710 ) </B>
<P>
	We are going right at the moment into the abyss of a chasm 
that we require a rail bridge across. When we put that rail bridge 
across the chasm in the mountains we then say that is a property 
improvement. As a result the regional districts along the way 
between the coal mines and port end up actually charging 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8194"> 8194 </A></B>
<P>
municipal taxes on the bridges, on the rail line, in the mountains 
going across the chasm.
<P>
	What is going on in Canada at the moment is that we are 
taxing our mines, taxing our natural resources at such a rate that 
we are going to put them out of production.
<P>
	The government saw firsthand how a reduction of cigarette 
tax created a greater volume of revenue through the increase in 
consumption. If we were to take a hard look at what we are doing 
in terms of taxes on our coal mines, on our mineral producers, on 
our natural resource producers, we would see that by lowering 
the taxes they would be able to increase demand.
<P>
	Our party is in an interesting position because on one side of 
the coin, particularly with respect to Bill C-48, we are saying 
that the Department of Natural Resources must be downsized at 
the federal level. There must be more power to be able to 
regulate at the provincial level. We must see a decrease in 
expenditures at the federal level and we must see a decrease in 
control.
<P>
	That is our position. However I must relate to the House that 
there is an interesting situation in the province of British 
Columbia where there is an NDP government. It seems to have 
some kind of an idea that it can do things completely out of 
context to what world demands are. It has come forward with a 
study called ``The Committee on Resources and Environment'', 
CORE. Under CORE there have been studies. There has been 
input from a tremendous number of people. It has come back 
with a report that supposedly has a very broad base. I see more 
regulation, not only taxes.
<P>
	It is not just me. I will read very briefly from a couple of news 
reports. Cranbrook city council will oppose implementation of 
the east Kootenay CORE report recommendation. In unveiling 
the report Owen, the person responsible for putting the report 
together, said east Kootenay CORE table members can take 
pride in the fact they put it together. This has been an ongoing 
process for about 18 months. That did not sit well with 
councillors Ron Tarr and Jim Kenelly. ``It was not a made in the 
Kootenay report'', Tarr said. ``It was a Stephen Owen report'', 
said Kenelly.
<P>
	In speaking to the people who took the time, and they took a 
lot of time to get into the consultation process, I am told that the 
CORE report simply does not reflect what was agreed to at the 
table. The regional district of east Kootenay on Friday passed a 
resolution asking the provincial government to delay adoption 
of the CORE report until it heard from area municipalities. The 
east Kootenay district said it had grave concerns about the plan.
<P>
	Lest we think it is just the politicians who are getting into the 
act here, the workers at Crestbrook Forest Industries Cranbrook 
sawmill have joined the list of those opposing Stephen Owen's 
east Kootenay land use report. Scott Manjack said CFI 
management has had its say and now it is their turn. The workers 
may agree with company officials but feel they should have a 
voice as well. In this instance we are on the same side, which is 
not always the case.
<P>
	We would not normally expect the workers on the green chain 
or the workers who are on the tools to necessarily be in tune with 
the company. Then we hear from a person who is actually in the 
office with the staff. There is a grassroots opposition group 
forming to fight the east Kootenay CORE report. Members fear 
it could ruin the industry. ``We are little concerned about its 
economic implications'', said Kay Eff, ``no we are a lot 
concerned''. Eff is a member of the Canadian Women and 
Timber Organization and an employee of Crestbrook Forest 
Industries. She said: ``This is not about my employer; it is about 
our economic future here''.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	Finally, we look again at the mining side. The CORE report 
recommends increasing protected areas where resource 
extraction is excluded from 13.1 per cent to 16 per cent. Coal 
bearing crown lands in the east Kootenay represent 
approximately 4 per cent of the area and yet coal mining is the 
single largest contributor to economic wealth. Coal lands 
designated as dedicated represent only 35 per cent of the total 
area of coal bearing lands, excluding private lands.
<P>
	The difficulty with this report and the reason I bring it to the 
attention of the House is that even when we talk about the 
potential of downloading some of the responsibility, the people, 
our constituents, whether they are voting at the regional district 
level, at the municipal level, at the provincial level, or at the 
federal level, must make their representatives accountable. The 
representatives must be responsible in the recommendations 
they bring forward.
<P>
	I had an opportunity a number of months ago to make a trip on 
the west coast with some members of the European Union. They 
came over to take a look at our clear cutting. I found it quite 
fascinating that as we were travelling north from Nanaimo to 
Port Alberni they were looking out the window trying to figure 
out what these tall things were beside the road. Of course they 
were 90-foot trees. They were a little bit nonplussed. They 
really did not know what it was they were looking at because a 
map that had been provided to them in Europe by the Sierra Club 
showed it as a desert.
<P>
	The legend of the map said that this area had been logged, was 
going to be logged, or was actually out of production. Yes, it had 
been logged. It had been logged 40 years ago and now we have 
90-foot trees beside the road. They were wondering what was 
going on.
<P>
	As a direct result of that trip the natural resources committee 
undertook a study on clear cut logging. The committee made a 
couple of recommendations and this comes from the report back 
to the House from the natural resources minister: ``Canada 
believes that internationally agreed rules would help all nations 
in their efforts to move toward sustainable forest management. 
Canada through the Canadian Council of Forest Ministers and in 
consultation with a broad range of stakeholders has begun a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8195"> 8195 </A></B>
<P>
process to define criteria and  indicators that will be a scientific 
and technical basis for measuring our progress toward our goal 
of sustainable forest management.
<P>
	In addition, Canada is actively participating in an 
international process to define criteria and indicators for 
temperate and boreal forests. During the past year Canada has 
cohosted with Malaysia the intergovernmental working group 
on forests to help determine the future path for international 
sustainable forest management. This will contribute to the work 
of the United Nations Commission for Sustainable Development 
as it reviews progress toward the goals agreed to at the 
UNCED''.
<P>
	I absolutely recognize, contrary to my friend in the Bloc, that 
there is a place for a Canadian natural resources department, 
particularly as it relates to international trade and international 
issues.
<P>
	In the area of communication, the recommendation from our 
clear cut committee was that the federal government, in 
conjunction with the provinces and territories, industry, 
environmentalists, and other stakeholders, strive to consolidate 
the communication strategies currently employed in 
international markets into a single and effective campaign to 
promote Canada's forest management practices abroad.
<P>
	The response by the minister was supportive of that. Her 
department says the Government of Canada agrees with this 
recommendation and recognizes that foreign customers, 
retailers, and nations are seeking assurances that the forest 
products they purchase originate from sustainably managed 
forests.
<P>
	With 50 per cent of Canada's forest products being exported,

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's time has expired.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have a brief question. In the interest of time, 
brevity is important.
<P>
	I listened to the hon. member's speech with a great deal of 
interest. He spent 20 minutes on a wide range of subjects, some 
of which I am quite grateful for the interventions that the 
member made. I understand he supports the bill just as I do, but I 
did not hear anything in his speech about why he supports the 
bill. I wonder if he might briefly give us some indication why 
the legislation in front of us-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Kootenay East.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Abbott:</B> Mr. Speaker, I apologize because unfortunately I 
did not see any signal from the Speaker so I did go over the time. 
My apologies.
<P>
	In response to the member, the main reason I support the bill 
is because I believe, in terms of the consolidation of the 
departments and the way in which the bill has been put together, 
it will create efficiencies.
<P>
	My major concern however is that we make sure the 
Department of Natural Resources at the federal level does not 
encroach on other levels of government. As a matter of fact we 
should be looking to efforts, as I have suggested, to divest the 
natural resources department at the federal level of some of its 
control and give it to the provinces.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to 
Bill C-48, a bill that reorganizes the Department of Natural 
Resources.
<P>
	The issue of natural resources is very important to my 
constituents in Kindersley-Lloydminster. Primary industries 
form almost the entire economy of west central Saskatchewan 
and are affected by this department or by the department of 
agriculture. Agriculture is also a natural resource.
<P>
	Within my riding there are two potash mines, the Cory mine 
near Delisle and the Cominco mine near Vanscoy. There are also 
two Domtar salt mines, one near Biggar and the other at Unity. I 
have a vibrant oil and gas industry within my constituency, as 
well as the controversial government megaproject, the heavy oil 
upgrader at Lloydminster. The majority of my constituency is 
involved in the greatest natural resource of all, agriculture.
<P>
	I have included agriculture as a natural resource even though 
it is traditionally thought of as separate from the other primary 
industries and perhaps is not affected by Bill C-48. It is 
appropriate in today's tough fiscal climate to reconsider the role 
of government in the lives of those working in primary 
industries. After all, this sector is the primary stimulus of all 
other economic activities.
<P>
	Currently Canada's primary industries are divided into three 
categories by the federal government. There is agriculture and 
agri-food, fisheries and oceans, and then mining, forestry, oil 
and gas, atomic energy and other energy sources grouped 
together in the Ministry of Natural Resources. As the direct role 
of government in these industries decreases it may be time to 
consider an administrative merger of these departments.
<P>
	It is worth while to consider that most of the provinces also 
have these three departments. Once we can agree which of these 
responsibilities are federal and which fall within provincial 
jurisdiction it will be easier to avoid duplication of effort. This 
will lead to less bureaucracy and may facilitate a merger of the 
federal ministries at considerable savings for Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8196"> 8196 </A></B>
<P>
	I do not want to give the impression that it is the policy of my 
party that these three ministries be immediately merged. I am 
merely suggesting that the current division between Canada's 
primary industries are somewhat arbitrary. On examination it 
may prove optimal to merge two or three of these departments.
<P>
	Currently the federal government seems to have its priorities 
reversed when it comes to funding our primary industries. The 
Lloydminster upgrader in my riding is a good example. Within 
the oil and gas industry the federal government concentrates its 
efforts on subsidizing the most expensive oil to produce like the 
heavy oil upgrader, the Alberta tar sands and the Hibernia 
project. The conventional oil and gas industry is then taxed more 
heavily to provide the money to subsidize the otherwise 
non-viable enterprises.
<P>
	If governments would avoid the megaproject boondoggles 
and reduce the tax burden on the smaller companies that are 
making a go of it on their own the industry would blossom and 
flourish. We would find that both productivity and employment 
within the industry would increase. The government would 
discover that the industry would employ more people than the 
megaproject would employ in any case.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Those real jobs within the industry are more likely to be 
permanent jobs than the jobs created by government subsidy 
where megaprojects lose money or perhaps even collapse. The 
same is true throughout Canada's primary industries. The 
conventional industry, which provides most of the jobs and job 
growth, is heavily taxed in order to subsidize government 
megaprojects.
<P>
	Being a farmer I am familiar with agriculture but the past year 
has given me the opportunity to become familiar with other 
primary industries within my riding. Earlier this spring I toured 
the heavy oil upgrader. I was impressed with its operation but on 
my tours through my constituency, I was even more impressed 
with the level of ingenuity and diversity of the people who are 
proving that large scale government intervention is not required 
to make industry work.
<P>
	The renewal of the agriculture industry and the strength of the 
oil and gas sector has happened, some would say, despite the 
best efforts of the federal government.
<P>
	The infamous national energy program of a previous Liberal 
administration is an example of Liberal gouging that still haunts 
the energy industry. The industry will not stand for another form 
of carbon tax no matter how the government chooses to disguise 
it. Instead of presenting these reorganization bills such as Bill 
C-48, why does the government not assure us that there will be 
no raping of the energy industry via taxation or via regulation?
<P>
	The reason I mention all these activities in my constituency is 
to demonstrate that large scale government intervention is 
neither necessary nor is it wanted. If farmers, foresters, fishers, 
and oil men and  women are left to run and develop their own 
industries then more economic activity will result. Not only 
does the government activity in these areas not lead to a 
rejuvenation of the economy, but it is largely counterproductive.
<P>
	These megaprojects create an artificial competition which, 
when combined with the higher taxes needed to support 
government enterprises, stifles the growth and productivity that 
would naturally occur.
<P>
	Bill C-48 is yet another housekeeping bill brought in by the 
Liberal government. For the most part, it merely amalgamates 
the old Department of Forestry with the Department of Energy, 
Mines and Resources. I support the principle of consolidating 
government departments but it seems to me that when the 
government is reorganizing departments it makes sense to 
rethink its whole involvement.
<P>
	What better time is there to seriously re-evaluate the role of 
the government in the area of natural resources? What better 
time to do this than in the first year or two of a new Liberal 
administration? Unfortunately what we have is an old bill 
reintroduced into the House with a few new brush strokes and no 
new imagination or input.
<P>
	Rather than conduct a long overdue and in depth evaluation of 
the role of government, the Liberals would rather do nothing and 
just pass the legislation prepared by the previous government.
<P>
	I support the small step the bill takes in reorganizing the 
government bureaucracy but I do not feel that the bill will 
improve the plight of the industry at all. There is still a long way 
to go. I am looking forward to the day when the government 
introduces some serious legislation in the area of primary 
industries.
<P>
	The current model of government involvement does not 
reflect the reality that exists today outside the Ottawa bubble. 
The massive amount of bureaucracy and administration 
supporting the megaprojects is outdated and hurting the rest of 
the industry. The administrative overlap and high costs have to 
be cut. The natural resources industry is too valuable to the 
Canadian economy to be regulated to death.
<P>
	In closing I will repeat my support for the principle of the bill. 
I look forward to the day when the House can consider some 
legislation with a little more meat in it.

	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP)</B> 
moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should consider the 
advisability of improving housing for First Nations people, and in particular 
First Nations elders.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to present to the 
House for consideration and debate a motion that I consider to 
be of utmost importance.
<P>
	It almost goes without saying that the living conditions 
endured by many of Canada's first peoples are deplorable. Study 
after study have established mountains of facts to support the 
need for addressing this serious problem. Year after year the 
federal government has found a new reason, a new excuse not to 
take the action that is required. The House's own standing 
committee said exactly that in its December 1992 report to 
Parliament ``A Time for Action''.
<P>
	I would hope that MPs from all parties here today would 
support this motion so that the weight of Parliament can be 
added to the voices from First Nations communities calling for 
action on housing.
<P>
	Before this debate today I called around to some of the leading 
voices in Indian country to get an up to the minute reaction to the 
current state of Indian housing. Briefly, they all speak in unison: 
not much has changed, the federal government must act 
immediately.
<P>
	If we look at some available statistics and read some of the 
recent newspaper articles we can tell that the situation is 
actually getting worse. The Assembly of First Nations tells us 
that an assessment of the on reserve housing stock in 1984 
indicated that 47 per cent of the stock failed to meet basic 
standards of physical house conditions, 36 per cent was 
seriously overcrowded and 38 per cent lacked some or all the 
components of basic amenities by which I mean running water, 
indoor toilets, a bath or a shower.
<P>
	By comparison, a 1991 report by the Department of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development indicated that of the 64,402 
housing units on reserve 56 per cent failed to meet basic 
standards of physical house conditions. Of these 24 per cent 
require major renovation and 10 per cent require complete 
replacement. Thirty-one per cent have neither piped nor well 
water and 31 per cent in 1991 had neither piped sewage service 
nor septic fields.
<P>
	Among the newspaper reports that I have in front of me is one 
that is written about a reserve in my own constituency. The 
headline from the October 19 issue of the Saskatoon 
<I>Star-Phoenix</I> reads: ``Waiting list long for homes on reserve''. 
It concerns the situation on the Mistawasis Indian reserve just 
75 kilometres west of the city of Prince Albert.
<P>
	After a fire left a family of eight homeless there was no 
replacement to be found. According to Mistawasis Chief Leona 
Daniels, quoted in the newspaper article, the band has 52 
applications for houses from band members waiting for 
adequate housing. This number is not unusual says the 
Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations, the organization 
that represents most of the province's Indian bands. This 
number is not unusual because among all the reserves there is 
likely a shortfall of some 800 houses in Saskatchewan at this 
moment.
<P>
<B>(1735) </B>
<P>
	At the Red Pheasant reserve just south of Battleford, also 
within my constituency, Chief Mike Baptiste says there is a 
current shortfall of 146 units. The band has a number of young 
families on reserve looking for their own homes. There are a 
number of elders who are crowded into the homes with many 
children. There are many band members currently living off 
reserve who want their children to be raised on the reserve and 
attend the band administered school but they cannot because 
there is no housing available.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8198"> 8198 </A></B>
<P>
	The newspapers are also full of stories concerning the 
situation of the Big Cove Band in New Brunswick where the 
council has reported that it has more than 500 people on a 
waiting list for housing. The band council has said that the 
response of the minister of Indian affairs to their 
problem-Indian affairs approved the construction of six new 
units this year, if you can believe this-is criminal.
<P>
	Earlier I referred to the report of the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs, an all party committee that travelled 
extensively and heard from First Nations people throughout 
Canada. I urge all members and particularly government 
members to have a look at this important and definitive report. 
Despite the fact that committee members expressed a sense of 
sorrow and helplessness in some of what they saw and heard, 
they worked to write a report with recommendations ``intended 
to provide a path to resolve the housing problems that exist for 
native Canadians in order that they may achieve suitable, 
adequate and affordable housing''.
<P>
	Prior to writing the recommendations the committee noted: 
``There is inflexibility in federal housing programs, limited 
economic spinoffs for aboriginal and northern communities, 
lack of co-ordination between governments and programs, and 
difficulties assessing programs''.
<P>
	The committee went a long way to resolving these problems. 
First, the committee recommended that the federal government 
conclude the review of aboriginal housing that has been kicking 
around the department of Indian affairs since 1975 and to get on 
with the business of addressing the problems that are all too 
evident.
<P>
	Second, the committee recommended that the government 
deliver all its funding for aboriginal housing through one agency 
and then transfer control of housing programs along with 
sufficient resources to aboriginal people.
<P>
	An important part of the solution is sufficient resources. To 
this end the committee recommended that the necessary funding 
be provided. It particularly singled out the special needs of 
seniors, the homeless, the disabled and the victims of abuse. I 
will have more to say about this in a moment.
<P>
	The committee also stressed that aboriginal people's cultural 
and practical needs have not been addressed in existing 
programs: ``The committee recommends that the Government of 
Canada recognize that the only way to provide the flexibility 
that aboriginal people need to ensure the delivery of the kind of 
housing best suited to their particular needs is through 
self-government for aboriginal people''.
<P>
	Every group that appeared before the standing committee 
urged aboriginal participation and control over housing 
programs.
<P>
	Before I leave the work of the committee I want to bring to the 
attention of this House the words of just a couple of witnesses: 
``One of the things so very important in community life, whether 
in Sioux Lookout, in British Columbia, or anywhere else is 
housing. It is important because it has all the ingredients to 
make the family work''. That is a quote from Mr. Eno Anderson, 
executive director of the Shibogama Tribal Council.
<P>
	From Bob Decontie, housing co-ordinator with the Assembly 
of First Nations: ``Many of the communities have large numbers 
of houses that are overcrowded close to urban centres such as 
Calgary. We hear stories that there are 20 people in one house. 
These are things that have to be addressed. We have to address 
issues such as if you don't have a place to study what are the 
chances of you going to or doing well in school''.
<P>
	Even Canada's Auditor General in his 1991 report criticized 
the federal government for its handling of Indian housing issues.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to quote briefly from the Auditor General's 
report, 1991:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Inadequate and overcrowded housing, among other things, can contribute to 
societal and health problems, such as sickness, marriage breakdown, alcoholism 
and child abuse. The financial results can be measured in terms of higher cost of 
health care, social assistance benefits, policing and penitentiary services. 
Solving the housing problems on reserve could reduce the cost of health 
services and social assistance by improving social and health standards.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Again, here we are in follow-up three years later with a new 
Auditor General's report and still no action in this regard.
<P>
	My motion today also specifically singles out the difficulties 
faced by Indian elders. I want to go beyond what has so far been 
debated on the issue, to look at the special needs faced by the 
growing population of elders living for the most part on reserve.
<P>
	Non-Indian society has spent a great deal of time in the past 
40 years developing a social security system that benefits our 
seniors. When it comes to aboriginal elders, we have forgotten 
they exist. From my own experience, I am proud of the seniors' 
special care homes that have been built in smaller rural 
communities across the prairies. When I visit nearby reserves I 
see nothing that compares. Indian elders who need special living 
arrangements or special care are often moved off reserve, away 
from their closely knit families and moved into the completely 
non-Indian environment in the nearest community with a 
seniors home.
<P>
	On reserve where housing dollars are limited elders are 
frequently unable to obtain sufficient funds to upgrade their 
homes or move to a newer home because the money is not there 
to do that. In this case I would like to single out the work of the 
Sandy Lake or Ahtahkakoop First Nation. Indian leaders have 
done a fine job of developing the elders' lodge concept where 
Indian elders are cared  for in a family and co-operative way, 
given independence in their day to day life and included in the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8199"> 8199 </A></B>
<P>
central activities of the band, including support for band 
government and the youth of the community.
<P>
	This concept has received praise from every corner of the 
country but nothing has happened because there is no money and 
the elders are just expected to remain in their own home or on 
the couch in the living room of the home of their son or daughter.
<P>
	The Ahtahkakoop elders' lodge was designed to meet certain 
needs. Let me quote from its proposal:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Currently the elders are living in relative isolation from each other and the rest 
of the band due to the remote nature of their homes and they are restricted in their 
mobility by age or disability. This isolation has resulted in incidents of 
mistreatment and neglect. There is no capability for native people to service the 
needs of their elders and infirm within their own communities. As a result the sick 
and the elderly are removed from their homes and family to be treated or admitted 
into facilities capable of providing the longer term, higher care required.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Ahtahkakoop study and proposal was done in 1990. It has 
had no movement from the federal government since then. I 
might add that other proposals along the same lines have been 
developed on numerous reserves in my own constituency and 
across Canada, concepts that include the ability of the 
community to best meet the needs of the elders who are living 
within that community.
<P>
	We have heard about the money problems in housing. If Sandy 
Lake or the Makwa Sahgeiehcan Band in my own riding near 
Loon Lake, or the Sweetgrass Band near Battleford, also 
involved in wanting to build and support an elders' lodge, want 
to do this they have to use all of the money that is allocated to the 
Band for housing for three or four years.
<P>
	That means that the only means available to properly treat 
aboriginal seniors on reserve is to take away all the renovation 
and all the new housing money available to everyone else on the 
reserve, including new families, returned Bill C-31 Indians and 
the disabled.
<P>
	I would like the federal government to do some soul searching 
today in its deliberations on housing programs and its response 
to the need for greater aboriginal control and increased financial 
support. I also ask the government to consider the special and 
immediate needs faced by Indian elders.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	It would be appropriate for the federal government to 
establish a new program that would make special financing 
available specifically for the construction and operating of 
elder's lodges so that the elders do not continually have to 
compete with others on the reserve for the housing dollars that 
do exist. The Minister of Indian Affairs has admitted that 
housing will be his priority in 1991.
<P>
	We have heard the minister comment in the Chamber and to 
the media outside the Chamber about the royal commission on 
aboriginal affairs. When the minister was asked if he thinks the 
money is being well spent on the royal commission, his response 
was if he had that money to spend, he would rather spend it on 
housing. I think that acknowledges that even the Minister of 
Indian Affairs recognizes the priority nature of the crisis in 
aboriginal housing.
<P>
	This is a new Parliament and there is a new government in 
office. The previous House was told by its own committee that 
action must be taken on aboriginal housing issues. At this early 
date, just one year into this Parliament, I urge prompt 
consideration and recommend that we cannot afford to wait for a 
better time to act. It is indeed, as the title of the House report 
stresses, a time for action. Too many people are suffering as we 
speak.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to rise and speak on the motion introduced by 
the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake on 
aboriginal housing.
<P>
	I begin by thanking the member for bringing this matter 
before the House. I can assure the House that the government 
and I share his concerns. I can also assure the House that we 
intend to address this issue as quickly as possible and in a 
manner that is socially and fiscally responsible to Canadians.
<P>
	As the hon. member has made clear, the housing situation in 
many aboriginal communities has become extremely difficult in 
recent years. In some communities the qualify of shelter is truly 
appalling for a nation such as ours. In others the shortage of 
housing has reached crisis levels. These housing problems 
affect not only the elders, as was stressed in my colleague's 
remarks, but all sectors of the population including the rapidly 
growing proportion of young people.
<P>
	A clear and decisive plan of action is required to correct these 
inequities which are contributing to many health and social 
problems on reserve, again as the member said.
<P>
	My colleague is also correct in stating that in 1992 the 
Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs recommended a 
number of very specific actions to address the shortage of 
adequate shelter in aboriginal communities. However, due to the 
dissolution of Parliament none of these actions were taken.
<P>
	The election that followed the dissolution of that Parliament 
gave Canadians the opportunity to vote for change, for a new 
approach to issues that face our nation. As we all know, 
Canadians took advantage of that opportunity in an 
overwhelming manner.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8200"> 8200 </A></B>
<P>
	I am convinced that one of the reasons Canadians elected the 
Liberal Party to majority government was the sincerity and 
progressive nature of our policies for aboriginal people. 
Canadians have long acknowledged that action must be taken on 
aboriginal issues and the Liberal Party of Canada has the 
political will to deal with those issues.
<P>
	The Liberal plan for Canada, the red book, which outlined the 
Liberal Party's policy initiatives during the election campaign 
made some very clear commitments to aboriginal people, 
commitments we have been working hard to fulfil.
<P>
	For example, we made the commitment to implement the 
inherent right to self-government, something we are now 
working on with aboriginal leaders and others. We will achieve 
this. The advantage is that it moves toward the local control for 
which the member was arguing. We made a commitment to 
dismantle the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, a process which has already begun in Manitoba.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
	That dismantling will leave the local control which the 
member knows is necessary to deal with this particular problem.
<P>
	We made a commitment to uphold the honour of the crown by 
settling land claims through a fair and equitable process. This 
House has spent a great deal of time and energy over the past 
year dealing with enabling legislation for a number of land 
claim agreements. I have spoken in the House in those land 
claim debates. I have worked in committee on those land claim 
debates and I was glad to see some of them going through.
<P>
	The land claims process also leads to the local control which 
the member knows is necessary to deal with this problem.
<P>
	Also in the red book we promised to increase support for 
post-secondary education. Several months ago the Minister of 
Indian Affairs and Northern Development announced that $20 
million would be added to the budget of his department's 
post-secondary education program bringing the total spending 
for 1994-95 to over $247 million.
<P>
	Improved post-secondary education will lead to expertise at 
the local level which is also necessary to deal with this problem.
<P>
	I, like the member, have dealt with the Hiawartha First Nation 
and the Curve Lake First Nation on matters of self-government 
and education and treaty matters. I am very interested 
personally in his suggestions.
<P>
	We also promised to address health issues by giving 
aboriginal communities the tools and resources necessary to 
tackle these problems. Toward this end the minister of health 
recently announced the building healthy communities strategy. 
This strategy will provide almost almost a quarter billion dollars 
in additional funding over  the next five years to address priority 
needs in the areas of solvent abuse, mental health, and home 
care nursing.
<P>
	The member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake knows that 
these matters are related to the problems which he is raising in 
the House today.
<P>
	We also made a very clear commitment in the red book to 
address the housing issue which the member has raised in the 
House of Commons this evening. This again is something to 
which we have been devoting a great deal of effort.
<P>
	Hon. members here must recognize that this is an extremely 
complex issue, one that requires a range of innovative solutions 
and the co-operation of many parties. It is not an issue that will 
be solved by money alone or, for that matter, by the federal 
government alone.
<P>
	The red book acknowledges that: ``Adequate shelter is a 
fundamental need of any society and a basic prerequisite for 
community prosperity''. That statement was made in direct 
reference to the precarious housing situation in many aboriginal 
communities.
<P>
	In response to the shelter challenge the red book commits the 
government to work with aboriginal people to develop an 
approach to housing that emphasizes community control, which 
the member has rightly stressed, local resources and flexibility 
in design and labour requirements, the local approach which the 
member for The Battlefords-Meadow Lake is arguing for.
<P>
	I am pleased to inform the House that the government has 
been doing just that. Both the Minister of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and the Minister responsible for the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation have made it very 
clear that the housing crisis is a personal priority. To fulfil the 
government's commitment both ministers have directed their 
officials to work together to develop a new aboriginal housing 
policy.
<P>
	Toward that end in the past several months federal officials 
have been working with the Assembly of First Nations task force 
on housing along with representatives of the Inuit Tapirisat of 
Canada, the Congress of Aboriginal Peoples, and others to 
develop a new policy.
<P>
	Many issues need to be addressed in devising a new aboriginal 
housing policy, everything from ownership and financing to 
aboriginal involvement in construction, maintenance and 
management of the housing.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	While aboriginal groups such as the Assembly of First 
Nations and the Inuit would like to see action taken quickly, they 
too acknowledge the need to work co-operatively with 
government and the private sector to develop viable solutions to 
this serious housing problem. The aboriginal leadership have 
shown determination and commitment in addressing this 
difficult issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8201"> 8201 </A></B>
<P>
	In conclusion, while I commend the hon. member's concern 
and acknowledge his call for a renewed commitment to 
aboriginal housing, I think it is clear that the government's 
commitment has never been stronger.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, I, 
also, would like to congratulate the hon. member for The 
Battlefords-Meadow Lake for his excellent motion. As a 
fellow member of the Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, I must 
say that he is known for his social commitment. This motion is 
entirely in keeping with the social positions he has taken at the 
committee's hearings.
<P>
	I will start by referring to the report of the Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs submitted in the previous Parliament and 
entitled ``A Time for Action, Aboriginal and Northern 
Housing''. A few years have passed and, although things had to 
be done at the time, we realize that nothing has really changed 
and that it is still time do something. On the government side 
they consult, they show goodwill, but action is not forthcoming. 
Meanwhile, we witness life conditions which are probably 
among the worst in North America.
<P>
	These conditions have to be seen. I belong to the category of 
people who believe in seeing for themselves, and I have visited a 
number of people from the First Nations. No later than today, I 
called upon my colleagues on the finance committee to fly or 
drive to some aboriginal communities to find out, first hand, 
how these people live today. I do not think I would offend 
anyone by saying that they live in a Third World economy.
<P>
	As we can see in the Auditor General's report, tabled 
yesterday, aboriginal people have very high rates of poverty. In 
some communities, the unemployment rate is 80 per cent; the 
suicide rate is sometimes five times higher than the Canadian 
average. Despair permeates these communities; the education 
level is much lower than the Canadian average. They are the 
victims of a paternalistic attitude they have been subject to for a 
long time. And yes, housing is unfortunately totally inadequate.
<P>
	I saw with my own eyes four generations living under the 
same roof. Imagine the promiscuity, the total lack of intimacy. 
Imagine having to eat every day with twenty people, 
representing four generations, around the table. These are things 
you do not see in the Third World; even in Latin America people 
are better off.
<P>
	There is a lack of infrastructure and adequate housing. How 
many communities do not even have sewers? How many 
communities do not even have running water?
<P>
	In a modern society, in a country like ours which boasts of a 
very high standard of living, tolerating Third World living 
conditions such as these is totally unacceptable.
<P>
	On top of that, some houses are of a style totally foreign to 
native culture. In some communities, all the houses are the 
same, tiny little bungalows. There is no concern for native 
culture, history or tradition. Across Canada, houses built the 
same way and often-I will come back to that later-by people 
who do not even live on the reserve. You can see that the 
Department of Indian Affairs is not really concerned about 
native culture and maintaining it but rather is driven by 
economic factors. So, let us build the cheapest houses possible.
<P>
	Financing on reserve is difficult. It is a real mess.
<P>
<B>(1800) </B>
<P>
	There is the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 
and then the Department of Indian Affairs. It is a mess. People 
do not know who to turn to. For housing construction as well as 
renovations, waiting lists are a mile long and, in many cases, the 
agencies pass the buck back and forth.
<P>
	Also of note is the limited involvement of native people in 
policy development. My colleague opposite mentioned earlier 
the significant contribution of native people. Again, as I said 
earlier, I just left a finance committee meeting, and the First 
Nations' leader was telling us that he deplored the lack of 
consultation of First Nations on housing policy. This policy has 
been in the making since 1984. And let me remind you that I 
started my remarks by saying that it was time to act. My hon. 
colleague says that it is time to act, time to consult but, for all 
practical purposes, the First Nations' leader told us no later than 
this afternoon that it was not happening.
<P>
	The reserves derive very little in the way of economic benefits 
from the various government programs. I do not want to embark 
on a discussion on the whole thrust and the whole gamut of 
government programs for native people, but the fact is that very 
little benefit accrues to the reserves per se from housing-related 
activities as well as other ones. Services are often provided by 
outside contractors who, on leaving the reserve, keep Natives in 
some degree of dependency.
<P>
	I will translate almost word for word what my hon. colleague 
said earlier, when he quoted the 1991 report of the Auditor 
General. I will repeat what he said in French because we are 
using the same reference. In his 1991 report, the Auditor 
General said this: ``Inadequate and overcrowded housing, 
among other things, can contribute to social and health 
problems, such as sickness, marriage breakdown, alcoholism 
and child abuse. The financial results can be measured in terms 
of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8202"> 8202 </A></B>
<P>
higher cost of health care, social assistance benefits, policing 
and penitentiary services''.
<P>
	May I remind you, Mr. Speaker, that the Auditor General said 
yesterday that all these problems are relevant to society. But 
they are amplified and emphasized in these communities. It is 
even worse. Solving the housing problems on reserves could 
reduce the cost of health services and social assistance by 
improving social and health standards. What the Auditor 
General said yesterday about society in general is that the 
problem is worse on reserves and must be solved soon.
<P>
	I would also like to extract a few facts from the 1993 report of 
the Department of Indian Affairs. I still remember the first 
presentation made by officials from the Department of Indian 
Affairs to the Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. They told us 
candidly that the native population was growing by nearly 5 per 
cent a year, double the Canadian growth rate. They also told us 
that they knew that there were housing shortages, but 
unfortunately, funds were lacking and, as I just said, people had 
to live with three or four generations under one roof in some 
cases.
<P>
	In their presentation, they told us that the First Nations had 
nearly 72,000 housing units, of which 42 per cent did not meet 
Canadian housing standards and 16 per cent lacked plumbing 
and sewage facilities. In our society today, not having a sewage 
system is almost unacceptable. Twenty-nine per cent do not 
have running water. Who here in this august chamber would 
imagine that such things could happen? Certainly not in our 
homes, where we have running water. But 29 per cent of homes 
on reserves lack running water and 26 per cent have no sewer 
service. I even meet band councils who tell me: ``Mr. Bachand, 
can you intervene with the minister and try to make him aware of 
our cause? We have no sewers on our reserve and no running 
water.'' I have to do that quite regularly.
<P>
	Subsidies have not increased since 1984, while the native 
population has increased 5 per cent a year, creating a big need 
for housing. So you understand that we now have to tell native 
people to continue to live with 10, 15 or 20 people under one 
roof, because the funding is not there and unfortunately their 
population is growing. So conditions continue to deteriorate and 
we can come right out and say that living conditions on the 
reserves are the worst in Canada; as I just said, it is Canada's 
Third World.
<P>
	There are solutions. Native lending institutions can be set up, 
for example; things like that would help. But before that is done, 
of course, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation would 
finally have to decide with the Department of Indian Affairs who 
has jurisdiction, because CMHC comes under Public Works.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	As I was saying earlier, this was a mess. There should be 
tighter management control and a single body or department 
should be in charge.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I will hurry because I realize that I only have one 
minute left. I would have liked to say more, because these 
people do not often have the opportunity to make themselves 
heard through us and they are showing signs of distress.
<P>
	We mentioned earlier, as did the leader of the First Nations, 
that the red book has a lot of implications and that it includes a 
number of commitments. However, no progress was made 
regarding the housing issue. In fact, the housing policy is still at 
the conceptual stage. There is not enough discussion with native 
people.
<P>
	I simply ask the government to implement as quickly as 
possible the promises made in the red book. The time has come 
to take action.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to address the House on the motion 
introduced by the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake.
<P>
	The hon. member has expressed some genuine concern about 
housing conditions in many First Nations communities. I know 
my hon. colleague's views are heartfelt and sincere. I commend 
him for bringing them to the attention of the House. I believe all 
Canadians share his concern that no group of people in our 
society should live in substandard housing.
<P>
	I can assure the hon. member the government is fully aware 
that there is a serious lack of homes designed especially for 
seniors on reserve; as well there is a lack of nursing homes for 
those requiring special care. It is our belief that elders need an 
integrated housing program that encourages and enables them to 
stay in their own homes longer.
<P>
	Health Canada's building healthy communities strategy 
which was mentioned by the hon. member for Peterborough a 
few minutes ago will support such a program. By supporting on 
reserve home nursing care for persons discharged from hospital 
and those with acute illnesses the strategy will help more First 
Nations people to continue to live in their reserve homes. The 
challenge now lies in ensuring that appropriate housing is 
available.
<P>
	While I appreciate this special concern for the elderly I think 
the hon. member would agree that improvements must be made 
in aboriginal housing for the benefit of all age groups from 
newborn to seniors. We must keep in mind that the aboriginal 
population is an overwhelmingly young population. If we do not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8203"> 8203 </A></B>
<P>
focus as well on the needs of youth and young families we will 
face increasing costs to our social security, health and justice 
systems while failing to meet vital challenges for First Nations.
<P>
	I know from conversations with the Minister of Indian Affairs 
and Northern Development and the minister responsible for the 
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation that they are both 
very concerned about the state of housing in certain aboriginal 
communities. The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development has witnessed these conditions firsthand in many 
of his visits to these communities. This is an experience which 
has strengthened his resolve to take action.
<P>
	In a recent speech to the provincial treaty forum on housing in 
Saskatchewan the minister acknowledged: ``Housing is one of 
the most critical problems facing aboriginal communities 
today''. He went on to say that the conditions he has observed 
simply should not occur in our country.
<P>
	I am therefore pleased to confirm that the government is 
working very hard to finalize a new policy and action plan to 
tackle the First Nations housing issue. We are doing so with the 
support of First Nations leaders and with input from a wide 
range of stakeholders. This action plan will provide a 
multifaceted approach to addressing the housing needs of First 
Nations, including the special needs of elders.
<P>
	The housing crisis is not a new phenomenon. The situation has 
been worsening year after year for the past decade as the 
previous governments failed to take action. Make no mistake 
about it. This government is committed to action on this issue.
<P>
	The problems are evident enough but the difficulty lies in 
finding solutions that will be effective, affordable and long 
lasting. These solutions must also increase First Nations control 
of the housing portfolio and contribute to the government's 
objective of building new partnerships with aboriginal people.
<P>
	As hon. members are aware there are serious concerns about 
the quality and quantity of on reserve housing. A relatively high 
percentage of reserve houses require some form of 
rehabilitation and many must be replaced. This is largely a 
reflection of the overall poor quality of reserve housing 
constructed before 1983 when the national building code 
standards were not enforced.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	There is also a serious shortage of on reserve housing. This 
shortage is becoming more severe each year as more and more 
First Nations families are formed. This shortage means that 
houses are overcrowded. In turn this takes its toll on family and 
community life and can affect the physical and mental health 
and well-being of family members.
<P>
	The housing shortage and the poor condition of existing 
houses are the two key issues that must be addressed. They call 
for a range of innovative and resourceful approaches.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Peterborough has informed the 
House, officials of the Department of Indian Affairs and 
Northern Development and the Canada Mortgage and Housing 
Corporation are working closely with the Assembly of First 
Nations task force on housing and others to develop concrete 
proposals for a new aboriginal housing policy.
<P>
	Among the concepts now being explored are a number of 
creative options that have come directly from First Nations. 
These proposals will be considered by the government in 
deliberations on a new aboriginal housing policy. A 
memorandum to cabinet is being prepared to seek support for 
such a new policy. Both ministers have instructed their officials 
that any new housing policy must encompass three key 
elements.
<P>
	First, it must improve housing conditions while moving 
greater control and accountability for housing to First Nations. 
The Government of Canada believes that community control is 
critical to the success of future aboriginal housing initiatives. 
This position is shared by First Nations.
<P>
	Second, the policy must provide greater employment and 
business opportunities for aboriginal people. First Nations 
people must have enhanced opportunities to build better houses 
for less money with more local supplies. We must also explore 
new avenues for financing First Nations housing by encouraging 
private sector investment in the housing portfolio. In the current 
environment of fiscal restraint and deficit reduction, 
government alone cannot foot the enormous bill for aboriginal 
housing.
<P>
	Third, the policy must promote the development of skills that 
will facilitate First Nations control of housing and enable 
aboriginal people to pursue jobs in the housing industry.
<P>
	A housing policy that achieves all those goals will also lead to 
improved health and social conditions in aboriginal 
communities. This in turn will reduce costs to government and 
will provide for a more equitable society. In other words all 
Canadians have a stake in improved aboriginal housing.
<P>
	As hon. members well know, the challenges in developing a 
new aboriginal housing policy are significant but they are not 
insurmountable. I am confident, as are the Minister for Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development and the minister responsible 
for CMHC, that the co-operative approach now under way 
offers the best chance for success. By working together with 
aboriginal people and making decisions that affect them we will 
arrive at solutions and approaches that can be supported by all 
Canadians.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8204"> 8204 </A></B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mike Scott (Skeena, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the motion 
before the House today speaks to the need for more aboriginal 
housing. It is a real problem. Anyone who has ventured on to an 
Indian reserve, travelled by one, or has had the occasion to come 
into contact with aboriginal people knows there is a real 
problem as far as aboriginal housing is concerned.
<P>
	As Canadians I am sure all of us would like to see the situation 
improved. We are not callous and uncaring. We would like to see 
everybody in our society living in decent housing with the 
opportunity to maintain what we have come to accept as the 
Canadian lifestyle.
<P>
	These are some of the facts surrounding current government 
spending on aboriginal affairs. The Government of Canada is 
currently spending some $5.8 billion a year to try and deal with 
the problems we are talking about this afternoon. Out of that 
amount, some $300 million is directed toward aboriginal 
housing. According to the latest reports some 3,500 new units 
are built and 4,500 units are renovated every year.
<P>
<B>(1815 ) </B>
<P>
	The Auditor General says that the spending on DIAND's 
budget is rising faster than the rate of inflation and the increase 
in aboriginal population combined. This tells me that the 
positive results of this funding are dismal to say the least. It is 
my contention that the results will always be a failure because 
there will never be enough money available in this budget to 
address the needs of these people.
<P>
	In my view the only way these people are going to be able to 
exist in housing that is acceptable to them and engage in a 
lifestyle that is acceptable to them and to us as Canadians is for 
them to become economically independent and be in a position 
to provide their own housing on the same basis as the rest of us.
<P>
	While I appreciate that the Indian people find that these 
existing programs provide some relief, they are surely no 
happier with the situation than we are, the non-aboriginal 
people and the taxpayers of Canada.
<P>
	I ask the question: How can someone feel a sense of 
self-worth and self-respect when he or she has to go begging to 
the federal government for money to subsidize housing or a 
standard of living?
<P>
	Reserves, in many cases, are located in areas where there is 
little if any economic opportunity. That is the reality of reserves 
in Canada today. The people who live on those reserves are 
relegated to a lifestyle which perpetually looks to the federal 
government to be subsidized. In many instances these reserves 
are located in remote areas that are very difficult to access and 
where there is really no economic activity taking place other 
than government funding. There is virtually no meaningful 
employment.
<P>
	The aboriginal people who have fared the best are the ones 
who have made the difficult but courageous choice to venture 
off reserves and become part of the Canadian mainstream.
<P>
	It is the view of our socialist friends, and we see the evidence 
of that in such motions as the one before the House today, that 
the government either has or should have the answers to all of 
our woes. ``If we only had a better program. If we only delivered 
it more efficiently. If we only earmarked more tax dollars for the 
program we would achieve our objectives and everybody would 
be happy. We would achieve a state of nirvana''.
<P>
	After nearly three decades of massive government spending, 
massive redistribution of wealth from productive people in our 
society to the have nots, we find that not only has the 
government not achieved its goals but in every instance has 
exacerbated the very problem that its programs were designed to 
correct.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Milliken:</B> That is complete rubbish.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Scott (Skeena):</B> Those are the facts.
<P>
	It is interesting to note that the Auditor General has in his 
latest report started to echo the sentiments of many brilliant 
economists, such as my colleague from Capilano-Howe 
Sound, who have been saying for years that government 
programs designated to fix problems such as unemployment and 
welfare by their very nature increase the demand.
<P>
	I will quote the Auditor General. He says: ``There are 
indications of possible negative effects associated with social 
programs''. He goes on to say: ``We note that most if not all 
social programs have the potential to produce such effects''.
<P>
	Many effects that have been associated with existing 
programs include rising social program use and high repeated 
use, suggest that social programs may be creating a long term 
dependence among some users. Disincentives to work when 
benefits from social programs are compared to earnings from 
jobs and interactions among social programs may result in the 
programs working at cross purposes.
<P>
	It is therefore obvious that the solution to native housing, the 
real permanent solution, does not lie with more government 
spending or more programs, policies or initiatives from 
government, but rather must come from the aboriginal people 
themselves through participation in the economy like all other 
Canadians.
<P>
	I might add that there are hundreds of thousands of 
non-aboriginal Canadians who live in poor and sometimes 
inadequate housing and who desire to move from their basement 
rental suites and their apartments and live in nicer housing. The 
reality for these people, a reality they accept, is that they will 
have to pursue their own dreams and aspirations using their own 
re-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8205"> 8205 </A></B>
<P>
sources. That is the way it works and that is the way it should 
work.
<P>
<B>(1820 ) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I want to return to the thrust of the motion 
which is to require the government to spend more resources and 
increase the aboriginal housing program. My response to that 
motion is that there will never be enough money. If these people 
are to rely on government programs, there will never be enough 
programs, there will never be enough general resources and 
there will never be general satisfaction among the recipients.
<P>
	The solution is to find ways to encourage and give incentive to 
aboriginal people to become self-sufficient and part of the 
Canadian mainstream. I recognize that this is not either an easy 
thing to say or to accomplish but in the long run, it is the only 
real hope for aboriginal people living in our country today.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The Chair should apologize to the 
Reform Party for not recognizing members of its party earlier in 
the debate.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to address the motion put 
forward by the hon. member for The Battlefords-Meadow 
Lake.
<P>
	This is an important issue. The motion concerns on reserve 
housing. Having grown up in the central part of British 
Columbia, I have seen the evidence and I have heard the stories 
of the deplorable living conditions on some of the reserves.
<P>
	These conditions can justifiably be called shameful in our 
society, certainly in the times we live in. Canada enjoys a very 
high standard of living, yet we have people, whether natives or 
not, living in abject poverty and deplorable housing situations. 
This is not something of which we can be proud.
<P>
	The member suggests in his motion that the government 
should put more money into an improved housing program. The 
fact is that present fiscal realities simply do not permit the 
spending of more money to alleviate the problem.
<P>
	In my opinion the money that the government is spending on 
native programs, particularly the housing programs and 
programs to help the social situation of the natives is already 
there. If only past governments and the present government 
spent a little more effectively and a little more efficiently, some 
of these problems could be looked after with the funds that are 
presently available.
<P>
	Unfortunately the popular opinion by the Auditor General is 
that the Department of Indian Affairs is out of control in its 
spending. The Auditor General said that the government is 
throwing ever increasing amounts of money at the native people 
but the programs are ineffective and inefficient.
<P>
	The report paints a picture of a disorganized Department of 
Indian Affairs lacking any direction, lacking any clear goals, 
lacking any monitoring of its existing spending, lacking any 
accountability of its existing spending. In fact the Auditor 
General gives the department a complete failing mark for the 
way it handles the funds that it has allocated to its department. It 
is totally out of control.
<P>
	The funds are there within the department. The Department of 
Indian Affairs has a $5.8 billion budget. The funds are there. 
They are just not being utilized effectively.
<P>
	When members of the Reform Party start questioning some of 
the things that the government does or some of the things that 
past governments did, members opposite immediately say that 
the Reform Party does not care about the plight of the Indians. 
We do. We feel very strongly about the plight of the Indians.
<P>
	What we care about as well is the taxpayers' money that the 
past and present governments have spent trying to solve the 
problems which the Indians have, trying to come up with 
solutions to improve their social standards, the plight of how 
they live, the houses that they live in and the deplorable 
conditions on the reserves.
<P>
<B>(1825 ) </B>
<P>
	We do care about that. That is the reason we questioned the 
way that the department of Indian affairs of this government 
spends its money. It is out of control and it is not going to 
improve until this government gets a handle on how the 
bureaucracy is spending its money, until it starts making 
demands for accountability, monitoring, evaluation, and results.
<P>
	One of the popular opinions in this country concerning the 
department of Indian affairs is that there is no bureaucrat in that 
department who ever wants to get the problem solved because if 
they ever solve a problem they will work themselves out of a 
job. We have a huge department that is overstaffed, overfunded 
and underproductive.
<P>
	There is a considerable amount of problems among the 
governments with respect to the delivery of the housing 
services. One of the problems is that the federal, provincial and 
territory governments are all involved in providing housing. A 
recent committee report by the Standing Committee on 
Aboriginal Affairs found there was a lack of focus because of 
these three levels of government that were involved. It was 
resulting in a patchwork of housing initiatives that really were 
not solving problems for anyone.
<P>
	The committee said that there was little or no co-ordination 
between the three levels of government. The lack of 
co-ordination is not constrained to governments. It has also 
been found to be rampant within various departmental 
programs. For instance, DIAND is not directly involved in 
housing in the territories. Both Yukon and Northwest Territories 
have a cost-sharing agreement with CMHC. However, it must be 
noticed that  50 per 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8206"> 8206 </A></B>
<P>
cent of the bands had to make use of CMHC because the funding 
provided by DIAND was not sufficient.
<P>
	In order to increase the efficiency of services to bands, some 
suggested to the committee that the housing programs between 
DIAND and CMHC be amalgamated. Here we have two 
government departments asking to be put together to become 
more efficient. That is not the way the bureaucracy has worked 
in this country, unfortunately.
<P>
	In fact, DIAND has no clear statement of federal 
responsibility with respect to housing for natives living on 
reserve. Because of this and because of the patchwork of 
programs among governments, the committee found that the 
natives living on reserves, which were side by side, could in fact 
have completely different levels of housing and services.
<P>
	A very clear message was being delivered to the committee. 
There are serious problems in the administration of the housing 
service between various governments and between various 
government departments.
<P>
	I conclude by restating what we in the Reform Party believe is 
the root problem of the deplorable housing conditions that exist 
on some of the reserves. It is not the fact that they need more 
money spent. It is not the fact that there is money to be spent 
because there is not. We have to borrow it on a daily basis to stay 
alive in this country. The fact is that the money they have, which 
is adequate, is simply not being used in an effective and efficient 
manner.
<P>
	I repeat again, their programs are out of control. Their 
spending is our of control. There is no monitoring within that 
department. There is no accountability and quite frankly under 
this government, we see also there can be no hope for that 
department to ever get its act together.
<P>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="GRAINTRANSPORTATION">GRAIN TRANSPORTATION</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. Len Taylor (The Battlefords-Meadow Lake, NDP):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the Crow debate has been with us for some time. It 
is an important debate that has a great deal of meaning for 
thousands of prairie farmers. It is a debate that these thousands 
of farmers want to be a part of. In fact, these farmers have 
already demonstrated that when asked they are more than 
prepared to participate in the debate.
<P>
	For example, when the previous government talked about 
changing the Crow benefit they hosted hundreds of regional and 
community meetings across the prairies. These meetings were 
promoted as transportation talks. They attracted hundreds of 
participants. In almost every case across Saskatchewan the 
response of those participants was to ask the federal government 
to maintain the Crow benefit.
<P>
	Farmers across the prairies time and time again have 
impressed upon the federal government that the Crow represents 
economic fairness in the transportation of grain destined for 
export. Saskatchewan farmers in particular are producing grain 
on land that is further from port than any other grain farmers in 
the world. Since the price of the product is based on its port side 
distribution, obviously the farther one is from port the more 
uncompetitive the product is for sale to the rest of the world.
<P>
	The Crow benefit simply recognizes that with the benefit all 
Canadians receive from the sale of Canadian grain into overseas 
markets, all Canadians will assist in the cost of getting that grain 
to its port of sale. Without the national subsidy, and I would 
argue it is an internal not an external subsidy, the revenue that 
would return to the prairies from the sale of grains would be 
much reduced. The cost of the loss of this transportation support 
to the prairies is therefore likely to be greater than the savings 
the Department of Transport and the federal government would 
accrue from the dismantling of the Crow benefit.
<P>
	The Minister of Transport has toyed with prairie farmers 
about this issue for months. Last week be betrayed a long held 
Liberal commitment to prairie farmers and the communities that 
they support when he announced that it is no longer a question of 
whether the federal government plans to change the method of 
payment, it is only a question of how it will be changed.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="8207"> 8207 </A></B>
<P>
	In making the announcement the minister argues that new 
GATT rules and the pending world trade organization requires 
that Canada make the change. This is shocking. At the same time 
as the Canadian Minister of Agriculture is abdicating Canada's 
role in making economic decisions for Canadians, the 
newspapers are running articles quoting American politicians 
saying that the GATT cannot be accepted there because (a) the 
treaty is a threat to its economic sovereignty and (b) the new 
trade organization will have the power to change its national law 
or regulation and impose fines and sanctions if it wants to.
<P>
	Here we are in Canada blindly accepting the international 
treaty without challenge while one of our trading partners, one I 
might add which is hurting us in the marketplace, is openly 
resisting the imposition of the terms and the agreement on them.
<P>
	Canada should be challenging the interpretation of the GATT 
deal affecting the Crow benefit and we should be resisting 
making unilateral changes until all the partners to the agreement 
have taken steps to ensure that a fair marketplace for all exists.
<P>
	It is obvious to all of us involved in the grain trade that 
without the Crow benefit and without specific changes to the 
U.S. export enhancement program, Canadian farmers are left at 
a significant disadvantage in the international marketplace. I 
argue that it is an artificial marketplace.
<P>
	The federal government should stop using the GATT deal as 
an excuse to cut the Crow benefit. As my friend Mr. Art Macklin 
the president of the National Farmer's Union has said: ``It is 
apparent that the federal government's agenda is to cut the 
deficit and they view the Crow benefit as a large budget item''.
<P>
	Mr. Macklin has also said: ``If the federal government really 
wanted to level with the people of the prairies, it would 
acknowledge that there does exist ways within the framework of 
the GATT agreement to retain the Crow benefit as a 
transportation subsidy''.
<P>
	In conclusion, late last week I asked the Minister of 
Agriculture if he has failed to understand the importance of the 
Crow benefit to the economic viability of the prairies or has he 
just decided to ignore the views of thousands of farmers who 
have made their views known at various times during the past 10 
years? For the record, I ask again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
government is now examining how changes can be made to the 
Western Grain Transportation Act, which enable Canada to meet 
its international obligation and which result in the greatest 
possible benefits to prairie farmers and the prairie economy.
<P>
	There are two compelling reasons we are talking about 
change. The new world trade agreement under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade calls upon countries to reduce 
export subsidies. Those reductions  must occur both in 
expenditures and volumes exported. The western grain 
transportation subsidy on shipments to west coast ports and 
Churchill is considered an export subsidy under the terms of the 
agreement.
<P>
	Legislation which will enable Canada to implement the terms 
of the GATT was tabled in the House recently. The uncertainty 
that would result in the grain industry were we not to reform the 
WGTA in response to the new world trade agreement would be 
untenable. The WGTA must be reformed before there is any 
threat of the volume limits on export subsidies being exceeded.
<P>
	The second compelling reason for change is exactly the 
concern expressed in the member's question. That is the 
viability of the prairie economy. It has long been argued that the 
current method of payment discourages high value production 
and processing in western Canada. The world is changing. The 
new world trade deal has opened new opportunities for Canadian 
products and specifically for higher valued consumer oriented 
products. We must ensure that our industry is equipped to 
compete and gain its share of these rapidly expanding world 
markets.
<P>
	As the government considers the best means for reforming the 
WGTA the fiscal circumstances of the government cannot be 
ignored. Agriculture will, along with other departments of 
government, have to bear its fair share of the effort to put our 
fiscal house in order.
<P>
	As we consider reform the views of farmers across Canada are 
being taken into account. Far from ignoring the views of farmers 
we are asking them very specific questions on how a new 
payment method for the WGTA might be designed.
<P>
	The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food has had meetings 
with representatives of the major farm organizations and 
commodity groups from eastern and western Canada. They are 
being asked for their views on the two specific options that have 
recently come forward from the producer payment panel and 
from the governments of Saskatchewan and Alberta. At the 
same time consultations have been undertaken by the Minister 
of Transport on efficiency issues.
<P>
	The end result will be reform for the grain transportation 
system that will meet our fiscal responsibilities and our 
international trading obligations. We also want to ensure that 
our Canadian farmers come out on the winning end of the issue.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 38(5), the 
motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, the House stands adjourned until 
tomorrow at 10 a.m. pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.38 p.m.)
