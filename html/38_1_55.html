<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The House resumed from February 10, 2005, consideration of the motion that Bill C-32, an act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, be read the second time and referred to a committee.</p><A NAME="Int-1123251"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123304"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123299"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette (Joliette, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, once again, I am pleased to rise to address Bill C-32, as I did Bill C-31, to condemn this totally unacceptable operation on the part of the government, which consists in splitting the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade into two entities, namely the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to do so, because I really feel that I am fulfilling the role of the Bloc Québécois, which is to protect the interests of Quebec and also to show Quebeckers how a sovereign Quebec would promote its values and political interestsand to use  its trade policy to meet these objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Quebec's interests are still being defended by Canada. Therefore, we must ensure that Canada has the necessary means to adequately protect Quebec's political and economic interests at the international level. However, this will not be the case with the splitting of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We often hear from the Liberals, and I imagine the same is true for the Conservatives and the NDP, that Canada's foreign policy and commercial policy must promote great Canadian values.  I agree with this. As a Quebecker, I hope that in a sovereign Quebec, the Quebec nation will base its foreign policy, commercial policy and international representation on promoting the values of Quebec society. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, I think the proposal being put forward by the government does not meet these objectives. Accordingly, as defenders of Quebec's interests and promoters of Quebec's sovereignty, we will oppose this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was saying, this bill, which is associated with Bill C-31 totally lacks transparency, and I would even describe it as anti-democratic. I will come back to that. It is totally backward and goes against Canada's approach to foreign policy for the past 30 years whereby commercial policy was used as  a lever in Canadian foreign policy and aimed, in an awkward and inadequate way, I agree, at promoting the great, so-called Canadian, values of democracy, social justice, fairness and social and economic progress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a decision that will set us back 30 or 40 years. It is illogical on every level. I will come back to that. Finally, this decision to split the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is harmful to Canada's economic and political interests and likewise to Quebec's interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously, faced with something so undemocratic, non-transparent, backward, illogical and harmful, the Bloc Québécois will vote against Bill C-32, just as it will vote against Bill C-31.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to remind hon. members that on December 12, 2003, the Governor General in Council passed an order in council under the Public Services Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, separating the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade into two departments: Foreign Affairs Canada, and International Trade Canada. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is extraordinary is that this order was handed down the same day the current Prime Minister was sworn in. I have said it before, but I want to say again that we are a little surprised by the speed with which the new Prime Minister was able to make such an important decision about splitting a department that, since the early 1970s, had merged these two missions: foreign affairs and international trade. We are not used to having the Liberal government act with such speed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can give the example of changes to the Employment Insurance Act. Since 2000, the Liberal government has been announcing, in election campaign after election campaign, a major overhaul of employment insurance to take into consideration the difficulties facing unemployed workers in seasonal industries who experience the  black hole. Women and young people are not eligible for EI because they have to accumulate 910  hours of work before they can get benefits. The benefit level is insufficient, thereby creating child poverty, which the federal government is constantly condemning.</p><A NAME="T1010"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1010"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1005"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1010)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, child poverty exists because parents are poor. And who made the parents poor? The current government did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has been announcing an overhaul of EI since 2000, and we are still waiting. Obviously, we hope that, in the February 23 budget, the unemployed will see some solutions to their problems. However, this is the year 2005, and the decision still has not been made.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for the aerospace industry.  During the election campaign, the government was able to announce a half a billion dollars for the auto industry, which is primarily if not almost entirely located in southern Ontario. A policy for the aerospace industry, which is primarily located in the greater Montreal region, is still under consideration. Without a decision, there can be no such policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The list goes on and on, and includes areas such as the clothing and textile industries. In April 2003, the Standing Committee on Finance tabled a report containing numerous proposals. The government waited until December, when there was a crisis that led to the closure  of six textile mills in Huntingdon, before following up on this report. However, since June 28, the government could have taken the necessary actions to help the clothing and textile industries, which are currently experiencing a very important transition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is more, the measures announced in December  are clearly not enough.  From the questions we asked of the Minister of Industry, we have the clear impression that the government has no intention of doing any more than it announced in December.   The Canadian Textile Institute itself feels these measures were inadequate and incomplete.  We are still waiting for action.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for what we are discussing today.  In two throne speeches, February 2004 and October 2004, new directions for foreign policy were announced.  We are still waiting for them.  The Minister of Foreign Affairs told the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade that he planned to do so in December.   Here we are still, nearly mid-February, with no indication as to when the minister or the government plans to make these foreign affairs directions public. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This of course has an impact on the work of the committee, and in fact we are incapable of planning our work in any useful way for the coming months.  We will need to consult Canadians and Quebeckers on these directions, which I repeat have been announced in two throne speeches by this government.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister reached a fast decision, the very same day he was sworn in.  Whom did he consult?  We do not know.  Certainly not the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, nor the major organizations concerned by such issues, such as those involved in international solidarity or international cooperation, nor even the major coalitions of exporters or groups concerned with defending economic interests.   So we are told, anyway.  Who, then, was consulted that the government moved so quickly to try to split up Foreign Affairs and International Trade?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Minister of International Affairs has given us a few ideas.  When we asked him what the decision to split up the department was based on, he could not come up with an answer.  Between you and me, the minister is not too thrilled with this decision by the PM.   He was probably not consulted either. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, because he is a good soldier, the foreign affairs minister said, and I quote:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Consultations are still going on. The government has always kept communications open with large associations of exporters and other representatives of economic groups.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later on, he added:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This time, after discussing the issue with various people, the Prime Minister decided otherwise.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the minister is telling us is that consultations are always held. Each meeting or chat the foreign affairs minister or the international trade minister has with somebody probably qualifies as a consultation. I guess this is the kind of discussion we are dealing with here.</p><A NAME="T1015"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1015"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1010"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1015)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, these are certainly not structured consultations. We are being told the Prime Minister has discussed this issue with various people, probably in his own entourage, and probably even before he was sworn in, since he has been able to move very quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foreign affairs minister's remarks are quite interesting. He said that, after discussing with various people, the Prime Minister decided otherwise. It means that even people in his inner circle advised him against splitting the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade.  He had made up his mind, but on what basis? We do not know. This decision has no analytical or political basis whatsoever. It is probably a concept that is dear to him for whatever obscure reasons that, to this day, we do not know, and that nobody has been able to explain. This is not a transparent and democratic decision. It did not draw on the usual parliamentary mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We find ourselves faced with a fait accompli. This order in council in December 2003, followed by the tabling, a year later, of Bills C-31, An Act to establish the Department of International Trade and to make related amendments to certain Acts, and C-32, An Act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts, is an attempt at setting a done deal in front of Parliament, namely the partition of the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of International Trade into two separate entities. That is profoundly anti-democratic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind the House that Jeffrey Simpson of the <i>Globe and Mail</i> was calling out for Hercule Poirot, that great detective and character invented by Agatha Christie, whose books you have probably read, imploring him to come to Ottawa to investigate whose absurd idea it was to slice up the Department of Foreign Affairs and   International Trade. It is a non-democratic, non-transparent and unfounded decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a step backwards, which is my second point. I would like to quote once again, because I think it is not well enough known by the public and the media, a letter  to the chair of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, dated December 8, 2004, from the president of the Retired Heads of Mission Association.  The first paragraph says it all:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Our Association, which is composed of approximately 270 former Canadian Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Consuls General, is deeply concerned about the future of the Canadian  Foreign Service. Recently, we have had to come reluctantly to the conclusion that our Foreign Service is being gradually dismantled. One clear manifestation of this happening is the recent decision to split the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT).</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not the one who says this: it is the association of retired heads of mission. The letter concludes with this:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>As former diplomats and officials of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Commerce, Immigration and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), our members have personally experienced the difficulties of integrating coherently these two crucial sectors of Canada's foreign policy. Thus, we believe that the decision to partition DFAIT is unfortunate and a step backwards.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These former representatives of Canada around the world came to this conclusion based on their experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, why is this backward? Why are these 270 former foreign affairs officials raising this? It is because this improv decision, until proven otherwise, the government was not able to explain the basis of this decision to us, goes against the past 30 years of integrating all elements of Canadian foreign policy within the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us recall that in 1971, under Pierre Elliott Trudeau, we started integrating functions of an external nature within the Department of Foreign Affairs. Then, in 1982, trade commissioners were included, over a ten year period.  There was reflection and consultation, even though Mr. Trudeau cannot be said to be the greatest democrat in the world. It was concluded that trade representatives had to be included in the Department of Foreign Affairs. Thus, since 1982, we have had the functions of foreign affairs, international trade and everything relating to immigration, particularly to refugees, and international trade.  </p><A NAME="T1020"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1020"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1015"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1020)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All that was overseen by the department, and they struggled to find a measure of consistency, synergy. Besides, retired diplomats also mention it. Indeed, it is difficult to achieve consistency and synergy in all those missions. That vision of things was maintained under the Mulroney and Chrétien governments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, this is the source of a problem, because the Department of Foreign Affairs and of International Trade has not developed harmoniously, in a straight line and free of problems over the past 30 years. It had problems. These problems were due less to administrative issues, and to the fact that four missions were combined, foreign affairs, international trade, foreign aid and immigration, particularly refugee matters, in one department. They have more to do, since the beginning of the 1990s, first with the Conservatives, then with the Liberals have cut the resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs and of International Trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present Prime Minister, when he was finance minister, is one of the people primarily responsible for this operation.  Clearly, since there was not enough funds, choices had to be made.  Officials tried to maintain the essential missions of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. They set aside or relegated the issues pertaining to foreign aid, immigration and refugees in favour of matters of foreign affairs and international trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the solution, and Jeffrey Simpson shares this analysis, is not to split a department which is trying to  ensure consistency in all of the functions of Canada's foreign policy, but rather to reinvest the resources necessary for this department to be able to assume its various responsibilities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this is a backward decision. It is also illogical, that is the third point, because it puts the cart before the horse. The past two throne speeches have announced a review of Canada's foreign policy. Why then proceed with the administrative partition of a department as important as the Department of  Foreign Affairs and International Trade before even debating   the basis  of the policy directions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, and Napoleon would agree, strategic, political decisions are made, and  logistics follow. In this instance, the opposite occurred. A decision is made, and then a discussion is held on what should underlie an administrative decision. This is totally illogical.  A decision is  made and presented to Parliament as a fait accompli, if possible, and then a discussion of the broad directions in foreign policy will be announced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative split  of the mandate of the  Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade will taint the debate. This brings us to the other point: the fact that this decision will be harmful to Canada's economic and political interests, because separating foreign affairs from trade policy is not possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will remind the hon. members that today is the 15th anniversary of Nelson Mandela's release, in 1990, which spelled the end of apartheid in South Africa. I remember very well  that it did not happen out of the blue. First  decisions were made by civil society, and later by governments, to boycott  products from and investments in South Africa. I remember clearly that my father would not buy wine from South  Africa at the Quebec liquor board. The liquor board, which might have undergone a name change during that time, was forced to stop buying  wine from South Africa. I also remember a boycott on Shell to get it withdraw its investments in South Africa. These trade policy pressures, combined with diplomatic pressures, of course,   paved the way for Mandela's release and the end of apartheid in South Africa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How can we separate the two elements? When the Prime Minister recently went to Asia, whether in Japan or in China, he discussed both trade policies and foreign affairs. You cannot go to China and only speak of international trade without addressing the human rights issue. When he went to Japan, the Prime Minister discussed the upcoming G-8 summit on climate change. This and the Kyoto protocol are linked both to foreign affairs and to international trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Splitting the department in two will weaken both Canadian foreign policy and trade policy at the same time. The ambassadors will only be accountable for their diplomatic performance. They will no longer be accountable to the Minister of International Trade. Indeed, Canada will lose on both fronts, economic and political.</p><A NAME="T1025"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1025"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1020"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1025)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all these reasons, you will understand that we cannot support this kind of hare-brained improvisation, which will ultimately be detrimental to the interests of Canada and, consequently, those of Quebec.</p><A NAME="Int-1123304"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123251"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am happy to ask a question of the hon. member of the Bloc Québecois, who finds that there is no reason to split the department in two. I find that interesting, not to say daring, for a party that seeks to split up our country. He is here to work himself into a state and to make sure that there is no separation between departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will find a few examples, because he feels that this decision was a step backwards. I know that the member is not aware of all the things that have been done recently but, in the case of the tsunami, it was not a question of international trade, but of foreign affairs. We recognize that we live in a global world. Large countries are currently increasing their potential and broadening their policies. I am thinking about China, Brazil and India. Those are examples that show that the world has changed a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must also take into account the fact that, in foreign affairs, policy considerations differ from those pertaining to trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette: </b> Unbelievable, reactionary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dan McTeague: </b>If I have heard correctly, the hon. member has just said that there are no differences and that both fields must be paired.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we want to talk about human rights or, as this hon. member knows, consular affairs, what in the name of goodness could that have to do with commerce?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that in many respects we have to judge the changing and evolving world, which that party simply does not get.  The reality, however, is that there are other dimensions to our foreign affairs policies, and they deal with defence, of course, and immigration, as the hon. member has just discussed.  Let us not lose sight of what the bill is all about it.  It formalizes a process by law, which the hon. member does not want to consider, which permits the government by order in council under a bill to proceed with the division of the department.  This is the formal process in which the member can have a debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That member  and I sit on the same committee on foreign affairs. Not once in the time he has been a member, or in the past year and a half that I have been a member, has an issue come up on the subject of trade.  Indeed, that member will know this, because his colleague, who is also the critic for foreign affairs, has brought several motions forward,  not one of them dealing with commerce.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I therefore will ask the hon. member this. Since this issue has already taken place and the division is already occurring, and because of the maturity of both the foreign affairs element of our department and commerce, often not inextricably linked as he suggested but just the opposite,  moving in very different directions to ensure the interests of the whole country, would he not agree that it is time for the Bloc Québécois and that member to get their facts together and to modernize their thinking about the world around them as opposed to the insular politics on which they are founding those kind of comments?</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1123310"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123312"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123304"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette: </b>Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely mind-boggling to listen to the parliamentary secretary. If he were at the Davos Economic Forum, he would be taken for an ultra-right guy. At this very moment, the forum is focusing  on social issues and democracy than on commercial issues. Globalization is about opening markets but also about standing up for democracy and promotion rights, namely union, democratic and environmental rights, as well as cultural diversity rights. If the member still does not get that, he is 30 years behind. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, he argues that the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade does not deal with commercial matters. The sole fact that the committee decided to study simultaneously Bill C-31 establishing the Department of International Trade and Bill C-32 on the Foreign Affairs Department proves that this the member is wrong. The matter was not referred to the sub-committee on investment and international trade, because it was thought that it was about foreign affairs as well as international trade and, therefore, had to be addressed by the committee itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are presently studying Bill C-25 on remote sensing satellites. This bill is about international trade, since the Canadian industry hopes to sell images throughout the world, but also about foreign affairs because we do not want those images to work against the military and trade interests of Canada.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Members will understand the point I was trying to make about the partition of the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Department. It is the result of a retrograde vision of international trade and foreign affairs.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The parliamentary secretary should know that at least 60% to 70% of our foreign affairs are about trade policy and that the best way for Canada to promote its values and vision is to communicate its ideas through its trade policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The comments of the secretary parliamentary only served to reinforce my belief that this decision goes against common sense and modernity. I am more convinced than ever that the Bloc Québécois will vote against this bill and I invite all members to vote against those two bills. </p><A NAME="T1030"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1030"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1025"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1030)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1123312"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Maka Kotto (Saint-Lambert, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would first like to congratulate my colleague for his very eloquent speech. His reference to South Africa was very relevant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We know now that Quebec's destiny today is defined by a logic of dependency. It is not simply a question of the technical separation of international trade and foreign affairs. This would take us into issues with broader ramifications in terms of values that we share, or maybe that we do not share, in light of what I am hearing from the members opposite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask my colleague if such a thing could be considered in a sovereign Quebec.</p><A NAME="Int-1123320"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123324"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123312"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette: </b>Mr. Speaker, I think the parliamentary secretary missed the beginning of my remarks, where I was answering him for a second time. I will avail myself of the question from the member for  Saint-Lambert, whom I thank, by the way, for asking it, to remind the House why this debate is so important to us. As I mentioned in my first response, first, making this decision goes against the economic and political interest of Canada. Moreover, this decision will have repercussions on the economic and political interests of Quebec, as we are unfortunately still part of Canada and as a large part of our presence abroad is assured by the Canadian government.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we want the Canadian government to be organized in a smart way in order to promote a number of values shared by Quebec and Canada, because we do share several, such as the promotion of Canada's economic interests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, not only do we want to defend a situation, but we want to promote a vision of things. What all sovereignists in the Bloc Québécois, the Parti Québécois and other movements think is that globalization is no longer a simple business matter. It has been much more than that for a long time. First, the opening of markets has social repercussions. For instance, the textile and clothing industries are currently undergoing restructuring. This also has cultural ramifications. Quebec's culture is threatened, but so is Canada's. They may not be sufficiently aware, but in Latin American countries, their culture is also threatened not by American culture, but by a conception of American culture which is that of big business and entertainment, rather than purely cultural. The same goes for the environmental domain. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government will thus need to be organized in such a way as to adopt a comprehensive vision of all those missions. In fact, it was present in the Speech from the Throne. Unfortunately, what I observe in this government, is that it says one thing and does another. Back when I worked with the CSN, we used to say that it puts the left blinker on, but makes a right turn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will read you only one sentence with which I totally agree, but which does not have any echo in the decision that is being forced down our throats. It is on page 13 of the Speech from the Throne of October 5, 2004:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are well aware that all of that must be part of a unified vision of foreign affairs and of a country's responsibilities towards the world. I will continue to quote the paragraph because I alluded to the next part:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision to separate the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of International Trade is not integration, but dispersal. This is typical of the government. It has so many priorities that it has none. It has so many visions that it has none. The most concrete illustration of that is the introduction of Bills C-31 and C-32 without consultations, in an attempt to present Parliament with a fait accompli. We will not accept this. </p><A NAME="T1035"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1035"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1030"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1035)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

As has been mentioned before, Bill C-31 and Bill C-32 are companion bills, which we will be dealing with over the course of time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my role as CIDA critic, I have had the opportunity to take part in a few foreign affairs committee meetings recently while our critic from Halifax was travelling on business related to the committee. It was interesting to hear my colleague from the Liberals say there was no necessity to have international trade as part of the foreign affairs committee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad to hear my colleague from the Bloc mention that in just the last week, in the only meetings I  have attended, we were dealing with issues of trade, specifically Bill C-25 and RADARSAT. That  certainly very much was commercialization; that was what we were talking about. It was a commercialized agreement made with the U.S. on dealing with images that come through RADARSAT. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as a note on that one before I get into my real discussion on Bill C-32, it was interesting to find out at the meeting that the Government of Canada had given a company $430 million to put RADARSAT in place. The company invested $92 million and said, “Here is a deal”. We thought Joey Smallwood made the best deal in Newfoundland for the sale of power from Churchill Falls, but let me tell members that the government proved it could come up with a better deal. From the Government of Canada, from the taxpayers, $430 million, and from the company, $92 million, so let us guess who owns it: the company that put in $92 million. Let us guess what else: Canada is going to pay for the images. Is that not a deal?  As well, if that satellite happens to fall out of the sky and creates some problems, we cover the liability. What a deal for us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that we do not want these people negotiating too many things on our behalf. I was shocked. I thought I had heard it all, but it actually gets better. I hope we will have a chance to discuss it more when we debate Bill C-25, but if Canadians want some real fine tuning, they should pay attention to it and ask some questions about that bill when it comes before the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to get back to Bill C-32, because this is an important issue, I think it is important that I read out exactly what Bill C-32 does.Canadians probably do  not realize exactly how a bill comes before us. We get a piece of paper with the name of the bill on the front and it tells us pretty much what the bill will do. Inside the bill  there is a recommendation.  Here is what the recommendation on this bill states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>Her Excellency the Governor General recommends to the House of Commons the appropriation of public revenue under the circumstances, in the manner and for the purposes set out in a measure entitled “An Act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts”.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to specify what “the appropriation of public  revenue” is, because there is no question that what we are dealing with here is an additional cost to the Canadian taxpayers. There is no question about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is happening at a time when we have a situation in our country in which the government, despite having a surplus, has taken more and more dollars from numerous programs. As a result we do not have, in my view, enough money in old age security for our seniors. We have taken dollars from the EI fund, so there is not enough money for EI benefits. We have issues with child poverty. There is not enough money to address that. We do not have a national housing policy. There are huge shortages of housing around our nation. They are huge in the first nations communities in my riding, and there are absolutely appalling conditions. There are shortages all over the country, not just in first nations communities. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this situation, our municipalities and our cities are fighting for infrastructure dollars, trying to get tax dollars back because they have to repair the infrastructure. We have a situation where water and sewer infrastructure is lacking in numerous communities throughout the country. We have shortages in our health care as far as trained professionals and other individuals are concerned. There are shortages of health care equipment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are huge issues around the country, but what is the government's priority? It is going to set aside money to have separate departments for foreign affairs and international trade. Some might argue that this would cost only a small amount of money. Even if it is $1 million or $2 million, that would be enough money to put more MRI machines where they are needed. It would be  enough money to enable us to give more money to seniors. It would be  enough money to give additional assistance in pharmacare programs. It would be additional money for post-secondary education.  It is not okay to say that it is just a small amount of money.  It is an additional cost, and there other costs as well.</p><A NAME="T1040"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1040"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1035"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1040)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will go to another section of the bill. It states:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Governor in Council may appoint two Associate Deputy Ministers of Foreign Affairs,--</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it goes on:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>The Governor in Council may designate one of the Associate Deputy Ministers appointed under subsection (1) to be Deputy Minister for Political Affairs.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are talking about a whole new bureaucracy being involved in setting up this department.  In my view we do not have the exact costs here.  I know it is going to be more of a cost and the question is whether we should be putting taxpayers' dollars in at this point in time, if ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apart from that, Canadians need to know that it was just over a decade ago that the federal government merged foreign affairs and international trade.  They were merged 10 years ago.  Now we are going to spend some money and demerge them. Why are we doing this? One observer said that it was because the Prime Minister wants to.  He wants to. There is no real justification for having to do this.  It is, quite frankly, the opposite.  There is justification for not doing this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from the Bloc, the member for Joliette, mentioned a number of reasons.  They are very valid reasons.  International trade and foreign affairs are tied together.  Each and every trip that I have ever gone on, when we are dealing with issues related to another country and we are meeting with the different officials from that country, there is always discussion of issues related to trade and foreign affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am pleased to say that on a recent trip we had discussions with colleagues in Viet Nam, Russia and China.  We dealt with trade issues and had discussions with these colleagues.  We also dealt with issues of human rights.  All of this comes together and we know that it should.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my colleague from Joliette mentioned, if we are going to deal in trade and do business with a country, then we should be able to say to that country that it has to do certain things as far as human rights, labour legislation and the protection of workers is concerned.  We must talk about human rights and treating everyone fairly in that country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must be able to ask if there are practices in place where people do not have the right of religious expression.  We must be able to say that we want people to be given that opportunity.  We should be able to have those discussions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope my colleagues from the Conservative Party will go a step beyond saying they will look after business and support this because it is the best thing for business and trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality is that it is not in the best interests for Canada to do business with certain countries.  My colleague from the Conservatives has criticized the state of human rights in China.  Does that party not think it is important that when we are dealing with trade and foreign affairs that we should be able to say to China that as a country it must make moves in this area?  China has one of the most undemocratic and hostile regimes as far as human rights.  Do the Conservatives not think that those things should come together?  Is that not what doing business together and improving things for everyone throughout the world is about?  It certainly is in my view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Joliette also mentioned Wal-Mart.  We have seen the situation where the one unionized Wal-Mart in Canada will be closed.   We can think that it is not a federal government issue.  In itself it may not be a federal government issue. However, the issue is to recognize why Wal-Mart is doing that.  We do not want to be promoting that kind of a position within our country.  We do not want to be doing that. Canadians believe that the right of representation is there.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More and more I am seeing issues where this government is accepting the crawl to the bottom of the barrel.  It is the basis on what the government is willing to accept as far as human rights are concerned. I know of various situations. I have heard of numerous cases in the United States where Wal-Mart pays the lowest wages possible so that all of their workers will be able to get medicaid.  Then Wal-Mart does not have to be pay anything from the company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the U.S. at a time when a story broke where Wal-Mart had signed contracts with a company to do the cleaning of its stores, knowing full well that the company was using illegal workers.  Therefore, the company could pay the workers less and, as a result, Wal-Mart paid less for the cleaning.</p><A NAME="T1045"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1045"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1040"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1045)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not want to be promoting that.  We want to stand behind good, decent  values in support of each other and decent wages for individuals.  More and more I see this kind of action, saying we do not want to tie human rights with trade because somehow trade is the ultimate. Companies having the right to trade is the ultimate goal.  It is not mine.  It is not my ultimate goal. I do not see human beings as a natural resource for companies to make a buck off of them.  That is not how I base my life and I would hope it is not how others do as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went off on a bit of a tangent, but when one starts to realize what seems to be happening in one's own country, it is starting to look an awful lot like what is happening in some other countries. One wants to ensure that the government is made to face it once in a while and have its members realize exactly what is happening because so often they do not know exactly what is happening in each and every area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to have to tie Bill C-32 and Bill C-31 together because another issue in this whole discussion is the fact that the government is in the process, so we hear, of an international policy review.  It is beyond my wildest imagination why we would be spending money and time on an international policy review when the report has not been finalized and been given to someone to review or had a whole scope of meetings with the country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government says it is in the process of an international policy review, but before getting the results of that international policy review it is going to divide international trade and foreign affairs.  It seems absolutely ridiculous. We use the terminology that it is putting the cart before the horse.  No kidding.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would be the same as spending a whole pile of money on the Romanow report on health care, but before even getting the report the government would go ahead and implement new programs and do different things in health care.  I guess I cannot say it is the same because there was no hope of anything being implemented in health care by the government, so I probably should not have used that analogy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reality with Bill C-31 and Bill C-32 is that it makes no sense to be carrying out an international policy review.  People in my riding from the multicultural community contact me and say they want to have some discussions on the international policy review.  There are people who have been actively involved in our communities since they came to Canada. They have taken a personal interest in the workings of our government and country, and want to be part of that international policy review. What is it saying to all those people who were going to do that job quite seriously and get their input in the international policy review if the government rushes to separate two departments with no justification for doing so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My colleague from Joliette mentioned the 270 former diplomats who think this is a crazy thing to do.  Certainly they must be in the know. They are the ones who have been involved in this for years.  It is really a strange situation.  It has us wondering why the government is doing this.  What is the great benefit? I must say that I have not heard a really good reason yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk about an area where the government could have moved.  As the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade exists now, we have the Canadian International Development Agency and there is a minister for CIDA, but there is no legislation in this country to mandate CIDA.  That is a piece of legislation we should have been dealing with, a mandate for CIDA.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It spends a huge amount of money and is supported by Canadians because we are caring individuals and value our representation,  and we support what our country does for the world.  Is there a mandate for CIDA spending millions of dollars?  There is no mandate for CIDA. The government's priority is a piece of legislation to separate the Department of  Foreign Affairs and International Trade. There is no legislation to mandate CIDA.  That is unacceptable.  It is absolutely unacceptable that this would be the government's priority and not CIDA.</p><A NAME="T1050"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1050"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1055"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1045"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1050)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue of not having a mandate for CIDA is twofold. First, we do not  know for sure exactly what CIDA is supposed to be supporting and what Canadians want CIDA to do. Most Canadians want to see CIDA dealing with the alleviation of poverty. That should be the mandate. The other area that Canadians want to see, and they want to see this in all aspects of government but certainly in CIDA, is the transparency and accountability of CIDA dollars, of Canadian taxpayers' dollars. With no legislation for CIDA, how do we ensure that? How do we ensure that Canadian taxpayers' dollars given to CIDA will be followed through, and have the accountability and transparency that Canadians want?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say to the government and to all my colleagues in the House not to accept these pieces of legislation. There is absolutely no urgency to do it. It is unconscionable to be accepting these pieces of legislation before the international policy review. I hope the people in all of our communities will come out and say to us that it is not okay to be doing this, it is not okay to be spending taxpayers' money.  If the government is going to do this then it should forget the international policy review because there is no point. It is a farce. It is slap in the face. The government does not care what people have to say. It is going to go ahead and do this first. It is not acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If my colleagues want to really have a priority, they should give CIDA a mandate. Canadians have shown what kind of people they are during the tsunami disaster. They came out wholeheartedly and wanted to help out. We need people to help out on a continual basis and we need taxpayers' dollars, stable funding, and funding that we can tell year by year is going to meet the needs of our assistance in the world. We need a mandate for CIDA far more than we need Bills C-31 and C-32.</p><A NAME="Int-1123368"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123377"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123324"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am  pleased to respond to the hon. member for Churchill. I have a great deal of respect for that member of Parliament and I know she speaks very passionately.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irony of course with her comments is that all of the concerns that she has raised, and those of her colleague from the Bloc Québécois and his party that she is supporting, on culture, human rights, peace, and yes, she even used the same example I gave on two occasions already on the tsunami, speak not for the reasons to keep this department together, but if we are going to respect the modernization of where Canadians are domestically, globally and internationally, then she could not but come to a conclusion other than the fact that there is an inconsistency with trade and our politics on foreign affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The member is well travelled, as she has well described, as are some members in the House. I am glad to hear that. If we are to take seriously our relationship with other countries, not as a means to ensuring trade, the first thing we hear from those from other parts of the world is that we should be involved in understanding their cultures better. What better way to do that than to recognize Canada's diversity, which works for us in so many ways, to create links around the world that do not just take into consideration how much money we are going to make at the end of the day. That comes after and it is based on trust and relationships. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our world has changed. Our consular services had nearly 200,000 inquiries by Canadians last year. The disaster of the tsunami that she pointed out had nothing to do, I hope, with anything related to international trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hon. member has given a passionate and direct argument as to why she will not be supporting the bill. Ironically, those are the very arguments I would use to say that she has and must support the bill out of interest to ensure that our foreign policy not be connected with our trade policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the member for Saint-Lambert, and based on what the member for Joliette had already said, who talked about the 15th anniversary of the freeing of Nelson Mandela, I want to remind those members over there who were not here in the House that it was in 1960-61 that John Diefenbaker led the charge to ensure that country was reprimanded for what it had done. That was a matter of foreign policy, and to connect that, although it may be convenient from a trade perspective or from a monetary perspective, loses sight of Canadian values and what we stand for: dignity and respect for human rights. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If human rights mean anything to those members from the Bloc or the NDP, they could not but conclude that this is the right approach and that Foreign Affairs should not be linked with International Trade. I understand the 270 former diplomats who were diplomats during the period of the great unity between the department, but times have changed.  Understanding what the hon. member has just said, would she not agree that change is a very strong argument to ensure that foreign policy, human rights, peace and culture become the priority of Foreign Affairs, not money?</p><A NAME="T1055"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1055"><!-- Hour: 10--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1100"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1050"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1055)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1123377"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123381"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123368"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais: </b>Mr. Speaker,  actually a couple of the words which my colleague used   would be  reasons  that I do not trust the government's motives.  Those  words are “trust” and “relationship”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no trust in the government in the reasons  it does anything any more. I do not trust the government to do this for the right reasons. What I have seen from the government is a climb down  to the bottom in everything it does by not ensuring  when it sets out trade deals that all the other aspects are not affected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I  cannot help but see that when we are working out a trade deal or whatever in relation to how we are going to treat  the workers in our country. We have heard  time and time again in  the House that  businesses are moving  to other countries  which have lower human rights standards, lower labour standards and cheaper working conditions. People  worry about getting a toy at McDonald's for a cheap rate while someone is being abused in the country where it is being made.  That is not acceptable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be  a holistic approach where trade and foreign affairs  come together. I think the government only in the issue of the bill will say, “We want to be separate. We want to use foreign affairs as a way to fight for human rights”.   We do not need a mandate for foreign affairs on human rights. It should be part of  every aspect of every job we do. We  should  not have to divide it before we can work for those things. If that is the issue, the government has an even bigger problem than I thought.  It is not acceptable.</p>

This means that in just 39 days Canadian families earned enough to pay for their food for 2005. As recently as 1997 Food Freedom Day was February 15.  In just eight years the percentage of income spent on food in Canada has dropped by more than 15%.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While consumers celebrate the fact that they are spending less on food, this also means farmers are receiving less for what they produce, at the very time they are paying more for the inputs they must use to produce it. In the opinion of many, the inevitable result of this cost price squeeze on farmers will be the erosion of our very capacity to produce food in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, the only way to stem this tide is a commitment to sustainable food production in Canada.  That is why I believe we need a Canadian food strategy to ensure we still have farmers in Canada 10 years from now, 20 years from now, and 50 years from now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These reserves contribute to the conservation of ecosystems, species and genetic variation. Furthermore, they promote education, as well as economic and human development that is socio-culturally and ecologically sustainable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, our biosphere reserves are unable to completely fulfill their mandate due to a lack of financial resources. The Coopérative de solidarité de la réserve mondiale de la biosphère du lac Saint-Pierre is currently seeking funding from Canada Economic Development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of providing funding through all the usual programs, however, the government should designate adequate and recurring funding for all the UNESCO-designated biosphere reserves in Canada.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many past and present employees of the steel industry are being seriously affected by the shake-up that is occurring in this sector.  As a result, provisions in  the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act are being implemented and these employees and pensioners find themselves at a disadvantage to other creditors after years of hard toil and loyal service, and at a time in their lives when it is most difficult to start over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This issue is not unique to either the steel industry or even to Canada. It is a growing serious concern for men and women across the country.  The steel caucus is unanimous that a serious study of the provisions of Bill C-223 as they relate to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our position has been communicated to the Minister of Industry and a copy has been  sent to all members of the House of Commons.  Let us have a full review of this issue.  Our employees and pensioners deserve nothing less.</p>

This plan is very timely in light of the wage stagnation in Canada, the growing productivity gap between Canada and the United States, and increasing challenges from and opportunities in emerging markets like China, India and Brazil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CME calls on the government to rebuild and enhance our relationship with our major trading partner, the United States, to ensure that our goods have access to the world's richest market.  To do this we must address its   legitimate security concerns and invest in key upgrade projects at the border.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report also highlights the need to reduce the tax and regulatory burden on Canadian businesses.  We must harmonize our regulations both within Canada and with our major trading partners to reduce the costs for business.  Business taxes should be reduced and existing tax credits and capital cost allowances should be improved to better assist manufacturers.  The Canadian government must also begin to look at an overall energy framework and realize the importance of a reliable cost effective energy supply to the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must above all recognize and appreciate the importance of the manufacturing sector in Canada.</p>

This year's theme has to do with markets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horticulture is an extremely important economic sector for Quebec. This industry generates total annual sales of nearly $700 million.  Its development and its future are intimately linked to its high level of excellence, as well as improved access to markets. The same is true for all agricultural production in Quebec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, horticulture is much more than just a lucrative industry. The Fédération des sociétés d'horticulture et d'écologie du Québec has over 60,000 members throughout every region, city and town in Quebec. These many members want to serve their neighbours and their environment  through improved quality of life and the beautification of their respective communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, hats off to all the green thumbs in Quebec. The Bloc Québécois wishes them success in both their personal and business ventures. Happy horticulture week 2005.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children whose parents smoke are more than twice as likely to  smoke as compared to children  whose parents are  non-smokers.  I beseech all Canadians not to smoke, but  those who do  smoke should not smoke around others, particularly children, because the smoke  will make them sicker.  Their lives depend on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the tragic events in South and Southeast Asia, Canadians responded generously, and the men and women of our armed forces continue to help in the field, delivering fresh water and assistance. However, we need to do more than look at short term crises and problems. We need to look down the road at the bigger questions. CIDA needs to be more than such an agency governed by a one sentence order in council written in 1968. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to follow the lead of other countries and establish a legislative mandate for CIDA. We also need to meet the commitment of .7% of GDP going to foreign aid, first established by the Pearson Commission 35 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government remains one of the stingiest in the world, giving only .24% last year, down from .42% when this Prime Minister first became finance minister. Majority Liberal governments have neglected foreign aid and broken promises to the world. The NDP will not let the developing world be taken for granted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that will be difficult because of the drug problem which is supposed to be a zero tolerance but which does not exist in this country.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Resuming debate, the hon. member for Etobicoke Centre.</p><A NAME="Int-1123740"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123757"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123735"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Borys Wrzesnewskyj (Etobicoke Centre, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, Bill C-32, an act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and to made consequential amendments to other acts presented by the Minister of Foreign Affairs  formalizes the continuation of the Department of Foreign Affairs, whose principle mandate is to coordinate and lead Canada's foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This re-centering of the Department of Foreign Affairs on its primary functions is already close to completion. It would allow for greater clarity in Canada's international actions and for improved coordination among the actors involved in developing our foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is incumbent upon us today to give a solid legal foundation to those who have been working toward this goal for a year now. To do so, we are being asked to make a number of amendments to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act, which dates back to 1982. It is a matter of  removing references to international trade from the act of 1982 in order to reflect the new reality of a department that has been operating in this manner since the order in Council of December 12, 2003, with great success, as we have seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first years of this millennium have been marked by events which have reverberated around the world and have had an impact on Canada's international obligations and vision. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, or of March 11, 2003, the war in Iraq,  various regional crises in Darfur, Haiti, or the Ivory Coast, the move toward democracy and civil society, whether in Ukraine or Somalia, all of these event affect Canada. They affect our interests, conflict with our values, and call out to our common humanity. Such tragic events necessitate well considered yet resolute action on our part.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International problems and crises provide opportunities for Canada to find solutions. The Government of Canada and more particularly our Prime Minister and our Minister of Foreign Affairs have recently met with considerable diplomatic success. I am referring, among other achievements, to the inclusion in the report of the UN high level panel on threats, challenges and change, of the concept of the L20, a group bringing together leaders of developed and developing countries and  the concept of the responsibility to protect. These successes, which emphasize Canada's influence in the world, were made possible through the dedication and professionalism of foreign service officers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than ever, our country must assert the role it wishes to play on the international stage. A Department of Foreign Affairs will now allow our diplomacy to focus on its foremost tasks: to promote the interests and values of Canada abroad; to develop its unique expertise, the product of over 80 years of remarkable history; to strengthen its international networks with a spirit of dialogue and collaboration with other government departments and actors on the international stage, International Trade Canada, the Canadian International Development Agency and the Department of National Defence, of course; but also the many other federal and provincial departments and agencies which, with the proliferation of exchanges and the need to apply truly global solutions, have seen their perspectives extend beyond our borders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade no longer claims a monopoly on Canadian action beyond our borders. Today, it is unthinkable for foreign policy and domestic policy to operate in isolation. Ever more complex issues and parallel improvements in means of communication have led the actors of domestic policy to become increasingly interested in what is happening around the world. It goes without saying that many global challenges can only be faced with a coordinated response. That is why federal departments and agencies are ever more involved in Canada's international policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Affairs Canada will remain more than ever the main architect of Canadian international policy, but that policy will have to be pan-governmental, involving the engagement of all federal departments and agencies having international interests, with a special contribution by CIDA, International Trade and National Defence. This role as coordinator and integrator thus requires that the Department of Foreign Affairs focus on its own activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Department of Foreign Affairs separate from that of International Trade does not mean the two distinct departments will cease working closely together to face future international challenges. To the contrary, these challenges will help Canada introduce a new diplomacy with an integrated approach that will take into account all Canadian actors involved on the international stage.</p><A NAME="T1220"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1220"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1215"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1220)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to emphasize that the act introduced by the Minister of Foreign Affairs does not affect the status of the management of consular affairs, which remains with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  More than any other service, consular affairs directly interacts with Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of our country are great travellers.  Wherever we go, whether in Latin America, Asia, Europe or Africa, we meet Canadians.  Some have chosen to work abroad, whether for private institutions or NGOs.  Others travel for pleasure, curious to discover the world.  Just think of all our fellow citizens heading south at this time of year.  For example, from November until March up to 15,000 passports will be issued every day and 8,000 a day during the other months of the year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, consular services are much more than issuing passports. Every year Canadians make over 100 million foreign trips.  Consular services are there to help Canadians plan their trips, whether for business, school or pleasure and to help them during their time abroad.  The consular services of the Department of Foreign Affairs are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, through Canadian offices set up all over the world. Canada has offices in over 270 cities located in some 180 foreign countries to serve our fellow citizens, as well as an around the clock consular operations centre here in Ottawa.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to provide the consular services at our missions abroad all the support they need to effectively carry out their foremost mandate, which is to serve Canadians.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The control and management of information are crucial issues of the 21st century.  For a department like foreign affairs, the effective management of information and knowledge, for both internal use and public dissemination, are of vital importance.  Innovation in the development of information technology is key to transcending the limitations of time, bridging cultural differences and overcoming the often great distances that separate Ottawa from its missions abroad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modern, well-defined Department of Foreign Affairs, as outlined in Bill C-32, can count on a very effective communications network to help fulfill its mandate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To conclude, I believe it is important for us to enable those who represent Canada abroad to continue their valuable work.  The legislation will do just that.</p><A NAME="T1225"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1225"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1220"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1225)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1123757"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123760"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123740"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Dan McTeague (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for Etobicoke Centre for his presentation in support of the bill. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I take the opportunity to congratulate the hon. member for his initiative and leadership in terms of yet another event that I believe has been important in transforming the way we see the world, Canada's effort with respect to Ukraine. This is unprecedented certainly in my time as a member of Parliament of almost 12 years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is rather ironic, but not all lost on those of us who know about the change that took place in Ukraine.  The response by the Canadian government and this Parliament speaks to the importance of foreign affairs policy that is directly focused on the issue of capacity for governing and  on issues dealing with good governance, proper legal systems and electoral reform, for which Canada is very much noted.  This is  quite separate from commercial interests and trade considerations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the member's expertise in this area, is it the view of the member that foreign affairs can operate more effectively when it is focused on matters dealing with affairs of other countries, devoid of commercial interests?  I would like to hear the hon. member's response to that because he has an expertise in the House which is beyond question.</p><A NAME="Int-1123760"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123766"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123757"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Borys Wrzesnewskyj: </b>Mr. Speaker, it is quite interesting that the two departments, as was mentioned earlier, came together some time ago, approximately a decade.  Quite a debate was going on in the international sphere of diplomacy at that time. We had just witnessed the crumbling of the Berlin Wall, the disintegration of the Soviet Union, and the cold war had come to a close.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An essay was written at that time entitled, “The End of History”.    There truly was a sense of euphoria in diplomatic circles that perhaps we had reached a certain end of history in terms of wars and we would now concentrate on economic development and trade.  That is perhaps some of the logic that precipitated this move of the two departments coming together. Perhaps the theory was premature.  Perhaps it speaks to a world that we will achieve one day, but events over the past decade have made it clear that we need robust diplomacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my speech, I referred to a number of very Canadian initiatives.  The initiative of L20 is similar to the initiative of the G-20, a concept our Prime Minister came up with, when he was minister of finance, of bringing the finance ministers of 20 countries together, not just the largest economies in the world but also regional leaders and economies in the developing world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canada has taken this one step further and come up with the concept of L20.  We have joined along with developing democracies, countries with developing civil societies.  It talks to a very different approach from our neighbours or allies to the south.  We have a very different approach in bringing democracy to the world than our American allies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The process that is bringing democracy to Iraq has been quite interesting. A number of people have been rightly suspicious.  In fact, some people call it the Haliburton method of bringing democracy to the world.  We take a very different approach.  We believe in multilateralism.  We believe in engaging the world, our allies and also countries that we believe are on the path and need to be encouraged along the path of democracy and civil society. We just heard a petition that was brought forward from the Sunshine Coast where the petitioners said that Canada should not be part of a war machine that brings war to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coming back to the example of what has happened in Iraq and the suspicions as to why that has taken place, we do not want that sort of suspicion to ever come into play when Canada plays an international role in diplomacy.  There should be a separation between commercial interests and our very important work in building democracy and civil society around the world.</p><A NAME="T1230"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1230"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1225"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1230)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32 clearly separates the two departments so when we engage other countries in the world, through concepts like the L20, people will understand that Canadians believe in the values of democracy and in bringing civil society to the world, notwithstanding our trade interests.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of my colleagues have addressed it over the past few days. On December 12, 2003, behind closed doors, the Governor General in Council decreed that the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade would be split. We are talking about an administrative decision that went almost completely unnoticed. Let me remind hon. members that December 12, 2003, was no less than  the day the Prime Minister was sworn in. Now, this decision must be endorsed here in Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the tabling earlier this week of Bill C-31, an act to establish the Department of International Trade, and the tabling of Bill C-32 today, many of my colleagues from the Bloc Québécois have set the tone of the debate by denouncing this unintelligible decision. Today I am, of course adding my voice to theirs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For more than three years, I had the pleasure of working with the member for Joliette, the Bloc Québécois critic for international trade and globalization. Today, among other things, I am deputy critic for globalization. Therefore, I can say in all modesty that we know a bit about international trade and globalization. Over the years, we had the opportunity to discuss with all major organizations and to follow all the debates held in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can assure you that I agree with my learned colleague from Joliette, who stood this week and today  to denounce what he called a totally absurd measure. Absurd indeed, because the Minister of Foreign Affairs himself, speaking before the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade on November 29, 2004, was unable to explain clearly why it was necessary to create two separate departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what we understood from his testimony is that it was likely the Prime Minister himself who made the decision, against the advice of various people he had consulted. Now, who did he consult and when? It remains a mystery. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same foreign affairs minister said that the Prime Minister, after having supposedly discussed the issue with various people, “made a different decision”. I am quoting here what the foreign affairs minister said on November 29. In other words, the Prime Minister went against the tide. It is true that he is a shipowner and knows something about boats. But the captain is going off course in this case. As we know, it is unfortunately not the first time this happens. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, we are faced with a fait accompli. Fortunately, we still have the possibility of voting against this bill and I take this opportunity to invite all my colleagues from other parties to seriously consider this issue. Others have done so, for example, the members of the Retired Heads of Missions Association. This association is made up of nearly 300 former ambassadors, consuls and high  commissioners, who wrote to the chairman  of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade, last December, to tell him that they are against those two bills.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote from the letter.</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>

</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the past 30 years, foreign affairs and international trade have gone hand in hand; indeed, the latter has become a tool to promote the former.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Liberal government now wants to ditch all of that, while we, members of the Bloc Québécois, have been advocating for a long time a globalization with a human face, a notion we will apply when Quebec becomes a country. The Liberals are creating a two-headed hydra: each head will be ignorant of that the other does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of International Trade will deal exclusively with foreign investment in Canada, investment abroad, and the development of trade. When issues relating to human rights, the environment or labour law  will be at stake, we will wash our hands of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, the Department of Foreign Affairs will make international commitments on behalf of Canada without holding the reins of international economic relations. Everybody will pass the buck with regard to human rights, labour law or the environment when Canada  invests abroad, for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know Export Development Canada, one of the tools used by the government to enable exporters and investors to gain access to about 200 markets in the world, including about 100 in developing countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade is split in two, we wonder how the Minister of International Trade will ensure that EDC respects democratic rights and  that Canadian projects in those developing countries are in compliance   with, for instance, the International Labour Organization conventions and those relating to the environment.</p><A NAME="T1235"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1235"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1230"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1235)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minister's response will be to put the ball in the foreign affairs minister's court. This minister will then toss it back to the international trade minister, saying that henceforth he will not  address international economic relations issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32 clearly takes the coordination of international economic relations away from the foreign affairs department. This  is clearly spelled out in paragraph 7(2) of the bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This situation will be all the more catastrophic since EDC already has a special status. At times, we wonder whether it is not a secret organization. It is not subject to the Access to Information Act or the Environmental Assessment Act, and it is not regulated by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions . </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be even more difficult to keep tabs on EDC. We will not know if our values and priorities are going to be respected in projects financed by the crown corporation in foreign countries. With Bills C-32 and C-31, of course, the government  strips its foreign policy of its economic and trade leverage.  But, as I said, the two are completely indissociable, no matter what the Liberals think.  The Liberals should remember, however, that their own leader, the Prime Minister of Canada, went to China recently. Every time our head of state goes to China, what do journalists ask him? Two things: essentially, if he discussed human rights issues with Chinese leaders and, obviously, if he signed any trade deals. These are the questions that our leaders are always asked when they visit, in particular,  developing countries and countries were human rights are partially or totally abused </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is frequently mentioned because of all the economic problems it might cause. Obviously, there are not just problems. It is good to do business with countries such as China. This is a very   compelling example. China  is a country with which we are developing trade ties. Despite the harm it has done to our clothing, textile and furniture industries, to name just a few, we must obviously draw maximum advantage of this huge market, which is now open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay for trade, but what about that country's human rights record? No one here  is unaware of the  human rights abuses and   medieval working conditions in China. With the creation of  two separate departments, the fear is that trade will take precedence over humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tying trade  to human rights has been standard practice for over 30 years. Today, more than ever, a country's foreign policy is  closely linked to its trade policy.  How can we better the lives of Chinese workers—I am using China as an example, but it could just as easily be another country, such as Bangladesh—if human rights are no longer part of discussions on trade? I would really like the government to explain this secret decision to us, which it has yet to do, as was said earlier. In any event, the Minister of Foreign Affairs has not satisfied us that he himself was convinced of the merits of the decision.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two major problems with Bills C-31 and C-32.  With respect to the first, as I said, trade is an essential tool for countries in determining foreign policy. With respect to the second, human resources are currently  managed consistently at the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, since all employees posted abroad answer to the same administrative unit. Separating the two entities  would only lead to  inconsistent management of human resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By creating two separate departments, how can the government now integrate its concerns and, naturally, the concerns of Quebeckers and Canadians about respect for  human rights and the resolution of conflicts, for example, into its trade policy or selection the criteria established by  Export Development Canada?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are still waiting for the foreign policy review. Even before the results of this review become available, and without holding public consultations, considering Parliament's contribution or seeking the public's opinion, the government has decided that it should separate Foreign Affairs and International Trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are naturally very anxious to see the changes made, because the present situation at Foreign Affairs is not ideal.  I have myself had a highly negative experience, but nothing compared to what three people from my riding had to go through. They were in Thailand and got hit by the infamous tsunami. They managed to get to the Canadian embassy there, hurt, in great distress and without passports or money.  They were  treated terribly.  The reception was cold to say the least, and one of them had to create a scene in order to even be allowed in.  He could not go to a hotel because he had no money. He could not go anywhere except the Canadian embassy, which is considered Canadian territory and supposed to be a place that welcomes refugees and people from Canada who are in difficulty.  That was anything but the case.</p><A NAME="T1240"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1240"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1235"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1240)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The department is definitely at fault here.  Its policy in the case of disasters must be reviewed.  Embassies are not  there just to organize nice little cocktail parties and receive VIPs.  They are also there to help people in distress.  Fortunately, these things happen very rarely but, when they do, our embassies have a duty to treat Canadian citizens with all the respect that is their due.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have also witnessed the minister's shilly-shallying about the missile defence shield, and the contradictions of his colleague at National Defence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there is international aid.  This, of course, has not yet reached the 0.7% of GDP mark, despite the promises made to Bono. Speaking of Bono, one wonders if he is not behind the PM's idea to split the department in two.    I think not, because this is a man greatly concerned with humanitarian interests, so I do not think he would take such a position.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are my feelings about Bill C-32, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose both C-31 and C-32. </p>

He started off by saying that approximately 240 former diplomats were opposed to this. There are  thousands and thousands of current and retired diplomats. With any change there will always be a small minority that dissents with a new vision, especially with bureaucracies, or as sometimes we encounter here in Ottawa, entrenched bureaucracies. That  is not what should guide us. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We should be the ones who provide the vision,  not the departments or the bureaucrats. I heard from across the aisle that  over the past 10 years  about 60% of the work of the department has entailed work around international trade. It is very important as we articulate Canada's values around the world that these  be values of democracy and civil society, and that there be absolutely no hint that trade will in some way influence these Canadian values and beliefs in democracy and civil society and the efforts of our diplomats in that regard. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have seen over the past 10 years what a great  importance and an increasing importance international trade  has in our lives. As international trade develops and takes on a greater and greater role, is there not a danger  if these two departments were together that  it would  take over the role of foreign affairs?</p><A NAME="T1245"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1245"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1240"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1245)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

He is well positioned to know that the influence that a country like Canada can have in a country where either democracy, human rights, the environment or labour rights are trampled relates to the fact that the foreign affairs and international trade departments are intertwined. He himself recently went to Ukraine, where many events occurred. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In exercising this influence, when our leaders discuss trade with leaders of other countries, these discussions are an integral part of everything related to labour and human rights. A country that intends to trade with a country like Canada must, of course, not only listen to it, but also make compromises. It must also prove that it is able and willing to change its approach toward human rights, the environment, social rights and so on. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not understand my colleague, who thinks that dividing the department in two can be beneficial, when his own Minister of Foreign Affairs did not manage to convince us. </p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1123797"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123799"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123793"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Borys Wrzesnewskyj: </b>Mr. Speaker, is not the particular case of Ukraine a perfect example of the way we should be approaching  developing democracies, developing civil societies in the world?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was absolutely no question that it was an issue of trade or investment. We looked to our allies to work together with them, but we took on a leading role.  We took on a leading role because Canadians expected it of us. They expected us to stand up for Canadian values, values that we believe in, democracy and civil society.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other examples  perhaps of when trade or investment  influence our foreign policy in countries that have developing democracies or civil societies. I am not convinced that it is the Canadian values  of democracy and civil society espoused by foreign affairs  that take precedence at all times when the two departments work together. They should be separated. Foreign affairs should lay the groundwork and make sure that when Canadians become interested in investment and trade that we do it    with countries that we have helped along the path of democracy and civil society.</p><A NAME="T1250"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1250"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1245"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1250)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

However, I do not understand what went wrong in this mission, when we have the department that is there now. Again, we simply fear that, if the department is divided in two, trade will trump democratic rights.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on one side, there will be rhetoric, for example, by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who will talk about the right to democracy. </p><A NAME="Int-1123876"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123881"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123799"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Pierre Paquette: </b>He is good at that.</p><A NAME="Int-1123881"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123802"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123876"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. André Bellavance: </b>Yes, we can proudly wear a flower in our lapel for saying that the right to democracy in Ukraine, or elsewhere, is paramount.</p>

There will no longer be a need to be consistent in our decisions, since the two departments will be separate. Trade will prevail over the right to democracy, in spite of the rhetoric.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they are asking for is a little  like saying that because of the Wal-Mart situation maybe the province of Quebec should have its industry department connected with its  labour department.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, we are being told that this department should be split into two, but we still are not convinced. As I mentioned earlier, even the foreign affairs minister is not convinced that this is justified. We are still trying to be convinced, but I think that, on this side of the House, it is a lost cause. We are still not convinced.</p><A NAME="Int-1123815"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123852"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123807"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David McGuinty (Ottawa South, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am honoured to be able to contribute to the introduction of Bill C-32, an act to amend the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act and to make consequential amendments to other Acts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that this measure will definitely help Canada produce a more balanced and more  consistent foreign policy as we enter the 21st century and will thus ensure a more certain and more prosperous future for all Canadians. I agree with my hon. colleague, the parliamentary secretary, and I invite all members to support this bill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no intention, of course, of repeating the minister's remarks; rather I will describe the proposed changes in more detail and provide some context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As has already been mentioned, a year ago the Governor General signed an order in council separating the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade into two distinct departments. The order in council created the two departments and integrated them into the legislative framework governing all departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The order was made under the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act,  which enables the governor in council to transfer   any portion of the public service and powers and duties from one portion of the public service or from one minister to another. This act also gives the governor in council the power to reorganize the administration, which is essential to give the government sufficient latitude, but not the power to give or increase powers without the prior approval of Parliament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill at hand only codifies the changes to the operations of the former Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade in accordance with the order in council regarding the Department of Foreign Affairs. In actual fact, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the       Department of International Trade have been operating as distinct entities for nearly a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill is being studied in parallel with the bill creating the Department of International Trade. That said, I shall limit myself to a brief review of the amendments it proposes to make to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bill C-32 simply gives official status to the responsibilities given to the Minister and Department of Foreign Affairs by the December 12, 2003, order in council. Broadly speaking, the proposed amendments to the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act consist in erasing references to international trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the creation of the Department of  International Trade, the reason for these changes is obvious. Therefore,  the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Act will become the Departmentof Foreign Affairs Act and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade will simply be called the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The changes will allow the minister and the employees of the department to use the new name in their official and legal correspondence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill confirms that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will remain the head of the department whereas any mention of the Minister of International Trade as additional minister will be removed. However, it still mentions the Minister of International Cooperation, who supports the Minister of Foreign Affairs in his duties concerning Canada's international relations and has access to the services and facilities of the department. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there are now only two foreign affairs associate deputy ministers instead of three, the minister having the power to appoint one of them as deputy minister for political affairs. The bill eliminates reference to the associate deputy minister for international trade, which can now be found in the International Trade Department Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers and duties of the Minister of Foreign Affairs remain unchanged with the exception of his responsibilities over international trade which will now be under the purview of the Minister of International Trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the section which describes the duties of the Minister of International Trade is totally removed as is the mention of international trade development. I want to underline that the international economic relations coordination function has been changed to reflect the general mandate given the Minister of Foreign Affairs in the administration of the foreign policy and the coordination of international relations.</p><A NAME="T1255"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1255"><!-- Hour: 12--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1250"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1255)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the bill stipulates that the Minister of Foreign Affairs will no longer have the power to develop or implement trade development programs. The bill also adds on a section on allocation of funds stating that the funds authorized by Parliament for the Department's capital expenditures that are not used before year-end become obsolete at the end of the following year, unless otherwise stated in an  appropriation act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that the bill also provides for the addition of the Department of Foreign Affairs to the schedules of the Access to Information Act, the Financial Administration Act, the Privacy Act and the Public Sector Compensation Act. The bill creating the Department of International Trade will remove all reference to the former DFAIT in both pieces of legislation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The powers and responsibilities of the Minister of International Trade will henceforth be set under the Department of International Trade Act, which will also amend certain other acts to replace “Minister of Foreign Affairs” by “Minister of International Trade” or to add reference to the “Minister of International Trade” if needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This measure is not expected to have any repercussions on the daily activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs. Consular services and passport services for the public will not be affected, and Foreign Affairs Canada has promised to maintain these services for all partner departments in missions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On an operational level, all the major aspects of the separation should soon be in place. As I was saying earlier, the two departments already operate independently and coordinate their activities. The division of resources and personnel is a complex matter, but I am sure that if it is well managed, the two departments will be able to focus on their respective main mandates and Canada will be able to follow its chosen path, reinforcing its place in the world and giving itself a 21st century economy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the parliamentary secretary has already said, our entire foreign policy and the Department of Foreign Affairs itself, should be in step with globalization. This requires more than one department or internal agency, not to mention the provinces, to have a presence abroad. It is important to lay out a consistent strategic framework based on partnerships to achieve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the crucial role of international trade, investment and the integration of the Canadian economy to the global economy, it goes without saying that the Department of International Trade has an important place in this collaboration. For its part, once the Department of International Trade goes its separate way, the Department of Foreign Affairs will be in a better position to focus on its fundamental mandate, which will give increasing importance to achieving consistency between international programs and programs within the Canadian government and its new partners. It will be incumbent upon the Department of Foreign Affairs to  interrelate the various repercussions on foreign policy of  each partner's actions in trade, defence, development, environment, and so forth, and to promote in  interdepartmental authorities an understanding of the larger international context. </p><A NAME="T1300"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1300"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1255"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1300)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will let my colleagues elaborate on the advantages this bill presents to Canada. I just want to say that it is important to pass this bill. For a year now, the two departments involved, with their partner department, have worked extremely hard to promote Canada's international program.</p>
<p>[<i>English</i>]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That said, in a nutshell, there are several fundamental messages here that  Canadians should understand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the legislation simply reaffirms and enshrines the mandate of the Department of Foreign Affairs to coordinate and conduct Canada's foreign policy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bloc Québécois continues to raise issues that  are far outside the ambit of this bill and its effect. They are valid and legitimate questions that surround the question of globalization and    the integration of human rights,  environmental rights and environmental protection, the protection of labourers, and so on and so forth, but  as far as I am concerned  they fall well outside the ambit of the import of this basic bill which gives rise to a separate foreign affairs department to coordinate and conduct Canada's foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, this is simply the codification of provisions in the 12th of December, 2003 order, and it formalizes the separation of both departments. As such, the legislation has no impact whatsoever on day to day government operations. If that were the case, we would have seen such impacts, given that we are now many months after the original separation of both departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are four salient features that inform the highlights of this legislation. This reaffirms that the Department of Foreign Affairs is under the authority of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who is responsible for the management and the direction of both the department in Canada and abroad. It makes explicit that this minister conducts Canada's foreign policy, and no other minister, and coordinates Canada's international relations. It removes from the powers, duties and functions of the Minister of Foreign Affairs those responsibilities that are simply related to international trade. It adjusts several federal acts to reflect that Foreign Affairs Canada and International Trade Canada are two separate departments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This bill has to be read in conjunction with the bill establishing the Department of International Trade, and although there are valid concerns being raised by all members of the House with respect to the system which governs the global marketplace, the system which governs the protection of labour and labourers, the emerging system that  is in place to protect our international and national environments, the import of this bill is a simple one. It creates a separate department.</p><A NAME="T1305"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1305"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1300"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1305)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1123852"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123856"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123815"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP): </b>Mr. Speaker, my colleague's comments were obviously from a  very well prepared speech by the Department of Foreign Affairs.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to draw something to the attention of my hon. colleagues in the House. I am sure  the Bloc members    picked up on this but  I am curious if my Conservative colleagues picked up on this, because it kind of just snuck in there a few times. I just want to emphasize what my colleague from Ottawa South said a few times. He said that the legislation merely sanctions what we already did on December 12, 2003.  We really do not need this legislation because we have already done it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the heck are we doing here? Are we here to rubber-stamp what the government does? Is that what we are doing here? I can tell members that anybody who supports this bill is rubber-stamping the government overriding Parliament by not bringing this before Parliament before it did it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much will this  cost Canadian taxpayers? No one has said how much this will cost Canadian taxpayers  but the Liberals  have gone ahead and done it.  All we are here to do is to tell them that they have done a good job and that we will pass the bill because they think it is right. That just does not cut it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole process of Parliament is debating legislation before we proceed. That is the issue. What does my colleague have to say about that?</p><A NAME="Int-1123856"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123859"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123852"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David McGuinty: </b>Mr. Speaker, I was unable to discern a specific question or two with respect to the comments, but let me react to a few things the member said earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To begin, she spoke about the question of CIDA and whether or not CIDA has a particular mandate, a specific mandate, a legislated mandate. This is an interesting question.  As a former lawyer who has performed a lot of international development work, who has acted in an executive capacity for CIDA  and whose own spouse spent five years working for CIDA, I find that an interesting comment when 1,100 employees of the Canadian International Development Agency and several thousand consultants do not believe they have a mandate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mandate of CIDA  is crystal clear.  It is informed by a series of principles and objectives, including the sustainable development of the planet, as CIDA pursues its development projects all over the world in dozens and dozens of countries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second fact the member has omitted to share with the House is the fact that many and in fact dozens of government departments have international activities.  Each of these is coordinated through and under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is another reason why we needed to hive off and form a separate department.  It was so we could better manage what is happening at Agriculture Canada, at Environment Canada or at the Treasury Board in terms of international projects and in terms of technical assistance which is going on all over the world. This is a strengthening of our capacity to deal with these internal management challenges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, just to be very clear, how can the governor in council simply create a new department?  Does Parliament not have to approve a new department?  The creation of new departments occurred within the statutory framework provided by Parliament.  Under the authority of the Public Service Rearrangement and Transfer of Duties Act, this governor in council has the ability to transfer portions of the public service and ministerial powers, duties and functions from one part of the public service to another or from one minister to another.</p><A NAME="T1310"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1310"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1305"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1310)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1123859"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123863"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123856"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais: </b>Mr. Speaker, the member was referring to my comments on CIDA from earlier this morning.  I am going to reflect on them. What I was calling for was a legislative mandate for CIDA, not a little statement in 1968 from the governor in council.  I want to see a legislative mandate brought before Parliament, just like this legislation should have been brought before Parliament.  That is what is important here and that is something the government seems to forget.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a minority Parliament right now.  This government should have known that it has to do business differently.</p><A NAME="Int-1123863"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123866"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123859"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David McGuinty: </b>Mr. Speaker, again I was trying to discern a question.  I appreciate the comment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, let us be clear with respect to CIDA. Why is the role of the CIDA minister not dealt with specifically in this legislation? This legislation is simple.  It is to codify in law the December 2003 order in council.  There are no ghosts hovering around this bill. Second, the amended act continues to provide for the Minister of International Cooperation to assist the Minister of Foreign Affairs, clearly in his or her responsibilities relating to the conduct of Canada's international relations. There is nothing omitted here that was not already included before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the government has decided to maintain the existing close integration of international development assistance, policies and programs with our foreign policy more generally. We all know of the symmetry, for example, between Canada's multilateral approach, which some describe as part of Canadian DNA, and our international development, our good governance work, our rule of law work  in other jurisdictions. An example of that is what we are doing today in Afghanistan.</p><A NAME="Int-1123866"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123868"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123863"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Keith Martin (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Defence, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I compliment my colleague on his fine speech and on his answers to the member from the NDP, and  I am sure they are very clear to her.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bill is about the division of the foreign affairs department, which we have spoken about before, but I want to look into the future of our country, our government and what we are doing to deal with some problems that have seemed intractable for a very long time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These include the prevention of genocide, the pandemic of AIDS, malaria and other diseases that kill millions of people in the world,  and looking at aid in a different way to make sure that, rather than putting good money after bad, our aid moneys are going to be used as effectively as possible. We need focused, effective aid to deal with the problems that people are faced with in some of the poorest parts of the world. And there is also terrorism. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need a  new vision for aid, for example, that is focused and coordinated, and where we look at trade that is fair and effective. The NDP has brought up many important issues that have to deal with fair trade. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, we in our party are gripped with this issue. The Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of International Trade are both gripped with this issue and are working hard with our partners to try to reduce the barriers to trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two big issues that the government has put forward which I think all members should support. One is the L20 and the other is the Canada Corps. The L20 can be a new, dynamic, focused group of countries, north and south, east and west, developed and developing, which can address  the seemingly intractable problems that I mentioned. The other, the Canada Corps, can bring in the best and brightest of our country and apply their skills, be they medical personnel, engineers, teachers or others, to address these problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ask my friend a simple question. How does he see the issue of the Canada Corps and the L20 moving forward after we have had this division into both parts of what was formerly DFAIT?</p><A NAME="T1315"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1315"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1310"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1315)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1123868"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123871"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123866"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. David McGuinty: </b>Mr. Speaker, what is remarkable about the work of this Prime Minister that all members of the House should keep in mind is that he was one of the earliest proponents of the expansion of the notion of the G-7 to an L20. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he drive that? I am convinced he drove it because he understood that there are  a number of mid-power nation-states all over the world that needed to come together and serve in some ways as a counterweight to, for example, the economic power of the United States of America.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not to say that this party is anti-United States or anti-American, but simply to admit that there is an L20 need out there, and I think the Prime Minister should be congratulated in fairness and objectively for his work in pursuing this notion on an international basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canada Corps is a wonderful opportunity for young Canadians to go abroad and take the message of Canadian multilateralism, Canadian tolerance and Canadian diversity to  all four corners of the planet. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something that the split or the hiving off of the Department of Foreign Affairs will further facilitate in terms of the management, the support and the spreading of the message that the L20 concept is a positive one for Canada and the globe, and the Canada Corps messages that informed its creation are desperately needed at a time when there are so many different hot spots and conflicts all over the world.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1123871"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123925"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123868"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—La Petite-Patrie, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise in this House to speak on Bill C-32, to separate the functions and responsibilities of the Department of Foreign Affairs and that of the Department of International Trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday, I had an opportunity to speak on Bill C-31, whose purpose is essentially the same. It is important to mention, however, that our discussions and debates in this place can only be conclusive if other debates are held down  the line, particularly regarding the order that was made and which the Governor in Council general passed in December 2003.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we are doing here today—and I tend to agree with my hon. colleague from the NDP—is debating an issue which, really, was settled on December 12, 2003, when an order was passed. All this bill has done, although it may not be mundane, is to start a discussion on issues that had already been settled and  incorporated into a bill that was tabled on December 7, 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to ask ourselves what the government's real  motivation is in  bringing Bill C-32  up for debate today. The hon. members and ministers across the way would have us believe that this is a purely administrative and technical bill, with no   substance, and no vision in terms of the issues and concerns of the government opposite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quite the contrary, what this Parliament is about to pass is not mundane at all. Basically, it puts into action a vision to separate      a number of rights with respect to international trade. At a time when globalization can no longer be achieved in isolation, and when management by silos is rejected around the world  in favour of a greater integration of the protection of rights—be it human rights, labour or environmental  rights—into globalization mechanisms, we have in front of us a government which is trying to get us to pass a bill designed to undo something that is internationally recognized.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Department of Foreign Affairs underwent a number of reorganizations in the past. In 1971, under Pierre Elliott Trudeau,  the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade was integrated. In 1981, another reorganization took place, and also in 1982. The latter sought to integrate and transfer the activities relating to CIDA, industry, trade and commerce, and the trade policy, to the department. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twenty-five years ago, when our exports accounted for barely 20% of Canada's GDP, such a decision might have been justified. However, we are now in a context of new markets and greater liberalization, with the result that our exports now account for more than 40% of our GDP. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, there is a global debate on the importance of integrating environmental protection, human rights and  labour laws in our governments' decision-making process.</p><A NAME="T1320"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1320"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1325"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1315"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1320)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a time when, in Davos and at international forums, civil society groups are trying to be heard to ensure that these concerns are reflected in trade rules, this government wants to split the role of Foreign Affairs and International Trade. We cannot sign international conventions and, at the same time, not take these concerns into consideration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes ago, I was listening to the parliamentary secretary to the Minister of National Defence. I understand why he supports this bill. It is precisely because he is in favour of this splitting between Foreign Affairs and  International Trade. He is hoping that projects such as the missile defence shield are implemented before the review of Canada's foreign policy has even begun. It suits him that this distinction be made between trade and our foreign policy. He is even hoping that a similar distinction will be made between Canada's foreign and defence policies, so that this silo approach can be perpetuated.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this side of the House, we see things quite differently. For example, my colleague opposite, with whom I was on a mission in Ukraine in December, mentioned, by way of example, the importance of dividing the  departments. However, since Canada has recognized the independence of Ukraine, one of the fundamental aspects has been its trade rules and its trade with Ukraine, which is the cornerstone of our trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Ukrainians were fighting  for the restoration of democracy, the government was trying to have us believe that commercial interests must not weigh in the balance in such a process.  Do they think that, when societies are trying to restore the voice of democracy in their country, trade between them and Canada is not a consideration? I would think so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China is the best example. That country is currently experiencing an important economic boom and vigorous growth and development, which will most probably expand trade between Canada and China. Is the government opposite,   trying to tell us that politics and human rights considerations must not be a factor in the kind of trade we will have in the future with China? On the contrary, we must incorporate these international trading activities and decisions in Canadian foreign policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all the more true since trade has evolved in recent  years. We must not forget the role of International Trade Canada, which comprises three main elements: the promotion of international trade, investment promotion and partnerships, and commercial and economic policy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promotion of international trade goes without saying. However, I would like to draw your attention to two other aspects of the mandate of International Trade Canada: investment partnerships. It is as if, on the other side of the House, investment was  real and visible based solely on what we have accomplished in the past 10, 15, or 20 years.</p><A NAME="T1325"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1325"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1320"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1325)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, new concerns are emerging with regard to investments. In recent years, we have seen the emergence of what is known as “socially responsible investments”. Before investing, potential investors seriously consider if the rights of workers and social rights are being respected. In my opinion, this is an integrated vision of investment partnering which, quite often, is developed by visionary small businesses wanting to ensure that these human rights are respected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If groups within civil society or individuals believe in socially responsible investing—personally, I do—we should expect the government to have just as much faith in it. The way to clearly express this would have been to maintain and not divide foreign policy and international trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is another aspect. The third aspect of the mandate of International Trade Canada relates to trade and economic policy, as if trade and economic policies remained the same and were not in constant evolution. We want to remind the government that fair trade—not trade for the sake of trade—means trade based on the creation of added-value products where the human element is integral to each product and its value. It is as if this did not exist, in the government's eyes. If the government truly believed in fair trade, it would maintain the conditions needed for these small groups to succeed. No, the decision is made to say trade is trade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biodiversity is another such example, since Canada has decided not to ratify the Cartagena protocol on biosafety. Its failure to ratify this protocol means it does not want to distinguish between products with GMOs and traditional products. So, it does not want to distinguish between the different products on the market.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To ensure a policy that ensures and that should ensure consistency, we must reject this bill which, in my opinion, clearly fails to make effective use of human resources and is clearly inconsistent in terms of services.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said: Mr. Speaker, in 2003, the Bloc Québécois was moved to take action in response to the regular gas price hikes, most of these for no reason, or no real reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its November 2003 report in response to the unanimous motion by the Bloc Québécois in February 2003, the Standing Committee of Industry, Science and Technology, having studied this matter, felt obliged to recommend creation of a  petroleum price monitoring agency.  The present government,  at the time in a heavy majority position and just as arrogant as now, rejected the recommendation, despite the unanimous opinion on the committee, some of whose members were Liberals, the present Minister of Immigration in particular.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The finance minister at that time, the irresponsible finance minister, I might add, and equally irresponsible PM now, had the gall to amend the taxation system in order to benefit  the oil and gas companies even further.  He dropped the tax rate on their profits from 27% to 21% over three years, while doing the exact opposite to mining companies, at a time when they were experiencing the lowest ever prices for their products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, in  a number of Quebec areas, in particular  Abitibi-Nord, Abitibi-Témiscamingue and the Eastern Townships, mines closed down and hundreds of workers were out of work, while the oil companies, for the first quarter of 2004 alone, were blessed with additional revenues not far from the million dollar mark,   including the increase in refining margins. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for the consumers, the truckers, taxi drivers, people living in the regions, the common carriers, both bus and trucking companies and airlines, they have never had an ounce of assistance from the government.  I am  not including in this certain shipping companies which conceal their assets in tax havens, fly flags of convenience, make purchases anywhere but here,  and pump out their bilges into Canadian waters, Quebec waters if at all possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now for the rise in gas prices.  As I said at the beginning, gas prices  have been increasing by leaps and bounds for years.  This happened in 1999, the winter of 2000-01, the winter of 2-003, and once again in 2004.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May 2004, gas prices reached record levels in the Montreal area, with a weekly average of 99.7¢ a litre for regular gas, I should point out. All kinds of excuses, each as false as the next,  were given, such as the war in Iraq, intense cold, taxes, pipeline sabotage and production cutbacks by Arab countries, to name but a few. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up to now, none of  these has had any effect on gas prices at the pump, it seems, up to now quite the contrary.  Shortages have been created artificially, and, each time,  the government revelled in the situation, even though 53% of the revenues generated went in the direction of the United States.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is worth mentioning that between May 2002 and May 2003, profit margins jumped by 62.33%, and from May of 2003 to May of 2004, they increased by 86%. In other words, they went from 29.5 cents a litre to 54.9¢ a litre and during the same period, the inflation rate was 2%, for the very reason that it was affected by the sharp increases in the price of petroleum products. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To show how little consideration this government gives to consumers, we need only consider that petroleum product prices more than doubled between 1999 and 2000. Under pressure from the opposition parties, the government introduced at that time a program to help consumers pay their heating bills. However, between 1999 and 2002, the price of petroleum products increased more than fivefold, but the assistance program disappeared, despite an even sharper increase between 2003 and 2004.</p><A NAME="T1335"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1335"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1330"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1335)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Minister, who was then finance minister and a shareholder in a western oil company, in apparently flagrant conflict of interests, had no qualms—any more than he did in the sponsorship scandal—when he reduced the taxes on petroleum company profits by 6%.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me be perfectly clear; I am not accusing him of getting richer. He probably lost some money, but that is not something we will shed tears over when we think about the poor folks who lost their entire life savings, or those who are unable to retire as they planned, all because of the minister's failure to regularize this situation. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us not kid ourselves; inflation caused by gas prices has had many effects and impacts on consumer prices, transportation costs—for those who could change them quickly enough—and on the survival of certain transportation companies, whether they move passengers or goods by air or on land. Air Canada is one example we might think of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most shocking thing in all this, and I am repeating it, is the fact that at least 53%  of these profits do not even touch down in Canada before going off to the United States. The same thing is still happening today with this government. We could mention the printing of our money in Germany, the production of advertising brochures in China, and particularly the very explicit encouragement to clothing manufacturers to go and set up shop where slave labour is the norm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a time when the federal government intervened with presence and authority in the oil industry in order to help the producers themselves in the 1960s. That was on the  recommendation of the Borden commission. In 1974 there was a freeze on the price of Canadian oil at a level below world prices. In 1975, Petro Canada was created to set a standard for the industry.  It cost Canadians a bundle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was beneficial for a time, that is, until the government realized that it was a great pork barrel for their buddies, who were just as greedy as the ones today, and then gave them a wonderful gift by selling them half of this crown corporation at a price everyone at the time thought ridiculously low.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was from that moment that its true mission was completely dropped and it became a champion of increased profits to the detriment of Canadian shareholders. This government decided to hand over to another Liberal friendly company the job of liquidating for good what was left of a company that had just made a 564% jump in profits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1984, the federal government has been much more concerned with freeing oil markets from their obligations than protecting consumers and other companies from the underhanded control of the oil market, going so far as to present them with the  possibility of adding billions of dollars more to their existing exorbitant benefits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of boosting these shameless surpluses, it would have been more appropriate to surtax the excessive profits, which might have discouraged these excessive profits. It also could have just as well required a decrease of emissions in the atmosphere. A portion of this surplus could have been used for this purpose and we may not be talking about this decrease today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the major oil companies insist that consumers are well served by the current market, one thing remains unanswered: the blatant lack of transparency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lack of authority of the Competition Act prevents Competition Bureau investigations from being effective.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time a crisis arises, the public wonders about the oil industry. It is high time to put an end to the crises every time the price of gas suddenly surges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is no secret. The crises are in large part due to the lack of competition in the oil industry where 75% of the market belongs to the three largest refineries. The increased profits for these oil companies stems directly from the profit margin at the refining stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, according to AQUIP, it costs between 2.5¢ and 4¢ to refine one litre of gas. When the refining margin is between  4¢ and 6¢ a litre, the company does well.</p><A NAME="T1340"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1340"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1335"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1340)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Between 1998 and March 2003, the margins averaged 7.2¢ a liter. Could it be said that it was very good? As of early March 2003, these margins fluctuated between 9.5¢  and 11¢ a liter, reaching 11.4¢ in March 2004 and an almost incredible amount of 21.7¢ of profit margin.   </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is having a huge Impact on certain groups of citizens and on the economy in general. It is hurting sugarbush operators who need to heat and boil the syrup, farmers who operate farm machinery, contract truckers, all those who use heating fuel, mass transit services, bus companies whose ridership has plummeted because of the increase in prices, just as airlines and the tourism industry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A first solution had been proposed. The Standing Committee on Industry, Natural Resources, Science and Technology of the Chamber of Commons, in its report on the Competition Act, recommended a reversal of the burden of the proof to deal with agreements among competitors and to determine whether there is a conspiracy. It would have been the responsibility of the party wishing to enter into an agreement to prove the ultimate social value of that agreement. The Bloc Québécois supported that report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 5, 2003, in the industry, natural resources, science and technology committee , Mr. von Finckenstein, the Commissioner of Competition,  cited raised as a shortcoming of the current Competition Act the   lack of investigative powers in the context of a study of the industry, and the need to have an independent body with the authority to summon witnesses and gather information while protecting confidential information that no one wishes disclosed but that would be essential to a factual conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, how is information to be gathered when documents cannot be disclosed and witnesses protected?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second solution that was  proposed was the establishment of  a petroleum monitoring agency. On April 2, 2004, the Liberal government presented its response to the  standing committee's report. It said no to the establishment of a monitoring agency. It simply pledged to promote the  dissemination and understanding of information on petroleum product prices. And this, even though the Liberals on the committee, including the current Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, had supported the report. This is another example of the democratic deficit under the current Prime Minister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have only one minute left, I will conclude here. I urge all members of this House to support this motion in order to stabilize the quality of life of all taxpayers in every one of our ridings and to  stabilize and curb any inflationary tendency.</p><A NAME="T1345"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1345"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1340"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1345)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to question the validity of the figures that are  available to us.  As he correctly pointed out, it was in 1995 through program review that the current Prime Minister, then the finance minister, eliminated a lot of the functions within the Department of Natural Resources to examine gasoline prices.  However, there are  public companies, such as  MJ Ervin &amp; Associates, that publish the prices every day on the Internet.  I was on the committee when we studied this issue. In fact none of the witnesses who appeared before us, even those who alleged collusion, questioned the validity of the figures put out by  MJ Ervin &amp; Associates. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to get the member's comments.  Does he accept the figures that are put out by MJ Ervin &amp; Associates?  Are those figures correct in his view, or are they wrong?  Is that one reason   he is proposing this motion?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the Competition Bureau can already investigate these matters  if it gets letters of complaint from six citizens.  This  seems to me to be a fairly low threshold.  If he thinks that is not sufficient, and obviously he does, why then does he see that as insufficient?</p>

I indicated that, in 1975, the government created a company  called Petro-Canada, at great expense to    Canadians, to stabilize oil industry in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the gasoline prices posted on the Internet, we are not questioning the figures. We are only questioning the need to set prices that high. No reason was provided to justify such high prices, because there is no correlation between the  cost  of a barrel of oil  and the price charged at the pump. The    refining margin   always jacked oil prices up. A reasonable profit margin for a refiner is somewhere between 2.5¢ and 4¢ per litre.</p><A NAME="Int-1123956"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123958"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123954"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Bouchard (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate my colleague from Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou on a fine speech.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all know there are taxes on gasoline: GST, QST along with federal and provincial taxes. Could my colleague tell me if the gasoline taxes are responsible for the increase in the price of gasoline?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also like him to explain the different tax levels in each region of Quebec.</p><A NAME="Int-1123958"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123960"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123956"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Yvon Lévesque: </b>Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague for his question. Even if some find that the taxes are too high, they do not really vary and certainly cannot account for the fluctuations in the price of gasoline. Most of these taxes are set and do not vary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, at the federal level, there is a set amount of 10 cents on the price of gasoline. At the provincial level, in Quebec, for the central regions, there is a maximum amount of 15.2¢ per litre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The provincial gasoline tax varies according to four tax zones. In the central regions, the tax level is 15.2¢. In the peripheral regions, Côte-Nord, Lac-Saint-Jean and Abitibi, for example, the tax level is 10.55¢ per litre. In specific regions like Rimouski or La Tuque, it is 12.9 cents per litre. In the border regions, the tax level varies up to a maximum of 14.2¢ per litre. GST is 7%, QST is 7.5%. Consequently, only the GST and QST vary in case of an increase before tax.</p><A NAME="T1350"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1350"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1345"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1350)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It is a noble effort, and I would like to speak to it today in two parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I would like to address Motion No. 165 by addressing the notion of a petroleum monitoring agency. This first proposal calls for the creation of a petroleum monitoring agency that would prepare an annual report on all aspects of the petroleum industry for consideration by the Standing Committee on Industry, Natural Resources, Science and Technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposal is very similar to a recommendation made by the former Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in November of 2003, at the conclusion of its report on gasoline prices in Canada. The committee's recommendation, however, at that time specifically indicated that a primary role of the agency should be to collect and disseminate pricing data, by removing specific reference to the collection and dissemination of pricing data and by replacing it with a mandate to report “on all aspects of the industry, including how prices are set and competition issues”. The motion suggests an even larger role for a new agency.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further to this last point, I should note that the committee's report concluded:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="15" align="right"></td>
<td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>In terms of federal government action, the Committee is satisfied that the Competition Bureau has sufficient powers, personnel and resources devoted to overseeing competitive aspects of the petroleum industry.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this finding, I have to  ask, why do we need an agency with an expanded mandate to report annually “on all aspects of the industry, including how prices are set and competition issues?” </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, in its report on gasoline pricing in Canada, the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology examined a significant increase in the price of gasoline that took place over several months. It found that the price increase: </p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>--was the result of industry participants’ competitive reactions to a series of international crises and the abnormally cold weather that gripped northeast North America last winter. No evidence was presented to the Committee of a conspiracy to raise and fix prices, nor was there evidence presented of abusive behaviour on the part of vertically integrated suppliers in the form of squeezing retail margins to eliminate or discipline independent retailers.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In its response to the committee's report on gasoline prices in Canada, the Government of Canada indicated that it had given careful consideration to the recommendation concerning the creation of a petroleum monitoring agency. Still the government concluded that current activities undertaken by federal and provincial governments or agencies, combined with information collected and widely distributed by the private sector, “provide the most practical and cost-effective method of informing the consumer”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, there is no evidence to suggest that the creation of a new petroleum monitoring agency, with its inevitable costs, is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me turn secondly then to the bill's call for amendments to the Competition Act. The second part of the motion proposes that the government should bring:</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td width="30" align="right"></td>
<td><small>forward amendments to strengthen the Competition Act, including measures to ensure that the Competition Commissioner has the power to launch investigations, summon witnesses and ensure confidentiality.</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government indicated in the throne speech that it was committed to providing an up to date legislative framework for business, and that it would propose changes to amend the Competition Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The government has already acted on the latter commitment. Bill C-19, an act to amend the Competition Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts, was tabled in early November of 2004, and referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Natural Resources, Science and Technology on November 16. The proposed legislation follows extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders, large and small businesses, consumers, consumer groups, economists and legal experts to help ensure that the proposed amendments will contribute to a modern competition regime in Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The proposed legislation, which is consistent with the recommendations made by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in 2002, includes the following actions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, it gives the Commissioner of Competition the authority to seek restitution for consumer loss resulting from false or misleading representations.  This will encourage companies to be accurate in their claims. It will allow consumers to get up to the amount paid if they have been duped by false claims.</p><A NAME="T1355"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1355"><!-- Hour: 1--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1350"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1355)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, it introduces a general administrative monetary penalty provision for abuse of dominance in any industry. Currently, with the exception of airlines, the main consequence for abuse of dominance is simply an order from the Competition Tribunal requiring an end to the practice.  Under exceptional circumstances, a structural change, such as divestiture, may be required. This amendment represents an additional tool to ensure compliance with the Competition Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, the legislation also removes airline specific provisions from the act to return it to a law of general application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth, finally it decriminalizes the pricing provisions dealing with price discrimination, regional price discrimination, predatory pricing and promotional allowances, so they can be dealt with under a civil regime, and this is very important, and the abuse of dominant position provisions of the Competition Act. This means that conduct like predatory pricing will receive the benefit of a full hearing on its likely economic effect.  Cases will also be assessed by the Competition Tribunal with a lower civil burden of proof compared to the former criminal burden of proof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion before us is not clear.  It does not describe what amendments are being proposed, other than amendments to strengthen the Competition Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us look at the facts.  The Commissioner can currently initiate inquiries if there is reason to believe that an offence has been committed or that grounds exist for the making of a remedial order by the Competition Tribunal. The Commissioner can summon witnesses, subject to judicial authorization; and the Commissioner must keep information confidential pursuant to section 29 of the Competition Act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While not clear, Motion No. 165 may be referring to a suggestion that the Commissioner should have the power to conduct inquiries into markets or industry practices, even if there is no reason to believe that an offence has been committed when significant competition issues have been raised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other members of the Bloc Québécois have publicly indicated that this would represent an improvement to the Competition Act, and have cited a study of the gasoline industry as an example of why such powers are needed.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this is the  government's experience. Recent nationwide consultations on various options to strengthen the Competition Act included a proposal to allow the Commissioner to ask an independent body, such as the Canadian International Trade Tribunal, to inquire into the state of competition and the functioning of markets in any sector of the Canadian economy. While some stakeholders supported the idea of market or general inquiries, many stakeholders raised strong objections to this proposal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serious concerns were raised with respect to procedures, length of time that these types of inquiries typically take and substantial costs likely to be incurred by both government and businesses in inquiries of this nature.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is my understanding that in response to these concerns, the Competition Bureau is now presently examining the approaches used in other jurisdictions on a comparative basis that have general inquiry powers for competition related issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to my final point.  The Competition Act, which dates back to 1889, is legislation of general application which provides a framework within which business can operate. It is important to approach changes to it with very careful consideration and to fully understand the possible implications of proposed amendments.  There is no evidence indicating that a petroleum monitoring agency is needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if the motion refers to general or market inquiries, I understand that more work is currently being undertaken by the Competition Bureau to resolve issues raised by stakeholders during consultations.</p><A NAME="Int-1123965"></A><a HREF="#Int-1123974"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1123960"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton—Leduc, CPC): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to speak to Motion No. 165, and I would like to read the motion into the record.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member of the industry committee that  studied this issue, I want to provide some background for members of the House. The committee studied it extensively. It issued a report in November 2003. The committee recommended something similar to what is in part (a) of the motion, although as the member just pointed out, something not quite as extensive. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to part (b) of the motion, it is true that gas prices in Quebec tend to be higher than they are in Ontario. Members of the Bloc have claimed for a long time that  there is collusion in the industry and that gas prices should be regulated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it is important to point out that no evidence of collusion has actually come forward. In fact, the Competition Commissioner pointed out that the industry had been studied 18 to 19 times on that basis and each time it was found that there was no collusion, except in minor cases at the local retail level, not at the crude oil price, which is a world price, nor at the wholesale level, which is done within the North American context.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As well, I should point out as the government has done on a number of occasions, rightly, that the regulation of gasoline prices in Canada can be done at the provincial level. Provincial governments are free to regulate gasoline prices. In Quebec, if  it feels a need to do so, the provincial government can certainly step in and regulate gasoline prices if it feels it is in the best interests of their citizens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important to point out, though, that Canada ranks very low on the list in terms of gasoline prices across the world.  These figures are free to anyone who wants to surf them.  International Energy Agency points out that in 2003, when this study was done by the industry committee, Canada had the second lowest gasoline prices to the United States and the world at that time.  If we took the comparative levels of taxation out from both the American side and the Canadian side, Canada would rank the lowest in terms of our gasoline prices. To put it into perspective, it is important for us to realize that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also want to provide some background on the price.  People look at the price as they drive by, but they do not understand what goes into setting that price.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, there is the international price of crude oil as set by global supply and demand. This is what people are referring to when they are talking about the cost of a barrel of oil. Obviously, that price has been very high in recent years for various reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second component to look at is the wholesale or the rack price which is the finished gasoline product used by cars and involves refining by oil refineries. For us in Canada, the price is set within a North American context. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third is the local price that we see when we drive into fill up our vehicles, and this is a regional market price. It varies from city to city, province to province, region to region. It is a very locally driven price. However, the retail price includes taxes to which we in this party have certainly drawn attention.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to point out that the standing committee report, which was done in 2003,  pointed out that over the long term the price of gasoline, excluding taxes, increased by 50% while taxes on the price of gasoline increased by 67%. Taxes are the fastest growing component of the final price of gasoline, a fact that should be clearly understood by all of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tax burden at the pump has been raised as one of the reasons why prices are higher in Canada than in the United States. In fact, once the taxes are stripped out and do the exchange rate, the price of gasoline is very similar, even lower in Canada than it is in the United States.</p><A NAME="T1400"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1400"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1355"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1400)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to remind my colleagues on the government side that they promised to look at the whole policy of taxation on gasoline  from the GST standpoint, but also in terms of  the 10¢ a litre excise tax  and  sharing that with the provinces and municipalities for infrastructure. That has been promised for two to three years. It should certainly be fulfilled in our view. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of returning to the issue of whether there is collusion within this industry, members of the standing committee listened to witnesses from all sides. Members of all parties had the opportunity to bring forward their arguments. The evidence was clear that collusion was not the cause of the increase in the price of gasoline in early 2003. This issue has been investigated 19 times. I think it is important to actually quote the competition commissioner who stated at that time, “We have never found  any evidence of any kind of collusion, except at a very local level, which is  usually a bunch of stations getting together and trying to maintain the price at a certain level. Those we have prosecuted with some success”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even those who testified that they believed collusion was possible in gasoline pricing  offered no concrete evidence. The Quebec consumer coalition was unable to offer any proof except its  belief, not the actual data that it  presented to committee, but just a belief that there was a strong possibility of a price fixing arrangement. A possibility is not a fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that should be emphasized here with respect to part (b) of the motion is that  the Competition Bureau currently has all the powers it needs to investigate collusion. Those Canadians  watching the debate who feel there is collusion should  get five of their friends to write specifically about whether it is two stations or three stations they suspect and  submit that to the competition commissioner. If people have a suspicion, they should gain a little bit of evidence and submit that to the Competition Bureau to deal with it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Competition Bureau did say to  the committee  that it is hampered by resources. It obviously has a finite level of resources and could use more resources to fulfill its mandate. Our party would be willing to look at that. However, we do not feel that the proper thing to do here, based on the fact that it has investigated this 19 times and has found no evidence of  collusion on a grand scale, is to give the Competition Bureau more authority  in this area. We feel it has  enough power as it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, we have called for the industry itself to do more in explaining the actual price, to do more in explaining about the components of what goes into the price in terms of the crude price, the wholesale price, the retail price and the taxes. The industry has made some efforts in that area, but it  could certainly do more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I mentioned, if the commissioner feels  there are too many cases being presented and the bureau needs more resources, we would look at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say indirectly, just as  support for the member, that there was a report done in 2003 and the government talked about setting up some form of information commissioner. We supported that even though frankly we did not  see a great need for it. That is why I asked the member if he questioned the data that was available from MJ Ervin   &amp;  Associates. This information is available and  every Canadian can monitor  the price of gasoline across Canada. I encourage them to do that to obtain  more information about how prices fluctuate across Canada.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nevertheless, the industry itself would even support having  a petroleum information commissioner who would  provide information to  Canadians on a regular basis. We see it as a double bureaucracy and  is not necessary, but if it would give more credence to the argument that the gasoline industry is not colluding, then maybe we should look at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main point we  would make is that those who would   want to launch an accusation of collusion ought to do so by bringing forward specific allegations against that industry. We should be very hesitant about launching accusations against industries within this country unless there is  actual data. If there is such data, it  should be submitted  to the Competition Bureau  to investigate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our view, and going back to the main point in the committee report, the fastest growing component of gasoline prices is taxes. Our party called for a reduction in taxes and certainly the GST in a 2003 report. That simply has not been implemented by the government. We would encourage it to do so immediately.</p><A NAME="T1405"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1405"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1400"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1405)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

This is an important issue, not just for those who    work, but also for the businesses that must use oil.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The members of the Bloc Québécois have repeatedly tried to make the government understand that not only are there risks of collusion within the industry, but also that there is a real disadvantage for the consumer. Who has not had the experience of going to the gas station at the beginning of the week, and, lo and behold, the price of gas per litre has gone up by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 cents?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I found it rather rich to hear our colleagues in the Conservative Party of Canada trying to be reassuring with respect to the behaviour of the industry, one of the most profitable industries, as we will show later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, my colleague, the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou, is bringing forward a motion that has two aims. Allow me to read the motion to make things clear for everybody.</p>
<p>
<table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
<tr valign="top">
<td><small>That, in the opinion of theHouse, the government should take action with regard togasoline prices by: (a) setting up a petroleum monitoringagency responsible for preparing an annual report on all aspectsof the industry—</small></td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are well aware that, in Canada, for example, the cost of drugs is controlled. So, when there is a situation of relative consumer  dependency  on one type of industrial sector, it is quite normal to consider that the state has a responsibility to monitor or even control the cost, the inflation price index, the price increase of a food product deemed essential to daily life. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The motion proposes to set up a petroleum monitoring agency, which would be separate from the Competition Tribunal and the Competition Bureau. We are not saying that this  bureau is not doing a good job or that it is not useful. We are saying that it does not have the authority to force people to testify and to conduct independent investigations. So, it cannot monitor or divulge information, as the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou was saying . In this sense, the bureau cannot play the role of watchdog that we should be able to expect. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us examine the pharmaceutical industry, about which I have learned a thing or two in my role as health critic. The government has introduced the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, which can oblige companies to testify. We are talking about big companies that perform research, the major innovative companies. The review board can issue orders that have the same weight as those issued by the Federal Court. It can even force the pharmaceutical industry to give back some of its profits when the revenues are deemed unjustified because of excessive prices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe this was the example that the hon. member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou had in mind when he presented this motion in the House.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we went to Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal, Moncton or any other major Canadian city, would hon. members agree that our fellow Canadians, irrespective of any kind of partisanship, are concerned by this collusion between the industries? When one increases its prices, everyone increases theirs at the same time. We are told that the review board could not conclude that there was indeed collusion. This is like some kind of vicious circle. It is circular reasoning.</p><A NAME="T1410"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1410"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1405"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1410)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, why was the Competition Tribunal or the Competition Commission not able to come to this conclusion? Because the Competition Bureau, whose mandate it is to set up the tribunal, does not  have the resources needed to do so. The tribunal cannot force witnesses to testify; it does not have access to records; it cannot divulge data, which is why it was unable to come to this conclusion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us stick, however, to common sense as we think of our constituents, with the week-end fast approaching. I remember the collusion that we witnessed, in Montreal for instance, before the construction holidays, in July. We saw the big oil companies raise their prices. This government has no backbone: while the law of silence reigns, it ignores the interests of the consumers and says, “No, there is no need for it, there is no need for concern.“ It is not really concerned about what happens to consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consumers are not the only ones who should be concerned. The status quo is not in the interest of big business either. I heard my colleague, who defeated our colleague, Mr. Bertrand, at his nomination meeting. He does not seem to be concerned about the situation. I invite him to be more vigilant because there is collusion.  As consumers, we cannot allow the situation to continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, governments collect taxes on gas. I have some numbers here. The federal government collects 10¢ per litre.   The Quebec government can collect up to 15¢. There are regional differences. There are regions where the tax can reach 15¢. In some remote areas, such as the North Coast, the Lac Saint-Jean area, the Abitibi area, it can be 10¢. In certain border areas, the tax can be as high as 14¢. However, the root of the problem remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we look at the profits recorded, we realize that Petro-Canada recorded an unbelievable increase in profits, so huge and exaggerated are they. They leapt upward by 564% in 2003, not 50 years ago, but two years ago. I repeat that Petro-Canada's profits increased by 564%, from $88 million to $584 million in the first quarter of 2003. We do not object to companies making profits, we are in a capitalistic regime. If companies make profits, it is because they take the risk of investing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, when a company declares a return on investment that translates into  $584 million profits, we have good reason to ask questions. A few moments ago, we were told—and I am sure my colleague listened carefully—that 5¢ was a reasonable margin  for refining. However, in some situations that were brought to our attention, profit margin at refining reached 21¢. Are we not right to think that that is not in the best interest of the consumer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am somewhat angry, in spite of my deeply calm and placid temper, when I see the Liberals and the Conservatives, the two great traditional parties, unite in a common front that goes against the interest of the consumer. I think that the Competition Bureau must be given somewhat more extensive powers. The commissioner must be able to do real investigative work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must not end up again in a situation where, on the eve of a long holiday, like  the construction sector holiday in Quebec, the big oil corporations hike their retail prices—the gas liter had undergone a huge increase—and we are told in this House that there is no need for concern. Only obvious contempt for the consumer can lead the two major parties to express such irresponsible and uncaring views, that in no way serve the interest of the consumer.</p><A NAME="T1415"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1415"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1410"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1415)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Paddy Torsney (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Cooperation, Lib.): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am thankful for the opportunity brought forward by Motion No. 165 to address the issues of competition, particularly in the gasoline sector.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second part of the member's motion  proposes that the government  bring forward amendments to strengthen the Competition Act, including measures to ensure that the competition commissioner has the power to launch investigations, summon witnesses and ensure confidentiality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The challenge of the motion, of course, is that it is not at all clear what kind of amendments it   is proposing.  While it proposes amendments to strengthen the Competition Act and provide some non-inclusive list of examples, these examples refer to powers   that already rest with the Commissioner of Competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently, as the member for Edmonton—Leduc has identified, if the commissioner has reason to believe that an offence has been committed under the Competition Act or that grounds exist for the making of a remedial order by the Competition Tribunal, she can, subject to some qualifications, “launch investigations, summon witnesses and ensure confidentiality”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the past, some members of the Bloc Québécois   publicly indicated that they wanted to amend the Competition Act so that the Commissioner of Competition would have  the power to conduct inquiries into markets and  examine competition issues even if there was no reason to believe that an offence had been committed. I have some problems with that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study of the gasoline industry, which  has been cited by some Bloc Québécois members, is an example of when such a power would be useful.  Since the introduction of the motion refers to gasoline specifically, the member must realize that the issues they address would apply in a more general nature to the entire market and the potential for the commissioner to launch investigations in all areas of competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first issue raised that must be addressed is that while some competition authorities in other countries, such as the U.S. and the U.K., found that these kinds of general or market inquiries were useful tools that  we should look at that, I really think there needs to be appropriate checks and balances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1980s, for instance,   a gasoline study  was conducted by the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission in Canada.  It gathered over 200 witnesses and the study took five years to complete.  This has enormous cost implications for all of us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also suggest that the example of the gasoline inquiry highlights the need for safeguards that could help ensure that the inquiries are initiated only when there is information suggesting legitimate competition issues that could be addressed by the inquiry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the member opposite has suggested that there is some kind of collusion going on between the Conservatives and the Liberals on this issue, let me say that the member for Edmonton—Leduc and I sat on a committee.  The committee wrote  a report   to which  I would refer the member opposite.  All of us sat around the table and none of us got  together out of some kind of crazed idea  of colluding, but in fact because we had studied this issue and examined the facts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many studies on gasoline prices and all have concluded so far that there is no evidence of price fixing or other types of anti-competitive conduct that would substantially lessen competition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The report that I referred to entitled “Gasoline Prices in Canada” by the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology in November 2003 represents one of the most recent studies.  In our report, the committee indicated that it was satisfied that the Competition Bureau was adequately overseeing competitive aspects of the petroleum industry.  Based on information, as the member opposite has suggested, from the International Energy Agency,  Canada's retail gasoline prices have consistently compared favourably to other major industrialized nations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to a second issue.  I am always concerned about any cost inputs to any aspect of Canadian industry.  I am concerned when gas prices go up and small business operators who have to deal with high input costs have to face these issues, but let us also look at the other side of this.  Sometimes higher gas prices help people look at other options, like public transit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more recent blips in gasoline prices, I read with astonishment, is that young are making absurd claims in the newspaper like, “At this rate it hardly justifies having a car”.</p><A NAME="T1420"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1420"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1425"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1415"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1420)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, maybe people do need to think about the choices they make.  If somehow the change in gasoline prices makes people think twice and makes them wonder about buying an energy efficient car or taking public transit, I would be quite excited about that. I just bought a hybrid and I am happy with my car choice because it is showing by example. I bought the Honda Accord hybrid and of course Honda has a vibrant plant in Ontario.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would also draw the attention of the members opposite to Bill C-19, an act to amend the Competition Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts.  The bill, already before the House, followed extensive national consultations conducted by the Public Policy Forum, an independent non-profit organization that the government hired to look into this issue.  The consultations proved very useful and helped provide a well thought out and balanced package of legislative amendments that addresses the interests of consumers as well as those of small and large businesses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of cooperation could I just seek clarification?  If I sit down, does the member opposite get to make a concluding statement?</p><A NAME="T1425"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1425"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1430"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#T1420"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1425)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1124012"></A><a HREF="#Int-1124029"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1124003"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Just for clarification, if  the member sits down, another member will rise and start to speak, but the member proposing the bill does not propose it until the end of the second hour of debate.</p><A NAME="Int-1124029"></A><a HREF="#Int-1124013"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1124012"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Hon. Paddy Torsney: </b>Then, Mr. Speaker, I would encourage members to look at the changes to the Competition Act that are currently proposed by the Minister of Industry.  These are important changes which will make sure that we have the best possible Competition Act, because it is in industry's favour to make sure that it is being held to the highest standards.  More important, it is in Canadians' and consumers'   favour to make sure we have a Competition Act that serves the interest of consumers in Canada and makes sure they have the safeguards to protect their rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This proposal should be considered by the Standing Committee on Industry, Natural Resources, Science and Technology during the hearings on Bill C-19, but until the research is done and the possible implications are clearly understood I do not think the motion before the House today should be supported.</p>
<p>[<i>Translation</i>]</p><A NAME="Int-1124013"></A><a HREF="#Int-1124042"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a><a HREF="#Int-1124029"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Mr. Robert Bouchard (Chicoutimi—Le Fjord, BQ): </b>Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the motion introduced by my colleague, the member for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik—Eeyou and supported by the member for Hochelaga. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I also live in a resource region, I am in a position to see that we are somewhat affected by gasoline prices. We have no control over and cannot monitor   gas prices. We must rectify this situation, because it has a major effect on the economy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a region like mine, which is hard hit by business closings, it is necessary to foster the emergence of new businesses. However, when we experience petroleum price increases, of course, this is another constraint for the economy as well as for the consumer. The petroleum price increase affects the taxi industry, the trucking industry, indeed, the whole transportation industry, whether in the public or the private sector. It affects municipalities and citizens as a whole.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a member from a resource region, I must often drive long distances, not only in my riding, but also across Quebec, and I am appalled at price variations from one city to another. It is not taxes that cause price variations, since they are stable. There is the GST, the QST, the Quebec gas taxes, which vary, as well as a flat federal tax. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It goes without saying that oil companies are there to make profits. We have seen that they make huge profits. I will only mention Petro-Canada, which, during the first semester of 2003,  had a 564% increase. Of course, other companies also make huge profits. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe my time has expired, Mr. Speaker, so I must say that there has to be price control—</p><A NAME="T1430"></A><p><A HREF="#TOC-TS-1430"><!-- Hour: 2--></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a HREF="#T1425"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a>(1430)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><A NAME="Int-1124042"></A><a HREF="#Int-1124013"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border="0" alt="-"></a><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The Deputy Speaker: </b>Unfortunately, the time provided for the consideration of private members' business has now expired, and the order is dropped to the bottom of the order of precedence on the order paper.  </p>
