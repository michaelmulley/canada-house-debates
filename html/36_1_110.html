convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A foremost victim of land mines, up to three million mines were 
laid in areas of the country, blocking the safe return of 
refugees and displaced persons and further hampering attempts at 
development and reconstruction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Through partnerships with other states, Canadian de-mining 
technology and expertise can help to eliminate the dangers of 
existing land mines in this region.

<P><A NAME="LINK5"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, there 
has been a lot of talk lately about the declining role of 
parliamentarians at the hands of judicial activism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of Rosenberg v Canada, a lesbian challenged the 
constitutionality of the Income Tax Act, since it forced Revenue 
Canada to refuse to register her employer's private pension plan 
if it extended death benefits to same sex partners. In a 
unanimous decision on April 23, the Ontario Court of Appeal 
decided to read a same sex definition of the term spouse into the 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel that the government has an obligation to defend its 
stated position on the definition of spouse and if an appeal 
fails then this issue should be put before parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the former justice minister himself said while defending the 
need for Bill C-33, “we shouldn't rely upon the courts to make 
public policy in matters of this kind.  That's up to legislators, 
and we should have the courage to do it”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This issue comes down to one question:  Is the current justice 
minister going to let the courts decide on the redefinition of 
the term spouse or is parliament?

</I></B></P><P align=left>On May 28, 1918 the Armenian nation threw off the shackles of 
oppression of the Ottoman Empire and re-established itself as an 
independent nation on the world stage.

Bosnia-Hercegovina. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the war which engulfed Bosnia-Hercegovina, most of those 
in Bishop Komarica's diocese were subjected to ethnic cleansing

and peaceful solution to the conflict in Bosnia and a harmonious 
co-existence between all of its peoples. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the threat to his personal safety, the bishop worked 
courageously to intervene and prevent the outbreak and escalation 
of large scale conflicts and oversaw the distribution of 
desperately needed humanitarian aid to all citizens in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I applaud Bishop Komarica for his defence and assistance of all 
victims of war in Bosnia-Hercegovina and I welcome him to Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Eleni Bakopanos (Ahuntsic, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, May 28 is a 
significant date for the Armenian community in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that date, in 1918, the Republic of Armenia was created 
following the tragic events in which more than one million of 
their fellow citizens were killed. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the new republic was annexed by the Soviet Union soon 
after, May 28, 1918 remains an important date for all Armenians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today the Republic of Armenia is once again an independent 
country, having declared its independence on September 23, 1991 
from the former Soviet Union.  Even though the Armenian economy 
has been strained by recent changes and is currently undergoing a 
difficult process of economic restructuring, the future now looks 
brighter for the new republic.

Quebec belongs in the Canadian federation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the Bouchard government, it has instituted a so-called 
non-partisan parliamentary commission on the Calgary declaration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did nine of the thirty persons who were approached decline 
the sovereignists' invitation to take part in this bogus 
commission? This speaks volumes about the non-partisan nature of 
this commission, which Premier Bouchard would have us believe

</I></B></P><P align=left>Children and older people as well as those with respiratory  and 
cardiac problems are the most vulnerable. Recent data show that 
up to 1,800 Ontario residents die every year from air pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Immediate action is required to ensure that Canadians can 
breathe cleaner air. Air pollution is a source of concern for 
all Canadians and should be a priority for all governments.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the results of a survey on grain marketing in 
Saskatchewan was recently made public.  I thought members who 
helped ram Bill C-4 through the House would be interested in the 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty per cent of the respondents thought there should be dual 
marketing for wheat; that is, the Canadian Wheat Board should not 
be the only company the western farmers can sell their wheat and 
barley to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixty-one per cent thought there should be a provision for 
producers to sell a portion of their production outside the 
Canadian Wheat Board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-four per cent thought the wheat board would be effective 
in a dual market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifty-three per cent felt they did not know enough about the 
changes to the wheat board passed in Bill C-4. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think members on the government side will pay more attention

Senior Citizens Week in Quebec, I take this opportunity to 
salute all senior citizens in Laval and Quebec and to thank them 
for their contribution to our society's development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two years ago, the federal government announced a seniors 
benefit program that would provide minimum annual payments of 
$11,420 to a person living alone, and $18,440 for a couple, 
which is clearly below the poverty line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the support of Bloc Quebecois members, seniors groups have 
questioned the formula used to calculate these benefits. They 
have criticized the federal government for jeopardizing the 
financial independence of elderly women and penalizing seniors 
with other sources of income.

Seniors can be assured that we will be vigilant during the 
review of that program.

poverty and in giving back to the state enough financial leeway 
as long as we continue to bleed ourselves dry over this

history of the APWA.  The minister certainly deserves it for the 
work he did as minister responsible for infrastructure when he 
launched the Canada infrastructure works program, a model program 
for intergovernmental co-operation.  He spearheaded the effort to 
rebuild Canada's infrastructure and provided $2 billion in 
federal money.  The program delivered the money where it was 
needed most, at the municipal level.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the important point here is that the albumin being imported into

Canadian authorities and has been found to meet safety standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member as a physician should know that albumin is an 
important product for the health of many Canadians.  Because of 
the shortage of licensed suppliers and at the request of

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said to the House and I say again to the member, if it 
does any good, that because of the shortage of this supply from 
licensed suppliers doctors have asked Health Canada to permit the 
importation from Alpha. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The American authorities have examined the very product being 
imported.  Canadian authorities have examined that product and

responsible in the way he is dealing with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Please, we are dealing with innocent Canadians who need this 
product for their health and safety.  Please, the officials have 
told me expressly that Alpha has an albumin product that has been 
approved for marketing in Canada but does not have a licensed 
importer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This product has been approved for importing into Canada.  It 
has been approved by the Americans.  Surely the member will be

instead of using it for narrow political purposes.

the reason the Alpha product is being permitted into Canada under

are out of product.  Physicians have come to Health Canada and 
said “Please let us use this product”, even though they do not 
have a licensed importer.  We looked at the product and it has 
been approved, as the Americans approved it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is, is it safe?  The authorities have examined it. 
They have applied standards and they have said it should be 
approved.  That is the issue, not whether the product is 
licensed.  Products are not licensed. They are either approved or 
not approved and this product has been approved.

heard the Minister of Finance say that he had created jobs in 
health care and education.  I would like to tell that to all the

and go to the United States to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asking the finance minister to stop taxing jobs by 
keeping EI premiums higher than needed for two years.  Back in my

30 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI fund is not supposed to be used to pad the government's 
books.  Now that the EI surplus is at least $12 billion, will the

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I hate to point this out to the hon. member, but in fact 
when the previous Conservative government took office from the 
Liberals the rate was at $2.  I hate to do this but in 1989 under 
the Tories the rate was $1.95.  In 1990 it went up to $2.25. Then 
it went up to $2.80. Then it went up to $3.  When we took office 
it was going up to $3.30 and we would not let it happen. That is 
why it is at $2.70 today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK63"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
to tell the hon. finance minister that when we were in power we 
had 4,000 people working at the shipyard and now we do not have 
people working at the shipyard.  We just lost Atlantic Sugar a 
week ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the minister that the government's own actuary 
has said that the EI premiums need not be any higher than $2. 
Media reports indicate that government officials are saying that 
the finance minister will have to amend the EI act if he wants to 
keep padding the books at the expense of the Canadian taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that what the minister is planning to do, or will he cut 
those premiums and put more money back in the pockets—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

record, but in fact when the hon. member's party was last in 
power there was a deficit in the unemployment insurance fund of 
$6 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to point out that in the Canadian economy over 
one million jobs were created in the last four years.  In the

adding active measures directly linked to the transitional jobs

</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister confirm that, despite his fine words and his

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

clearly an extremely popular program that has created thousands 
of jobs in Quebec and elsewhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a transitional fund intended to last three years, that is, 
until March 31, 1999.  It is to be expected that funds lasting 
until March 31, 1999 will be committed now, if they are to be 
spent by March 31, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funds are committed, but they have not yet all been spent.

<P><A NAME="LINK74"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources

$300 million in the transitional fund, $95 million or 30% of 
which is for Quebec and has to last until March 31, 1999. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is committed at the moment, because, understandably, if we 
want to spend it by March 31, 1999, we have to make commitments. 
There is nevertheless some manoeuvring room, because the costs 
of projects are sometimes less than forecast.  So there is some 
flexibility, but less so at the end of the program than at its 
start.  This is how responsible management works, generally.

<P><A NAME="LINK78"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the 
Minister of Human Resources Development recognized that his 
government had deliberately made it harder for young people to 
qualify for employment insurance, so that they will stay in 
school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister claims in all seriousness that the government made 
cuts to the employment insurance program for the good of young 
people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the Minister of Human Resources Development is 
this: Is it truly his government's intention, through its 
employment insurance reform, to deny benefits to three out of 
four young people, so as to force them to go back to school? 
<P><A NAME="LINK79"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are also giving an insurance 
premium holiday to any business that will hire young people, in 
an effort to help young Canadians enter the workforce. That too 
is part of the employment insurance reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said yesterday is that we, on this side of the House, 
have ambitions for our young people. We want them to have access 
to the labour market, and we know that this will be achieved 
through greater skills and knowledge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I said yesterday is that, when it is too easy to get EI 
benefits, this becomes an incentive to—

<P><A NAME="LINK80"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the minister 
does not seem to understand that these young people have worked, 
paid premiums and are thus entitled to employment insurance 
benefits, whether he likes it or not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the minister not find it unacceptable that young people who 
decide to enter the job market and who unfortunately lose their 
jobs are forced to go back to school because the minister says 
so? If these young people are not entitled to employment 
insurance benefits, why does the minister make them pay 
premiums? 
<P><A NAME="LINK81"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, if young people are not eligible 
for employment insurance benefits, it is precisely because they 
have not yet entered the labour market. This is obvious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> The fact of the matter is that those 
who have not accumulated the required hours of work do not 
qualify. I think that when— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B> The Minister of Human Resources Development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew:</B> Anyone will agree that an employment 
insurance system that is too readily accessible is an incentive 
for young people to enter the labour market too soon, sometimes 
before they are ready. This is something I have seen personally 
in many regions of Quebec. That is why we have greater ambitions 
for young Quebeckers.

asked the finance minister to cut EI premiums on October 7, 
October 31, November 7, November 28 and December 1. The minister 
has refused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>High payroll taxes kill jobs.  Will May 27, 1998 go down as 
another day that this minister refuses to give Canadians the tax 
breaks and the jobs they need? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is trying to build a war chest on the backs of 
unemployed Canadians. Does the minister honestly believe that 
significant payroll tax reductions would not lead to job growth 
in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK105"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, if that is the position of the member's party, why was 
that not the position it took when it was in government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have reduced payroll taxes $4.2 billion more per year than 
when that government was in power. We will continue in this vein 
because reducing personal income taxes, reducing payroll taxes 
and investing in health care and education are the priorities of 
the government. 
<P><A NAME="LINK106"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, listen 
to this quotation: “Whatever may be the situation in the past, 
we are now confronted in this country by very serious problems 
and the government should address these problems.  They should 
not seek refuge in history”.  That was from Paul Martin Sr. in 
1956 in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a news flash for the minister.  Ten cent cuts are not 
good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Halifax in March the minister said that significant payroll 
tax reductions would not lead to job growth.  Yet in his budget 
he reduced payroll taxes for youth significantly. Why is it good 
enough for young people but not good enough for all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If payroll taxes will not lead to job growth, why did he give—

<P><A NAME="LINK107"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I can certainly understand why the hon. member would not 
want to discuss his party's history.  A $42 billion deficit is 
now down to zero.  Unemployment of 11.5% is now down to 8.4%. 
Consumer confidence is up.  Retail confidence is up.  Business 
investment is surging.  That is today.  It was not the case six 
years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Godin (Acadie—Bathurst, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, the employment 
insurance program belongs to the workers of this country. The

money stolen from the workers?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at

fund has been consolidated with the government's financial 
statements since 1986.

question is for the Prime Minister.  Yesterday the environment 
commissioner's report on the government's mishandling of the 
environment clearly stated that if the performance of the 
government does not improve, the environment and the health of 
Canadians will be damaged.  It is a sad situation when there are 
more than six traffic officers to patrol Parliament Hill looking 
for parking violations while this government has only one 
environmental assessment officer for the province of New

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ORDER PAPER QUESTIONS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK125"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta—South Richmond, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today on a question of privilege.  I have given 
the Chair a copy of the grievance that I bring to the attention 
of the House and I have also contacted the office of the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government to 
indicate to him that I wanted to rise today on a question of 
privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the past, in your wisdom, you have offered guidance on 
similar matters and I would hope for the same today.  Needless to 
say, if you determine that I do have a question of privilege I am 
willing to move the necessary motion to bring this matter to the 
appropriate parliamentary committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a long and honourable custom in the House that members of 
parliament are to provide other members factual information and 
only the truth.  It is part of the law of privilege that a member 
of this House in the performance of his or her duties can expect 
the truth from ministers of the crown, even if the truth should 
be that ministers cannot or will not answer the question raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Either we as members of parliament on all sides are entitled to 
rest secure in the knowledge that we are going to receive the 
truth in ministerial replies or we are not.  Parliament is 
dependent upon ministers providing truthful information so that 
they and the government as a whole can be held accountable.  This 
doctrine is the hub around which much of our parliamentary life 
revolves and lies behind our existing practices of parliamentary 
disclosure of official information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In essence, it means that ministers have to provide truthful 
information about the exercise of their responsibilities in order 
that an account can be rendered in parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years different mechanisms have been developed for the 
disclosure of information, parliamentary Order Paper questions 
being a prime example of the mechanism for eliciting factual 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A failure to provide to the House truthful information is 
considered a grave offence.  After a careful review of various 
precedents, in 1978 Speaker Jerome summarized in the form of a 
question what I think is still the convention of this House.  I 
quote:

<A HREF="#LINKT13"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that lead to the conclusion that, by virtue of an act or 
omission, the House or a member has directly or indirectly been 
impeded in the performance of its functions or his duty, or that 
there has been a tendency to produce such a result?  If I find 
so, then I really have no choice but to find, prima facie, that a 
contempt has been committed. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Conventions governing responses to written parliamentary 
questions have been established to govern the disclosure of 
information by government to parliament.  Such conventions have 
recognized that a balance must be struck between the legitimate 
requirements of government to have a certain degree of privacy 
for the proper conduct of its business and the need to ensure 
that parliament has the factual information which it requires to 
scrutinize the executive and hold ministers to account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is right for members and for the Chair to ask themselves if 
sanctioning the tabling of obviously false information to 
parliamentary questions strengthens or weakens our parliamentary 
institutions.  A parliamentary democracy cannot function unless 
parliamentarians are permitted to know what their government is 
up to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An approach to written parliamentary questions that does not 
respect the fundamental feature of our system will undermine 
rather than strengthen Canadian parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where does it leave us if we disregard the fundamental 
principles of ministerial responsibility? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I am sure you will remind honourable members that 
to assume that any member of the House ever states anything but 
the truth would be in itself a breach of the standing orders of 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to bring to your attention, Mr. Speaker, the fact that I 
placed Question No. 33 on the Order Paper last October.  The 
answers given by the government to Question No. 33 appear to be, 
in whole or in part, simply false.  I am concerned that the 
government's response hinders and obstructs the work of 
parliament and its members and has the effect of diminishing 
respect for this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question inquired into what involvement ministers of the 
crown had in an issue that arose in 1995.  Sport fishing lodges 
in July and August 1995 refused to comply with the requirements 
of the Fisheries Act.  The act required lodges to provide 
accurate and timely catch data to the department of fisheries so 
it could manage the chinook fishery on an almost daily basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, 1995 was a year much like 1998.  In 1995 chinook 
were expected to return to spawn in dangerously low numbers.  In 
1998 it is coho. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government states in its response to parts (a), (b), (d) and 
(f) of Question No. 33 that no minister of the crown or their 
staff other than the fisheries minister and his staff were 
involved.  Departmental documents suggest otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The department of fisheries has provided me, under the Access to 
Information Act, documents that go to the credibility and 
veracity of the claim that ministers of the crown and their staff 
were not involved.  The documents refer to ministerial 
involvement.  The documents have fisheries managers complaining 
of political pressure.  The documents reveal a meeting or 
meetings between a minister of the crown from Victoria and his 
political staff and the lodge owners.  The documents detail a 
possible threat from the Minister of Industry to go to the Prime 
Minister to have fisheries officers stand back while the Oak Bay 
Marine Group flouted the law and let conservation be damned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you have been very patient with me and I will 
quickly cite specifics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A July 21, 1995 briefing note prepared for and given to the 
minister, the member for Victoria, states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Meeting with David Anderson's office, the Sport Fishing Institute 
and representatives from Queen Charlotte Island lodge operators 
regarding management ventures implemented in Areas 1 and 2. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another note, dated July 25, reads: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The attached briefing note was used to brief Randy Pettipas of 
Minister Anderson's office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This indicates that responses to (a), (b) and (f) are in whole 
or in part false. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another document reveals the fisheries minister's office 
demanding ammunition to fend off the Minister of Industry who was 
threatening to go to the Prime Minister.  It reads:

and unjustified.  Manley's office and Buchanan are suggesting 
that they might take this issue directly to the Prime Minister.

fisheries concluded his demand to the regional director general 
for the Pacific region with: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like this information by the end of this afternoon. 
Please contact me as soon as possible to let me know what we 
might expect. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, in reply to Question No. 33(d), the government told the 
House that no ministers or their staff participated in the 
Pacific salmon management teleconference calls once the sport 
fishing lodges refused to supply vital catch data in July and 
August. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part (d) asked if ministers of the crown or their staff 
participated in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Pacific 
salmon management teleconference calls in 1995 which considered 
the refusal of the lodges, including the Oak Bay Marine Group, to 
provide such data. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Departmental documents made available by the department of 
fisheries under the Access to Information Act indicate that the 
current minister of fisheries, then in another portfolio and a 
minister of the crown, did through his political staff 
participate in these management conference calls at a time when 
the lodges were refusing to provide the department of fisheries 
with the necessary catch data such that the department could 
manage the fishery to protect fragile chinook stocks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I quote from a document entitled “Speaking Points for the 
Deputy Minister”: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>On August 15, [1995] the bi-weekly salmon management conference 
call between departmental officials was extended to include 
participation from—Minister Tobin's office and Mark Cameron, 
Minister Anderson's office. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again, the response given to the House to part (d) of Question 
No. 33 is incorrect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current minister of fisheries, then and now the lead 
minister from British Columbia, and a spokesman in cabinet for 
the Sport Fishing Institute, a lobby organization of lodge 
owners, and for Bob Wright, the largest lodge operator on the 
west coast, did through a member of his political staff 
participate in these management discussions once the lodges had 
refused to obey the requirements of the Fisheries Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in a question of privilege on the accuracy of 
responses to written questions by a previous minister of 
fisheries, Mr. Tobin, on December 13, 1994 you stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not in any way minimize the seriousness of this question of 
privilege raised—He surely has a grievance which perhaps can be 
corrected without proceeding to a complete point of privilege.  I 
hope the hon. member for Delta and perhaps the member for 
Kingston and the Islands and the hon. Minister of Fisheries and 
Oceans might come together to resolve this particular grievance. 
I want the House to understand that I do take this very seriously 
when a member feels that he or she is in any way impeded from 
performing his or her duties as members of Parliament.  I would 
give this assurance that I will return to the member from Delta 
if indeed he does not get a response to his grievance in 
discussions with the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands and 
the hon. Minister of Fisheries and Oceans. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am concerned that such obviously false 
responses should be allowed to stand on the parliamentary record. 
<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Don Boudria (Leader of the Government in the House of

differences in what they believe to be accurate or otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The information I have as Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons is that the information provided by my hon. colleague, 
the minister of fisheries, is in fact accurate.  If the member

he wants to write to us to seek further clarification, there is 
certainly nothing that stops him from doing so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, there is no intention either on the part of the hon.

provide information that is anything other than correct.  We 
still believe that the information that was tabled in the House

realize that on certain questions of privilege or on certain 
points of information there is always a chance we could debate 
such issues as the efficacy of some policy or whatever, but this 
question of privilege does not deal with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question of privilege brought forth by the hon. member deals 
specifically with the contradiction between an answer to a 
question on the order paper and information gathered through 
access to information channels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When you review this question of privilege, Mr. Speaker, I 
believe you will see that one is in complete contradiction to the 
other.  It is not a matter of debate of policy or a debate on the 
issues.  That would be just a political argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue there is enough question, based on the evidence 
when you look at it, that you would allow the hon. member to put 
the appropriate question, which is to refer it to a committee to 
have it properly examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the government member says that we can write to him. 
Of course that is what the question on the order paper was 
already about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is enough question now as to the answer and the veracity 
of the answer that I would hope a committee of parliament could 
examine it to see what is at the bottom of these two obviously 
conflicting arguments.  One is from access to information and the 
other is from the answer to the question on the order paper.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an hon. member saying he put a question in and he 
received an answer.  The answer he received does not coincide 
with the facts that he believes he has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the hon. government House leader standing up and saying 
that to the best knowledge of whoever prepared this and to his

rulings, the first on February 28, 1983 at pages 23278-9 of the 
<I>Debates</I>; the second on February 21, 1990 at page 8618; the

that in none of these cases was the matter found to be prima

of issue to raise.  The hon. member is not satisfied with the 
response given.  The difficulty that is always with the Chair in 
these cases is that there are often very great differences of 
interpretation on answers given.  It is not a question of 
privilege.  It is a question of disagreement over certain facts 
and answers that were given. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member will know that I did listen to his arguments.  I 
listened to the opposition whip and I listened to the government 
House leader.  In my view this is surely a dispute over the facts 
but it is not a question of privilege.

that our police officers and firefighters are required to place

wishes to support in a tangible way the surviving families in

<P><A NAME="LINK177"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lucienne Robillard (for the Minister of Finance)</B> 
moved that Bill C-36, an act to implement certain provisions of 
the budget tabled in parliament on February 24, 1998, be read the 
third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK178"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Bill C-36 is a comprehensive 
bill incorporating a diverse number of measures that relate to 
the 1997 and 1998 budgets.  Each however is important to building 
a strong economy and a secure society, two goals our government 
has pursued since coming to office in 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the government believes there is no better 
investment in the future than investments in education, knowledge 
and innovation.  The establishment of the Canada millennium 
scholarship foundation in Bill C-36 is proof of this commitment. 
This is the single largest investment ever made by a federal 
government to support access to post-secondary education for all 
Canadians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elements of the Canadian opportunities strategy, which is 
designed to provide Canadians with greater access to the 
knowledge and skills needed for jobs and opportunities in the 
21st century, are included in this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government also believes that equality of opportunity means 
a good start in life.  This is why the national child benefit 
system, which was developed to provide better support for low 
income families with children, is also part of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures in Bill C-36 include changes to old age security, 
increased excise taxes on tobacco products, air transportation 
tax reductions, tax arrangements with aboriginal governments, and 
measures dealing with Canada's international obligations and the 
Hibernia oil project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since debate has already taken place at second reading and in 
committee, I will limit my remarks to a brief overview of this 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with the Canadian opportunities strategy. The aim 
of the strategy is to help ensure that all Canadians, especially 
those with low and middle incomes, have equal opportunity to 
participate in the changing labour market.  This means reducing 
the financial barriers and other obstacles to acquiring skills 
and knowledge. I will take a moment to talk about some of the 
specific measures of the Canadian opportunities strategy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 establishes the Canada millennium scholarship 
foundation which will provide scholarships to students in 
financial need and who demonstrate merit.  The scholarships will 
improve access to post-secondary education for low and middle 
income students.  The foundation will operate at arm's length 
from government and, in consultation with provincial governments 
and the post-secondary education community, will decide how the 
scholarships are designed and delivered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's initial endowment of $2.5 billion will provide 
more than 100,000 scholarships annually for 10 years to both full 
and part time students, beginning in the year 2000.  Full time 
students will be eligible for an average of $3,000 a year with 
individuals potentially receiving up to $15,000 over four years. 
This could reduce student debt load by over half. On a related 
issue, Bill C-36 amends the Canada Student Financial Assistance 
Act, the Canada Student Loans Act and the Bankruptcy and 
Insolvency Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Agreement was reached last December at the first ministers 
meeting that the 1998 budget had to include measures to reduce 
the financial burden on students.  The 1998 budget followed up on 
this commitment and several of those measures are contained in 
Bill C-36. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, interest relief will be extended to more graduates. 
Second, the repayment period will be extended for those who need 
it. Third, for borrowers who remain in financial difficulty, 
there will be an extended interest relief period.  Fourth, for 
individuals still in financial difficulty after these relief 
measures, the loan principal will be reduced. These measures 
together will help up to 100,000 additional borrowers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 also legislates the Canada education savings grant, 
another important component of the Canadian opportunities 
strategy.  This grant will make registered education savings 
plans one of the most attractive savings vehicles for parents to 
save for their children's education.  It will provide for a 20% 
grant on the first $2,000 in annual RESP contributions made after 
1997.  It will provide that grant for children up to the age of 
17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 addresses the problem of youth unemployment by giving 
an EI premium holiday to employers who hire additional young 
Canadians between the ages of 18 and 24 in the years 1999 and 
2000.  This measure will increase youth employment opportunities 
and reduce payroll costs for employers by about $100 million a 
year in 1999 and 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 also deals with a new Canada child tax benefit.  Hon. 
members will recall the government's commitment to the national 
child benefit system which was announced in the 1997 budget. 
Under the new system, the federal government provides an enriched 
Canada child tax benefit while the provinces and territories 
redirect some money into better services and benefits for low 
income families, especially the working poor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government proposed a two step process in the 1997 budget 
whereby the current $5.1 billion child tax benefit would be 
enriched by $850 million to create a new Canada child tax benefit 
by July of this year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Beginning last July the working income supplement was increased 
by $195 million.  Working income supplement benefits are now 
provided per child instead of per family.  This coming July over 
1.4 million Canadian families with 2.5 million children will see 
an increase in their child benefits. Families earning up to about 
$21,000 will receive Canada child tax benefits of $1,625 for the 
first child and $1,425 for each additional child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once discussions have taken place with the provinces, 
territories and Canadians, the Canada child tax benefit will be 
enriched by an additional $850 million, a commitment made in the 
1998 budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to turn now to some changes in this legislation 
which relate to seniors.  The government remains committed to 
providing a secure retirement income for its senior citizens. 
Starting in 1999 the payment year for both the guaranteed income 
supplement and the spouse's allowance will move to July from 
April.  This will give GIS recipients three additional months to 
file their income statements with the government and reduce the 
possibility of underpayments. The payment period for war veterans 
allowance will also change from July in one year to June of the 
next.  These changes will improve services to low income seniors, 
eliminate government duplication and increase fairness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another component of Bill C-36 addresses the issue of First 
Nations taxation.  The Kamloops Indian band will now have the 
authority to levy a 7% value added tax on all fuel, alcoholic 
beverages and tobacco products sold on its reserves.  The 
Westbank First Nation will be able to impose a similar 7% tax on 
all alcoholic beverage sales on its reserves. It already has the 
authority to tax tobacco products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, with the approval of the governor in council, the 
Minister of Finance or the Minister of National Revenue will be 
able to enter into tax administration agreements with aboriginal 
governments that want to tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to mention the two amendments to the Excise Tax Act 
contained in this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First Bill C-36 increases federal excise taxes on tobacco 
products which will add an extra $70 million annually to federal 
revenues and will help to discourage Canadians, particularly 
youth, from smoking. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment reduces the air transportation tax and 
clarifies the rules relating to the elimination of the tax later 
this year.  This measure is part of the government's program to 
commercialize air navigation services in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the international front, the recent Asian crisis reinforced 
how crucial it is that the International Monetary Fund be able to 
support a stable international financial system.  It also 
reinforced the importance of our government having the ability to 
participate in internationally co-ordinated efforts to resolve 
short term liquidity crises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result this legislation amends the Bretton Woods act to 
ensure adequate resources for the IMF to fulfil its mandate of 
preserving monetary stability.  The amendments also give the 
government additional means to participate in co-operative 
financing arrangements with other countries to supplement IMF led 
assistance packages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time consultations between the Minister of Foreign 
Affairs and the Minister of Finance will be mandatory prior to 
Canada providing any financial assistance to institutions covered 
under the International Development Assistance Act. Consultation 
with the Minister of Finance will improve control over the growth 
of contingent liabilities associated with Canada's participation 
in these institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Action taken through international institutions is critical if 
we are to benefit from a stable global financial system. That is 
why in addition to the action we can take at home, such as that 
found in Bill C-36, our government is working in concert with 
other governments around the world to address economic stability 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sparked by lessons from the financial crisis in Asia, the 
Minister of Finance has proposed that a global banking 
supervisory body be set up to monitor the stability of financial 
institutions around the world.  This idea has received 
considerable interest and support with the latest endorsement 
coming from last weekend's meeting of the APEC finance ministers 
in Kananaskis, Alberta. 
Turning to other aspects found within Bill C-36, there are 
provisions to allow the Canada Development Investment Corporation 
to sell the government 8.5% interest in the Hibernia oil project 
when market conditions are favourable.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the bill provides the authority to wind up CDIC 
following the sale of its remaining principal asset, the Canadian 
Hibernia Holding Corporation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are highlights of Bill C-36.  As I stated at the 
beginning, each is key to help build a strong economy and a 
secure society, goals the government has pursued since 1993. 
These are goals the government will continue to pursue as we 
complete this mandate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many Canadians are waiting to benefit from these measures.  I 
urge my hon. colleagues to pass the legislation without delay. 
<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
begin by seeking unanimous consent to split my time with 
the member for Calgary Southeast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Monte Solberg:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that. Now 
that my colleagues across the way have agreed to that I am afraid 
I am going to have to be less than charitable about why we need 
to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-36 is about a number of things.  It is the budget 
implementation act.  It is about things like the millennium fund 
and all kinds of measures the government discussed in the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first issue I want to talk about is that the government has 
moved closure on this bill.  Therefore my colleagues and I are 
forced to split our time so that we can speak at least twice on 
the third reading of Bill C-36. Otherwise we simply would not 
have the chance to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When these government members were in opposition they routinely 
chided the Conservative government of the day for the times it 
moved closure.  But now the Liberal government has actually 
exceeded the former Mulroney government in the number of times it 
has moved closure.   I think it is 41 times since it came to 
power just over four years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. House leader for the government said when he was in 
opposition “I am shocked.  This is just terrible.  This time we 
are talking about a major piece of legislation.  Shame on those 
Tories across the way”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member from Kingston said “What we have here is an absolute 
scandal in terms of the government's unwillingness to listen to 
the representatives of the people in the House.  Never before 
have we had a government so reluctant to engage in public 
discussion on the bills brought before the House”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We throw that back at the government and say when in opposition 
this was completely unacceptable. As members pointed out, on 
major pieces of legislation there should never be closure.  We 
should be allowed to debate these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are now talking about the budget.  We believe that citizens, 
through their representatives, should have the ability to call 
the government to account for some of the things it has decided. 
We are talking about decisions to spend hundreds of billions of 
dollars.  To move closure so that we have a scant two hours to 
debate the budget implementation act at third reading is 
unbelievable and completely anti-democratic.  The government 
should be ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to talk about the millennium fund, I am afraid I have 
to go back in history a few years.  When the government was 
running to be the government in the 1993 election, the current 
Prime Minister, then the leader of the Liberal Party, said in the 
leaders debate that he would not cut transfers to the provinces 
for health care and higher education. 
He told the leader of the Reform Party that if it were up to him 
he would raise the transfers to the provinces. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>History shows that not only did the government not raise 
transfers to the provinces, it cut them by $7.5 billion, a 40% 
cut for health care and higher education.  The impact of that was 
devastating.  We saw people in the provinces rebel. The were 
extraordinarily upset.  We saw people picketing and marching on 
provincial legislatures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the people were misguided.  They should have been on the 
lawn of Parliament Hill because when the provinces are faced with 
cuts of $7.5 billion they have no choice but to make cuts 
themselves in health care and higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the government blatantly broke a major election 
promise and now it has chosen to introduce the millennium 
scholarship fund in the vain attempt to convince people across 
the country that it somehow cares about higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians start to look at the details of the millennium 
scholarship fund they will be extraordinarily disappointed.  They 
will find it helps precisely 7% of all students today trying to 
upgrade their skills so they can get a job in the modern 
workforce.  But the government has carried on as though this is 
going to help everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could have helped everybody if it allowed the provinces to 
keep these transfers and the provinces could have given them to 
everybody in the form of lower tuition costs, and that truly 
would have helped everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now we have the government saying it is going to help 7% of the 
students who return to school.  Granted, a lot of those students 
are part time but nevertheless they need skills upgrading to get 
a better job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's argument is that this will help 100,000 people 
through scholarships to individuals.  That is only 25% of the 
full time students, leaving 75% to be completely excluded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This huge memorial fund to the Prime Minister is really going to 
help very few of the people who should be helped and could have 
been helped had the government allowed the money to stay in the 
pockets of the provinces and be used to reduce overall tuition 
costs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party and colleagues in the Conservative Party, the 
Bloc and the NDP brought forward a number of serious proposals to 
hold the government accountable on how the millennium scholarship 
fund would be used.  Unfortunately when we brought these forward 
at report stage the government moved closure, cut off debate and 
these very serious helpful proposals never had a chance to be 
discussed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately again the democratic will of parliament was 
thwarted.  I believe the democratic rights of Canadians to have 
these things discussed by their representatives were thwarted. 
We are in situation now where the government will completely 
ignore all the suggestions that came forward from the various 
opposition parties via the witnesses who will be most affected by 
changes brought about by the millennium scholarship fund.  They 
will never find their way into legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The moves to hold the fund more accountable will not be 
discussed.  They will not be looked at by the government.  The 
suggestion that the auditor general be the auditor in charge of 
the fund may not ever be accepted by the government.  The 
suggestion that the millennium fund be subject to access to 
information will be completely ignored by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens when a government moves closure on an 
important piece of legislation like a budget.  It is absolutely 
ridiculous and it is an affront to people who believe in the idea 
of democracy. We are extraordinarily disappointed in how the 
government has dealt with this whole issue. 
But it even goes beyond that.  Not only did the provinces take 
the heat when the government cut transfers back in 1995, all the 
heat for what the federal government had done, now the government 
is going to end up letting down all Canadians once again.  I 
would argue it is going to let down many of the very students it 
proposes to help.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What students are going to find out when they graduate from 
universities, after having taken advantage of the millennium 
scholarship fund, is that many of the jobs they have been trained 
for simply do not exist in Canada, which is why we have a massive 
problem with brain drain today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues in the Reform Party have spoken on this issue many 
times in the past.  I know my colleague from Calgary Southeast 
has talked on this before.  Many of their own family members have 
had to go across the border to the United States most often, also 
around the world, to apply the skills they have received because 
of the generosity of taxpayers in this country.  These students 
take this subsidized education and go across the border.  One of 
the best examples is the university class at the University of 
Western Ontario where I think it was one-third of the entire 
graduating class in computer sciences was scooped up by 
Microsoft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian taxpayers via the millennium scholarship fund end up 
subsidizing the richest man in the world, Bill Gates, because he 
is the one who benefits by all these people who earn their 
education at taxpayer expense.  How much sense does that make? 
What point is there in putting together a millennium scholarship 
fund if we are only going to graduate students to send them south 
of the border and never have the ability to take advantage of all 
those skills within Canada and all the benefits that would bring 
to the economy? What is the point of that?  I do not think it 
makes any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has failed utterly and completely to deal with 
the demand side of the equation.  It is taking faulty steps in 
dealing with the supply side by providing these funds, but it has 
done absolutely nothing on the demand side.  These highly skilled 
people, doctors, lawyers, computer scientists, nurses, engineers, 
technicians, our brightest and best, are being driven out of this 
country by an economic regime and a tax regime that is simply too 
difficult to live with. Why would they try? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I received an E-mail from a young man, 23 years old.  He has a 
wife and child.  He at the age of 19 went to the United States to 
apply his tremendous skills as a computer technician at various 
companies.  He worked in silicone valley in California, got tired 
of that and wanted to come home.  He ended up taking a job for 
less money than he was making in the U.S.  He was making $75,000 
U.S. in silicone valley. He came to Toronto to accept a position 
for $65,000 Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He sent me the E-mail when he received his first paycheque and 
had a look at the government tax bite.  That is the problem this 
government has consistently failed to address.  Now this young 
man with his tremendous skills is considering whether he really 
does have a future in Canada after all.  He is considering taking 
his family and his tremendous skills and all the benefits that 
will reap for the economy and moving back to the United States. 
I think that is a terrible indictment of this government and this 
government's failure to deal with the huge economic problems that 
people in this country have to face every day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That young man is extraordinarily lucky.  He has these abilities 
and these skills and he has I gather a tremendous natural talent. 
He is able to parlay that into all kinds of job offers.  But not 
everybody has that.  So we have a different set of problems for 
people who do not have those skills and do not have those 
abilities, who have not had the chance perhaps to get an 
education.  Those people are in a situation that is far worse 
than my friend the computer programmer.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They are in a situation where they are competing with hundreds 
of thousands of other people who do not have very many skills for 
jobs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an unemployment rate of 8.4%.  Today in question period 
I heard the finance minister boasting about the 8.4% unemployment 
rate.  I would not boast if I were him because we simply need to 
look across the border to the United States to see that it has an 
unemployment rate about half what ours is, 4.3%. Here we are, 
economies that share a tremendous amount of trade, very similar 
economies, except its economy is far more efficient than ours. 
Its puts hundreds of thousands of people to work whereas hundreds 
of thousands of our people have to sit on unemployment insurance 
and welfare.  That is a human tragedy of tremendous scope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a budget is brought down, one of the first things to be 
done should be to address issues like unemployment and high taxes 
that cause unemployment.  I know what my friends opposite will 
say.  They will say they did bring in tax relief.  They will 
point to the cuts they made to the surtaxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they fail to point out is that according to their own 
budget papers, the cut in income taxes through the reduction of 
surtaxes in this budget year will be more than erased by the 
phenomenon of bracket creep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right away taxpayers are still worse off this year.  In other 
words, taxes are still going up this year compared to last year. 
That does not even take into account the whole issue of Canada 
pension plan premiums which are marching inexorably upwards 73% 
over the next six years, the largest tax hike in Canadian 
history.  Where does that leave workers?  It leaves them looking 
for jobs on the unemployment line.  That simply is not 
acceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I turn now to the issue raised today not only by members of the 
opposition but by the premier of Ontario and by Statistics 
Canada, the EI surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I point out to my friends opposite that the employment insurance 
fund is there to ensure that in the event of a downturn there are 
adequate funds set aside so that the fund can provide benefits to 
unemployed workers.  That fund is now at about $15 billion, way 
more than is necessary to take workers through even the toughest 
recession.  In the next several months that fund will continue to 
grow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not actually have that money sitting in an 
account.  It has essentially spent it, so there is an IOU. In 
other words, if there is a downturn in the economy they will have 
to borrow $15 billion.  We should be very clear about that.  This 
is another example of the government's so-called prudence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is now using the overage, the extra premiums, 
coming in not for unemployment insurance, not for benefits, not 
to give back to the workers who are supplying it, including the 
small business people, the very people who create jobs.  It is 
keeping it.  What will it do with it?  It is putting it away to 
use it for its election slush fund down the road.  I think that 
is completely unacceptable. That is a breach of the deal that was 
made implicitly between governments and workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The deal was that money should be returned to them in the form 
of lower premiums so that they can keep it in their pockets, so 
they can use that money for the things they want to use it for, 
things like providing for their education, providing for their 
retirement.  Unfortunately the government thinks it knows better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in a situation today where the finance minister could not 
bring himself to say that we are going to start to reduce payroll 
premiums in a serious way so that workers are not so heavily 
burdened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also point out the impact that high payroll taxes have on 
business. 
The Canadian Federation of Independent Business points out 
regularly that payroll premiums are a job killer.  It points to 
the government's finance department economists who say that 
payroll taxes like EI premiums are a job killer.  Joe Italiano is 
one of the people I will point to.  We qutote him in our document 
which we have made widely available to the public.  My friends 
across the way laugh when I say that but it is a fact. When we 
have 8.4% unemployment we should have the government taking steps 
to deal with those sorts of issues.

Speaker, I thank my hon. colleagues for allowing me to split the 
time with my colleague for Medicine Hat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by condemning this government for allowing itself to 
trample on democracy and democratic deliberation by invoking 
closure and time allocation on Bill C-36.  This evening we will 
be gathered in this place to vote on a bill that is not just any 
normal bill.  It is not some kind of housekeeping amendment.  It 
is not some kind of technical legislation.  This is legislation 
that authorizes the expenditure of billions and billions of 
dollars earned not by the government, not by the members 
opposite, but by Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are authorizing the government in this bill this evening to 
use the coercive power of the state to take away the fruits of 
those people's labours.  If there is one founding principle of 
liberal democracy, it is the principle of no taxation without 
representation.  That is what they said when the entire concept 
of liberal democracy came about in the late 18th century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But this government has a different idea of what liberal 
democracy is.  Now that it is Liberal democracy, they think 
democracy means the government will authorize, without adequate 
debate, without proper procedure of deliberation in parliament, 
the taking and spending of billions and billions of dollars from 
taxpayers who now come home with less than they did 15 years ago 
because of the tax burden imposed by this and previous 
governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not take my word for it or our word for it when we inveigh 
against the undemocratic invocation of closure 41 times since 
this government took power.  I ask my colleagues opposite to 
reference what their caucus colleague said when they were in 
opposition.  They were principled when they were in opposition. 
They spoke out against the invocation of closure and time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague quoted from certain statements made by the 
current government House leader when he was in opposition and by 
the hon. member for Kingston and the Islands. The member for 
Kingston and the Islands said in debate in this place on February 
19, 1993: “I suggest that the government's approach to 
legislating through closure is frankly a disgrace.  It cuts back 
the time that the House is available to sit and then it applies 
closure to cut off the debate”.  He called it a disgrace.  He 
was right then and we are right now by using the same word.  He 
also said on April 23, 1993: “This is not the way to run a 
parliament.  This is an abuse of the process of the House”. That 
was a Liberal then, a Liberal today.

people.

to hold the government more accountable and to make the operation 
of government more efficient.  Only one member of each party had 
an opportunity to speak on dozens of amendments.  They were not 
allowed to address each amendment but just groupings of those 
amendments.  That is not the democratic process properly 
conceived or executed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not only is the government invoking closure undemocratically, it 
is invoking closure on a bill which gets a failing grade from the 
auditor general of this parliament.  I am not talking about a 
member of the opposition or about some columnist or critic.  I am 
talking about the man charged by all members and all parties of 
this place to monitor the books of the government to ensure they 
comply with generally accepted public sector accounting 
principles.  The auditor general, a man of integrity, has said 
the section of Bill C-36 authorizing the creation of the 
millennium scholarship fund does not comply with but rather 
contravenes the most basic principles of public accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some will say who cares about how you account for the numbers, 
which year you put it in, where it appears in the public 
accounts.  Some people will say it is a technical argument, that 
the opposition does not have anything else to talk about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very important principle here.  Parliament 
is an institution which goes back hundreds of years in history 
and essentially is an institution which was created as part of an 
effort by the commoners to have a real check and balance on the 
executive power, the power of the crown, to expend public funds 
without public scrutiny.  Our job is to ensure that the bills we 
authorize are conducted with proper accounting principles, with 
full transparency so the public can see and know how its money 
is being spent with confidence.  The auditor general has said 
we cannot have confidence in how Bill C-36 and the budget of 
this year construe the millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said: “I believe believe that the accounting change for the 
millennium scholarship fund will open the door for governments to 
influence reported results by simply announcing intentions in 
their budgets and then deciding what to include in the deficit or 
surplus after the end of the year once preliminary numbers are 
known”.  What he was saying was that by authorizing the 
expenditure now and booking it in the current fiscal year 1998-99 
but not expending it until the fiscal year 2000, we are playing a 
shell game with the public finances.  That too is a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without even getting to the substance of the bill, which is bad 
enough, the government is closing down debate to rush through a 
bill the auditor general will not permit.  I dare say that if the 
previous government, the Mulroney government, had made a similar 
effort the Liberal Party and all Canadians would have risen up in 
contempt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague from Medicine Hat discussed at some length the 
provisions of the bill as they relate to payroll taxes, so I will 
not reiterate his eloquent remarks.  However, let me focus on 
another part of this bill and the budget which it implements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt projected for the current fiscal year by this 
enormously fiscally responsible government is $583.2 billion. The 
finance minister talks a great deal about how we are going into 
debt reduction. However, when I look at the budget I see that in 
the next fiscal year, 1999-2000, the debt is $583.2 billion. 
Then I look in his budget at fiscal year 2000 and guess what?  He 
has brought the debt all the way down to $583.2 billion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is amazing that this man of fiscal rectitude, this champion 
of debt reduction has scheduled in the fourth fiscal year through 
his projections that the debt will come plummeting down to $583.2 
billion.  What does that mean?  It means we will continue to 
spend $45 billion a year in debt interest costs, money that comes 
from taxpayers that does not finance one single worthy social 
program or contribute to education, training or infrastructure 
investment. The $45 billion which this budget and this bill 
authorize for the current fiscal year does the following. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I believe you will find consent for the following 
motion: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That for the remainder of this session motions pursuant to 
Standing Orders 57 and 78(3) shall not be receivable by the 
Chair. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent to present the motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  There is not consent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Madam Speaker, I am delighted now that 
we have made a motion that at least one Liberal has decided to 
appear and to listen to the rest of the debate on the budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted by the 
absence of members opposite, those debt interest costs will be 
$45 billion in tax dollars for this year, next year, the year 
after, and the year after that.  That amounts to two full years 
of CPP benefits for every pension beneficiary in the country. 
Just the interest this year amounts to two and half years of GST 
revenues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seventy-one per cent of all personal income tax revenues paid 
this year will go just to finance the interest on the debt.  All 
that we spend in benefits for old age security, the Canada health 
and social transfer for education and health care and employment 
insurance, the three big social programs administered by the 
federal government, are the amount equivalent to what we will 
spend on debt interest because of this budget and this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debt interest costs are equivalent to the entire annual 
budgets of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. 
The debt interest this year alone is equivalent to the entire net 
debts of all provinces, except for the three largest provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The $45 billion interest bill is enough to pay for all Canadian 
hospitals, all physician charges and all drug and pharmaceutical 
costs for an entire year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is how much this government has chosen to spend on debt 
interest because it has not made the right and difficult choice 
to reduce the debt and to prioritize spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we spend on debt interest through this budget would be 
enough to cut taxes on an average of $3,200 a year per taxpayer, 
not per household.  It is closer to $6,000 a year per household. 
It is enough to provide for a $30,000 a year endowment for every 
poor child in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals talk about their millennium prime ministerial 
endowment fund, heritage fund, or I do not know what spin name 
they have given it.  If they had started earlier in the 1980s 
when they were in power to make the difficult choices and if they 
had continued on today, we would not be spending $45 billion a 
year in interest.  Then families could keep $6,000 a year in 
their pockets, or we could set up an endowment of $30,000 for 
every poor child in the country.

</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to convert the annual interest bill into $100 bills 
and we stacked them up one on one, the pile would be 118 
kilometres high.  The pile would be 214 times higher than the CN 
Tower. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the status quo which we are going to let sit there, that 
huge debt which is festering.  This government and its spin 
machine talk at great length about prosperity in the Canadian 
economy and growth of jobs and so on but they have fallen prey to 
the very same fatal hubris of the Mulroney government. The 
Liberals believe arrogantly that they have managed to defeat 
something called the business cycle, the notion that in a market 
economy or any economy there are ups and downs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately there will be a downturn sometime in this economy. 
The finance minister speaks as though he is a Pollyanna.  He 
speaks about a new golden age where this country will have 20 or 
30 years of uninterrupted growth. I am an optimist and I wish the 
minister were right but any rational, objective reading of 
economic history in this or any modern country will indicate that 
it simply will not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There will be a downturn in our economy at some point, a 
recession at some point.  Government revenues will drop at some 
point and social expenditures will increase at some point. Should 
that happen while we are still sitting on a $583.2 billion debt 
with $45 billion in interest payments and the highest income tax 
burden in the G-7, it will be too late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have not solved the problem, the problem that Reformers came 
here to solve in 1993, the problem of overspending, the problem 
of overtaxation and the problem of too much debt. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We say here today as this government rams this bill through this 
parliament that it is time to stop and get our heads out of the 
sand.  We have to realize the Mulroney government made precisely 
the same mistake in 1988 when it thought it was facing a decade 
of future growth.  That government decided to let it go easy on 
the spending side.  It decided to let up on the fiscal reins as 
this government is doing in this bill and this budget today.  We 
are paying the price today with a $600 billion debt and $45 
billion in interest payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for us to remember the fundamental principle of the 
terrible lesson we have learned with the fiscal history of this 
country in the past two decades.  We have not yet solved the 
problem. That problem is still very much the $583 billion debt 
which the government leaves completely untouched, an act of 
fiscal irresponsibility which is almost unparalleled in the 
history of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have the Liberals done on the tax side?  They talk about 
tax relief.  Whenever we ask the finance minister he stands up 
and blathers about how he has given the child tax credit and all 
this stuff but most of what they call tax cuts are in fact tax 
expenditures.  They are government cheques that are being cut. 
That is the Liberal accounting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we account for the $10 billion annual increase in CPP 
premiums and the enormous effect of bracket creep which sucks up 
$2 billion to $3 billion a year out of the pockets of taxpayers 
just through inflation, what we find is that this is actually a 
tax increase budget. When we calculate the total net effect of 
the CPP payroll tax, the EI tax, the bracket creep higher income 
tax revenues and everything else and what they call their tax 
cuts, when we add it all up what we end up with is this budget 
being a tax increase budget.  It is the fifth consecutive tax 
increase budget from a government that promised in the 1993 and 
1997 elections not to raise taxes.  Another promise broken. 
Another trust betrayed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 the government has taken a cumulative $49.1 billion 
from the pockets of taxpayers amounting to an average of $3,500 
per taxpayer. That is more than was being taken. That is an 
increase over the enormously high tax burden of this government's 
predecessor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we take into account this budget and the future years 
projected in the budget documents, the government, when it closes 
its books in the fiscal year after the next one, will have raised 
taxes by a cumulative total of nearly $80 billion. 
That is $80 billion, or $5,700 per year for the average taxpayer. 
Compare that to what we have proposed in the official opposition 
which is to cut personal income taxes by $12 billion a year, or 
$2,000 for the average family by the year 2000.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another little feature, or technical flaw as we might say, in 
the budget bill is the change being made to what is called the 
child care tax deduction.  The government has decided to raise by 
$2,000 the amount parents can deduct in the cost of paying a 
third party to care for their children.  That is fine. We respect 
the choices of people who decide to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are millions of Canadian families and parents who make the 
sacrifice to stay at home and raise their children to do what 
they believe in their conscience is best for their children.  Do 
they get the benefit of the $2,000 additional deduction or even 
the $5,000 deduction that is there now?  They do not get one red 
cent of it.  They are told if they give up the second income they 
get no consideration under the tax code.  It is a two tier tax 
code, one for the daycare choices the government supports and the 
other for families who want to make choices for themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill is a disgrace. Closure is a disgrace.  The lack of 
disclosure is a disgrace. The public accounting principles that 
are manipulated here are a disgrace.  The unfairness for families 
is a disgrace.  The $583 billion the government is passing on to 
future generations is a disgrace.  That is why I and my 
colleagues will be voting against it.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to use certain facts 
and certain references to illustrate the importance of what the 
federal government is doing today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the 1964 federal-provincial conference, Quebec's position with 
respect to the federal student loan and bursary program was made 
known.  According to the Premier of Quebec of the day, Jean 
Lesage, “Under the circumstances, in order to resolve the 
problem posed by the federal student loan policy, Quebec demands 
that the Government of Canada hand over to it, in the form of 
tax equivalencies, those amounts it would have reimbursed in 
interest payments on loans to Quebec students.  We would accept 
as the basis for determining this equivalent amount the relative 
proportion of the population of Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On leaving the conference, Premier Lesage declared “We most 
certainly cannot accept that the federal administration would 
err, regardless of whether or not it was in good faith, by 
invading an area that is indisputably under our jurisdiction and 
one which, what is more, we have been handling for the past 
three years.  There is only one solution which would avoid the 
conflict which both sides most certainly wish to avoid, and that 
is tax compensation according to the Diefenbaker-Sauvé formula, 
which was used not long ago to resolve a similar problem to the 
real advantage of both governments. This is a solution that can 
be applied immediately, to spare us the complications and even 
serious disputes which would otherwise inevitably arise”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This warning by Mr. Lesage, as he left the federal-provincial 
conference, was heard by the Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. 
Pearson. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a telegram, Mr. Pearson said to Mr. Lesage “The federal 
government hopes to introduce shortly legislation to extend 
family allowance benefits to children aged 16 and 17 who are 
dependent either because they are unable to work for physical 
reasons or because they are still in school.  In addition, the 
federal government intends to propose arrangements to permit 
university students in each province to obtain guaranteed bank 
loans up to the amount approved for a given student by the 
authorized provincial body”.  The key sentence in the telegram 
reads “Any province preferring to confine itself to its own 
loans program may receive equivalent compensation”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1964, Quebec has developed the best student financial aid 
program. 
This has been confirmed by all those involved, from both inside 
the province and from the other provinces in Canada: “We want a 
loans and bursaries program.  We want scholarships because our 
students have an average debt of $25,000 when they finish their 
studies, whereas in Quebec, the average debt is $11,000”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They reported a succession of debates in Quebec.  Students have 
demonstrated several times to make sure that the plan they end 
up with will suit their needs.  Over the past 35 years, we have 
developed a plan that is based on students' financial needs.  In 
Quebec, no one ever tried to include the notion of merit in it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, the federal government wants us to pass a bill that will 
create the millennium scholarship foundation. 
These scholarships will include the notion of merit and will be 
distributed by a foundation that will reach agreement with 
certain provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do you think the government chose this course of action 
rather than simply changing its student loan program into a loan 
and scholarship program and allowing Quebec to continue to 
exercise its right to opt out with full compensation?  Why did 
it take this approach?  Because the government wanted to be 
visible.  The only valid reason was to ensure its visibility.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Quebec government decided to show magnanimity. It said “we 
will give you that visibility”. During the negotiations, Mr. 
Bouchard told the Prime Minister “we will appoint negotiators if 
this is what you want. They will look at how this can be 
achieved and then we will propose concrete solutions to meet 
your visibility criterion”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the negotiations, Quebec said “if it means putting the 
Canadian flag on a cheque, so be it”. But this was still not 
good enough. Why? Because throughout the negotiation process, 
the Minister of Human Resources Development had no mandate to 
amend the act in any way, shape or form. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During clause by clause review of the bill, we debated for a 
whole day and said “Before reviewing this bill, should we not 
wait for the outcome of the negotiations with Quebec, to see 
what amendments may be made to the legislation?” The Liberals 
did not propose any amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a perfect bill, one that requires no amendment at all. 
Yet, the members of the majority who sat with us in committee 
did see that there was indeed unanimity, but on the Quebec side. 
We are fully aware that this bill is designed to prevent Quebec 
from opting out with full compensation, and that Ottawa wants to 
achieve visibility at the expense of the needs everyone in 
Quebec agrees on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this will really hurt students, because it will again 
create dissension. We will end up with a dual system. 
Students are going to be applying for $3,000 federal government 
scholarships on the basis of financial need, but also on the 
basis of their marks and their merit.  We do not know how merit 
will be defined.  When these people apply for the $3,000 in 
Quebec, how will they be treated? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is unacceptable.  The government is not thinking 
about changing a program that does not work; it is thinking 
about changing, replacing and upsetting the best system in 
Canada.  This is completely unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is that, this afternoon, I received a release from the 
Fédération étudiante universitaire et collégiale du Québec, 
signed by its president, Nikolas Ducharme.  It reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In its handling of the millennium scholarships issue, just as in 
its handling of the hepatitis C affair, the federal government 
must be the envy of certain authoritarian regimes. 
We are deeply disappointed with the attitude of the Prime 
Minister of Canada.  Quebec students view democracy as coming 
from the people.  When the people make a request, when citizens 
speak, when those they represent are critical, elected officials 
must listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Fédération étudiante universitaire du Québec, 
the Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec, the Coalition de 
l'éducation, the business community, the Parti Quebecois, the 
Liberal Party of Quebec, Action démocratique du Québec, and the 
National Assembly of Quebec have all spoken out against Bill 
C-36, and the Prime Minister has not listened. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And here is what students are asking the Prime Minister: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the Prime Minister of Canada have so little respect for 
democracy? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the anger of students, we realize that it is because 
they are the ones, ultimately, who will have to apply for these 
scholarships. 
They will be in the situation of having to apply to two 
different governments for the same thing.  I do not know whether 
all members have seen what a loan and scholarship application 
looks like.  Each educational institution has to have someone to 
help the students.  There are student loans and financial 
assistance advisors performing this function in cegeps and 
universities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are now going to have the pleasure of dealing with two 
forms, rather than just one, with two governments, and wondering 
whether they have the right to forward personal information to 
this private foundation.  How are they going to deal with all 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The situation is completely unacceptable.  It is too bad that 
the government has taken this attitude, because we would have 
liked the negotiations to have produced essentially the same 
results as in 1964, when the federal government finally listened 
to what Quebec wanted. 
It took the same kind of pressure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, the National Assembly acknowledges the Quebec 
Government's intention to allocate the amounts thus saved in its 
scholarship programme to the funding of colleges and 
universities. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the message is very clear. There is a consensus. I could 
make an interesting comparison and point out to the Liberal 
majority that this consensus is even stronger than the one that 
existed regarding school boards. There are no opponents in 
Quebec in this case. The Liberal majority could not find a 
single witness that would come and tell the committee that this 
is a good idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, after the referendum, this House adopted a 
motion on distinct society. If the federal government really 
wanted to show its good faith regarding the distinct society 
issue, it would not go any further with this bill. 
It would say “We have to resume negotiations with Quebec. We 
have to accept the amendment with the right to compensation. It 
would be the first time in several years that we can show our 
willingness to use a different approach with Quebec”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it would be important for the Liberals to think about 
that. They may wonder why they have so much trouble getting 
members elected. It might be because they are losing touch with 
the grassroots. It is hard to get the whole picture from only 
part of the National Assembly, from the other side or from a 
party with only a handful of members, but in this case we have a 
unanimous motion passed by the National Assembly, a unanimous 
position taken by the Quebec education coalition, led by the 
president of McGill University. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not a debate between the sovereignists and the 
federalists, but between those who want the current Constitution 
to be respected and those who want it to be violated. This is 
the situation we find ourselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>English Canada does not understand that, when Quebec joined 
Confederation, jurisdiction over education was something to be 
cherished, something nobody could touch, then or in the future, 
as it is directly linked to the notion of a people. No nation in 
this world would entrust the education of its people to some 
entity other than the government in which it has a majority. 
Quebeckers will never accept that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, the federal government had decided to bulldoze the Quebec 
government and the people of Quebec. It wants to impose its 
will, but it is actually shooting in its own net. 
I pledge to systematically remind everybody in Quebec that the 
federal government, in this debate, chose to ignore the 
unanimous consensus reached by all Quebeckers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It took 35 years to build that consensus. It was not built in 
the last year, or over the past five years. It has been building 
since 1964, since Quebec and Canada reached a consensus on the 
advisability for Quebec to have an independent financial 
assistance system. 
That was 34 years ago.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, this consensus is being cast aside. This is it. Through 
the Liberal majority, the Canadian government has decided to 
impose its approach on Quebec in the area of education. This 
action will have far-reaching consequences. This is a historic 
moment, a grave moment that Quebeckers are not about to forget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the years to come, we will be able to tell all Quebeckers 
“This government in which you do not even have a majority voice 
has decided to step into what you felt is the most important 
area and, while this fundamental jurisdiction is covered by the 
Confederation pact, to disregard this pact”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is turning out to be a money issue. The federal government 
has the power to spend and it spends whichever way it pleases. 
We have seen what this attitude has led to in recent years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship foundation may be a suitable concept 
for the other provinces of Canada, but it is not for Quebec, 
where it has been unanimously rejected. That is why I move the 
following amendment: 
<A NAME="LINK186">&nbsp;</A>

the Canada Millennium Scholarship Foundation.”

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> The motion is taken under

<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe—Bagot, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
would like to take this opportunity to congratulate my colleague 
from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques for his 
excellent work on the issue of employment insurance for the 
benefit of the unemployed in Quebec and in the rest of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a situation as dramatic as this one arises, it takes people 
like my esteemed colleague to document the issue fully, to ask 
pertinent questions of the minister responsible, and to demand 
equally pertinent replies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is a very serious matter, and one that is 
well documented.  I am sure that, some day, logic will win out 
and the minister will make decisions accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les 
Basques said, we are starting another black chapter in the 
history of Canadian federalism. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1650

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is rather surprising, when one thinks of the business of the 
millennium scholarships, that there is one man, and one man 
alone, who has been a character in all of these black chapters 
in the history of federalism: the present Prime Minister of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He was there for the night of the long knives, he was 
there when the Constitution was patriated to the detriment of 
Quebec.  He was there, floating about in the back hallways and 
everywhere else with his cell phone and pager during the debate 
on Meech Lake, and he had a hand in its failure.  The present 
Prime Minister was a presence throughout. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, with a major and fundamental intrusion into an area of 
jurisdiction that is exclusive to Quebec, once again we find the 
Prime Minister of Canada, the hon. member for Saint-Maurice, 
right in the middle of things, as the main booster of the 
millennium scholarships. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is most unfortunate that a single man can do so much harm to 
the people of Quebec and to the history of the long battle by 
the people of Quebec to make the federal government mind its own 
business.  It is, moreover, virtually unprecedented in the 
history of Canadian federalism for the very essence of the 
Constitution, the British North America Act which gave exclusive 
jurisdiction over education to the provinces, and to Quebec in 
particular, to be trampled underfoot with such arrogance and 
cynicism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have just finished a three week stint with the Standing 
Committee on Finance, during which we heard testimony from 
people speaking on behalf of others. The 14 Quebec witnesses 
represented no less than 1.2 million people in business and 
education. In fact they represented everything that moves and 
has an interest in education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For three weeks, these 14 organizations and others from across 
Canada came to say that supporting a scheme such the millennium 
scholarships was out of the question. These organizations, 
including some Canadian ones and some illustrious Canadian 
university professors, came to say that if the millennium 
scholarships were good for Canada, they were bad for Quebec. 
Now, this is something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even after three weeks of such intense work, the Liberals did 
not even move one single amendment, even though there is 
unanimous opposition to this in Quebec. 
Every single witness told the federal government to mind its own 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially, the witnesses had four messages. First, the 
millennium scholarship scheme reveals a deep lack of 
understanding of Quebec reality. I would like to quote from the 
FTQ's brief; it said that “as it stands now, Bill C-36 shows a 
lack of understanding on the part of the Canadian government of 
Quebec loans and grants system and Quebec's priorities in 
education”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an understatement. Year in and year out, student loans 
in Quebec alone amount to approximately $500 million. On top of 
that, the Quebec government pays out grants to students to the 
tune of $253 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system has been in place for over 30 years.  And now we have 
a bill that ignores this reality, Quebec expertise and the 
extraordinary results, which in the opinion of the Canadians 
testifying before the Standing Committee on Finance, tops those 
of all the other provinces.  The government is dismissing all 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second problem is the duplication.  Quebec has had an 
administrative structure for loans and grants for over 30 years. 
There are educational and administrative experts in a whole 
network of loans and bursaries, who are among the world's most 
specialized.  Now the system is being top loaded, as we say in 
good French.  The federal government is introducing a new 
parallel structure, federal this time, to administer a $2.5 
billion fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do you know what it will cost to administer this millennium 
fund? 
It will amount to 5%.  Five per cent of the total budget of the 
fund will go to administer this new federal program in a sector 
that is Quebec's exclusive jurisdiction.  That figure represents 
twice the cost of administering the Quebec system of loans and 
bursaries, and they talk about effective management of federal 
funds.

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major problem haunted the deliberations of the finance 
committee, and it is that the millennium scholarships bear no 
relation to the needs of students in Quebec and even less to the 
needs of the education system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Liberals really wanted to help students cope with their 
debt load and gain easier access to education generally, the 
intelligent approach would have been to limit cuts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the past four years and until 2003, the Minister of Finance, 
who continues shamelessly to collect a surplus of up to $20 
billion in the employment insurance fund, has been and will be 
stealing money from students and the entire Quebec and Canadian 
educational system, for by then he will have cut $10 billion 
from higher education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best way to help students and ensure their access to 
education is for the government to return to the system what it 
took from the provinces.  This would have been an intelligent 
way to intervene in the sector, while maintaining provincial 
jurisdiction in the educational sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another problem with this fund.  In recent years, the 
Minister of Finance has got us used to figure juggling.  He has 
us used to being given figures that have nothing to do with 
reality or the government's annual financial statements. 
It is the third time that he cooks up figures in such a shameful 
way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time, the auditor general gave him a stern warning, but 
cynicism and arrogance are contagious. Indeed, the cynicism and 
arrogance displayed by the Prime Minister have now spread to the 
Minister of Finance and the whole cabinet. The Minister of 
Finance ignores the criticisms of the Canadian Institute of 
Chartered Accountants and those made by the auditor general on 
three occasions for basically the same reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance posted to his 1997-98 budget—which ended 
on March 31—all the funds, a total of $2.5 billion, earmarked 
for the millennium scholarships. He led us to believe that they 
would start spending this money immediately. The fact is that 
the foundation will only start awarding these scholarships in 
the year 2000. 
So, an expenditure that would be made only two and a half years 
later was charged to the 1997-98 federal budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not standard procedure. Financial statements no longer 
mean anything. We can read them, but we cannot really find out 
about the government's revenues and expenditures, because the 
minister cooks up the figures. This is the third time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He did so when the maritime provinces harmonized the GST with 
their own sales taxes. The minister was to give $800 million to 
the maritime provinces the following year, because they had 
agreed to harmonize the GST with their own sales taxes, but he 
had already charged the whole $800 million to the budget of the 
previous fiscal year. He did the same thing with the innovation 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At some point, he will have to stop cooking the books. The truth 
will have to come out, because this is complete nonsense. 
Neither the financial statements nor the estimates make sense 
any longer. And I am not the only one to think so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the Minister of Finance brought down his last budget, all 
the editors said that it made no sense to forecast, year after 
year, no surplus in government operations, when we know the 
surplus will keep increasing, starting this year with a 
$4 billion surplus in the federal budget. It does not make any 
sense to put “zero, zero, and zero” in the estimates for the 
next three years. Will he stop laughing at the taxpayers some 
day? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He does it again with the millennium scholarships; he cooks the 
books and hides the real budget surplus and all the drastic cuts 
to education. He keeps doing it and still maintains that he has 
to fight the deficit, when in fact, since the last fiscal year, 
we have a surplus that will increase in the future.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I would ask hon.

the member who is speaking. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, I was saying that a new chapter 
has been written in the dark history of the federal system, as 
illustrated by all the arguments I and every other speaker from 
Quebec have submitted. They have also unanimously rejected the 
proposed millennium scholarship fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not every day that the Premier of Quebec and his education 
minister lead a delegation to come to meet with the Prime 
Minister of Canada here, in Ottawa, to see if they could agree 
on a mutually acceptable position, which would at the same time 
satisfy the federal government's need for visibility. That is 
all there is to it: the federal government wants to be visible 
in what it does for students in the hope of winning them over to 
the cause of Canadian federalism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are they taking students for? 
Students can see that behind this need for visibility there are 
measures which have been penalizing them big time for the past 
four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premier and the minister of education of Quebec came here to 
meet with the Prime Minister of Canada. They tried to smooth 
things over and made several concessions. They also put on the 
table proposals that would respect Quebec's jurisdiction while 
giving the federal government the visibility it desired. That is 
all it is after. It does not care about efficiency or helping 
students. Just the same, a negotiating committee was set up. 
Week after week, the lead negotiator on this committee did not 
show any real desire to define a mutually acceptable position. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, little fed up with all the fine talk, and a little 
fed up that things are not moving ahead, the minister of 
education has decided that enough is enough, that the federal 
Liberals do not really want to work out any new arrangements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned just now, the National Assembly even 
passed a unanimous motion that allowed the federal government 
its visibility but that also ensured some respect for the 
Government of Quebec's jurisdiction, ensured that it was Quebec 
that was responsible for the administration, as well as 
providing the lists of millennium scholarship fund recipients. 
We also had a share, based on the demographic figures, of the 
$2.5 billion that would have gone to Quebec.  This was passed 
unanimously by all parties present in the National Assembly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once again, this is an indication of the consensus that was 
clearly evident during the discussions of the Standing Committee 
on Finance, when witnesses from Quebec appeared before the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are even Canadian supporters, as I mentioned earlier. John 
Trent of the University of Ottawa, for instance, who is a vocal 
opponent of the sovereignists, who is certainly no friend of the 
Bloc Quebecois, said, and I quote “The fund will inevitably lead 
to federal-provincial duplication and overlap with existing 
programs.  It is in direct competition with Quebec's loans and 
scholarships program, which many consider superior”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When people like him speak in our favour, speak in favour of 
Quebec, and add their voices to the consensus in Quebec, that 
says it all.  The government is demonstrating unprecedented 
arrogance and cynicism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague mentioned earlier, there have been several 
attempts by the federal government in the past to interfere in 
the field of education, which comes under the exclusive 
jurisdiction of Quebec.  Every time, the federal government 
understood.  The federal leaders, who were less arrogant and 
less cynical than our leaders today, understood in the past that 
education was sacred to Quebec, that we would not allow the 
federal government to interfere in this sector.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most important federal conferences in the history of 
Canadian federalism was held in Quebec City in 1964, on March 31 
to be exact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember that it was given front page coverage by the <I>Globe 
and Mail</I> on that date, because it considered this an historic 
event on a number of levels, including the fact that it marked 
the discussion of new arrangements between the federal 
government and the provinces, Quebec in particular, with respect 
to taxation, the establishment of a new order if you will, in 
federal-provincial relations and the respect of jurisdictions 
such as education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, Messrs. Pearson and Lesage, two intelligent men 
who were willing to talk to each other, exchanged views during 
this federal-provincial conference because, in 1964, the federal 
government wanted to inaugurate a federal program of student 
loans and bursaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was surprised to find, in rereading the opening remarks by 
the Hon. Jean Lesage, the Premier of Quebec at the time, that 
they could have been made today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I may, I will quote a few passages from those opening remarks 
by Mr. Lesage. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that the federal government offers only student loans, 
not bursaries and loans as seems to have been the case at one 
point, may at first appear to be an attempt to avoid the 
constitutional problem bursaries would have presented.  In fact, 
because supply falls within its jurisdiction, the federal 
government can give the impression that it is remaining within 
its jurisdiction by giving loans rather than bursaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do 
not believe this gets around the constitutional problem.  The 
students themselves have felt this, because they have openly 
opposed the new federal policy. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The millennium scholarship project has also been opposed 
recently by students. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will now continue. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty arises, not from the fact that there are loans, 
but that they are interest-free loans for students.  These loans 
will be made by financial institutions— 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For these two reasons, 
the Government of Quebec cannot accept application of the 
federal program as it is proposed at present. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have, moreover, 
already set up a student aid service involving sizeable amounts 
of bursaries and loans to students every year. 
We are therefore already making a particularly significant 
effort in this area, not to mention the huge sums of money we 
devote to other sectors of education every year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the 
circumstances, in order to resolve the problem posed by the 
federal student loan policy, Quebec demands that the Government 
of Canada hand over to it, in the form of tax equivalencies, 
those amounts it would have reimbursed in interest payments on 
loans to Quebec students.  We would accept as the basis for 
determining this equivalent amount the relative proportion of 
the population of Quebec. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that conference on, therefore— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I would point out to the 
hon. member that he has only one minute remaining. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvan Loubier:</B> Madam Speaker, at this conference the then 
Quebec premier was very reluctant as is the current Quebec 
premier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But Mr. Pearson understood. As a result of their discussions, 
barely two weeks after the end of this important federal 
provincial conference, Mr. Pearson sent a telegram to Mr. Lesage 
allowing Quebec to withdraw, with full compensation, from a 
program in an area under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are still hoping that the current Prime Minister will stop 
being so obtuse, cynical and arrogant and lend a favorable ear 
to the consensus in Quebec, to allow, as was the case at the 
Quebec conference when Mr. Pearson and Mr. Lesage— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I must interrupt the 
hon. member but his time has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must also inform the hon. member for 
Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques that his amendment 
is in order.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Nelson Riis (Kamloops, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I want to 
say from the very start that I am so bloody mad I could spit at 
the moment.  If we are very quiet we can hear the jackboots of 
the Liberals trampling over the democratic rights of the citizens 
of this country.  We can hear them in the hallways.  A dark 
fascist cloud hangs over this institution today as the Liberal 
government has brought in closure on this bill and the 
representatives of 30% of the voters of Canada will not be heard. 
They will be muzzled.  The 30% of the people who voted 
Conservative and the 30% of the people who voted New Democrat 
will not be heard on this multibillion dollar budget bill.  We 
say that is wrong.  It is disgusting.  It is anti-democratic.  It 
is simply wrong and it is unparliamentary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not where it ends.  This is the final stage of an 
anti-democratic sweep by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the legislation was introduced, after post-budget 
considerations that were essentially ignored, we heard 88 
representatives who came before the finance committee with a 
whole set of very positive recommendations for change. There were 
88 interventions.  Amendments were brought forward.  Did 
government members listen to a single one of those 88 interveners 
who proposed changes?  Not a single period was changed.  Not a 
comma was changed in the legislation.  It makes a mockery of the 
system.  It is a slap in the face to all of those witnesses who 
appeared before the committee.  I say that is wrong and 
undemocratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to be careful because I could get worked up.  I have a 
whole speech that I am supposed to read on behalf of my caucus. 
The Conservatives had a representative who wanted to make a 
speech today, but we are unable to do that.  We are not allowed 
to.  There is something wrong with a system which says that 30% 
of the electorate is simply cut out of a discussion on this 
budget legislation.  It is wrong and it is something the 
government has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought the Tories were bad under Mulroney.  We were up here 
day after day saying what a bunch of scumbags they were because 
they were introducing closure, introducing time allocation, 
cutting off democracy and making a mockery out of this place. 
The Liberals are actually worse.  It is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a couple of comments about the legislation.  To start 
with I want to talk about the millennium scholarship fund.  Let 
us acknowledge that this millennium scholarship fund, at best, is 
going to help about 7% of students who need help today.  As a 
matter of fact, it is a lot less than that.  About 7% of college 
and university students may get assistance.  Ninety-some per cent 
will never see the benefit of this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the government take its commitment to education seriously 
by reinstating transfers to the provinces for education?  No it 
does not.  Does it take its position seriously by doing what 
every OECD country does by providing federal leadership on access 
to education?  Does it do that? No, it does not.  It brings in 
this little flashy millennium scholarship fund.  I can see it 
now.  All the cheques will be signed by the Prime Minister and 
sent out to all of the students as a good public relations 
gesture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, it will help a handful of people in need, but will it help 
provincial governments in terms of their tuition fees?  No, it 
will not.  Will it help the thousands and thousands of young 
people today who are indebted up to their eyeballs, the average 
debt load being $25,000?  Will it help them?  No it will not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then it refers to the employment insurance fund.  We find out 
today that the employment insurance fund will have a surplus this 
year of about $16 billion or $17 billion.  By the end of the year 
it will be about $19 billion.  By next year there will be a 
surplus of about $25 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is stealing money out of the hands and pockets of employees 
and employers across this country.  No wonder we have the deficit 
under control.  Money has been taken out of the pockets of the 
hardest working people in the country.  It is wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government says that it is going to provide an incentive to 
encourage employers to hire young people.  That is going to help 
1% of the hundreds of thousands of young people who are out of 
work today.  One per cent may benefit from this initiative. 
That is hypocrisy.  By saying that they are going to do 
something, that they are going to help 1%, is like taking a slap 
in the face for every unemployed young person.  That is wrong.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.)</B> moved that Bill 
C-235, an act to amend the Competition Act (protection of those 
who purchase products from vertically integrated suppliers who 
compete with them at retail), be read the second time and 
referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, I am very pleased to be here to speak 
to this bill.  The bill was initially introduced in the House of 
Commons last year but, because of the election and time 
constraints, we did not have an opportunity to get back to it. 
on the order paper, but Bill C-235 is from the 36th Parliament. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This bill becomes even more important when we consider the 
recent tactics by a number of industries but specifically the gas 
industry.  We have witnessed across the country some very 
disturbing trends occurring with respect to retailing of gasoline 
products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is really something I think we can see occurring in 
other areas such as the travel industry with respect to 
reservations.  A number of travel agents have spoken to members 
of parliament about the problems there. We have also heard 
rumours recently about the impending actions taken by the U.S. 
government perhaps at some point down the road with respect to 
Microsoft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem that exists here is really one of predatory pricing 
and price discrimination.  For the purpose of this bill we want 
to deal specifically with what it does.  It would provide for the 
enforcement of fair pricing between a manufacturer who sells a 
product at retail, either directly or through an affiliate, and 
who also supplies product to a customer who competes with the 
supplier at the retail level. This bill provides a supplier's 
customer with a fair opportunity to make a similar profit as the 
supplier at the retail level in a given market area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week in Toronto and in many regions across the country 
a number of independent gasoline retailers told me and expressed 
to other members of parliament how difficult it really is to stay 
in business when the supplier you are competing against is the 
very person who is determining the cost at which you are going to 
receive the supply. 
If that supplier deems it is important to increase market share 
at your expense, then it will not be very long before predictably 
you will be out of business.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal committee on gasoline pricing has crisscrossed the 
country.  It has come up with a number of ideas that it will 
eventually bring forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill speaks for itself.  In the view of many in this House, 
there is a very clear indication that there is a shortcoming in 
the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1986 the restrictive trade practices commission came to the 
conclusion that there was a need far from what the provinces are 
doing today to enforce and to strengthen legislation in the 
Competition Act as it relates to section 50. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We realize this is the first hour of debate and I am honoured we 
have had an opportunity to look at this.  I am equally delighted 
that the Subcommittee on Private Members' Business had the 
fortitude and the quite common quite sense to deem this bill 
votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Current measures in the federal Competition Act dealing with 
predatory pricing and price discrimination clearly have proven to 
be insufficient in combating these activities and in providing 
adequate protection for those in the industry. It is fair to say 
that the cumulative effect of legislation is not to bring about 
restriction in price or governance of price.  The idea is to 
ensure that legislation exists so that there are effective ground 
rules and more important, that legislation in this country 
ensures and fosters a free market and at the end of the day 
adequate supply and demand. When it comes to predatory pricing, 
it is clear to many that we need change and that change should 
happen as soon as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of mom and pop type gas station owners across this 
country are watching this bill very intently.  It is not because 
it is something that would allow them to line their pockets, not 
because it would allow them to make a profit at the expense of 
the consumer, but it is because their survival hinges on our 
ability here this evening to provide legislation that adequately 
protects them against the practice of below cost selling.  This 
is occurring at an alarming rate.  We only have to go to the 
major centres across the country to know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we tear away at this country's small businesses, or through 
neglect of our obligation here in terms of legislation we allow 
these people to die on the vine by a thousand cuts, we 
effectively have surrendered our obligation to protect people who 
want nothing more than to be competitive and to be efficient and 
at the end of the day to provide a product that every consumer 
needs. This bill is designed to protect certain people who have 
to compete against their own suppliers, but at the end of the day 
this bill is designed to protect consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very clear in regions of this country where there has been 
the ultimate demise of many independent retailers of gasoline 
product, where they have been eliminated, such as in Newfoundland 
or New Brunswick, there has been a corresponding trebling in the 
cost of gasoline.  It has nothing to do with taxes.  It has 
nothing to do with competition.  It has to do with the fact that 
we are seeing in this industry the emergence of an oligopoly 
which is dangerous in its very essence and is certainly dangerous 
to the interests of consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I encourage members of parliament to look at the legislation, to 
look at what the Competition Bureau said in 1986 in the Bertrand 
report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank each and every colleague for making this a 
votable bill. Let us not fail small business in this country. Let 
us make sure we continue to make competition viable in Canada. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Ref.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise 
with a lot of interest in this bill. 
I think the hon. member when he first started on his crusade with 
regard to gasoline prices undertook something that had an awful 
lot of appeal.  What has happened in the process of the bill is 
quite different from where the hon. member started.  We would 
have to look at this from the point of view that I personally and 
the Reform Party that I represent in the House clearly support 
vigorous and open competition in the marketplace.  We encourage 
that and we want to make sure there is competitive pricing, 
competitive promotion and that we enforce competition law as it 
exists at the present time.

<A HREF="#LINKT43"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also recognize there is a perception on the part of certain 
independent gas retailers that the competition that exists is not 
fair and that there is a lack of competition in some cases and 
the very same thing exists in the minds of some customers and 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to advance to the hon. member that his intention 
was great but Bill C-235 fails to resolve that issue.  It stops 
short of looking at the real issue behind the lack of competition 
in the marketplace.  The issue is not the Competition Act as has 
been proposed because the Competition Act lays out very clearly 
provisions preventing predatory pricing, abuse of dominant 
position or unfair practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is necessary for us to know to what the Competition Act says. 
Section 78 in part (a) refers specifically to what 
anti-competition really means.  It includes any of the following 
acts.  Part (a) says it is squeezing by a vertically integrated 
supplier which is exactly what Bill C-235 addresses: “squeezing 
of the margin available to an unintegrated customer” which in 
the example is the independent gasoline retailer “who competes 
with a supplier for the purpose of impeding or preventing the 
customers entry into or expansion in a particular market”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is precisely the issue the hon. member is trying to 
address.  He is suggesting the Competition Act does not cover 
this issue.  I submit it does. Part (i) reads: “selling articles 
at a price lower than the acquisition cost for the purpose of 
disciplining or eliminating a competitor”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not take a genius to figure out what that really means. 
The intention of the hon. member is certainly commendable but the 
current legislation provides for exactly the kind of thing he 
wants to prevent.  I agree that we should not have that and that 
is why section 78 exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under section 50 of the Competition Act we have very serious 
consequences for a company or individual engaging in 
anti-competitive behaviour.  The hon. member in his initial 
comments made the observation that the Competition Act needs to 
be enforced and must be efficient in its application. I could not 
agree with him more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the issue is one of enforcement it seems that is exactly what 
it is.  The current provisions under sections 50 and 78 have 
comprehensive enough coverage that they can deal with all the 
things the hon. member wants to deal with in Bill C-235.  The 
issue becomes one of the willingness to enforce that legislation, 
to actually say if this is done then there is a consequence. 
Part of the reason for the perception that competition does not 
exist is the act is not being enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member suggested this has nothing to do with taxation.  It 
has a lot to do with taxation.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I go into the taxation part I would like to suggest one 
other issue.  That has to do with the most recent article that 
columnist Diane Francis wrote for the May 26 issue of the 
<I>Financial Post</I>.  She suggests that one of the reasons 
Canada has some of the difficulties it has with regard to the 
Competition Act is in Canada there is not the kind of anti-trust 
legislation that exists in the United States. I agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the time has come for us to examine very seriously 
whether we ought to be looking at the issue of whether industries 
and certain players in the marketplace are becoming too large. If 
we allow an oligopoly to develop where an industry becomes so 
big, a player in a particular sector becomes so big that it 
virtually dominates the marketplace and dictates the prices of 
services and product in that sector, we ought to look very 
seriously at whether that oligopoly ought to continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I alert the Minister of Finance in this connection when he 
considers later this year the proposed merger of the banks. It 
seems to me we ought to look at that as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to come back to the taxation issue.  The hon. member told 
us very clearly that it has nothing to do with taxation.  Let me 
suggest that the excise tax on gasoline can be blamed for higher 
prices at the pumps more effectively than anything else.  I will 
cite some facts.  More than 50% of the average price of gasoline 
at the pumps actually is excise tax.  The residual effect is that 
the profit margin for suppliers and retailers is reduced.  If we 
are looking for negative forces on the marketplace then we need 
look no further than on the effective of excessive taxes on 
industry, the business person and the consumer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of gasoline pricing and profit margins for both big 
and small players everyone is being hurt by excessive taxes.  The 
only player who comes out unscathed in the entire process is the 
tax grabbing Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That tax grabbing hurts the consumer by raising the prices at 
the pumps and by cutting into the profit margins of big and small 
business.  That is the issue. The typical gasoline retailer 
realized an average gross profit margin of three and a half 
cents on the sale of a litre of regular gasoline in 1996.  That 
amounts to 6% of the average pump price.  The taxes meanwhile 
averaged 28.6 cents a litre more than 50% of the average pump 
price at that time.  Both refiners and gasoline marketers have 
seen profit margins fall as a result of price competition despite 
rising crude oil prices since 1991. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a very practical issue here that we need to look at as 
well.  Average consumers will ask how on long weekends and during 
vacation periods can prices go up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Crude oil prices can rise and the lag between the rise in world 
prices and the price at the pump has a very short time span.  But 
when the price drops on the world market it takes a long time 
before the price falls at the pumps. These are the issues we want 
to look at in a very serious way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I commend what the hon. member is trying to do, but I submit 
that it is the wrong way to go at the issue.  I encourage him 
first to suggest to his colleagues to reduce taxes and get the 
money back to the taxpayers so that they can afford to buy 
gasoline and that the margin for the businessman increases rather 
than decreases.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am pleased 
to tell the hon. member that, in principle, his bill is a step 
in the right direction. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1810"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since debate on the proposed reform of the Competition Act 
appeared to be headed toward a weakening of the existing 
provisions of the act and not their strengthening, it is 
refreshing to see a member across the way introduce a bill to 
strengthen those provisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there are still a number of unresolved issues. For 
instance, clause 50.1(2)(<I>a</I>) of the bill states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(<I>a</I>) the supplier's own retail price in the same market area as 
that in which the purchaser customarily sells the product or 
offers it for sale, less 
</UL></UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(i) the supplier's own cost of marketing at retail, and 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(ii) the supplier's reasonable return on the retail sale, 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is “reasonable”? What is the “cost of marketing at 
retail”? 
This remains vague. I do not know how to address this problem, 
but it is nonetheless important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, I would like to point out that this bill does not 
completely solve the retailers' problem. I think it is also the 
opinion of the Association of Independent Distributors of 
Petroleum Products that this bill does not completely solve the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, to address the overall problem, we have established 
the Régie de l'énergie, which, more than a year and a half ago 
already, set for gasoline in Quebec a floor price that takes 
into account the wholesale price in the Montreal area, 
transportation, taxes, and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This way, to help independent retailers, oil companies cannot 
sell their gasoline for less than a set minimum price. 
I realize we can also discuss that principle, but the idea is to 
listen, each year, to the stakeholders and see how the market is 
evolving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we agree that we cannot allow a monopolistic or oligopolistic 
market, we must take measures so that independent retailers can 
thrive and not merely survive. Times are very hard for many of 
them right now. I know that a number of them are desperately 
trying to survive and are counting on a review of the floor 
price that will be conducted by Quebec's energy board. After 
all, we have to define a guaranteed margin of profit, otherwise 
independent distributors will not survive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did hear arguments such as “we have to think about 
consumers”. 
It is true. But at the same time, let us not forget that 
consumers also include the producers who need revenues. 
If we only think about reducing prices, regardless of the impact 
on employment, economic development and small and medium size 
businesses, then we can have lower prices, but we will also have 
growing income gaps, as well as major social and economic 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I support in principle the bill introduced by the 
hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. I wish him luck. But I do 
want to discuss the issues raised by his bill. I congratulate 
him on his work, because—and I agree on this with the hon. 
member to my right, no pun intended—we really need to look at 
how small and medium size businesses in the oil and other 
industries can survive.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dick Proctor (Palliser, NDP):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
congratulate the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge on this 
bill and for the opportunity to say a few words about the subject 
of gas pricing in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member noted in his opening remarks, Bill C-235 is 
directed at ending predatory pricing practices of the oil 
companies which also own refineries and retail outlets, the 
so-called vertically integrated companies.  We think particularly 
of near monopolistic practices such as the Irvings in the 
Atlantic region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note a recent letter from David Collins who is with the Wilson 
Fuel Company Limited to our caucus to support the upcoming 
introduction of this bill or amendments to the Competition Act. 
About these amendments he says in part: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—amendments provide some much-needed definition to the concept 
of predatory pricing.  As local independent marketers of 
petroleum products, we have found ourselves singled out to face 
retail prices which are below those made available at wholesale. 
The result has been to discipline our company into retail price 
conformance.  (This) bill would provide firms such as ours some 
form of legal recourse to remedy such a situation. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Collins goes on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that the U.S. market is far more 
“regulated” when it comes to the marketing of petroleum 
products than it is in Canada.  The Americans also enjoy lower 
prices on average. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He concludes by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>(The) bill goes only part of the way toward bringing Canada's 
regulations in harmony with those afforded to the U.S. consumers. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also recognize and applaud the work of some folk in Atlantic 
Canada who have been fighting this stranglehold on the market to 
which I referred a moment ago.  I will particularly single out 
Elizabeth Weir, the leader of our party in the province of New 
Brunswick, and John Holm, the house leader in Nova Scotia, for 
the work they have done in the recent past on the whole matter of 
predatory pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill that is before us would provide for the enforcement of 
fair pricing between a manufacturer that sells a product at 
retail either directly or through an affiliate and supplies a 
product to a customer that competes with the supplier at the 
retail level.  This provides a supplier's customer with a fair 
opportunity to make a similar profit as the supplier at the 
retail level in a given market area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note in passing that we have a member in our caucus, the 
member for Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, who has also done a lot 
of work on the unfair pricing of gasoline in Canada generally but 
specifically in the province of Saskatchewan.  He has been 
arguing for some time that what we need is a commission to 
regulate the wholesale and retail prices of gasoline, taking into 
account both the public interest in having reasonable and 
consistent pricing and the need for manufacturers, distributors 
and wholesalers to have reasonable costs covered.  The commission 
could also conduct hearings on competition in the oil industry 
referred to it by the competition tribunal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we accept that some prices of goods or services which 
are central to our well-being and to the economy in general and 
often controlled by monopolies or near monopolies should be 
regulated in the public interest.  I am thinking, for example, of 
telephone and cable television costs.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally the oil companies do not agree.  They recently 
launched an ad campaign, as I understand it, in Ontario and in 
eastern Canada to explain some of the things that drive Canadians 
crazy on an annual basis about the oil and pricing regime as it 
has existed ever since I can remember. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give three examples.  Why do prices go up just before 
seeding season or the harvest season in my part of the world on 
the prairies?  Why do they go up across the country just before 
summer long weekends?  Why, when Saskatchewan is clearly a net 
exporter of oil products, do we end up paying a higher price than 
we do in Ottawa when the tax regime is exactly the same in both 
provinces?  Today in Regina the price at the pump is 56.9 cents 
as compared with 49.9 cents in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that these ads that are running in 
eastern Canada are not running in the west.  I would offer it is 
because the oil companies simply cannot answer that last one, 
that Saskatchewan is a net exporter yet ends up paying 7 cents a 
litre higher than is currently being paid in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the agriculture critic for our caucus one of the things that 
is a real bugaboo for people on the prairies, especially at this 
time of the year—and it is nice to see some of the other members 
of the standing committee on agriculture here tonight—is the 
high input costs being paid out as we speak, as farmers are out 
on the land putting their crops in the ground.  Among the highest 
are the costs for fossil fuels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this caucus believe that the bill introduced by the member 
for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge is a good bill.  It is worthy of 
support.  We commend him for the work he has done and for 
encouraging us as a parliament to continue to work on this very 
important issue. 
<P><A NAME="LINK197"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to say a few words in this debate on behalf of my 
colleague, the member for Markham. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge as well the efforts of my colleague from 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge in sponsoring the bill, an act to amend 
the Competition Act which is a protection for those who purchase 
products from vertically integrated suppliers that compete with 
them at the retail level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As ominous as vertically integrated suppliers sounds, I think we 
owe it to all stakeholders to give every consideration to the 
intent of the bill.  Beyond the intent we must also look at the 
bill's effectiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially Bill C-235 is attempting to accomplish fair pricing 
between a manufacturer that sells a product at retail either 
directly or through an affiliate and supplies product to a 
customer that competes with the supplier at the retail level. The 
bill's sponsor is also hoping to achieve an opportunity for a 
supplier's customer to make a similar profit as the supplier at 
the retail level in a given market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another major goal of the bill is to prevent anti-competitive 
acts such as predatory pricing and price discounting in 
industries where suppliers of products compete with their 
customers at the retail level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has not been oblivious to issues which are addressed by 
the bill.  The Competition Act, implemented by the previous 
Conservative government to replace the Anti-Combines Act, deals 
with the inherent issues of Bill C-235 without making any 
amendments.  The issues of price discrimination, price 
maintenance and abuse of dominance are already addressed by the 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us deal with the issue of fair pricing first.  The problem 
with the legislation is that it would create an artificial profit 
margin.  By guaranteeing pricing to competitors based on any 
formula which includes retail pricing, the bill would be creating 
a floor price below which no one could go. 
The elimination of the ability to engage in discounting would be 
a peculiar approach to addressing fair pricing.  The result would 
in fact be higher prices which certainly is not in the best 
interest of the Canadian consumer.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has already overburdened small and medium 
size businesses across the country with outrageous reporting 
requirements either in the area of sales tax, payroll taxes, 
Statistics Canada or any other number of government bureaus or 
agencies which enforce different degrees of compliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Legislators must begin searching for ways to ease the paperwork 
burden and let Canadian businesses get back to their core 
services, and this would not happen under Bill C-235.  Quite the 
opposite would be the case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine how the government could possibly begin tackling 
the issue of what constitutes proper wholesale prices, profit 
margins and marketing expenses of firms.  Quite simply it could 
not be done.  We would be creating another level of bureaucracy, 
an extra burden of government and an enormous enforcement cost. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I realize the bill is generic in its wording but it is clear 
that it will have a great impact on the retail gas industry.  The 
result would be to abandon market based forces as the proper 
determinant of gasoline prices and instead move to a cost based 
formula. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect we would be shackling the marketplace with a central 
command approach to economic questions.  The reality is that the 
Competition Act must above all else focus on achieving desirable 
results for consumers.  It should not be used to undermine the 
legitimate outcome of competition such as low prices.  We believe 
this would be the result of Bill C-235. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The M. J. Ervin report, the Canadian retail petroleum marketing 
study, produced many issues of note on this subject.  For 
instance, since 1994 Canada has enjoyed retail gasoline prices 
which on a pre-tax basis are among the lowest in the world. 
Between 1986 and 1995 gasoline jumped by 4 cents a litre and over 
the last six years operating margins have declined by 7 cents a 
litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these outcomes are a result of having dynamic change and 
innovation in our gasoline industry, dynamic change which has 
benefited many Canadian consumers.  The reality is that healthy 
competition exists in the industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the unique aspects is known as corner competition or the 
tub thumping effect where prices will get knocked down for a 
brief period of time but a correction will come about and prices 
will increase again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the House were to pass Bill C-235 we would in effect be tying 
the hands of suppliers from all affected industries.  They would 
be unable to change prices in response to market forces. This 
could lead to vertically integrated suppliers making the decision 
that the burden of compliance is too great and therefore they 
would cease supplying competitors.  This would result in less 
competition and higher prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For all these reasons we have to say that the Progressive 
Conservative Party will not be supporting the bill.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (St. Catharines, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
today I am addressing the House on the subject of private 
members' Bill C-235, an act to amend the Competition Act. 
Unfortunately I cannot support the bill.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to congratulate my colleague, the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, for his work in preparing this bill 
and for his laudable efforts to find solutions to the problems 
facing many of our small and medium size businesses.  While his 
efforts were well intentioned, the proposed means to resolve this 
issue will not bring about the results he seeks and will most 
certainly have serious adverse consequences on the Canadian 
economy in general and on a number of specific industries which I 
will explain shortly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 seeks to prohibit vertically integrated companies 
from selling their products to retailers competing against them 
in the same market at prices which would inhibit the retailer's 
ability to make a profit similar to that enjoyed by the 
vertically integrated supplier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill also seeks to prohibit vertically integrated suppliers, 
by virtue of their dominant position, from coercing retailers 
into adopting a specific pricing policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the bill, both of these proposals would be effected 
by amending sections 50 and 78, respectively, of the Competition 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill as it is currently worded will potentially apply to 
every vertically integrated supplier no matter what industry it 
is in.  My colleague across the way also explained that earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While many of us are aware of our colleague's interest in 
providing assistance to independent gasoline retailers, we should 
ask ourselves if tying the hands of all integrated players in the 
Canadian economy is not unlike using a bomb instead of a fire 
cracker.  Do we really wish to see our selection of tires, auto 
parts, jeans, electronics products, computers or green plants 
diminished by overbearing government regulation?  Do we wish to 
push some firms out of the Canadian economy because they find our 
laws burdensome?  I think not.  Indeed, we wish to encourage 
Canadians to open and expand their businesses and create jobs. 
We wish to welcome foreign investment as a further stimulus to 
job creation and to the Canadian economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, did we not adopt a policy of deregulation in the 
1980s?  We have been furthering that agenda for some time with 
the specific purpose of cutting down the costs of doing business 
in Canada in a attempt to provide Canadian businesses with an 
equal chance to compete in foreign markets and to meet import 
competition here at home.  To be more specific, experience has 
shown us that in markets where similar legislation has been 
enacted prices for the products covered by the legislation have 
risen.  Higher prices of inputs to major manufacturing in Canada 
would harm the overall competitiveness of the economy and inhibit 
Canadian firms from competing on a level playing field with 
foreign firms not subject to the same constraints. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allegations that vertically integrated suppliers have retailed 
their product below cost have rarely, if ever, proven supportable 
upon close analysis.  Forcing these suppliers to underwrite the 
return expected by competing retailers could easily lead to the 
supplier's legitimate refusal to sell their products through 
independent retailers.  In a nutshell, there is little good to 
come out of these proposals. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, these amendments would discourage price wars which 
can be of benefit to customers.  The resulting price 
inflexibility would introduce price rigidities, impeding the 
ability of businesses to quickly react to changing market 
conditions—and we all know that market conditions change 
continuously—and set their prices accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendments would force companies to check with their 
accountants and financial controllers to determine whether a new 
price offering would cover all their market costs and mandated 
rate of return even if short term requirements to sell off 
product or meet competition in the marketplace was urgently 
needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking specifically at how regulators would administer such a 
law, I draw the attention of members to the following scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The competition bureau would be expected to act upon any 
complaints arising from each and every price increase at the 
retail level of products covered by these proposed sections of 
the act.  Just looking at price changes at the pump, which happen 
as often as three times a week, in the 20,000 markets across 
Canada, we can expect the annual administration costs of 
investigating and pursuing such complaints to be easily in the 
billions of dollars.

<A HREF="#LINKT50"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Add to that the price increases for tires, car batteries, 
computers or plants, or the myriad products sold at stores like 
Price Club, and the costs could soar.  I doubt very much that 
this is what was intended by the proposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, I have studied the sections of the Competition Act 
which relate to abuse of dominance and price maintenance. 
Sections 50(1)(c) and 78 on their own, without any amendments, 
are currently drafted in a manner which addresses the concerns of 
the hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge.  Predatory 
pricing, which is defined as selling products at prices 
unreasonably low, having the effect of substantially lessening 
competition, or pricing which is aimed at eliminating or impeding 
the expansion of a competitor is a criminal offence under the act 
as it now stands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, abuse of dominance in situations where substantial 
lessening of competition results is a civil provision.  One of 
the subsections of that provision deals specifically with the 
issue of dominant vertically integrated firms squeezing the 
margin available to non-integrated customers and competing with 
the suppliers for the purpose of impeding or preventing the 
customer's entry into or expansion in the market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since these provisions already respond to the issues raised in 
the proposed amendments, I ask why we need to add redundant 
provisions to an existing law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Competition Act already has a provision which deals 
with coercive pressure to resale a product at a price dictated by 
the supplier.  This provision, known as price maintenance, is 
criminal in nature, allowing for greater use of the provision 
when warranted by the director of the competition bureau and the 
Attorney General of Canada to deal with competitive problems in 
gasoline markets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, on January 26, 1996, Mr. Justice David 
Dempsey imposed a fine of $50,000 against Mr. Gas Limited, a 
local Ottawa gasoline retailer, for having influenced upwards, by 
use of a threat, the prices charged by one of its competitors in 
Ottawa, Caltex Petroleum Inc.  Since this prosecution Ottawa has 
become a very competitive gasoline market which last year had the 
lowest average gasoline prices in Ontario.  I give this example 
to show that there is already a very effective provision in the 
Competition Act to deal with gasoline suppliers attempting to 
coerce their competitors with respect to prices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically the competition bureau has undertaken 11 
prosecutions under the price maintenance provision in gasoline 
markets and has been successful in obtaining 9 convictions.  This 
is obviously an effective provision in the Competition Act. 
Canadian business does not need new duplicate regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The price maintenance provision has also been used successfully 
in literally hundreds of prosecutions.  The business community, 
in general, knows its content and what conduct is expected of 
them to stay within the law.  A new, similar provision to price 
maintenance, which one of these amendments contains, only 
complicates the life of business persons and adds no additional 
benefit for the economy, consumers or small gasoline retailers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not here to determine for our citizens what a reasonable 
rate of profit is today.  The market does that.  Economies which 
have tried to establish so-called planned economies have recently 
lived through the utter failure of their efforts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to find solutions that encourage innovation, new and 
efficient entrants, consumer choice, new jobs and economic 
growth.  Let us work together toward that end and not adopt the 
proposals before us today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I would like to again congratulate the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge for his hard work in studying gasoline 
prices.  I am sure he will continue to do good work in that area. 
<P><A NAME="LINK199"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to address a matter that has again and again been 
brought to the attention of the members of this place, a matter 
that seems to have induced public anger as only a few other 
issues have been able to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it would be more appropriate for me to say that I am on 
my feet today as a result of the constant public and media 
attention afforded to this topic.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue to which I refer is the matter of gasoline pricing and 
the factors that affect petroleum price setting in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to lend my personal support to private member's 
Bill C-235 which is currently before us.  On an historical note, 
this is not the first time this particular piece of legislation 
has been placed on the Order Paper.  Bill C-235 was first 
introduced in the 35th Parliament in 1997 as Bill C-238. 
Unfortunately, the bill had not been fully considered when the 
House dissolved for last summer's election.  As a continuation of 
that process, last October the member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge reintroduced the aforementioned 
measures with the hope that we would now have the opportunity to 
fully debate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be inappropriate if I failed to acknowledge the 
tremendous initiative and leadership demonstrated on this matter 
by our colleague, the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge.  Not 
only did this member commit to the establishment of the caucus 
committee on gasoline pricing, he also agreed to act as our 
chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As chair he was guaranteed long and irregular hours, a hectic 
travel schedule and an endless barrage of what was at times a 
hostile media assault.  Without his determination and guidance I 
know that the so-called gas caucus would never have come to 
fruition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-235 would establish a legislative basis for the 
enforcement of industry-wide fair pricing policies.  I submit 
that the proposed measures would go a long way toward improving 
the industry's rapidly emerging anti-competitive atmosphere. 
However, these concrete and long overdue alterations also promise 
to have a profound trickle down effect at the pumps, a result 
that, especially with summer looming, I believe we can all 
applaud. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to promote fair pricing rather than just cheap 
pricing, Bill C-235 clearly establishes regulations for a 
manufacturer who sells a product at the retail level and one who 
sells either directly or through an affiliate while at the same 
time supplying the product to a customer who competes with the 
supplier at the retail level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To simplify it, this bill would give the customer a fair 
opportunity to make a profit similar to that of the supplier, 
hence ending the practice known throughout the industry as 
predatory pricing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, this bill would also establish a policy of 
governance which would label any supplier who attempts to bully 
or coerce a customer in the establishment of retail marketing 
policy as one who has committed an anti-competitive act.  That in 
a nutshell is what this bill aims to resolve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the course of the past several months the Liberal caucus 
committee on gasoline pricing has extensively toured the country. 
During that time we conducted a comprehensive series of public 
hearings.  Further to that, when in Ottawa we devoted a 
considerable portion of our efforts and time to direct 
consultations aimed at providing us with access to a wide 
cross-section of the opinions held by consumers, retailers, 
wholesalers and specialized interest groups. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the formal results of the aforementioned study will 
soon be put forward in a report, at this time I can say that one 
of the most common sentiments expressed to us was a sense of fear 
resulting from the rapidly depleting pool of competition within 
this industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Department of Industry holds the primary responsibility for 
ensuring that the provisions of the Competition Act are enforced. 
Even though the department has in good faith conducted numerous 
investigations into specific case violations of the Competition 
Act, I fear that this would be similar to arming our currently 
active duty military personnel with only black powder muskets. In 
essence, the musket was at one time the most effective tool 
available to the police and military, however, that is no longer 
the case.  It is not that the musket operates any differently 
today than it did 100 years ago, but because the situation around 
us has evolved so dramatically we need to develop new and 
innovative ways to deal with the new and innovative problems we 
are faced with today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This analogy applies to the Competition Act more than most of us 
would care to admit.  The Canadian oil industry looks very 
different today than it did only a few short years ago.  This has 
occurred in part as a result of the aggressive tactics and the 
predatory pricing policies of the industry majors.  The resulting 
instability has placed the smaller independently owned dealers in 
serious jeopardy of becoming a thing of the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might wonder why parliament should concern itself with the 
loss of a private, small and independently owned business.  The 
loss of one outlet, although not preferable, does not impact 
tremendously when viewed in the context of the grand scheme of 
things.  However, when we start experiencing the loss of hundreds 
or even thousands of them, alarm bells should start ringing. 
The industry majors will freely admit that the little guy is 
their best single source of competition, the most 
effective method of keeping them honest.  With that in mind would 
it not stand to reason that each time the market loses an 
independent that safeguard is weakened?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regretful that over the course of the last 20 years a 
disturbing trend has emerged within the industry.  We are losing 
independently owned establishments left, right and centre.  Some 
would argue this is a result of the reduced access to capital or 
any number of other factors that small businesses routinely face. 
I say the banks will not lend money because of the increasing 
risks involved, risks that are skyrocketing because of unfair 
competition within the market. The point is if we do not act 
immediately to rectify the problem, we run the risk of missing 
the boat on this issue. When the independents are gone they will 
be gone forever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My point is very basic.  The Competition Act as it exists today 
is not properly equipped to deal with the complicated issues 
being generated by this sector of our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The oil industry is unlike any other area of commerce.  As such, 
it requires highly specialized rules of governance, rules such as 
those contained in Bill C-235.  Bill C-235 is not a blanket 
solution for all the regulatory problems that face us as 
legislators.  However, it is an important first step.  Later this 
month the committee will be formally releasing a comprehensive 
report that will include a synopsis of the problems that exist 
within the oil industry along with a series of potential 
solutions.  We need to take the initiative and move forward with 
this step now if we are to prove to the public that we are 
committed to resolving this matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recall the gas prices of last summer and how my constituency 
office was flooded with angry calls demanding that I do something 
to deal with the exorbitant and rapidly fluctuating pump price of 
gasoline.  I could unfortunately do little to ease the concerns 
of my constituents as the Competition Act applies only in 
instances where there is collusion.  It is an act that represents 
only a very small part of a much larger problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that time I have taken an active role as a member of the 
committee.  In January I hosted a well attended public 
consultation session in my riding with the gasoline pricing 
committee.  Further to that I have been on my feet in the House 
on several occasions to present constituent petitions asking the 
government to enact legislation that would require the oil 
companies to justify in writing to the Minister of Natural 
Resources the reasons for any substantial fluctuation in the pump 
price per litre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said it before and I will say it again.  If we opt for 
inaction then we opt for a continuation of the unfair, 
anti-competitive and highly unjustifiable pricing policies of 
this country's major oil companies.  That is totally unacceptable 
to me and it is totally unacceptable to the constituents I 
represent. I want to clarify that I am not attempting to paint 
the majors as evil villains.  I want to ensure adequate statutes 
are in place to ensure they are accountable to individuals who 
rely on them and their products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In rural Canada as in many other sectors of this nation, public 
transportation is simply not available.  Services are miles apart 
and therefore personal transportation is a necessity rather than 
a luxury.  We would not stand for unwarranted and unexplained 
vacillation in the price of food, home rental costs, medicine or 
other basic essentials.  Why have we accepted it with gasoline? 
We need to establish accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge each of my colleagues to support Bill C-235.  It is a 
good bill deserving of our support.  I understand that pump 
prices are low right now, as low as they have been in months, but 
that is not the point.  This bill is not demanding bargain 
basement prices.  It is calling for fair prices.  High or low is 
not necessarily the issue.  Often as a result of predatory 
pricing extremely low prices cause the most difficulty for the 
aforementioned independents. Selling at less than the rack price 
allows the majors to undercut their competition, hence 
eliminating any recognizable profit margin.  We are all aware of 
what profit loss means to a business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A continuation of predatory prices is a prime example of short 
term gain for long term pain.  Right now parliament has the 
ability to prevent a looming disaster. If we wait for all the 
competition to be eliminated from the market then what we have 
remaining is an uncontrollable monopoly that has the ability to 
unilaterally dictate the price and availability of one of the 
country's most essential commodities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I reiterate my support and gratitude for the actions taken and 
proposed by the member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
I will be supporting this bill.  I sincerely hope that each of my 
colleagues will be doing likewise.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>FISHERIES 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK202"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Steckle (Huron—Bruce, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak on the long term viability of the Canadian 
freshwater fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am delighted to see that this issue has started to attract 
real political and public attention.  I am also pleased to 
declare that this new focus has started a dialogue between 
stakeholders and government, hence promoting constructive 
criticism of the effectiveness of the program, the public image 
an the spending habits of DFO. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Great Lakes commercial and recreational fisheries are among 
the world's finest.  It is estimated that the Ontario sport 
fishery alone annually contributes over $60 million in GST to the 
federal treasury alone, a figure that does not consider the 
millions of tourist dollars and other economic spinoffs that 
result from the fishing industry. In short, the Great Lakes offer 
Canadians much more than fish. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing committee recently completed a tour of the Great 
Lakes region endeavouring to examine the geographic locations 
that are most dependent on the fishery.  To this end, we invited 
stakeholders to come forward with their ideas and comments.  I 
would describe the trip as productive.  However, what we 
witnessed and what we were told can only be described as 
troubling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>DFO's public image seems to be floating belly up.  Power 
devolution and spending cuts have decimated DFO's Ontario 
operations and as a result we encountered the perception that DFO 
has only a minuscule impact on the daily lives of those involved 
in the industry, an impression that seems to grow with every 
dollar cut from DFO's Ontario budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I regret having to sound alarms.  However, we must take note of 
the emerging trend in Ontario.  I do not advocate casting away 
money.  However, I do believe that strategic investment is needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee recently put forward reports on the failing status 
of the east and west coasts fisheries, fisheries that only a 
short time ago sustained millions.  Those reports outline a bleak 
coastal situation.  If one believes in foreshadowing, then these 
documents could have implications here.  In essence, by opting 
for inaction we opt to continue along a path toward the end of 
this country's freshwater fishery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1492 Columbus wrote that the fish in the Grand Banks were so 
plentiful that they slowed his ships.  What a difference a few 
years can make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be remiss if I failed to congratulate the current 
minister for his actions on this matter.  This minister has taken 
a personal interest in the affairs of DFO in Ontario.  The 
minister recently stated that the government remains committed to 
protecting the inland fisheries resources, particularly of the 
Great Lakes.  To prove his sincerity, shortly thereafter he 
announced an increase to the sea lamprey control budget, a move 
applauded by stakeholders across all Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aforementioned represents a first step.  However, there is 
much yet to do.  The committee will be presenting a report on the 
status of the Canadian freshwater fishery based on information 
provided by individuals and groups that understand the issues 
better than almost anyone here, the frontline stakeholders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently presented a motion in committee calling for the long 
term adequate and priority funding of the sea lamprey control 
program which was adopted unanimously by the committee.  Members, 
including the parliamentary secretary, eagerly await the 
minister's response to this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must work to resolve the many potentially devastating issues 
facing our fishery.  The Great Lakes are a substantial inland 
resources.  With that in mind it is our duty to take a proactive 
leadership role in their management.  By working co-operatively 
with stakeholders, with the U.S. through the international joint 
commission and by consulting the province of Ontario we will 
ensure the sustainability of this resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have lived my entire life only a few miles from Lake Huron. As 
such, I am acutely aware of the pivotal role the lakes play in 
the socioeconomic development of their bordering communities. I 
urge members to realize this fact also.  It is time to fish or 
cut bait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do not have the infrastructure, personnel and funding in 
place to effectively manage the Great Lakes, we must make it 
available.  Failure is not an option.  We must learn from our 
past mistakes and move to ensure that the Great Lakes continue to 
be a valuable asset to the people and to the economy of central 
Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I recognize the 
hard work of the member for Huron—Bruce on both the fisheries 
committee and on his trying to achieve and arguing for funding 
for the sea lamprey program in the lakes.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For members who may not be aware of this issue, sea lampreys are 
parasitic eel like fish that as adults attach themselves to other 
fish species and feed on their prey's body fluids.  This is why 
they can cause great harm to fisheries resources and why the 
Great Lakes fisheries commission has worked over the years to 
control them.  After spending four to seven years in a larva 
phase a sea lamprey lives one to one and a half years as an 
adult.  It is during the adult phase that sea lampreys cause the 
most harm, killing up to 40 pounds of fish before they return to 
the rivers to spawn and die. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main method used by the Great Lakes fisheries commission to 
control this parasite is to apply a lampricide in the rivers 
where the adult animals spawn.  Although toxic to sea lamprey, 
the chemicals used have minimal effects on plants and other 
aquatic organisms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans announced on April 1 of 
this year, the federal government has renewed its support for the 
Great Lakes fisheries commission.  The federal government will 
contribute $6 million in fiscal year 1998-99 to continue the sea 
lamprey control program, an increase of over 14% over the last 
year.  The Department of Fisheries and Oceans commitment to sea 
lamprey control is also not limited to funding for the Great 
Lakes fisheries commission.  In addition to direct support for 
control of the parasite, the department carries out freshwater 
science programs that provide indirect support to the commission. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member would like a long term commitment with respect 
to funding for a sea lamprey control program in the Great Lakes. 
I am sure he would—

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK205"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska—Rivière-du-Loup—Témiscouata—Les Basques, 
BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am delighted to rise this evening on this 
adjournment motion to ask the government for additional 
information on the entire question of unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois has decided to make this week in parliament 
employment insurance week.  We have poured our energies into 
drawing the government's attention to the experiences of the 
unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we have succeeded.  We have pointed out totally 
unacceptable situations, such as the fact that only 41% of those 
unemployed are receiving benefits.  Even worse, only 26% of 
young people paying premiums actually end up receiving benefits. 
This is totally unacceptable.  And the government has not 
denied it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only reason offered by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development is that employment insurance requirements were 
tightened to keep students in school.  I consider this an insult 
to our young people who have finished their studies and are 
entering the labour market.  Is the minister unaware of what 
these people do as a job?  When they enter the labour market 
they find precarious jobs, short term contracts for a few weeks 
or a few months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the first year they have to work 910 hours to be entitled to 
employment insurance, that is 26 weeks of 35 hours each.  If it 
were possible, it would be 62 weeks of 15 hours, but there is no 
such thing as a 62 week year.  There are only 52 weeks in a 
year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the end, with the new criteria, young people are 
systematically excluded, and three out of four unemployed young 
people do not receive benefits.  That is totally unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The week was encouraging because employment insurance and what 
the unemployed are going through drew public attention and 
because the Bloc hung on and made its point and got public 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sad part is that the minister talks about concentrating on 
active measures.  They are important, but the federal government 
has delegated them to the provinces to a large extent under 
manpower agreements. 
However, the federal government has not delegated what it calls 
passive measures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Making sure someone has a decent income between jobs is not what 
I would call a passive measure. I think this kind of measure is 
essential to ensure that an unemployed person has a decent 
income and is able to meet his or her daily financial 
obligations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Employment insurance is also an active measure because it keeps 
people off the welfare roles. It is a known fact that, when 
people are forced to rely on welfare, when they receive welfare 
benefits over an extended period of time, it is much more 
difficult for them to re-enter the labour force. They lose touch 
with the existing networks. They are no longer used to compete 
for jobs. These are difficult situations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program prevents people from having to 
rely on welfare. It is not a gift. Employment insurance is an 
acceptable social safety net that allows people to stay in the 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time, there was an agreement in Canada whereby 
resource based regions, such as the maritimes and certain parts 
of Quebec, would develop our natural resources in areas such as 
agriculture, forestry and tourism. On the other hand—and I will 
conclude my remarks on that note—central regions would have 
year round jobs. This agreement was broken by the employment 
insurance reform— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B> I am sorry to interrupt the 
member but his time has expired. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK206"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, in reply to my hon. 
colleague I would simply like to repeat what was told to him a 
short time ago.  It is something which I think the hon. member 
understands very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since March 1997 social assistance caseloads have declined in 
the provinces throughout Canada.  The most recent figures from 
the Government of Quebec show that 436,200 households were on 
social assistance, which is the lowest number of cases since 
January 1993. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some EI recipients eventually turn to social assistance, but a 
proportion of social assistance recipients have always been 
persons who either did not qualify for EI under the old rules or 
have exhausted their EI benefits.  The vast majority of EI 
claimants, however, do not exhaust their benefits.  They find 
other employment within 40 weeks of becoming unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was told to the hon. member just on Monday, the government's 
employment insurance reform included bold new measures to help 
modernize the system and to better help Canadians to find and 
keep a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, we chose to invest more funds in active measures such as 
wage subsidies or self-employment assistance to help Canadians 
return to work as quickly as possible.  These measures have a 
proven track record in helping people find jobs and get back to 
work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have broadened the eligibility for these measures so 
that all Canadians who received EI or UI in the last three years 
can now benefit from these active measures as can people who 
collect maternity or paternal benefits during the last five years 
and then withdrew from the labour force to care for their child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are very important measures that I am sure the hon. member 
will appreciate.  We have actively engaged the problem of 
unemployment, especially youth employment, and we are succeeding 
in the battle.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>NUCLEAR WASTE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Waterloo—Wellington, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, the people in my riding of Waterloo—Wellington and 
Canadians all across Canada are very concerned about our 
environment and what we as a society and as a country are doing 
to our environment both good and bad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People know and understand that we need to do everything 
possible to protect and preserve our environment.  People know 
and understand that we must not make decisions which will have 
harmful effects on our environment.  People also know and 
understand that we need to pass on a clean and safe environment 
to future generations of Canadians.  We owe this to our children 
and to our children's children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The disposal of nuclear waste is a concern which is important to 
all Canadians.  There is more than 1.2 million bundles of spent 
fuel, nearly 30,000 tonnes, in temporary above-ground storage at 
nuclear facilities across Canada.  A lot of work has gone on to 
find a solution regarding proper and safe disposal of this kind 
of material. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remind the House that the Atomic Energy Board of Canada Ltd. 
supported by Ontario Hydro has spent a considerable amount of 
time and resources on research to prove that creating enormous 
vaults inside the granite of the Canadian Shield is the best and 
safest method of disposal of nuclear waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Atomic Energy of Canada Ltd. research showed that technology 
behind the proposed burial was safe.  However Canadians remain 
sceptical and are not convinced that the solution was absolutely 
foolproof.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly a Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency panel 
decided it could not endorse disposal of nuclear waste in this 
manner.  The panel is quoted as saying “While the safety of the 
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited concept has been adequately 
demonstrated from a technical perspective, from a social 
perspective it has not”. In addition the panel said “the Atomic 
Energy of Canada Limited concept in its current form for deep 
geologic disposal does not have broad public support and does not 
have the required level of acceptability to be adopted as 
Canada's approach for managing nuclear fuel waste”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a federal government we need to make a decision on how to 
provide long term management of nuclear waste.  It is important 
that we do so knowing that nuclear waste can remain harmful to 
the environment and health for up to 500 years and radioactive 
for as long as 10,000 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the parliamentary secretary is straightforward. 
What does the government plan to do to dispose of nuclear waste 
in Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Byrne (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Natural Resources, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank the hon. member for Waterloo—Wellington for a very 
important and pertinent question. The member has raised the 
question on the floor of the House of Commons on several 
occasions.  He has also met with the Minister of Natural 
Resources to discuss the matter in person. I think the House 
should show its appreciation and respect for the hon. member's 
very diligent interventions on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be quite clear that the present practice of storing 
nuclear fuel waste at the reactor sites throughout Canada is done 
in a very safe, efficient and responsible manner.  However the 
Government of Canada wants to be more sure that we have an 
appropriate long term solution for the waste that is created in 
our Atomic Energy of Canada Limited facilities as well as 
facilities throughout Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to develop the concept of deep geological disposal 
of nuclear waste in the granite rock of the Canadian Shield. This 
was a proposal which was investigated under a public review of 
this concept which was initiated in 1998 under the federal 
environmental assessment and review guidelines order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An eight member Canadian environmental assessment panel chaired 
by Mr. Blair Seaborn held public hearings in five provinces which 
have a nuclear interest. On March 13, 1998 the Seaborn panel 
released its recommendations to the government regarding the 
safety and acceptability of the AECL concept. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Seaborn panel report found that from a technical 
perspective, safety of the geological disposal concept had been 
adequately demonstrated from the conceptual stage of development. 
However the disposal concept in its current form did not enjoy 
broad public support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The panel recommended that a nuclear waste management agency be 
established quickly. The panel also recommended that the first 
steps for such an agency would be to deal with the stated lack of 
broad public support necessary to ensure the acceptability— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  I am afraid the time 
has expired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion to adjourn the House is now deemed to have been 
adopted. Accordingly, this House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
