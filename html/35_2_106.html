UNITED NATIONS PEACEKEEPING ACT</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.)</B> moved that 
Bill C-300, an act respecting the establishment and award of a 
Canadian volunteer service medal and clasp for United Nations 
peacekeeping to Canadians serving with a United Nations 
peacekeeping force, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, I know you are always well prepared and 
orderly, but I would just like to point out that one month from today 
will be Christmas, in case you had forgotten, sir.
<P>
	I speak to this bill with a fair amount of trepidation because I 
know the track record of private members' bills in the House of 
Commons. All members become very enthusiastic and tied up with 
their bills but I feel very strongly that this bill is well worthy of 
consideration and hopefully of passing this House and the other 
place.
<P>
	Bill C-300 is an act respecting the establishment and award of a 
Canadian volunteer service medal and clasp for UN peacekeeping 
to Canadians having served with a United Nations peacekeeping 
force. The Canadian volunteer service medal for peacekeeping will 
be awarded to any Canadian, whether they be military, Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police or civilian, who qualifies as a result of 
United Nations peacekeeping activity. A clasp, to be worn on the 
medal ribbon, awarded to those who served prior to September 
1988, will represent the honour they brought to Canada as 
recipients of the Nobel peace prize awarded to Canadian 
peacekeepers at that time.
<P>
	Most of us think of peacekeeping in respect of Canadians 
starting with the Suez United Nations emergency force mission in 
1956. However, Canadian peacekeeping actually started in 1949 
with UNMOGIP, the United Nations military observer group in 
India and  Pakistan which operated until 1979. In fact our first 
peacekeeping casualty was Brigadier H.H. Angle, DSO ED, of 
UNMOGIP who was killed on July 17, 1950.
<P>
	The next Canadian peacekeeping commitment was UNCMAC, 
the United Nations command military armistice commission for 
Korea, which commenced in 1953 and is still in being today. 
Between 1953 and 1956, 43 Canadians lost their lives with 
UNCMAC.
<P>
	In 1954 Canadian peacekeepers were committed to UNTSO, the 
United Nations truce supervision organization for Egypt, Israel, 
Jordan, Lebanon and Syria which is still operating today. This 
mission has suffered two killed, the first in 1958 and the second in 
1985.
<P>
	Also in 1954 Canadians became involved in the ICSC, the 
international commission for supervision and control in 
Indo-China until 1974. This mission cost five Canadian lives 
between 1954 and 1965. Three of those lives lost were foreign 
service officers from the Department of External Affairs. The 
remaining two were Canadian forces servicemen.
<P>
	Then in 1956 came the Suez crisis and UNEF, the United Nations 
emergency force which operated from 1956 until 1967 and cost 31 
Canadian lives.
<P>
	I do not intend to take members through each of the 
peacekeeping missions we have participated in, but from the Congo 
to Cyprus, the Middle East, Bosnia, Haiti and now Rwanda-Zaire, 
they did and do go on and on.
<P>
	In all, to date 150 Canadians have died as a result of 
peacekeeping missions. If there is discrepancy in this number from 
the 102 officially recognized by the Canadian government, my 
figure comes from the Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans 
Association which includes those peacekeepers who were 
committed with UNCMAC, the United Nations military command 
armistice commission for Korea, and those who have committed 
suicide while on a mission or following a mission. Thus this figure 
represents the people who died either as a result of the mission or 
on the mission.
<P>
	The only specific further example I want to give is that of the 
nine Canadians who died when their aircraft was shot down in the 
Middle East. On August 9, 1974 Canadian Armed Forces Buffalo 
aircraft No. 115461 on a routine flight to Damascus had left Beirut 
and climbed eastward over the Lebanese highlands. It was being 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6638"> 6638 </A></B>
<P>
tracked by Syrian radar. As it neared the village of Diemas, 
someone in the surface to air missile site there decided to terminate 
its progress. Several surface to air missiles were launched, at least 
one being on target.
<P>
	The Buffalo, commanded by Captain Gary Foster, was blown out 
of the sky. Nine Canadians lost their lives in this bizarre incident. 
Although it was investigated by the United Nations, the Canadian 
forces and the Syrians, no satisfactory public explanation of the 
tragedy was ever released. The Syrians claimed that it had been 
accident, that the Buffalo had shown up as an Israeli aircraft on an 
attack mission in the area and had been mistakenly identified as an 
enemy fighter. The outcome was nine Canadians were killed.
<P>
<B>(1110)</B>
<P>
	Because August 9 was the day on which the largest number of 
peacekeepers have been killed, the Canadian Peacekeepers 
Veterans Association has designated that day as Canadian 
Peacekeeping Veterans Day. This is officially recognized by British 
Columbia. In 1995 it was also proclaimed by Manitoba, Nova 
Scotia, New Brunswick and Alberta.
<P>
	Peacekeepers voluntarily place themselves in danger. They 
endure uncomfortable conditions and long repeated separations 
from family and loved ones. They are exposed to horrors of human 
atrocities, degradation, inhumanity and suffering. They accept 
tremendous stress and live with the lasting impact these memories 
cannot help but impose. In so doing they have brought and continue 
to bring great honour to Canada.
<P>
	And how does Canada recognize them? The United Nations 
medals, which are awarded to qualified participants in UN 
peacekeeping activities, at some time after they are awarded are 
accepted into the Canadian honours system. The second 
recognition they have is the dramatic and effective peacekeeping 
memorial on Sussex Drive which was unveiled on October 8, 1992.
<P>
	How do other nations recognize their peacekeepers? Belgium, 
The Netherlands, Ireland, Ghana, Poland and the United States not 
only accept the UN medals but also award a national medal. 
Sweden and Finland are at this time in the process of establishing a 
national peacekeeping medal and Australia and New Zealand are 
considering likewise.
<P>
	In 1942 Canadian commander General Guy Simmons wrote to 
his commander saying: ``The final criterion of a good or bad award 
is the reaction of the troops. If the troops feel it is a good award, it 
is a good award. If awards are criticized by the troops, they are bad 
awards. Before forwarding any recommendation, at each level the 
commander should ask himself the question: Would the frontline 
soldier, if he knew the facts, consider this well deserved?''
<P>
	I did not dream this bill up on my own. It results from a 
tremendous amount of input from present and former peacekeepers 
as well as other Canadians from across our country. Bill C-300 has 
been formally endorsed by the  Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans 
Association, by the Canadian Association of Veterans in UN 
Peacekeeping and by the Air Force Association of Canada.
<P>
	The Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans Association has received 
letters of support from: the municipality of Annapolis County, 
Nova Scotia; the city of Kingston; British Columbia Premier Glen 
Clark; former member of Parliament and Prince Edward Island 
Premier Catherine Callbeck; our Speaker; the Deputy Prime 
Minister; the chief government whip; the Minister of Public Works 
and Government Services; the member for Hamilton West; the 
member for Regina-Qu'Appelle; the member for Ottawa Centre; 
the member for Notre-Dame-de-Grâce; the member for Winnipeg 
Transcona; the member for Shefford; the member for 
Hillsborough; and many more.
<P>
	In the 34th parliament two members proposed similar bills but 
unfortunately they were not lucky in the draw. Therefore those bills 
never came to the floor of the House of Commons. In 1993 the 
Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans Affairs 
recommended the award of a Canadian volunteer service medal for 
peacekeeping but unfortunately Parliament was dissolved before 
that could be acted on and put into place. In addition, I personally 
have presented petitions from thousands of people from across 
Canada in support of a Canadian volunteer service medal for 
peacekeeping.
<P>
	It is the perception of these people that the present Canadian 
recognition of peacekeepers is inadequate. I support that 
perception.
<P>
	Our chancellery and the Canadian honours system accept United 
Nations peacekeeping medals as Canadian. They claim that only 
one honour can be won for any specific act or service, that new 
honours cannot duplicate existing honours.
<P>
<B>(1115)</B>
<P>
	Canadians want to maintain respect for our medals. We do not 
want to denigrate them or have medals considered as bobbles that 
are issued on a whim. It is vitally important that people recognize 
they are awarded only for true merit and good service.
<P>
	Many of Canada's military traditions originate with the United 
Kingdom, and the British are often seen as the military example for 
Canada's forces to follow. But the British are far more generous 
with their medals and awards than are Canadians. For example, the 
Royal Air Force Red Arrows aerobatic team leaders quite regularly 
receive an air force cross at the completion of each successful tour 
of duty.
<P>
	On the other hand, only one air force cross has been awarded to a 
Canadian since the second world war. This occurred for a young 
Sabre pilot on a low level mission when he was in collision with a 
hawk. The hawk struck the aircraft at the juncture of the 
windscreen and the canopy. It took out the entire left side of the 
canopy. As a result, the plexiglas from the canopy hit the pilot in 
the  face. It blinded him in his left eye and caused severe contusions 
which led to a lot of blood. In order to see from his good right eye 
he had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6639"> 6639 </A></B>
<P>
to turn his head sideways to the left so the blood would be blown 
away from that eye.
<P>
	Fortunately his number two was able to lead him back to the base 
at Baden-Soellingen. His landing was so good that the fire truck 
and ambulance drivers who had been sent to receive him thought 
there was no problem and they started to withdraw. At the end of 
the runway on his rollout he collapsed from loss of blood. The 
emergency vehicles were quickly recalled and he was extracted 
from the aircraft. No one would argue that flying officer Burrows 
deserved the air force cross which he was awarded in this instance.
<P>
	On the other hand, there is an additional precedent to override 
the government concept that was set when the Canadian volunteer 
service medal for Korea was initiated by parliamentarians, 
approved in June 1991, and granted royal assent on July 10, 1991.
<P>
	There is yet another precedent for additional Korean honours. A 
United Nations medal for peacekeeping had been awarded although 
it could not really be considered a peacekeeping mission. It was 
called a police action but was in fact a full blown war. Another 
Canadian medal, which shared a common ribbon with our 
Commonwealth partners of Great Britain, Australia and New 
Zealand, was also awarded. There were in total three medals 
awarded for the Korean action.
<P>
	While Government House can no longer claim that only one 
honour can be awarded for an action, it has thus far been unwilling 
to consider submissions that recommend a Canadian volunteer 
service medal for peacekeeping and the clasp which would 
recognize the honour brought to Canada with the award of the 
Nobel peace prize to our peacekeepers in that year.
<P>
	Moreover, I contend that in any case this is not a duplicate 
honour. A Canadian volunteer service medal for peacekeeping and 
the clasp to represent the Nobel peace prize award would represent 
the first and only Canadian recognition of the death, danger, horror, 
deprivation, extended and repeated separation from family and 
loved ones that our peacekeepers endure.
<P>
	I will compare the service of our peacekeeping forces in the 
former Yugoslavia with those of the second world war. As the 
House is aware, the D-Day invasion took place on June 6, 1944. 
Victory in Europe was declared on May 8, 1945. The invasion of 
Sicily was on August 10, 1943 and our troops in Italy continued to 
fight throughout the war. Our people served for 11 months during 
the European invasions on the mainlands of Germany and France 
before victory was declared. For the Italian campaigners it was 
about 19 months.
<P>
	During the service in Yugoslavia some of our peacekeepers did 
three or four six-month tours. I  understand one soldier did five 
tours there. That would mean that they were at least as long in a 
combat theatre as those who served during the second world war. It 
seems to me this fact should be recognized. Thus I think the 
Canadian volunteer service medal for peacekeeping would be the 
first and only recognition of the honour and esteem our 
peacekeepers have gained for Canada.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	What we are talking about here are a couple of pieces of metal 
and some cloth. It is the significance of these pieces of metal and 
that cloth that really matters. What it says to those to whom they 
are awarded is that Canada recognizes the honour they have 
brought to our country and that Canadians recognize that our 
peacekeepers have voluntarily placed themselves in danger and 
have accepted uncomfortable and sometimes horrid conditions, 
along with repeated, extended separations from their families and 
loved ones.
<P>
	This medal, this ribbon and this clasp will say that what our 
peacekeepers are and what they have done is respected and 
appreciated by Canada and their fellow citizens. It will say: 
``Thank you. We are proud of you and you have every right to be 
proud of yourself''.
<P>
	The peacekeeping memorial on Sussex Drive here in Ottawa is 
dramatic, effective and very much appreciated by our 
peacekeepers. However, many Canadians, indeed many 
peacekeepers, will never visit Ottawa and thus will never see it. 
Besides that, the memorial does not provide the individual 
recognition to be worn personally by those who won that honour.
<P>
	I hope that the members of the 35th Parliament will take 
advantage of this opportunity to award this long overdue 
recognition to our Canadian peacekeepers.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernie Collins (Souris-Moose Mountain, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise this morning to speak to Bill C-300, 
standing in the name of the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf 
Islands. The bill before us is being presented for the most laudable 
of reasons, to recognize the men and women of our country who 
have served with distinction in many peacekeeping missions.
<P>
	I am glad to have this opportunity to pay tribute to the thousands 
of Canadians who have served wherever their country has sent 
them. The medals they have received represent our small attempt to 
tell them how much their service has meant to all of us. Without 
them we would be much diminished.
<P>
	It is impossible to determine exactly how many Canadians have 
received medals. In the first world war over 427,000 Canadian 
military personnel were eligible for one or more medals. During 
the second world war some 700,000 were eligible to receive one or 
more medals. More than 25,000 Canadians served during the 
Korean war. To date, almost 100,000 Canadians have earned UN or 
other international medals.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6640"> 6640 </A></B>
<P>
	In addition to the military, almost 500 UN medals were earned 
by members of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and other 
Canadian police assigned to these UN missions. As well, the UN 
has authorized and Canada has approved the issue of numerals on 
UN medals to note subsequent tours in a mission for which a 
medal has already been earned.
<P>
	At the present time the UN has awarded service medals to 
personnel who served with some 30 UN missions. These medals 
are accepted for wear by Canada.
<P>
	It is somewhat unfortunate, and likely only an oversight, that the 
bill before us refers only to UN veterans. There have also been five 
non-UN missions where Canadian peacekeepers played a 
significant role. I am sure the hon. member would not wish to 
exclude these worthy Canadians. It is in the interests of improving 
the discussion that I raise the issue here.
<P>
	These five missions, two in Indo-China, one in the Sinai and two 
in the former Yugoslavia, each had a specific medal associated with 
it. These medals, like those of the UN, were also accepted for wear 
by Canada, and over 5,500 of these medals were earned by 
Canadians, including 52 members of the then department of 
external affairs who participated in the second mission in 
Indo-China.
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	A special medal was struck and issued for those Canadian 
personnel who took part in the gulf war in 1991. Just under 4,500 
were awarded.
<P>
	For those missions which were not recognized by a specific 
medal, the Canadian special service medal with peace-paix bar is 
available to anyone who has served on such a mission for 180 days 
or more. This medal, authorized in 1984, issued for the first time in 
1990, is never issued without a bar.
<P>
	Almost 65,000 Canadian military personnel, retired and serving, 
have been awarded this medal for one or more bars for special 
service with NATO, Alert, Pakistan and for humanitarian issues.
<P>
	The peace-paix bar has been awarded to just over 1,000 
personnel where the U.N. has not issued a specific medal for a 
mission. I am sure the Chair will recall the debate that took place in 
this Chamber some two and a half years ago around the motion of 
the member for Winnipeg-Transcona concerning his proposal for 
a medal for the veterans of the Dieppe raid.
<P>
	While the original motion was amended, some interesting 
thoughts were developed during the debate and I can recommend it 
to my hon. colleagues for their information.
<P>
	There was much goodwill displayed on the part of many during 
the debate and many participants went away, I believe, with a new 
determination to seek a solution. One was found, one which I know 
was  welcomed by the valiant men who were a part of that historic 
battle and by their survivors.
<P>
	On July 14, 1994 the Secretary of State for Veterans announced 
on behalf of the Government of Canada the awarding of a 
distinctive decoration for Canadians who participated in the August 
19, 1942 raid on Dieppe, France. The silver bar to be attached to the 
ribbon of the Canadian volunteer service medal was designed 
featuring the word Dieppe in raised letters on a pebbled 
background. Above this the bar bears an anchor surmounted by an 
eagle and a Thompson sub-machine gun.
<P>
	The design was created in consultation with Dieppe veterans and 
the Prisoners of War Association and was produced by the Royal 
Canadian Mint. Members will know the decoration was a long 
awaited, special recognition for a very special group of veterans 
who had waited 50 years for this honour.
<P>
	I hasten to add that I do not raise the Dieppe decoration as a 
reason not to award a special recognition to those who have served 
us with distinction in many peacekeeping missions since then. I do 
raise it to suggest that there are alternatives to the separate medals 
proposed by the member opposite.
<P>
	As I understand it, approximately 80,000 to 90,000 Canadians 
would be eligible for a medal such as that proposed by the private 
member's bill. I realize that the number is significantly higher than 
that mentioned by my colleague opposite and I can only say that we 
need to get our experts together so that we can give a very 
definitive answer.
<P>
	This number is a very important reason to consider such a bill 
favourable and equally a very important reason why we have to be 
sure that it is right the first time.
<P>
	I also want to take a moment to comment on the announcement 
on November 13 by the Minister of National Defence that the 
Government of Canada will seek approval from Her Majesty the 
Queen for a medal for service in Somalia.
<P>
	In December 1992, almost 1,400 Canadian forces drawn from 
both the regular and reserve forces were deployed to Somalia under 
United Nations resolution 794.
<P>
	As a chapter 7 mission, it is appropriate that a separate Canadian 
medal be awarded. During this mission Canadian forces members 
restored order, ensured that convoys of badly needed food and 
medical supplies reached people in desperate need and assisted in 
rebuilding war ravaged communities in Somalia. Now that the 
government has given its approval to proceed with the Somalia 
medal, an order in council must be established for this new honour. 
Once the order in council is signed, the Queen's approval will be 
sought through letters patent.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6641"> 6641 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1130)</B>
<P>
	While we can wish that all was speedier and the process faster, it 
may take between six to twelve months before Canadian forces' 
members actually receive their medal. Much attention has been 
paid in recent years to certain tragic events that occurred in that 
theatre. The government is saying by proceeding with this medal 
that it wants to acknowledge the vast majority of courageous and 
self-sacrificing individuals who represented us all with pride and 
honour. I believe that Canadians have wanted us to take this action, 
to speak for them in recognizing those who served.
<P>
	May I say in conclusion that I will listen very carefully to the 
debate on this bill and for the moment urge all members only to 
give it their earnest consideration. Perhaps when next we return to 
this debate we will find we have come a long way toward finding a 
common understanding of how we can achieve this objective.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to have a chance to speak to Bill C-300, the initiative of a 
Reform Party member, which is an act respecting the establishment 
and award of a Canadian Volunteer Service Medal and Clasp for 
United Nations Peacekeeping to Canadians serving with a United 
Nations peacekeeping force.
<P>
	Of course, more and more Canadian soldiers are taking part in 
peacekeeping missions, given the number of major regional 
conflicts throughout the world, particularly in certain areas. Given 
the growing role of the United Nations as well, there are more and 
more interventions of a military or humanitarian nature, aimed at 
securing a lasting peace in regions emerging from a conflict.
<P>
	At this time, nearly 2,000 Canadian peacekeepers-the number 
depending, of course, on how many are sent on the African great 
lakes operation-are located in various parts of the world, or may 
be by the end of this year.
<P>
	This is a substantial figure, representing a substantial 
contribution by Canada to various missions. As well, we have to 
accept that the armed forces, particularly in a country like Canada, 
now play a dual role. In addition to providing civil assistance 
within the country, they participate in these peacekeeping missions 
carried out by the United Nations, or in others which may, while 
under the auspices of the United Nations, be commanded by a 
specific country.
<P>
	I must make it clear immediately that we are in agreement with 
the bill proposed by the hon. Reform member. It might, however, 
be worthwhile to broaden the first point in clause 4 to indicate that 
it is a mission authorized by the United Nations, not necessarily an 
operation under the command of the United Nations.
<P>
	This would cover such cases as the operation in Zaire and 
Rwanda, not in its present form, but as it was initially going to be. 
So in this case, it is not necessarily a mission initiated by the UN 
but rather a mission authorized by the UN under Canadian 
command.
<P>
	So these cases as well should be included if we want to extend 
the scope of this bill, whose purpose is to recognize by means of a 
distinctive medal the contribution of soldiers from Quebec and 
Canada who were involved in this type of mission and, who knows, 
may be in the future as well.
<P>
	There are also people who are not parliamentarians who support 
this bill, one example being the Canadian Peacekeeping Veterans 
Association.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	In 1993, the creation of a similar medal was suggested in a report 
by, I believe, the national defence committee or the foreign affairs 
committee. I would like to read part of this report, which was 
tabled shortly before the election in 1993. Because of the election, 
there was no follow-up.
<P>
	The report said that the government should establish a medal for 
volunteer service in peacekeeping operations, to be awarded to 
members of the military and non-military employees-I will get 
back to this-who are on UN peacekeeping missions. This was in a 
report by the Standing Committee on National Defence and 
Veterans Affairs, dated June 1993.
<P>
	The bill also recognizes the contribution of those who take part 
in these missions without necessarily being members of the 
military. In certain cases, these people are sent on peacekeeping 
missions. They would also be entitled to the medal. So it would be 
more than just recognizing the contribution of the military.
<P>
	At the present time, there is a UN medal, but none offered by the 
Canadian government. Other countries do have their own awards. 
The bill makes it possible for the Canadian authorities to give 
special recognition to those who volunteer for such service, 
whether they are members of the military or other people involved 
in these operations who served on peacekeeping missions. There 
have been many instances of members of police forces or the 
RCMP who were sent on such missions. Some people may be 
involved in the delivery of medical assistance and other services. 
There are also others who make a significant contribution.
<P>
	I would also like to mention something our constituents often 
ask us, and it is whether this kind of assistance, these operations in 
which Canada is involved are not too costly. Considering our 
relative wealth, we have a duty to contribute to restoring peace. We 
have everything to gain by bringing a more lasting peace to all 
parts of the world, a world that is rapidly shrinking as a result of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6642"> 6642 </A></B>
<P>
extraordinary development of  communications. I think working 
towards a more lasting peace is everybody's business.
<P>
	The United Nations can intervene, co-operate and bring a more 
lasting peace to an area through the presence of peacekeepers. Such 
co-operation is particularly significant when it makes it possible to 
introduce democratic government. I am sure those taking part have 
powerful memories, some of which are no doubt distressing, others 
happy ones.
<P>
	The people in the armed forces have done extraordinary 
humanitarian things. Some operations, particularly in recent years, 
have not been huge successes. The Somalia inquiry has revealed an 
operation that failed on many counts. That said, there is no need to 
exaggerate or generalize the fact that some people may have lacked 
judgment in certain operations.
<P>
	Generally, the behaviour of the vast majority of peacekeepers 
brings honour to us all. Our international reputation, which is very 
important in some respects, enviable even, in certain instances, is 
often thanks to those who represent us abroad. These people are 
from families we know, sometimes from our own family. Here in 
Parliament, there are people who have served in the armed forces. 
All have contributed to a positive image of us as Quebecers and 
Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1140)</B>
<P>
	This then is an act intended to honour people who often make 
significant personal sacrifices during peacekeeping missions. 
Generally these missions last six months. During these six months, 
they live far from their families in conditions that are not always 
easy.
<P>
	They must be extremely careful at all times, because they are in 
zones that most of the time have been in conflict, and so their work 
is extremely delicate. They carry out their mission brilliantly. It is 
indeed a very good idea to want to honour them with a special 
award, and I see no reason why Parliament would not support such 
a bill.
<P>
	The bill also contains provision for a retroactive award in order 
to honour participants in earlier peacekeeping missions. Tracing 
these people may be a lengthy process, but it should be done where 
possible.
<P>
	The bill's aim as regards future missions is certainly readily 
achievable. I have no doubt that it may be done without costing a 
whole lot. It is fair compensation for what these people give and the 
contribution they make.
<P>
	I conclude by saying that initiatives such as this are easy to 
support. I would like to congratulate the member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, for his initiative. He has my support and 
that of my colleagues.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
my pleasure and honour to debate Bill C-300, an act respecting the 
establishment and award of  the Canadian volunteer service medal 
and clasp for United Nations peacekeeping to Canadians serving 
with the United Nations peacekeeping force. The award as 
envisaged by the promoter of the bill does not restrict itself merely 
to those who serve in traditional armed forces capacities but also 
would include people involved in peacekeeping areas such as 
policing, local administration, the delivery of aid, medical 
assistance or even election assistance.
<P>
	I want to speak to this bill because I strongly support it. The bill 
is a well thought out initiative that recognizes the realities of the 
future. We know that the world is changing. We know we are 
entering a new era. Increasingly we see signs that peacekeeping in 
the wider sense, not just the traditional sense, will become a more 
and more important function of our armed forces and many other 
armed forces in the world.
<P>
	We have traditionally focused our recognition and awards on 
traditional combat roles and traditional war theatres. It is time to 
update some of the recognition and awards. Domestically we are 
prepared to have medals and recognition that are more appropriate 
to the future roles that is seen for our armed forces.
<P>
	In speaking in favour of this bill I would like to pay tribute to the 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands very briefly. He has brought 
this bill forward and is one of my colleagues who is retiring at the 
end of this Parliament. I want to pay tribute to him for bringing this 
bill forward. He was a distinguished member of the armed forces 
who has been a great help to us. It has been a pleasure for all of us 
on both sides of the House to have him here. He is closing out his 
career by participating in the ultimate phoney war back and forth 
across the House of Commons and has been willing to act as our 
deputy whip, perhaps also to engage in his last peacekeeping 
assignment.
<P>
	The bill has an interesting history, as other members have 
pointed out. For some time voices have been calling for this kind of 
award.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	In the last Parliament this initiative was supported through the 
introduction of two private members' bills. The House of 
Commons Standing Committee on National Defence and Veterans 
Affairs called for the establishment of a Canadian volunteer service 
medal for United Nations peacekeeping. That committee was made 
up of the Liberal Party, now the present government, the 
Progressive Conservative Party and the New Democratic Party. 
Those were commitments which those parties made in a unanimous 
report. Endorsement for this has come from the Canadian 
Peacekeeping Veterans Association and the Canadian Association 
of the United Nations Peacekeeping Chapter.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6643"> 6643 </A></B>
<P>
	Other countries already have similar awards: Belgium, the 
Netherlands, Ireland, Ghana and, of course, the United States.
<P>
	I could go on to mention the various groups that have pressed for 
this award: many members of the government, all parties, past and 
present, municipalities and petitioners. I will not dwell too much 
on that because I have a limited amount of time and I want to speak 
about other issues.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I have a base in my riding which is being gradually 
relocated to your city. I am sure that is a coincidence on your part. 
However, the base is being relocated. During my time as a member 
of Parliament, having the military in my riding has given me a 
chance to deal with military personnel on a wide range of issues, 
including their experiences with peacekeeping assignments.
<P>
	In my dealings with the military I have always been impressed 
with their commitment to their various engagements, including 
their peacekeeping engagements. In that context I want to express 
my concern about the previous failure to approve this bill. I hope 
that this time the government will approve it.
<P>
	Bill C-258 was a non-votable bill when it was introduced by the 
hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands in the last session. As a 
non-votable bill the official representatives of the ministry spoke 
against it for what I consider to be the flimsiest of reasons. 
Basically the excuse was that Government House has a process for 
this and that process should be followed, that there is a decorations 
committee which has a process and that the United Nations has a 
process and we are partly involved in that process. They were all 
excuses based on these processes.
<P>
	It amazes me how fast the government is to send people into 
conflict and how slow it is to recognize their contributions, whether 
it is in wartime or in peacekeeping missions. Reading over the 
debates from this session and from the last session when we 
debated Bill C-258, one is really struck by the glacial speed at 
which governments make decisions to recognize the contributions 
of our military.
<P>
	Dieppe, Hong Kong, the merchant marine: we are talking about 
coming to terms with the full recognition of some of these 
activities a full 45 to 50 years after the events. In the case of 
Somalia, we have dragged our heels both in recognizing the 
contributions our peacekeepers made and also in finding out 
exactly what happened during the unfortunate incidents which 
occurred there. Of course, in that process the reputation of 
everyone who served has been tainted.
<P>
	We are tremendously slow in dealing with the real contributions 
that military people make, yet not only are we quick to send them, 
we are quick to mobilize the resources of the state to make sure that 
the contributions  of a handful of people are always recognized. 
The Prime Minister is recognized when he is at the United Nations 
or when he calls the President of the United States. He is getting the 
best publicity for his contribution. Our diplomats are being fully 
recognized. We have had some outstanding generals who have 
played particular roles in these missions. We make sure that they 
receive their full recognition and honour here in the House or at 
Government House or wherever else. However, we have been 
consistently slow in recognizing the real contribution of our 
military people. These people go into these situations, often risking 
their lives. In many cases they are dangerously under-equipped, 
assuming not just the risk of the mission but additional risks 
imposed on them by the general mismanagement of our armed 
forces over the past 20 years.
<P>
<B>(1150)</B>
<P>
	I have always been impressed by the fact that whenever one of 
these missions is called or conceived-somebody's brainchild 
somewhere-at how quickly the military people are to get their 
bags packed, to come out saying publicly from the general right on 
down to the private that they are ready to do, they feel confident 
and they are looking forward to the challenge.
<P>
	Everyone who deals with the military knows that most of the 
time these people know that there are no clear rules of engagement. 
Half the time there is not a clear objective. Almost all the time they 
are grossly under-equipped, grossly undermanned and in great 
danger. Privately they will tell you about these concerns and they 
are always bothered by the fact that these concerns are not taken 
seriously, but they are good soldiers.
<P>
	Good soldiers do not complain publicly, they just do it and this 
should be recognized. It is about time we started to recognize these 
things. I must admit I am very tired of this attitude, this tendency to 
praise people at certain levels and then to not recognize fully the 
people who do the work.
<P>
	We are coming out of an era finally where it seems to be a noble 
thing for Liberal politicians to spend other people's money so they 
could get credit for presumably fixing problems. I am glad we are 
finally starting to come out of that era and to recognize that money 
cannot fix everything and furthermore it is not necessarily the 
government's money to start with.
<P>
	I see this attitude still with us in military operations and military 
policy. Somehow it is noble for the Prime Minister or for the 
government or for others to be willing to put other people's lives at 
risk in order to solve or deal with military and humanitarian 
situations around the world. Let us not forget whose lives are at risk 
and who are making the contributions. It is the men and women on 
the ground and their leaders and commanders. That is on what this 
bill is focused.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6644"> 6644 </A></B>
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that rather than hear once again in 
this debate all about the processes and all about the impediments 
to getting this approved, the protocol and the fact that Government 
House should be first, let us just get on with doing on the basis 
of recognition what we do not hesitate to do whenever the 
telephone rings from New York or from the United Nations. Let 
us recognize our peacekeepers.
<P>
	It about time that the government and the ministry got off their 
duffs and passed this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I compliment the 
member for Saanich-Gulf Islands on his initiative. The member is 
well known to us on this side of the House. He has had a very 
distinguished career as a jet fighter pilot in the Canadian Armed 
Forces. It is a reminder, because of age and other factors, of the 
very few members of Parliament who have served in the armed 
forces and the special contribution that they make. He is, I think, 
for this reason appreciated on matters that go to the core of our 
armed forces.
<P>
	All of us on both sides of the House are concerned about the 
reputation of our armed forces. We have great reason to be proud of 
their contributions in two world wars and their contributions to UN 
operations. It should not be forgotten of course that Canada devised 
UN peacekeeping. It was the idea whose time was right, of our then 
foreign minister, Lester Pearson. He recognized, at a certain point 
in history that when you have combatants who fought themselves 
to a stand still that sometimes a third party, offering grace under 
fire and interposing themselves can allow both sides to retreat 
without intolerable loss of political face.
<P>
<B>(1155 )</B>
<P>
	That was the genius of Mr. Pearson's suggestion for the original 
UN peacekeeping force, for which he won a Nobel prize. It is also 
the result of the characteristics that Canadians represent-I speak 
of our whole country-decency and tolerance of others and 
moderation in action. We are always sought by the United Nations' 
secretary-general when it is a matter of a peacekeeping operation.
<P>
	We should pay tribute to the service given by the Canadian 
Armed Forces as part of various UN missions. It is right to remind 
us, of course, as my hon. colleague from my party said earlier, that 
there have been other UN operations to which Canadian forces 
have contributed and which are not covered by the term UN 
peacekeeping. Therefore, it would be within the spirit if not the 
actual wording of the bill as proposed by the hon. member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands that any new decoration would be extended 
to cover them too.
<P>
	UN peacekeeping, as we know, is limited to operations under 
chapter VI of the United Nations charter. Other operations before 
that time, before Mr. Pearson's  suggestion adopted in 1956 for the 
Suez war and also subsequent operations should also be covered.
<P>
	Part of the difficulty that our armed forces have been meeting is 
due to the confusion, or better still, the blurring of the line of 
demarcation between a chapter VI and a chapter VII operation 
under the charter. People start off with a mandate and a specific 
function but then, operationally, other exigencies emerge and they 
are asked to move from one role to another. It is not really fair for 
the people taking part because peacekeepers, as such, are trained 
for this mission which is 50 per cent to 60 per cent diplomatic and 
perhaps only 30 per cent to 40 per cent military in operation with 
the peacekeepers involved interposing themselves without 
weapons and without the ability to use armed force between 
combatants who have privately agreed to separate if somebody will 
allow them to do so without loss of face.
<P>
	Chapter VII operations involve a totally different style of 
military engagement and they require special troops. I would add 
the further category which some countries have developed, the sort 
of SWAT team operation which sometimes is entrusted to civilian 
police and sometimes to the military. I suppose its apogée was in 
the German venture in Mogadishu a number of years ago which 
liberated hostages held by terrorists in a civilian passenger aircraft 
and achieved it with minimal loss of life or casualties.
<P>
	However, it is unfair to the troops to blur these distinctions even 
if for high reasons of policy it may be necessary to ask them to 
move from one role to the other. A good deal of the problems of 
perception of the operation of our Canadian Armed Forces, 
encountered in recent months, stems from this fact. I think we have 
placed on record our great pride in the achievement of our armed 
forces and a great pride in what they have done in UN 
peacekeeping. Therefore, the suggestion for a medal to recognize 
this is something we all endorse and agree with. It is something we 
can all support.
<P>
	There are some matters and I would simply take the liberty of 
suggesting them to the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands 
because I do not think they are opposed to the spirit of what he is 
suggesting. It is perhaps an error to get too many specifics in a bill 
of this nature: the coloration, the arrangement one might say of a 
medal. These are issues of design which on the whole have been 
handled very well by the Canadian and Commonwealth military. I 
suppose most of the medals we have are from that. I think that is 
probably best left to them.
<P>
<B>(1200 )</B>
<P>
	There could have been more deference given to the role of the 
governor general in the awards. It may not be a function that any 
governor general has sought, but the source of the medals 
historically is from the sovereign, from the king, and the governor 
general vestigially holds this office. In the formulation or 
concretization of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6645"> 6645 </A></B>
<P>
these  proposals the role of the governor general and established 
committees could be recognized.
<P>
	On the main principle, this is a timely gesture. It is something 
Canadians would certainly endorse. I believe medals awarded by 
the UN properly qualify as Canadian medals. Although I do not 
know the exact ruling made by our order of precedence it seems 
they would be entitled to precedence in medal ribbon rows ahead of 
any foreign or other decorations that might be integrated into the 
Canadian system.
<P>
	There may be an issue of duplication of awards should a UN 
medal and a Canadian medal for a UN operation be held 
simultaneously. It is understood that Canadian medals are viewed 
as area medals. With the specific location I do not see any problem 
with duplication.
<P>
	My compliments to the hon. member for Saanich-Gulf Islands 
for a measure that clearly stemmed from the heart in his case. It 
reflects the great pride that all members of the House take in the 
achievements of our armed forces, in the special contributions the 
forces have made since 1956 when Mr. Pearson's idea was adopted 
of UN peacekeeping operations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to talk to the bill. I was a little taken aback by the time 
allocation. How much time would I have?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The member's question is a good one. 
Private Members' Business ends at 11.04 a.m., in about three 
minutes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will see what I can slip in during the 
allotted time.
<P>
	My basic point concerns what the medal is all about. Why should 
there be any medal? We can get down to real basics by asking such 
questions as what training do members of the Canadian Armed 
Forces go through and what does a medal represent in their ethos.
<P>
	The training the members of our military get prepares them to 
give their lives for their country or their unit. This is instilled in 
them throughout their training so that when the time comes they 
will be prepared. A medal is simply recognition of that among 
other things. A medal can be a campaign medal that tells all who 
want to look on its bearer that the individual has had service in a 
foreign land.
<P>
	At the same time it tells those who look at that medal or the 
medal ribbon, its representation, that individual has put it all on the 
line during his training and has said: ``I am prepared to give my life 
for my country or my unit, and all I expect in return is the loyalty of 
my fellows in the field and of my country toward me, the 
representation of which is this medal''.
<P>
	I will say more at a later date. This is a very worthwhile bill for 
this House as an entity to support.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member will have 
approximately seven minutes when the debate resumes next time if 
he wishes to use it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The hour provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped to the bottom of 
the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I have notice of a point of order from the hon. member for St. 
Albert before I recognize anyone on the government side.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="BILLC-63">BILL C-63</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a 
point of order with respect to the notice of time allocation for Bill 
C-63 given on Friday, November 22, 1996, pursuant to Standing 
Order 78(3)(a). This standing order states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A Minister of the Crown who from his or her place in the House, at the previous 
sitting, has stated that an agreement could not reached under the provisions of 
sections (1) or (2) of this Standing Order-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	It continues. I checked <I>Hansard</I>, and on page 6628 of Friday, 
November 22, 1996 the minister said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, while there are continuing discussions on a number of issues, out of 
an abundance of caution I wish to inform the House that an agreement could not be 
reached under the provisions of Standing Orders 78(1) or 78(2) with respect to the 
report stage and the third reading stage of Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act and the Referendum Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, if you review <I>Hansard</I> you will note that I 
immediately stood on a point of order and objected because the 
deputy House leader for the government and I were sitting talking 
about that particular issue at that very time. To emphasize my 
point, the government has resumed negotiations on its own 
initiative this very morning.
<P>
	On Wednesday, November 20, 1996, I rose on a point of order to 
complain that documents regarding the royal commission on 
aboriginal affairs were not going to be made available to members. 
The government whip stood up and challenged my point of order, 
claiming it was ``speculation at this time''.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6646"> 6646 </A></B>
<P>
	The Deputy Speaker agreed and this point was well taken and 
applies to this situation as well. One cannot give notice of a 
hypothetical fact based on speculation. Procedurally, pursuant to 
Standing Order 78, there is either an agreement or there is not. If 
the intent of the standing order was to allow for a condition, it 
would say  ``in the event of no agreement''. But that would be 
another matter.
<P>
	There was a similar challenge to time allocation notice in August 
1988 by the member for Windsor West. The Speaker ruled on 
August 16, 1988, page 18381 of <I>Hansard</I>:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Standing Order 117 provides for a minister to act if there is no agreement and, as I 
stated on June 6, 1988, the Chair must take a minister's declaration at face value.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister's declaration in 1988 was simple: ``An agreement 
could not be reached''. The minister's declaration from Friday, 
November 22, 1996 does not meet that standard because the 
minister stated on record that he has given notice just in case he 
cannot reach an agreement.
<P>
	The standing orders do not allow for a conditional notice. The 
proper procedure for notice for the purpose of being cautious is a 
procedure set out in Standing Order 57 regarding closure. Standing 
Order 57 is not concerned with consultation nor is it concerned 
with agreement that might be made, can be made or should be 
made.
<P>
	The minister cannot cut corners and take shortcuts by giving an 
ambiguous notice under the provisions of Standing Order 78(3). If 
we allow this notice to stand, then a minister could give notice for 
every bill based on an anticipated or hypothetical situation. No 
longer will consultation be necessary because notice would be 
allowed to be given before consultation or any effort to make an 
agreement. The notice given on Friday, November 22, 1996 by the 
Minister of Industry is out of order because the provisions of 
Standing Order 78(3)(a) were not met.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, with 
regard to this point of order, I think it is important for the Chair to 
note that at the time the minister gave the notice there was no 
agreement on time allocation. In fact, it is accurate to say there is 
no agreement now on time allocation. The discussions taking place 
were in relation to the substance and not to the time allocation.
<P>
	I would respectfully submit to the Chair that the notice that was 
given is perfectly in order. The notice is related to the fact that there 
could not be agreement. There is not an agreement now. The 
discussions that have been ongoing, which I acknowledge I have 
been part of, are related to the substance but we still have not 
reached an agreement. There is no agreement.
<P>
<B>(1210)</B>
<P>
	While I accept what my hon. colleague is trying to put forward, 
there is just no agreement. The discussion is on the substance of 
this matter, not on time.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to rebut the comments 
by the deputy House leader of the government.
<P>
	While the negotiations were concerning a substantive 
amendment to the bill, they were in order for us to grant 
concurrence and agreement with the time allocation proposed by 
the government, thus the substantive negotiations. We were quite 
prepared to accept the offer of time allocation by the government 
provided we had agreement on these issues. Therefore they were 
very much part of an ongoing process that still continues at this 
very moment regarding us and the government.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I thank the hon. member for St. Albert 
and the parliamentary secretary to the government House leader.
<P>
	The member for St. Albert quoted from Speaker Fraser's ruling, 
page 18381 in <I>Hansard</I> of August 1988. I would add to his quote 
the second part of that paragraph:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-the Chair must take a Minister's declaration at face value and cannot judge the 
quality of negotiations or of any proposals that may have been made. In this case I 
was not even asked to judge on the quality of the negotiations because there is a 
document that indicates the arrangement at least had been entered into with two of 
the parties in the House, albeit, not that of the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The Speaker, as the member for St. Albert will remember, ruled 
that the notice was in order.
<P>
	There are other judgments which appear to go the same direction 
on the same basis. Speaker Fraser on March 29, 1990-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> On a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> No, there are no further points of order.
<P>
	The Speaker ruled, at page 9917, that he accepts the minister's 
motion as being in order.
<P>
	The Chair regrets that I do not have time to consider the 
precedents and so on and come back with a coherent and hopefully 
cogently worded decision, but on the basis of what I have heard 
today from the member for St. Albert and the parliamentary 
secretary to the government House leader, I am satisfied that the 
notice was proper and that the negotiations have not completed and 
if the minister takes the view that it has not been possible to reach 
an agreement, then the notice is acceptable.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I declare the motion carried.
<P>
	(Motion agreed to.)
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONSIDERATIONRESUMEDOFREPORTSTAGE">CONSIDERATION RESUMED OF REPORT STAGE</A></H4>
	The House resumed from November 22, 1996, consideration of 
Bill C-63, an act to amend the Elections Act and the Referendum 
Act, as reported (with amendments) from the committee, and of the 
motions in Group No. 3.
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
motions in Group No. 3 concerning Bill C-63, an act to amend the 
Elections Act and the Referendum Act, were considered briefly on 
Friday.
<P>
	As agreed, the hon. members for Stormont-Dundas, Calgary 
West and Kootenay East had the opportunity to speak at that time to 
help set the debate in context.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I suggest the debate be adjourned at leisure so we 
have a chance to concentrate on the debate.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Bellechasse has a 
point of order.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Mr. Speaker, until such time as we can have an 
intelligent debate, I suggest the debate be adjourned at leisure.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> My colleagues, could private 
conversations please continue outside the House? I thank the hon. 
member for bringing this matter to my attention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Langlois:</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker, but not for reasserting 
your authority, because it took less than 15 seconds to show that 
you were still in control.
<P>
	We made progress in the debate last Friday, and the motion of 
the hon. member for Beauséjour, which was just agreed to, will 
enable us to proceed much faster, perhaps even too fast for our 
taste. As I indicated on Friday, there is something basically 
reprehensible in rushing through an amendment to the elections 
act. The members who will take a second look at this bill will, of  
course, have to take into account the circumstances of its passage.
<P>
	The substance of the bill may be debated and debatable, but its 
form is essentially out of bounds because, in my opinion, this 
debate has been flawed from the start. I will address this point in 
my remarks at third reading.
<P>
	As for polling stations' hours of operation, last spring, the 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs examined 
various scenarios put forward and explained by Elections Canada 
before the committee.
<P>
	Subsequently, this House passed and referred to the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs a bill proposed by the 
hon. member for Vancouver East and concerning polling hours, 
Bill C-307. I listened carefully to what the hon. member for 
Stormont-Dundas and the hon. member for Calgary West said 
about polling hours. If we look again at Elections Canada's 
scenarios in the official report, we can see that this proposal does 
not fit in with any of the scenarios in question.
<P>
	This is a sui generis proposal that the government came up with 
and was even forced to amend at report stage, because it was not 
given enough thought.
<P>
	Motion No. 21 proposed by the hon. member for Calgary West 
would extend polling hours, particularly in Alberta and British 
Columbia. Allowing polling stations to close at 8 p.m. instead of7 p.m. would protect what can be considered the golden hours, that 
is, the hours during which those who are allowed to vote can do so. 
This is a very important time of the day, a time when election 
organizations get people to come out and vote.
<P>
	Having polling stations close at 7 p.m. in certain regions of the 
country seems to me to be extremely early. On Friday, the hon. 
member for Kootenay East stated his views in a very objective 
fashion on this legislation, which should not be subject to 
partisanship in any case. It is only because of the government's 
haste if the debate has now become a partisan exercise, although 
we, on this side, are trying to remain as objective as possible.
<P>
	The hon. member for Kootenay East said on Friday that the 
problem is essentially a matter of perception, since all votes in 
Canada, whether in St. John's, Newfoundland, or in Langley, 
British Columbia, carry the same weight. This is true. It is also true 
that the feeling of alienation felt by many western Canadians is due 
to the fact that when the media can begin broadcasting the results, 
the outcome is already decided, regardless of how they vote. 
Central Canada, in which 176 ridings will be contested in the next 
election, will probably seal the fate of this whole exercise. The fact 
remains that all votes are equal, but I can understand the perception 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6649"> 6649 </A></B>
<P>
explained by the hon. member for Kootenay East. Therefore, the 
amendment proposed by the hon.  member for Calgary West would 
help improve the situation.
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	However, the member for Calgary West goes a lot further. He 
proposes that section 160 of the Canada Elections Act be amended 
so that the counting of the ballots would start at the same time 
everywhere in Canada. Whether in Newfoundland or in British 
Columbia, the counting of the ballots would begin at the same time, 
which means that people in Newfoundland would have to wait 
about an hour and half before starting to count the votes.
<P>
	In the best of all possible worlds, the proposal by the hon. 
member for Calgary West that the count take place at the same time 
would of course be extremely interesting. If people did not have to 
sleep, eat, go to work the next morning, and so on, having the count 
at the same time would be a definite advantage.
<P>
	However, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds. We 
live in a world where compromises must be made. One such 
compromise could be to adopt Motion No. 21 of the member for 
Calgary West, but drop the other motion calling for an amendment 
to section 160 of the Elections Act, so that the count could take 
place immediately after polling stations officially close in a given 
province. This is what the official opposition will be favouring with 
respect to hours and count.
<P>
	The official opposition presented its own amendment, Motion 
No. 22, asking that the four-hour period voters now have in which 
to vote be maintained. We are essentially proposing that these four 
hours be maintained, by saying: ``employers must ensure that 
eligible employees are allowed at least four hours''. This would be 
better than giving them only three hours.
<P>
	It must be borne in mind that, under the government bill, polling 
stations would close at 7 p.m., Pacific time, and voters would have 
only three consecutive hours in which to vote. The four hours that 
have been traditional in Canadian history for years would disappear 
with this amendment to the Canada Elections Act regarding the 
number of consecutive hours required and allowed.
<P>
	I do not think it is a move in the right direction to shorten the 
period allowed by one hour. It is true that if polling stations in 
central Canada have to close at 9.30 p.m., it becomes academic 
whether three or four hours are allowed. But it is with these two 
extremely important factors in mind, that is, the local time at which 
polling stations close and the effective period of time people have 
in which to vote, that the official opposition has presented Motion 
No. 22, so as to ensure that voters from coast to coast have the 
benefit of four hours.
<P>
	This concludes my remarks on the third group of motions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
do not think anyone really opposes the concept of reducing the 
election period from 47 days to 36 days in principle, although I 
have some specific examples of problems this can create which I 
will get into a little later.
<P>
	With regard to the Group No. 3 motions, I refer first to Motion 
No. 5 proposed by the government which would make it possible 
for the chief electoral officer to extend the voting hours from the 
current 11 hours to 12 hours. We consider that this extension is 
costly and unnecessary and really does not achieve any particular 
purpose. We would suggest that the 11 hours currently laid aside 
for Canadians to vote is adequate. Therefore this motion is not 
required and we will oppose it.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	With regard to the staggered voting hours across the country, as a 
parochial British Columbian representative, I contend that the 
change in the voting hours to close the polls on the west coast or in 
British Columbia at 7 p.m. does not do justice to the British 
Columbian voters and those in the Yukon. A lot of people, because 
of their occupations and their location away from their voting 
stations on voting day, tend to exercise their vote at the end of the 
day. Therefore the rescinding of that last hour from 7 p.m. to 8 p.m. 
would impact dynamically on the vote.
<P>
	In my own constituency it is quite common for 87 per cent or 
more of the voters to come out to vote. I suspect that if this 
particular motion is carried we will see a lower turn out. I do not 
think this is what was intended by the electorate.
<P>
	Alternatives were proposed that would allow for the voting to be 
substantially the same as it is now but that would provide for the 
avoidance of the perception on the west coast, or in the west for 
that matter, that the decisions were already taken and the 
government was chosen and formed before it came to voting at that 
time. No one to my knowledge has been able to assess the impact 
on the western voters of knowledge of what the eastern vote has 
been.
<P>
	Whether people would say that the government has been formed 
and they are going to vote against that government or that the 
government has been formed and they want to vote for that 
government so that there is government representation out there, I 
do not know. However, I suspect that it does have an impact and 
that this should be avoided.
<P>
	My own personal preference would be to have the voting hours 
remain exactly as they are now but to delay the count of the vote 
and have the count occur simultaneously. This might mean starting 
the count of the vote the following day. Understandably this might 
not sit well with the election committees, campaign workers  and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6650"> 6650 </A></B>
<P>
so on because they get all hyped up on the day of the vote and they 
want to know what happened.
<P>
	I submit that the purpose of an election is to select a government. 
It is a very important purpose which should be an overriding 
concern in the election process. Therefore I think it makes eminent 
good sense for the ballots to be taken on one day but to be counted 
simultaneously across the country the following day.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the reduction of the electoral period from 
47 to 36 days with its commensurate saving of money and of the 
campaigning that people perhaps tire of during the actual election 
campaign are pretty good. There is a lot of substantiation for that. 
However we do feel that it would impact negatively on byelections.
<P>
	For instance it is within the power of the government to make a 
byelection happen by virtue of promoting a member of Parliament 
from this House to the other place. The government would thereby 
have an advantage in that it would know when and in which area 
that is going to happen. This would leave the opposition parties and 
the independents scrambling to try to make up for lost time. That 
might not be possible.
<P>
<B>(1315 )</B>
<P>
	I also think that the reduction to a 36-day election period impacts 
rather negatively on geographically large ridings. Obviously there 
is a lot more territory to cover. The residents are dispersed and for 
an individual candidate to get around to visit those areas takes more 
time than in a congested urban area.
<P>
	As an example, there are 14 large northern ridings which would 
be so affected. They include Skeena, B.C., Prince George-Peace 
River, B.C., Peace River, Alberta, Athabasca, Alberta, Churchill 
River, Saskatchewan, Churchill, Saskatchewan, Kenora-Rainy 
River, Ontario, Timmins-James Bay, Ontario, Abitibi, Quebec, 
Manicouagan, Quebec, Labrador, Newfoundland; Yukon, Western 
Arctic and Nunavut. All would be dramatically affected by the 
reduction of the campaign time from 47 to 36 days.
<P>
	Perhaps there is some way to overcome this. However, it is 
important that this be remembered and taken into consideration 
when the election act is being changed.
<P>
	It is vitally important that we also remember that the government 
has rather pushed this thing through. If I was a suspicious 
individual I might think there was subterfuge here, a dateline it 
wanted to meet in order to call an election. But that may not be the 
case.
<P>
	One thing which was not considered and which should have been 
considered in the bill is the idea of a fixed election day. The Prime 
Minister in the Canadian Parliament has a tremendous amount of 
power in that it is his choice when Canadians go to the polls to 
select a new government. He can choose a propitious time for the  
polls, choose a time when people are distracted elsewhere. It gives 
him tremendous power.
<P>
	I think that for the good of the country we should consider and 
perhaps institute a fixed election date. Of course, Reform would 
advocate that these election dates be every four years, on a 
specified date so that there is no doubt in anyone's mind when the 
next election is going to be.
<P>
	I personally found it a little questionable in committee when the 
matter of allowing inmates to vote was raised. Granted, that is not a 
direct concern in this bill, but it was certainly discussed. It is 
unacceptable to me that an individual who has broken the law, been 
convicted and incarcerated that they should still have all the rights 
in elections as a normal, law-abiding citizen. I would think that 
anyone who is incarcerated after being convicted should forgo the 
privilege and the honour of being able to vote until he or she has 
completed that sentence and thereby paid his or her debt to society.
<P>
	We think it should be mandatory that in the case of a byelection 
that the Prime Minister's ability to control the agenda should be 
constrained. We suggest that when byelections are called they 
should take place within six months of a seat being vacated, rather 
than the current time which is pretty well open to the Prime 
Minister. This obviously leaves some constituencies without 
representation in the House while the seat is vacant. That is neither 
right nor appropriate in the democracy in which we live.
<P>
	Another point which is worthy of consideration is that of 
requiring people to prove their identity, either when they register to 
vote or when they actually cast their ballot. The permanent list with 
which the bill is mainly concerned is made up of things like 
drivers' licences, birth certificates and so on. It seems to me that it 
would not be inappropriate for an individual to be required to prove 
to the registrar or to the voting official when he or she goes to vote, 
exactly who he or she is and that he or she has the right to cast a 
ballot to elect the next Government of Canada.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	The truth is that in the present day electronic world in which we 
live there is no way that election results from the east will not get to 
the west, if they have been counted, before the polls in the west 
close. With E-mail and the Internet there is no question that this 
information will be transmitted, either via the United States or 
other countries. Therefore, no matter how carefully we control the 
vote, if the ballots are counted the results are going to be known 
very shortly thereafter.
<P>
	In conclusion, I would say that Reform is not diametrically 
opposed to the concept of a 36-day election campaign as opposed 
to 47, but we do question the wisdom of running a separate 
enumeration, which is very expensive, outside the normal voting 
process. We would  advocate that the next election campaign be the 
normal 47-day period and that the enumeration list compiled for 
the next election comprise the basis for the permanent list with 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6651"> 6651 </A></B>
<P>
which this bill deals. We find the idea of having an enumeration in 
April unnecessary and expensive. It would be better to put it off to 
the normal election call.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Is the House ready for the question?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> On debate?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> On debate? Is it questions or comments?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> There are no questions or comments. The 
question has been called. Had the member who wishes to debate 
been out of the House?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Meredith:</B> Yes, Mr. Speaker, I want to speak.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> We normally extend courtesies to 
members. The question had been called. The hon. member, 
obviously, would like to speak to the issue. Accordingly, the Chair 
will give the hon. member the right to speak.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley, 
Ref.):</B> Thank you, Mr. Speaker. There was a slight bit of confusion. 
I stood when you were calling for debate. You were looking over to 
the side and did not notice me. I appreciate you recognizing me.
<P>
	I would like to speak on behalf of British Columbians and I do 
not necessarily agree with my colleague.
<P>
	This bill proposes to stagger the times that the polling stations 
are open. I do agree with my hon. colleague who just spoke that 
staggered times would not be conducive to the voter in British 
Columbia if the polls are closed at seven o'clock as opposed to 
eight o'clock.
<P>
	Most of the people who live in the constituency of 
Surrey-White Rock-South Langley work in Vancouver. The 
commuting time from Vancouver to Surrey-White Rock-South 
Langley is anywhere from one hour to an hour and a half. Many 
people work in businesses which are open from nine to five. 
However, some people work until 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m. to miss the 
rush hour traffic. They would not have the opportunity to exercise 
their right to vote. It would be terribly unfair to the constituents in 
my riding who commute to Vancouver. Closing the polls an hour 
before the normal time would be an undue hardship to them.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	I know some allowance was made in the bill to change the 
number of hours, but I believe it was to reduce the number of hours 
that an individual could take off from business to make sure they 
were back at their place of residence for voting. On that point I 
would agree with my hon. colleague from Saanich-Gulf Islands. 
However, I do not think the object is to count the votes the next day.  
It is unfair to Canadians to expect them to vote and then wait for 24 
hours before finding out the results of their voting privilege.
<P>
	I do feel that allowances can be made to stagger the hours, keep 
the voting hours in British Columbia with the polls closing at eight, 
but perhaps the votes could be counted at a later date. With modern 
technology in voting where the votes are actually counted at the 
same time as the ballot is deposited, or at least they were in the 
municipal election, there is no reason why the results of those votes 
taken could not be released at a reasonable time in the evening even 
though the polls might close at eight o'clock in British Columbia.
<P>
	Perhaps opening the polls later in the morning in the maritimes 
would not be as a great a hardship to the voters as it would be 
closing the polls earlier in British Columbia.
<P>
	The cost of having an enumeration will be there, whether it is 
done in April or laterally when the election call comes. I think it is 
important to have a permanent voters' list for convenience sake and 
even just for accuracy. This is a very important issue that has to be 
addressed.
<P>
	If the time is taken at enumeration to clarify the people who have 
the right to vote and are duly Canadian citizens is followed through 
on a permanent list, the end result is that people who have a 
legitimate right to vote and who are Canadian citizens and exercise 
their vote would probably clarify a lot of confusion come election 
day across the country.
<P>
	In my riding, election day poses numerous problems because of 
the large number of new immigrants who are coming to the lower 
mainland area. They do not understand that in order to exercise 
their right to vote they must be Canadian citizens.
<P>
	I also believe that having a permanent voters' list will make it 
much easier for new immigrants who do take Canadian citizenship 
to be added to that voters' list in a manner that is efficient and up to 
date. That would certainly solve a lot of the confusion that happens 
when we try to rush through citizenships in order to allow people to 
have the vote. That process is often looked on with a little bit of 
misunderstanding and sometimes suspicion.
<P>
	If we have a permanent voters' list, one that has been updated in 
a routine fashion, those kinds of situations where one brings to 
question why things are being done would not be quite so blatant.
<P>
	The concept of a permanent voters' list is a good one. Staggered 
voting hours are reasonable but the times could be put into effect 
that would respect the needs of the various regions of the country. I 
certainly believe this legislation goes in the right direction but still 
could be improved.

<BLOCKQUOTE>That Bill C-63, in Clause 2, be amended by replacing line 28 on page 2 with the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``polling day in the case of a general election or the forty- seventh day in the case of a

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6653"> 6653 </A></B>
<P>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to rise on Motion No. 6 
which stands in my name. The motion concerns the length of a 
campaign for byelections under the new proposed regime.
<P>
	Let me reiterate what has been said on the length of the election 
period. Our party has indicated that we are prepared to support in 
principle the shortening of an election campaign. I have said that is 
my preference.
<P>
	The proposal in this bill is that we move to a 36 day election 
calendar. That is one of the three main features of Bill C-63. This 
has been a longstanding proposal in that for a number of years there 
has been some pressure from the public and from political parties 
to shorten the election campaign period if possible. In the past, 
technical difficulties in terms of the ability of Elections Canada to 
implement a shortened electoral period have prevented the 
shortening of the period below the current 47 days. Mr. Speaker, 
you may recall in your political life that the campaign was longer 
than 47 days.
<P>
	The Lortie commission heard a lot of submissions on this 
subject. At that time my party was not particularly supportive of 
shortening the campaign period although many who made 
submissions to the commission were. The Lortie commission had 
suggested it was possible to move to a 40 day election campaign.
<P>
<B>(1335 )</B>
<P>
	What is the origin of the 36 day campaign in this bill? It is the 
implementation of the computerized register of electors and the 
ability to implement it prior to the next election by virtue of a 
pre-election enumeration. Thirty-six days in effect is the shortest 
campaign that Elections Canada felt could comfortably be executed 
by the people who run the campaign nationally. It is fair to say that 
this will cause some problems for some parties. It will certainly be 
a new experience for most parties but I suspect that most major 
political parties will be able to adjust.
<P>
	There are some advantages to the new calendar. However even if 
one supports a 36 day election campaign there are other problems 
that are raised by the way it is implemented in this piece of 
legislation. One was addressed by the hon member for 
Saanich-Gulf Islands, the expense of running an initial 
pre-election enumeration to start the register. I will have more to 
say about that later in this debate.
<P>
	The government is going about the implementation of this 
shorter period in a way that in our opinion will actually be much 
more expensive initially than it needs to be. This is a significant 
problem. Another significant problem that we raised repeatedly 
before the bill came to committee and in committee has been the 
problem of the implementation of a shortened election period for 
byelection campaigns. That is what this motion addresses.
<P>
	There have been two kinds of problems with byelections in the 
past. The first is the problem this motion seeks to address and 
which we witnessed in this Parliament. That is the sudden calling 
of a byelection in a riding that was occupied by a sitting member on 
the government side for which there was no expectation  
whatsoever of a vacancy but which occurred overnight and then a 
snap byelection was called to deal with the situation. These have 
always been in ridings that are very favourable to the government. 
In the case of this Parliament they have freed up members and 
freed up ridings to bring in new people and to move other people on 
to greener pastures, be they appointments, Senate seats or 
whatever.
<P>
	There is much to object to in this process. Obviously there is the 
unnecessary expense, the patronage angle and a number of things 
that are quite infuriating about this particular practice. It is fair to 
say that in the case of byelections this does create some 
considerable difficulty for the opposition parties even under the 
present calendar.
<P>
	Last winter byelections were unexpectedly called in safe 
government ridings. They were also called at a time of the year 
when nobody was anticipating campaigning, in the dead of winter 
just at the end of the Christmas period. These situations create 
serious enough organizational problems as it is without moving to a 
36 day campaign.
<P>
	The other problem with byelections is something the Reform 
Party has been concerned about for years. It is the opposite 
problem, that byelections are held off indefinitely and ridings are 
kept open for extremely long periods of time for other reasons. If 
the government thinks it will be defeated in a particular riding it 
does not want to have a byelection and therefore the riding 
unnecessarily goes unrepresented for months and sometimes for 
over a year. In the last Parliament the government deliberately 
called byelections for a date so far into the future that it knew there 
would be a general election before the byelection ever occurred. 
There are snap byelections but this is the opposite problem.
<P>
	The Reform proposal deals only with the problem of a snap 
byelection and deals with it only in the most peripheral way. What 
we propose is simply that the new 36 day campaign period would 
not apply to byelections. Instead the 47 day campaign would 
remain in effect for byelections.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	I should say that our ideal proposal on this particular problem 
would be quite different. Our ideal proposal would give a a 
significant period of time between the occurrence of a vacancy and 
the calling of a byelection on the one hand and on the other hand it 
would set a maximum period of time within which a byelection 
must be called.
<P>
	Frankly the time we have in mind for that would be something in 
the order of 60 days between the occurrence of a vacancy and the 
actual holding of a byelection and no more than six months 
between the occurrence of a vacancy and the holding of a 
byelection at the other end. The minimum period would provide the  
opposition parties with some assurance that a byelection will not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6654"> 6654 </A></B>
<P>
called just to surprise the opposition and return a government 
supporter. The other provides the reasonable expectation that 
voters will be represented in Parliament within a reasonable period 
of time.
<P>
	The reason we have not proposed it in this amendment is that the 
actual calling of a byelection as opposed to the campaign period 
falls under the Parliament of Canada Act rather than the Canada 
Elections Act. That makes it impossible for us to put forward our 
ideal proposal in this particular piece of legislation.
<P>
	It was pointed out during our discussion in committee that 
technically speaking, because it is in the Parliament of Canada Act, 
our ideal proposal falls outside the scope of this legislation. It does 
fall outside the scope of this legislation and the principles of this 
legislation, but it certainly does not fall outside the subject matter 
of the legislation because this bill affects the process for 
byelections in quite an intimate way. However as the legislation is 
drafted, this falls outside its scope.
<P>
	I return to the comment I made on Friday which is that this 
House has not approved this bill in principle. It has only approved 
it for committee study. The bill went to committee. The purpose of 
committee study before second reading is supposed to be to 
examine all aspects of the bill including material that while within 
the subject matter of the bill may fall outside of its scope.
<P>
	I am disappointed that this issue was not addressed during the 
committee hearings. I still hold out some hope that we will 
consider this issue before we complete our deliberations on this bill 
here in the House.
<P>
	I urge the House to support this particular motion which 
improves the bill in a very small way. It does not force a byelection 
to be held. It does not even force a byelection to be delayed. It 
simply says that a byelection campaign should be at least 47 days 
in length. I put that to the House for its consideration.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the hon. member for Calgary West for bringing up the 
important issue of byelections and especially the period within 
which these are supposed to be held.
<P>
	Generally speaking, when we are looking at a byelection, 
especially from the opposition's point of view, we mainly want to 
know when it will be called. The government should not wait too 
long. But the reverse is also true, as the hon. member for Calgary 
West pointed out. The government should not be able to call a snap 
election that catches the opposition parties off guard.
<P>
	We could consider something like a minimum of 90 days after 
the vacancy occurs, up to a maximum of 180 days, in other words, 
between three and six months. Actually, in committee, because of 
the gruelling pace, it  was impossible to discuss this aspect. In fact, 
it was hardly possible to discuss anything at all.
<P>
	We will probably have a second opportunity, as I pointed out 
earlier, to look at all these questions, now that everyone has 
simmered down, and I am referring to voting hours, byelections 
and establishing a register of electors. Since today is Monday, the 
beginning of the week, perhaps I may explain what the debate is 
about, for the benefit of those who were not listening Friday.
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	We are now talking about shortening the electoral period to 36 
days, down from 47. Is anyone opposed to this? Not many people. 
A few members from large ridings object, but a large majority of 
members are in favour.
<P>
	Earlier, we saw that the hon. member for Surrey-White 
Rock-South Langley did not agree with his colleague from 
Saanich-Gulf Islands on the subject of voting hours. It would 
probably be the same in our own caucus. The issue of voting hours 
came up all of sudden, and now we have to take position on the 
matter. Perhaps it could be left out of the debate, but there are many 
other things that should be left out as well.
<P>
	If we can have an election within a shorter period of time, it is 
only due to a procedural trick. There would be a pre-election 
enumeration, probably during the first three weeks of April, so that 
as soon as the writs were issued, the chief electoral officer would 
have enough information so he would not have to order a second 
enumeration but could proceed immediately with revision as 
necessary.
<P>
	We agree with the principle, but as we pointed out on Friday, not 
at this stage, not in the last year of the government's term. None of 
these last minute changes in the rules of the game. What we would 
like is one last election with the current rules, which everyone 
knows, with one last census, which would be held during the 
election campaign and would be valid for the election of the 37th 
Parliament.
<P>
	I raise the point the hon. member for Calgary West raised earlier. 
There are problems in our system, which can be fairly easily fixed 
and which cause the powers of the government to be blatantly out 
of proportion with those of the opposition. Our preference would 
have been elections on a set date, which probably does not require 
an amendment either to the Constitution or to the statutes or 
ordinary legislation.
<P>
	The Prime Minister could simply announce from his seat at the 
opening of Parliament that the next general election would be held, 
say, five years from the last one, unless the government were 
overturned in the meantime. The current Prime Minister could have 
said, when the House began sitting in January 1994: ``The next 
election will be on the third Monday of October 1998''. Everyone 
would know the date of the election.  Everyone-Liberals, 
Reform-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6655"> 6655 </A></B>
<P>
ers, Bloc members and others-could prepare for the third week of 
October 1998. This could have been done through a ministerial 
statement, without changing provisions of the law and the British 
North America Act of 1867 and without taking any powers away 
from the Queen by prohibiting her from dissolving Parliament if 
she so desires. We all know very well that Her Majesty does not 
intervene in this sort of thing, except on the recommendation of the 
government.
<P>
	This constraint could easily be eliminated. A ministerial 
statement, rather than a major constitutional change, is all it would 
take. We would feel much more involved in the process, not to 
mention the fact that, in the last 18 months of a government's 
mandate, the opposition keeps wondering when a general election 
will be called. If we knew the date, we would all be on an equal 
footing, as has been the case for over 200 years in the United 
States, where Democrats, Republicans and Reformers all know 
that, on the first Tuesday of November, they elect all members of 
the House of Representatives and one third of the Senate every two 
years, and the president every four years. We could have exactly 
the same provisions without amending the Constitution. I believe a 
private member's bill to that effect was introduced and will be 
reviewed by a committee.
<P>
	As for the date of a byelection, it goes without saying that there 
is a danger in putting it off for too long, as is currently possible. 
The government must, in the six months following a vacancy, 
announce the date at which a byelection will be held. However, that 
date does not have to be within the six-month period. We should 
follow the example of some Canadian provinces. I will take the 
example of Quebec, since I am more familiar with its legislation. In 
Quebec, a byelection must be held in the six months that follow a 
vacancy.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	No one is caught by surprise, since the byelection is held within 
a set timeframe. An exception could be made whereby, in the last 
year of a government's constitutional mandate, that is to say, 
between its fourth and fifth year in office, a byelection would not 
have to be held.
<P>
	Otherwise, given that the whole process requires a number of 
months, a member elected in the last year of a mandate might sit 
for just a few weeks. In fact, should the House adjourn, that 
member could be elected, sign the roll, be sworn in, and never 
actually sit in the House.
<P>
	So, an exception could be made whereby, in the fifth year of a 
Parliament, a byelection would not be required if one or more seats 
became vacant. In the other four years, a byelection would have to 
take place between the 90th and the 190th day following a vacancy. 
Therefore, we will support Motion No. 6 in Group No. 4, tabled by 
the hon. member for Calgary West.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
motion is rather important one from the point of view of 
maintaining balance and democracy. For example, if the chief 
government whip were to be appointed ambassador to 
Minnesota-well, that is hockey they say-all of a sudden that 
would happen in the same way that it happened with our 
ambassador to Israel or any number of the other wonderful 
appointments the Prime Minister has bestowed on members.
<P>
	In terms of keeping a balance in democracy, we all recognize 
that within any contest, which politics truly is, we want to have a 
set of rules that will not create the outcome but will see that the 
outcome is fair and balanced and that everyone has an equal chance 
to participate.
<P>
	My colleague from Calgary West was mentioning that there is a 
provision under the Parliament of Canada Act for the government 
to call an election within six months. However, that does not mean 
that it has to be held within the six months.
<P>
	Again, we address the problem then for the people in the 
constituency where the vacancy has occurred as opposed to this 
situation of the government whip's going to Minnesota. We have 
other situations where things are less controlled, where there is 
perhaps illness or even the death of a member of Parliament and 
people are simply not represented.
<P>
	I would like to speak specifically to the issue of a 36 day 
campaign period, particularly for the opposition party, where we 
have a situation such as the heritage minister's being hounded from 
this House on the basis of her GST promises. It is widely reported 
that she made that decision after seeing an opinion poll which 
showed that she would be re-elected in her own constituency. So 
boom, that was it. She was gone.
<P>
	Other vacancies have occurred. I am thinking primarily of the 
vacancy that was created so that the person who now fulfils the role 
of minister of immigration could come to this House. Those 
vacancies occurred, as it were, at the whim and at the direction of 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Everyone in the House will be aware of the fact that every 
political party has its own specific set of rules, but there is, after all, 
a nomination process. Therefore, we would have the government 
members of the day, in this case the Liberals, who will have 
absolute control over what is to be going on. They will have all of 
their ducks in order. If we need any evidence that in fact the 
Liberals did have the ducks in order, on the day the heritage 
minister resigned and then was going to be coming back to this 
Chamber by way of the vote in Hamilton, all of a sudden she was 
appearing at a political rally that evening with all of the signs, 
banners and organization, everything completely in place.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="6656"> 6656 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not speaking to that particular election. I am just pointing 
out that clearly she and the government had absolute control over 
that situation. With a 47 day campaign that absolute control ends 
up being somewhat diluted by virtue of the fact that as the other 
parties have to go through a nomination process, a fundraising 
process and a team building process, they could have up to 30 of 
the 47 days. In other words, they could have virtually a full month 
to go through that entire process and then conduct a very 
aggressive political campaign in the last 17 days.
<P>
<B>(1355)</B>
<P>
	What would happen if we were to reduce the byelection period to 
36 days? If in fact it did take 30 days, and clearly it can very easily 
take 30 days to go through the nomination, fundraising and team 
building processes, then the other parties would have less than a 
week to get themselves organized. There would only be six days 
left in the election campaign for those parties to try to affect the 
results.
<P>
	All members of the House are aware of what goes into an 
election campaign. Signs must be printed. Offices have to be 
organized. Telephones have to be installed. Billboards have to be 
organized. Advertising time has to be purchased. All of these 
things having to be put in place in a 36 day period clearly puts the 
advantage in the hands of the government of the day.
<P>
	Motion No. 6 calls for a sense of fairness and a sense of balance. 
Motion No. 6 must be supported by all members of the House. This 
motion will provide fair and balanced political competition for the 
important role of member of Parliament.
<P>
	Many of the proposed amendments to this bill demonstrate 
clearly that collectively, with a minimal amount of partisanship, we 
are creating rules which are fair, balanced and, above all, equitable. 
Democracy will be protected through this process.

the untold stories of the University of Manitoba is the existence of 
ISIS Canada. Part of the Canadian network of Centres of 
Excellence, ISIS Canada technology works to develop solutions to 
Canada's infrastructure problems.
<P>
	Headquartered at the University of Manitoba, the ISIS network 
brings together researchers from universities in every province of 
Canada who are designing the new composite materials which will

	Using carbon fibre for reinforcement and optical fibres for 
sensing, they are creating structures which are stronger, lighter, 
which last longer and which monitor themselves.

	Thanks to the ISIS network, Canada leads the world in the 
development of this technology, a fact which will allow Canadian

Canadians, I can only receive two or three regular TV channels. We 
have no cable TV and no prospect of getting cable, but that is not 
our complaint.
<P>
	Here is the problem. The air around us out there is filled with a 
cornucopia of good TV programs and movies but our government 
here in Ottawa says we may not receive those programs because it 
is illegal.
<P>
	If a Canadian company were to make this programming

there is no such company. Therefore tens of thousands of rural

<P>

	At a time when the prime rate is less than 4 per cent, banks still 
insist on charging an average of 17.5 per cent on outstanding credit 
and balances. Some major retailers are charging a whopping 28 per 
cent. Incredible.
<P>
	The government is doing its part to put money back into the

refuse, the people demand and deserve an explanation. Failing that, 
maybe we should boycott them altogether.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage is responsible for the 
official languages program and, accordingly, for supporting the 
francophone minority outside Quebec in order to prevent its being 
assimilated by the anglophone majority.
<P>
	How can the Minister of Canadian Heritage fulfil her ministerial 
responsibility and protect the two official language minorities, 
when she in fact refuses to acknowledge that Canada has a real 
problem in the assimilation of francophones outside Quebec, as 
Statistics Canada figures prove beyond a doubt?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the hon. member really 
wants to know what I said, he can read the minutes of the 
committee in which I said, following the comments by the minister, 
Ms. Beaudouin, that the problem of anglicization exists throughout 
the country, including in the Province of Quebec.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Minister of Canadian Heritage has said a lot of things, 
so many things that she was awarded the <I>Montreal Gazette</I>'s 
brickbat of the week. No mean feat.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duceppe:</B> I would recall some statistics for her: the rate of 
assimilation of francophones in New Brunswick is 8.7 per cent; in 
British Columbia, 72 per cent; in western Canada, 55 per cent; in 
Ontario, 37 per cent and in the City of Hamilton, her city, 65 per 
cent. These are Statistics Canada's figures. And this is why 
associations representing francophones in English Canada have 
criticized the minister's remarks.
<P>
	Instead of concealing the problem, by promoting bilingualism, 
does the minister not think it is time to recognize the facts, to open 
her eyes and to perhaps offer some solutions?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, if the member is really 
interested in the well-being of the francophone community across 
Canada, I would ask him to contact his counterpart, the Quebec 
minister of education, who has introduced a system that 
discriminates against francophones outside Quebec in French 
language post-secondary education.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Quebec introduced a system of higher costs for out of 
country students, as did Ontario. In Ontario, it is good 
management; in Quebec, it is discrimination.
<P>
	In the case of out of province students, Quebec charges them the 
average cost of education in Canada, which means that it costs even 
less for an Ontarian than studying in Toronto. Those are the facts. It 
is time the minister woke up. If she wants to talk money, we will 
talk money.
<P>
	Does the minister not think that one way to meet her 
responsibilities, because she does have responsibilities although 
she may not realize it, is to look carefully at the use the other 
provinces make of the money intended to go to educating official 
language minorities that went to other things, like heating schools 
or setting up public washrooms in Kingston?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I asked the hon. member, 
who, I assume, supports the policy of his colleague, the hon. 
member for Québec-Est, who supports a policy of bilingualism 
across the country, which we support, whether he is prepared to 
acknowledge that the education policy of his counterpart in Quebec 
City, Pauline Marois, discriminates against 1,500 students 
registered at Laval, the University of Sherbrooke and the 
University of Montreal. Most of them are francophones who wish 
to continue their studies in their own language.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minister keeps hammering at Quebec because she cannot do her 
own job properly. That is the problem.
<P>
	Marcel Beaudry, president of the National Capital Commission, 
said before the Joint Committee on Official Languages that Ottawa 
was, to all intents and purposes, a bilingual city. However, only last 
summer the Fédération des communautés francophones et 
acadienne condemned the national capital's English unilingualism.
<P>
	Considering that the assimilation rate of francophones within the 
federal capital has reached 30 per cent, does the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage not think it is high time she reminded Mr. 
Beaudry that it is part of the NCC's mandate to actively promote 
linguistic duality?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, one thing is certain and 
that is that someone who refers to francophones outside Quebec as 
paraplegics in wheelchairs is hardly in a position to say anything 
about the state of the French language.
<P>
	That being said, what I said, and what is falsely denied by the 
hon. member for Québec-Est is that now, and this was not the case 
30 years ago, 99 per cent of francophones outside Quebec who wish 
to be educated in their language have that possibility, thanks to 
federal policies.
<P>
	Of course the policies are not perfect. But if the hon. member 
wants to victimize francophones in this country, I think he is 
barking up the wrong tree.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
challenge the minister to prove that 99 per cent of francophones 
outside Quebec have access to education in French, when there are 
only 50 per cent. This is a shameless falsehood on the part of the 
minister who is supposed to be responsible for this sector.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Dear colleague, I suggest it would be more 
appropriate to refrain from using words like ``falsely'' or 
``falsehood''. I would ask you to be very careful about your choice 
of words.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Marchand:</B> NCC leases provide that tenants who are 
businesses or government agencies must advertise and provide 
services in both official languages. According to Mr. Beaudry, they 
cannot act on these clauses because they have never been enforced.
<P>
	Are we to conclude that the Official Languages Act is no longer 
valid because it has never been properly enforced in Canada, 
outside Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, you will understand my 
pleasant astonishment at the spectacle of the Bloc Quebecois' 
supporting the use of bilingual signs across the country. We think 
that is an important step forward.
<P>
	If the member for Quebec Est is honest in the comment that he 
made the other night to the committee that he supports bilingualism 
across the country, in every part of the country, including the 
province of Quebec, I would encourage him to intervene with the 
minister of education in Quebec who has introduced a two tier

	Then we hear about the 16,000 New Brunswickers who have 
signed a petition to dump the tax and then a report comes out 
showing how rents in Nova Scotia will go up, hurting the old, the 
young and the poor, those least able to absorb a tax hike.
<P>
	Finally, at the end of the week Ontario's finance minister put a 
torch to any possibility of Canada's largest province hitching a ride 
on this Hindenburg.
<P>
	Why will the finance minister not finally admit that his hope for 
a nationwide harmonization deal is dead? Will he kill it now in 
Atlantic Canada before it kills any more jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
terms of the Greenberg stores, the fact of the matter is the stores, 
indeed all retailers in Atlantic Canada, will gain as much if not 
more as a result of the introduction of input tax credits than any 
other cost.
<P>
	At the same time, the minister of finance in New Brunswick 
stated very clearly that he is prepared to sit down with any of the 
retailers in New Brunswick, as indeed are the other ministers of 
finance, to make sure tax inclusive pricing is introduced in a way 
that will not cause hardship but that will in fact give consumers 
what they want.
<P>
	The issue nonetheless that remains in this House is why the 
Reform Party has supported in House of Commons committee and 
in fact in its own official program, all 18 versions of its own official 
program, tax harmonization. Why is it prepared to support it in 
principle but when Atlantic Canada wants to do it in order to
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6662"> 6662 </A></B>
<P>
make its small and medium size business more competitive, to give 
it an opportunity to get a leg up, the Reform Party in an act of blind 
attack against Atlantic Canada refuses to accept that very good 
measure?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
Reformers are standing up for Atlantic Canada. My question is why 
do we have all these Atlantic Canadian MPs sitting over here using 
up perfectly good oxygen but not standing up for their constituents.
<P>
	Despite a billion dollars in hush money the facts of this political 
deal have started leaking out. Everything is going up in price: new 
houses, rents, heating fuel, children's clothing, gasoline. Nova 
Scotia's opposition leader says this deal will mean $53 million in 
new gas taxes in Nova Scotia. Even Nova Scotia's finance minister 
admits that municipal property taxes are going to have to rise 
because of this deal.
<P>
	Why is the finance minister allowing this tax attack on the hard 
pressed people of Atlantic Canada when it is clear that it will hurt 
the poor and it will kill jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hidden agenda of the Reform Party is very clear. It comes out in 
its body language, it comes out in the words it uses.
<P>
	The hon. member uses the words hush money. Any time money 
is transferred to Atlantic Canada it is hush money. It was not hush 
money when Ontario received stabilization payments from the 
federal government. It was not hush money when western Canadian 
grain farmers were given the support for agricultural payments. It 
was not hush money for the Reform Party when the Alberta tar 
sands were given a very important deal that would create jobs 
there.
<P>
	But transfer a penny to Atlantic Canada and it is hush money and 
the reason is the Reform Party refuses to take a pan-Canadian view 
of this country. The Reform Party refuses to understand that the 
regions of this country support one another.
<P>
	The problem that exists here is that the Reform Party simply has 
given up on Atlantic Canada while the Liberal Party has not. We 
believe in Atlantic Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Monte Solberg (Medicine Hat, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the fact 
is the Liberal Party has made a career of creating divisions in this 
country, which is why it is not willing to come up with $3 billion 
for Ontario and the other provinces.
<P>
	The devil is in the details. A copy of this deal says a cut in the 
provincial portion of this tax requires the unanimous consent of all 
provinces involved.
<P>
	When was the last time we had unanimity on anything in this 
country? But a rate increase only needs a simple  majority. That is 
one of the reasons the finance minister himself opposed 
harmonization back when he ran for the Liberal leadership. This 
deal entrenches higher taxes forever.
<P>
	Why has the finance minister compromised his own belief that 
harmonization guarantees higher taxes forever and, in doing so, 
why did he sell out the people of Atlantic Canada?
<P>
<B>(1430 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would simply ask the hon. member to go back to the byelection 
which took place in Labrador when the Reform Party was prepared 
to stand up and speak for Atlantic Canada. Now all of a sudden, 
having lost that byelection as well as every other election in 
Atlantic Canada, Reform members are taking out their vengeance 
on Atlantic Canadians, saying ``we will not allow you to have a 
lower tax rate, we will not allow you to have lower consumer costs, 
we will not allow you to break away from a cycle of dependence, 
toward independence''.
<P>
	The hon. member asks when was the last time we had unanimity 
in this country. I will tell him. It was when Canadians from coast to 
coast to coast said ``the Reform Party has had it; it is going down 
the drain''. They do not want to have anything more to do with 
those vicious policies it stands for.

	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Canada pension plan is in trouble because it is not 
backed by investment but only by taxes on future generations. 
Today's young face a very bleak prospect. When they have families 
of their own, three of them will have to pay the taxes to take care of 
one pensioner, half of the six doing so now. Only the full private 
investment of CPP premiums can prevent such an unfair burden.
<P>
	When will the Minister of Finance do the right thing, stop the 
unfair burden on future generations and make the CPP a fully 
funded system?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
the hon. member knows, when the finance ministers met there was, 
by and large, a consensus for the necessity of having a fuller funded 
plan and that, in fact, the moneys should be invested at arm's length 
from governments by an independent investment group.
<P>
	To the extent that deals with the member's question, I believe 
there is consensus across the country on that particular issue. 
Hopefully we will be able to move to consensus right across the 
board because I believe that all members of the House would agree 
that the Canada pension plan is indeed an essential pillar of the 
Canadian retirement system. I would suggest that all provincial 
governments, as well as the federal government, deal with this as 
quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Herb Grubel (Capilano-Howe Sound, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, higher job killing premiums are the cornerstone of the 
Liberal reform of the Canada pension plan. Lower job creating 
premiums for employment insurance are overdue and demanded by 
nearly everyone except the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	Will the minister do the right thing for future generations and 
today's workers and commit himself to a package of 
simultaneously higher CPP and lower EI premiums, a package 
which does not increase job destroying payroll taxes?
<P>
<B>(1435 )</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
am sure the hon. member knows that the employment insurance 
plan and the Canada pension plan are quite separate. They are not 
linked, as indeed are  health levies, education levies and workmen's 
compensation, which are all payroll plans in the provinces. For that 
reason the Canada pension plan must be dealt with on its own.
<P>
	I have a little difficulty with the member's question, how it 
reconciles with the Taxpayers' Budget brought forward by the 
Reform Party which states: ``To ensure that savings from reform of 
UI translate into deficit elimination, the Reform Party recommends 
the establishment of a permanent reserve fund for the UI. Until the 
budget was balanced, funds from this reserve would be applied 
against the deficit''.

this statement?

question is for the Minister of Health.
<P>
	This morning, a coalition of organizations, including the 
Canadian Hemophilia Society, renewed its request for access to the 
documents the Krever commission wishes to examine. These 
documents, including draft regulations on blood products, go back 
to 1984, when the Liberal Party was in power and the current Prime 
Minister was Deputy Prime Minister. According to testimony given 
by certain senior health officials, the draft regulations were blocked 
at the highest level.
<P>
	How can the minister explain his stubborn refusal not to table 
these documents, unless it is because their publication could be 
embarrassing to the present government?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is not a stubborn 
refusal, it is a legal requirement.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Canada Evidence Act gives the minister the required authority. 
Under the terms of that statute, the minister may ask the President 
of the Privy Council to intervene in order to overturn a decision by 
the Clerk of the Privy Council to refuse to make these documents 
public, and to have them finally turned over to Judge Krever so that 
he may get to the bottom of this tragedy.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, last 
Friday in this House the minister of Indian affairs said that he could 
not send treaty entitlements directly to grassroots Indian people 
who live on reserves. He said that is not the way his government 
deals with other levels of government.
<P>
	Ottawa routinely sends individual entitlements and benefits 
directly to other Canadians, including GST rebate cheques, child 
benefit cheques, pension cheques and so on.
<P>
	Why is the minister afraid to give treaty Indians a choice about 
how they want to receive their treaty entitlements, either directly 
from the government or from the chief in council? Why is he 
denying Indians the same rights as every other Canadian?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, let me explain this to the hon. 
member. First, treaty land entitlement is direct to the individuals 
through a process.
<P>
	But under treaty we have not yet scoped out the meaning of 
health, the meaning of education, the meaning of economic 
development. There are four processes going on in this country that 
I hope would have something.
<P>
	What the hon. member wants me to do-I explained it to her 
colleague last week-is pay the money directly to 300,000 or 
400,000 aboriginal people. We do not deal that way. We deal 
government to government. We do not do that with provinces. 
Provinces do not do that with municipalities. They elect people. 
They decide on the priorities, whether hospitals, schools or roads. 
This is the way they do it.
<P>
	Certainly the hon. member is not suggesting that the Minister of 
Finance take the money he collects and send a cheque to each 
Canadian so they can decide what to do with the money. The people 
elect us to come to the House of Commons to make decisions. 
Aboriginal people elect chiefs in council to make decisions. It is 
quite simple.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
an example. The First Nations accountability coalition is 
comprised mainly of treaty Indians who receive old age pension 
cheques. They are now able to speak out because they are not 
totally beholden to the chief and council for their survival. Their 
pension cheques have given them a real voice and real power for 
the first time in their lives. These people are demanding financial 
accountability of their own leaders. I am not asking this, they are 
asking.
<P>
<B>(1440)</B>
<P>
	Some of them have been threatened and beaten; some have had 
their houses shot at. When they complained, the minister's own
<P>
officials in Saskatchewan told the coalition: ``Do not take it 
personally; it is happening all over''. This is not good enough.
<P>
	When will the minister finally give authority to the auditor 
general to look into these complaints of financial mismanagement? 
When will he make sure that aboriginals are treated fairly and 
equally in this country?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is probably the 
last person to be asking that question. These are the same types of 
questions which are asked of the Minister of Justice. Reformers 
take one isolated case and say because this happened, people 
cannot handle their own responsibilities and that we should look at 
what is happening.
<P>
	Reformers refuse to look across the country at the 80 per cent of 
First Nations that do a good job of managing. They refused to look 
at the B.C. treaty process which was a success and which 
Reformers opposed. They refused to look at the Manitoba 
dismantling which they opposed and which is a success. They 
refused to look at treaty scoping out and they even refused to 
support legislation in the Yukon. Yet they come here and ask when 
there is going to be fairness for the aboriginal people. They are the 
wrong people to be asking that question.

partners can be arrived at within a matter of a day or so.
<P>
	The meetings which were held last week were very important in 
terms of determining the needs. Last week there was a high level of 
confusion about how many refugees were left, what their condition 
was and where they were located.
<P>
	That decision was consolidated during the meeting at Stuttgart. 
The Minister for International Cooperation held a very good

response would be based on the information arrived at this

might remove the domestic fuel tax if they accept the restructuring

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

that this government is taking the same position that it has taken 
now for almost a month. The Minister of Transport did not go to 
British Columbia to try to broker a deal between Canadian Airlines 
and its union. He went there to listen. The Minister of Transport did 
not go to British Columbia to write a cheque. The minister is there 
to listen.
<P>
	To quote the Minister of Transport, there is no role for 
government until such time as the company is made essentially 
profitable. Government involvement now with money or anything 
else will not solve the chronic restructuring problem.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I do not know why the government is listening now; it 
never listened before. Reform has been calling for the removal of 
the federal fuel tax on aviation gas but the federal tax is only part of 
the problem. An international treaty on air transport, agreed to by 
184 countries including Canada, prohibits taxation of fuel used for 
international air transportation. The federal government has 
complied but a number of provincial governments have not.
<P>
	Given that this provincial aviation fuel tax on international 
flights contravenes the treaty signed by Canada and compounds the 
competitive problems for Canadian air carriers, what action if any 
has the minister taken to have this provincial tax removed? If he is

finally  talking to them about that, why did he wait until Canadian

	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to help the hon. member out. 
He is a hardworking member of the transport committee.
<P>
	Maybe he has not met with his leader for a while but his leader 
spoke on CBU AM radio in Vancouver and said: ``In keeping with 
our philosophy that government should stay out of the marketplace 
and stay out of business, if Canadian is to survive, it will survive 
because it is successful in implementing a business plan to make it 
profitable''.
<P>
	In any of the speeches that have been made by his party or by the 
government there has been no mention about foreign investment 
and nothing about eliminating taxes. It is there in Reform's 1995 
blue book: ``Eliminate regional development as a goal of 
transportation policy''. There is no mention by the leader of the

	<B>Mr. Robert Bertrand (Pontiac-Gatineau-Labelle, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	For several months now, we have been hearing that the federal 
government was going to get more directly involved in promoting 
job creation.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Human Resources Development tell us 
what steps he has taken, in co-operation with the government of my 
province, the Province of Quebec, in order to stimulate job 
creation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Pierre S. Pettigrew (Minister of Human Resources 
Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, naturally the Government of 
Canada and the Government of Quebec both wish to help as many 
unemployed people as possible re-enter the job market. One way in 
which our governments want to help Quebecers find work is to 
facilitate the exchange of information between employers and 
workers, by working closely with partners in the private sector.
<P>
	I would like to give one example of how the governments of 
Canada and of Quebec have worked together, in an activity 
sponsored by Défi Emploi in the region of Témiscouata. In this 
region, the Government of Canada and the Government of Quebec 
have worked with local dailies, which have agreed to advertise jobs 
free of charge.
<P>
<B>(1455)</B>
<P>
	You will be pleased to learn that this Défi Emploi project in 
Témiscouata has been a success. Of the 557 jobs advertised, 
approximately 469 have been filled, a success rate of 84 per cent. 
This means that 469 men and women have thus found jobs when 
our governments work together.

	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	The information commissioner, John Grace, recently declared 
that a number of government ministers were urging their officials 
to break the law on purpose by refusing to make public within 30 
days replies to requests for access to information.
<P>
	What action does the minister intend to take to ensure that his 
foot dragging colleagues get serious and observe the provisions of 
the Access to Information Act?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I know that all of my colleagues 
make their best efforts in good faith to comply with their 
obligations under the law. Sometimes the complexity of a request 
or the difficulty in amassing the necessary information is such that 
the time limit is not fully respected. However, the record of this 
government is clear. We take these responsibilities very seriously 
and we make our best efforts to provide whatever information is 
required as soon as practical.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, surely the commissioner was not just making idle 
comments. There must be a problem.
<P>
	When will the justice minister propose amendments to the 
Access to Information Act for the purpose of strengthening the 
coercive authority held by the information commissioner over 
officials, political staff or ministers who deliberately take their 
time making documents to which we are entitled to have access 
under the act public?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, these matters are always under 
review. We are happy to discuss with interested parties ways in 
which the law can be improved. However, we are satisfied that for 
the most part the statute works well now. As I say, we make every 
effort in good faith to comply with its spirit, its intent, as well as its 
letter.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="JUSTICE">JUSTICE</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the rule of 
law means that everyone in our society, including ministers of 
government, premiers, the rich and powerful and ordinary citizens 
alike are governed by the same law of the land. Those words were 
spoken in the House by the Minister of Justice last September. Yet 
last Friday the same minister asked me to overlook niggling 
legalisms such as orders in council to permit Madam Justice Louise 
Arbour to accept another position, despite the fact that the Judges 
Act specifically prohibits judges from accepting other 
appointments.
<P>
	Is the minister now saying that the rule of law does not apply to 
this minister when he grants orders in council to powerful people?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, nothing has happened since Friday 
last to add any legitimacy to the position expressed by the hon. 
member. He was wrong then and he is wrong now.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6668"> 6668 </A></B>
<P>
	The order in council that was made granted a leave of absence 
to Madam Justice Arbour. That is entirely permitted by the Judges 
Act. The fact that Madam Justice Arbour is pursuing other duties 
is also permitted under the Judges Act.
<P>
	What is prohibited by the Judges Act is that Madam Justice 
Arbour would accept money from sources other than the federal 
government. That she has not done and she will not do so until Bill 
C-42 becomes law. That legislation is intended to amend the Judges 
Act so that Madam Justice Arbour can take up the duties, with pay 
from the United Nations, for which she was appointed.
<P>
	I might say that she was appointed by the United Nations 
Security Council in a unanimous vote. This country was honoured 
that a judge of the court of appeal for Ontario was appointed to this 
position, a position of world leadership in terms of morality: chief 
prosecutor of the war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the end 
does not justify the means. Regardless of what the minister is 
saying today, he did say before the Senate that he had absolutely no 
power to grant this order in council as the law currently stands and 
he is in violation of section 55 of the Judges Act which prohibits 
other employment. It has nothing to do with salary.
<P>
	Since the minister has granted a special dispensation to Madam 
Justice Louise Arbour, will he acknowledge that the appearance of 
impartiality by Madam Justice Arbour will be seriously 
compromised when she returns to the bench if she is judging cases 
that involve the Government of Canada?
<P>
<B>(1500)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this concern makes no more sense 
when it emanates from the hon. member than it did from some of 
those in the Senate who expressed it also. I do not understand it 
frankly. I simply do not understand it. It does not make sense.
<P>
	The United Nations wanted a judge from this country for the role 
because with judges it has impartiality. It wanted a Canadian judge 
because of our reputation in the world order. It wanted this judge 
because of her integrity and her reputation for fairness and 
competence. By unanimous vote of the security council it chose her 
for this role.
<P>
	We found that although she is permitted a leave of absence to 
take up the duties she cannot be paid by the UN without a change in 
the statute. The UN does not want us to pay her because it fears that 
will undermine her independence in the World Court. We propose a 
change to the statute and all we hear from this member is a bizarre 
and, in my view, incorrect interpretation of the statute which might 
cause difficulties in having this woman do an important service for 
humanity.

get this job done for the world?

<P>
	The banks will be announcing another $6 billion profit, a record. 
We hear members of the Liberal caucus making progressive noises 
in the finance committee about the banks' service charges and 
interest rates charged on Visa cards. But the real question is: What 
is the government going to do?
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance commit his government to putting a 
ceiling on interest charges on Visa, Mastercard and the other credit 
card companies? Will he act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is nice to know the 
NDP has an inside track on bank profits because none of the banks 
has announced their profits yet this year.
<P>
	The government is committed to ensuring that the banks do their 
fair share to support the economy. By that I mean paying their fair 
share of taxes. These are the highest taxed corporations in the 
country. Indeed they pay large corporate taxes. They pay a special 
capital tax for large institutions besides their corporate taxes. They 
paid a billion dollars in taxes in 1991 and 1993 and more this year.
<P>
	That is one of the ways we have made sure that the banks play 
out their role in the community.

	<B>Hon. Jean J. Charest (Sherbrooke, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the worst abuser of the unemployment 
insurance fund in Canada, the Minister of Finance.
<P>
	After three years of Liberal government, Canada is experiencing 
the longest period of high unemployment we have known since the 
thirties. Nevertheless, the Liberal government continues to put a 
surtax on employees through the unemployment insurance fund.
<P>
	I simply want to ask the Minister of Finance whether he thinks it 
is legitimate for the government to use the unemployment 
insurance fund to reduce its deficit?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
that takes the cake. When the Conservative government came to 
power in 1984, unemployment insurance premiums were $2.30, 
and when we came to power in 1993, they were about to reach 
<P>

<B><A NAME="6669"> 6669 </A></B>
<P>
$3.30. We have  reduced them annually, but the Conservatives 
increased them every year they were in power.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is beyond belief. It must be very difficult to be the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party and have to swallow oneself whole 
every time he stands up and denies the record of his government in 
office. Every single year it was in office unemployment insurance 
premiums went up. Every year that we have been in office 
unemployment premiums have gone down.
<P>
	He represents a government that was prepared to impose on the 
Canadian people the highest level of taxation that they have ever 
had. Yet they also gave them the highest deficit. At least the leader 
of the Progressive Conservative Party should have the courage of 
the Reform Party and outline from where his tax cuts will come. 
Let him admit that he will cut health care-

	The House resumed consideration of Bill C-63, an act to amend 
the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act, as reported 
(with amendments) from the committee; and Motion No. 6.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The hon. member for Kootenay East who 
has four minutes remaining in his intervention.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the 
concluding portion of my remarks I was referring to the fact that 
what we are trying to do here is create an improved bill respecting 
elections in Canada and the fact that I believe we have good will in 
this House and are attempting to do it in such a way that it be 
non-partisan.
<P>
	However, politics being the partisan effort that it is, I would 
draw to the attention of the Liberals the fact that during the last 
Parliament it was they who were carrying on in quite a manner 
about the fact that the Conservatives would bring in closure. It was 
the Liberals who put in their red book appendix an article about 
people who would ascend to the position of deputy chair of this 
chamber.
<P>
	In other words, whether we like it or not, the reality is it seems 
when people move from this side of the House to the other side of 
the House, certainly historically between the Liberals and the 
Conservatives, they generally carry on the position of the people on 
the government side of the House.
<P>
	I therefore draw that to their attention because it is important to 
realize that when we are trying to craft something here we are 
trying to craft a set of rules that we can play a game with; not play a 
game in the sense of frivolous but indeed compete in.
<P>
	Many of us enjoyed watching the Grey Cup yesterday. It was 
interesting that the field was of equal width at either end. It was 
interesting was that one set of goal posts was not lower or wider. 
Both sets of goal posts were exactly the same.
<P>
	In other words, when we set up the rules of engagement for 
whatever the competition may be, whether it be a football game or 
a political contest, the rules be tailored in such a way that they are 
fair to all participants, that all participants have equal opportunity.
<P>
<B>(1520 )</B>
<P>
	We know as it presently stands the government has the potential 
of turning around and doing whatever it will with respect to calling 
an election. It actually becomes something of a joke. I note in the 
province of Alberta the premier has been saying ``soon, soon'' 
much the same way the health minister here keeps on saying 
``soon, soon'' with respect to tobacco taxes. The point is the

	With that in mind, it is all the more important therefore that we 
make sure that the 36 day campaign be restricted exclusively to a 
general election. As stated previously, each party must go through a 
nomination process. This is a process where each party goes out of 
its way to cast its net as wide as it can to get as highly qualified 
candidates as it can. Each party must go through a process of 
fundraising, particularly at the constituency level where 
byelections are being called. Each party must build a team of 
people to help the candidate, help the campaign for that candidate 
to become successful.
<P>
	As I have stated previously, it is for that reason we must have 
rules that are fair or as close to fair and equitable as we can so that 
each candidate and each party is given the opportunity to have as 
much time as is required to get the job done properly.
<P>
	I recognize that this is a Reform motion and it has been the 
history of this government that motions from parties other than the 
Liberal Party have received very scant attention. However, in this 
particular case, I think it is really important for future byelections 
that will be held under this legislation that the members and the 
government, because it will be leading its members, take a serious 
look at this and recognize that this is the only way that we can keep 
the field for the election contest the same and the goal posts at the 
same height.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
before us an amendment proposed by the Reform Party to maintain 
a slightly longer period for a byelection than one would for a 
general election.
<P>
	I support this type of amendment, and I will explain why. In a 
general election, the parties knew it was coming, so they have a 
chance to set up their campaign machine, the people who volunteer 
their services such as fundraising, an indispensable adjunct to the 
democratic process which includes exercising the right to vote and 
the election campaign that precedes voting day. Obviously, in a 
general election, the parties have had a chance to prepare for the 
event.
<P>
	However, with a byelection that comes out of the blue, the 
parties do not get the same advance notice, except of course the 
government party which has all the time in the world to decide 
when. It is clear that the government party would have an unfair 
competitive edge since it sets the date, which gives it plenty of time 
to get ready to face the opposition parties in a campaign that will 
last for a very limited period.
<P>
	In that kind of situation, the opposition parties would have to 
recruit volunteers very quickly, which is not easy, and get their 
grassroots financing. And by the way, those  parties that are funded 
by multinationals get huge cheques. As you can imagine, that kind 
of fundraising is much easier. The other parties, including the Bloc 
Quebecois, which raise money from their members and the general 
public in the form of small contributions, will have to work much 
harder over a much longer period of time.
<P>
<B>(1525)</B>
<P>
	It will therefore be understood that this is necessary in 
byelections so that all parties, the government party and the 
opposition parties, may act under fair rules and within an extended 
period of time. The Reform Party motion is well received in this 
connection.
<P>
	Let me remind you that the government party has not always 
acted with-shall I say-all the respect it ought to have shown to 
the opposition parties. I refer specifically to the byelections held 
last February in three Quebec ridings.
<P>
	At that very moment, the Bloc Quebecois was involved in a 
leadership race. The energies of our activists, our volunteers, were 
focussed on that, yet we had at the same time to campaign in three 
separate ridings. This shows that the precautions contained in the 
Reform motion are not without purpose.
<P>
	Indeed, the government party, understandably, wants to hold an 
election at the time that is best for it and, consequently, the worst 
time for the opposition parties. They cannot be faulted for that. It is 
to be expected, strategically speaking. Nevertheless, the public 
interest must take precedent in such cases. The goal must be, not so 
much to give the opposition parties the opportunity to get 
organized, but to ensure that the public interest is protected by a 
democratically held election.
<P>
	You will agree that, if the opposition parties lack the time to 
prepare themselves, to get organized, to explain what they have to 
offer to the population of a riding holding a byelection, the voters 
in that riding are being totally deprived of the public debate that 
ensures a healthy democracy. The voters in the riding are deprived 
of the possibility of making the most informed choice possible.
<P>
	Because we are in a democracy, we have to respect not only the 
underlying principles, but the means. I do not doubt that the 
government party has all the necessary respect for the underlying 
principles of democracy, but it must also have respect for the 
means.
<P>
	Let us face it, a party in power will one day sit on the opposition 
side. Consequently, what I have to say today in support of the 
Reform motion is, in reality, also for the benefit of the party in 
power at the present time.
<P>
	You will have understood, of course, that by the time this rule 
applies, the Bloc will likely be elsewhere, its mission 
accomplished, but on behalf of the democracy which is, and will 
remain, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6673"> 6673 </A></B>
<P>
in Canada and in Quebec, I  believe that the Reform Party motion 
ought to be well received by this House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
make a few remarks with respect to the amendment that we 
proposed to Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada Elections Act. 
The amendment relates to byelections and the period of time in 
which those byelections can take place.
<P>
	Historically, as all members know, elections campaigns have 
been carried out over a 47 day period. A sequence of events took 
place during those 47 days which, generally, was acceptable to 
Canadians. That 47 day period allowed both government members 
and opposition members to adjust.
<P>
<B>(1530 )</B>
<P>
	This piece of legislation shortens the time period for a byelection 
from 47 days down to 36 days. In some cases that may be okay. For 
example when because of ill health someone passes away a period 
of time exists afterward and there is a bit of notice not only to the 
government but also the opposition parties in terms of filling that 
vacancy. There is some notice.
<P>
	The major concern is that there are other situations. In this 35th 
Parliament there have been a number of situations where someone 
resigned on one day immediately after which the Prime Minister 
announced the byelection in the respective constituency and all 
parties were supposed to be ready. In that kind of a situation the 
government party is at an advantage.
<P>
	Let us take the resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister. We 
knew that the Deputy Prime Minister should resign and the 
opposition, the Reform Party questioned the government day after 
day, checking on the integrity and the actions of the government. 
We asked that if the Deputy Prime Minister really said that if the 
GST was not eliminated, killed, scrapped or done away with, if that 
did not happen, that she would resign. It took some days to prove it. 
We had to work on that. Knowing that this government had such a 
massive majority we were not sure that the Deputy Prime Minister 
would stick with that statement, show integrity and resign. The day 
came when all of a sudden the Deputy Prime Minister resigned. It 
happened. We were not sure when that was going to happen but the 
government was.
<P>
	In the backrooms people like Hosek, Goldenberg and all those 
other backroom strategists who pull the strings of this government 
and really run the government, who tell the Prime Minister, the 
Deputy Prime Minister, the House leader and the whip what to do, 
had a lead time of two or three weeks to plan the events of the 
byelection. They were able to notify the people in Hamilton that 
there was going to be a byelection and to get themselves ready, 
raise their funds, get their campaign people  together, that the 
Deputy Prime Minister was going to make an announcement. 
Quietly they could do that and I am sure they did.
<P>
	The plug was pulled. There was a byelection. There were 47 
days. We here in the Reform Party scrambled around, got a good 
candidate in place, raised funds, got our constituency organization 
working, brought people in from a variety of places to campaign, 
but we were somewhat at a disadvantage.
<P>
	The government now wants to say that all of that can be done in 
36 days. Who is winning out of that kind of a major amendment in 
the legislation? It is all to the advantage of the government.
<P>
	I commented earlier in some of my statements in committee that 
a 36 day campaign for a regular election is not a bad idea. What is 
the difference? The difference is that going into a general election, 
opposition members, whether they are with one of the recognized 
parties or one of those parties that are disappearing into oblivion 
like the Progressive Conservative Party, if they have any smarts 
and are sitting in this House and making some general 
observations, which can be done even here today, they know that by 
the spring 1997 there will be a general federal election, or if it is 
not in the spring it will be in October 1997.
<P>
	Those are easy observations. Anybody can do that. As political 
parties, just like the government, we should set some target dates in 
1996 or 1997. I would think that all parties should have all or at 
least 90 per cent of their nominations completed by the end of 
March 1997 so they are ready. Then the candidates can work, raise 
funds, get their teams together and be prepared for a general 
election. There is notification and a 36 day campaign could work 
under those circumstances.
<P>
<B>(1535 )</B>
<P>
	The better situation would be if there were fixed dates for 
elections so that every four years we would know exactly when we 
would vote. That would be a much better situation rather than 
allowing the government to play politics in the elections.
<P>
	The case I made relative to the amendment is that we should 
have a longer notice period. In our amendment we have suggested a 
30 day freeze period after a member vacates a seat for a variety of 
reasons. There are good reasons for that if we look at the examples 
here in the House.
<P>
	David Berger was appointed as the ambassador to Israel at a 
salary range of between $88,000 and $103,000. That opened a seat 
and subsequently there was a byelection. It could have been called 
immediately the day he was appointed as the ambassador to Israel.
<P>
	Jean Robert Gauthier was appointed as a senator. The day he was 
appointed and resigned his seat, a byelection could have been 
announced and we would have had only 36 days. That is not
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6674"> 6674 </A></B>
<P>
enough time for people to understand what has happened nor for 
the opposition parties to prepare.
<P>
	Andre Ouellet was appointed chairman of Canada Post. His 
salary has nicely increased from what it was in the House of 
Commons. It is now somewhere between $128,000 and $160,000.
<P>
	The point I want to make is that the person could have been 
appointed one day and the byelection could have been announced at 
that time, with only 36 days rather than 47 days to prepare. Some of 
the information in terms of salary is relevant in that we can see how 
there is such a desire for people to leave the salary or the position 
of member of Parliament or minister to go to other Liberal havens 
that are created for respective members of Parliament. I am sure 
that many have their eyes on such plumbs.
<P>
	There have been other instances where a byelection was created. 
Roy MacLaren went to the position of high commissioner in the 
United Kingdom. William Rompkey and Shirley Maheu became 
senators. In every one of those situations, along with the example I 
gave earlier with regard to the Deputy Prime Minister, the person 
could have resigned his or her seat in this assembly and 
immediately an announcement of a byelection could have been 
made.
<P>
	Under the legislation which has been brought before us by the 
Liberal government, the period of time for a byelection will be 36 
days down from 47 days. That could have a major adverse effect on 
the democratic process in the preparation for the respective 
byelection. It would be unfair to the people who have to select the 
next candidate to sit as a member of Parliament.
<P>
	The government should reconsider its position with regard to no 
freeze period of 30 days. If we could possibly reach a compromise, 
going back to the 47 days which is currently in the legislation, that 
would even be some recognition by the government that the period 
of time for a byelection must be longer than the minimum 36 day 
period which exists in the legislation being presented to us at this 
time.
<P>
	I hope the government will reconsider its position and look at 
something different. Thirty-six days is just not fair in terms of good 
preparation for a byelection. A freeze of 30 days would be best but 
if we could agree to some kind of compromise at 47 days in an 
amendment to the legislation, I think it would meet some of the 
concerns we have on this side of the House.
<P>
<B>(1540)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to add my voice to that of the other members of this House in 
the debate on the amendment proposal by the Reform Party.
<P>
	The arguments put forward by the member before me are clearly 
neither very logical, nor plausible nor of much value to democracy 
in Canada or Quebec.
<P>
	I am, however, surprised at the amount of time spent in this 
House-an hour, an hour and one quarter-discussing an 
amendment that should be unanimously approved and be 
self-evident. The federal Liberal government should be 
automatically interested, in my opinion, in such a claim, which 
would serve well all Canadians, all political parties and, 
consequently, democracy in Canada.
<P>
	However, I am not surprised by the arrogance of the Liberals, yet 
again, in failing to listen to our arguments and to try to find a way 
through compromise for all members of Parliament to come up 
with a better electoral act, which would serve all political parties 
and therefore all Canadians and Quebecers.
<P>
	I am surprised that they are preparing to reform the electoral act 
in disregard of principles established in all western democracies for 
the past 50 years. Is it, for example, common practice for the date 
of an election to be set at the whim of a Prime Minister? Is that 
common practice in a democracy? Is there anywhere in the world 
where this behaviour is permitted?
<P>
	The first reform proposed by the government ought to have been: 
``Every four or five years, we will have a vote on the first Monday 
or first Sunday of November or October''. The month does not 
matter, what counts is a set date for elections. This I think would be 
the reform Canadians and Quebecers would appreciate the most.
<P>
	It is also out of the ordinary for the date to be set, when a seat 
becomes vacant through a member's resignation or death, at the 
Prime Minister's pleasure and not through a consensus of all 
parties reached through consultation or, simply, 60 or 90 days after 
the departure or death of a member.
<P>
	It seems to me that we should have a date, as they have in most 
European countries, a predetermined date for the general elections; 
and a dateline for byelections after the incumbent's departure, 
instead of the Prime Minister having the inside track through 
picking and choosing the election date.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, since the beginning of the century, the 
Liberal Party has always acted in its own best interests with regard 
to general elections in Canada. This century, it has been in power 
for 60 or 70 years out of 90. It has repeatedly refused to pass 
legislation in keeping with that of major western democracies, 
preferring to hang on to its archaic privileges and to use them 
gradually so as to keep the advantage whenever an election is 
called.
<P>
	This fat cat party is completely out of touch with Canadian 
reality; it has no regard for democracy in action at election time. 
What matters to the Liberal Party is to seize power. What matters is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6675"> 6675 </A></B>
<P>
to stay in power, and  anything goes, including handing out plums 
to party supporters, ministers handing out discretionary contracts 
to whoever best served not society, not the government or citizens 
as a whole, but the Liberal Party.
<P>
<B>(1545)</B>
<P>
	When the former Minister of National Defence hands out a 
$75,000 discretionary contract for a little survey that was never 
conducted and never will be, because it was awarded to a party 
treasurer, you get the picture. And this man was one of the heavy 
weights on the government's front benches. What did the Prime 
Minister do? He applauded the handing out of these discretionary 
contracts to friends of the party.
<P>
	In the meantime the minister's wife was patronage adviser to the 
Prime Minister. Imagine the racket this will lead to, to raise funds, 
collect election funds, organize the next elections, flout democracy. 
And who cares about setting a date? Whenever the polls are 
favourable, the government will pick a date and try to rout the 
opposition. That has been the typical attitude of the Liberal Party 
since the beginning of the century. If anything, this bill shows that 
this party intends to maintain democracy in Canada by perpetuating 
that attitude.
<P>
	I mentioned the former defense minister, but let us speak about 
the former heritage minister. One month after the election, she 
invited 20 persons to a small private cocktail party for $2,000 each, 
thus collecting $40,000 for the event. In the following months she 
granted a dozen of these people discretionary research contracts the 
likes of which we have never seen and will never see again. She 
used public funds to reward people who contributed financially to 
her political party and to her own election. This is what the minister 
did. How did the Prime Minister react? He stood up and applauded. 
That is the vision of the Liberal Party for you.
<P>
	A reform like this one should be discussed among Canadians and 
Quebecers, in both our countries, since it has an impact on the 
future of democracy in this House, and there should be broader 
consultations. But what does the government do? It gags us. It uses 
parliamentary procedures to limit debate so it can rush this bill 
through and be free to call the next election whenever it pleases.
<P>
	With a small but important amendment like the one proposed by 
the Reform Party, which members of the Bloc support, we are 
saying there is at least one amendment we are submitting to prevent 
them from repeating what they did in the byelection held six 
months ago, which everybody criticized.
<P>
	That byelection led to the squandering of $100,000 for no reason 
at all except that the member wanted to be reconfirmed; it was just 
a big show. So, the Deputy Prime Minister used public funds to 
look good and, to make sure she would be elected, she limited the 
number of days  and quickly announced an election to throw the 
other political parties off balance.
<P>
	She should have had a deadline, as proposed by Reform 
members. But I would go further than what Reform members are 
proposing. Each time there is a byelection, it should be announced 
on a fixed date, that is, the day after the resignation. It would 
always be the same number of days, whether 60 or 90, so that each 
party knows when to expect an election.
<P>
	But once again, the Liberal Party prefers to hide. The Liberal 
Party will try to cheat again. It is used to depend on such schemes 
for its survival. This is what the Liberal Party is, a party of 
schemers.
<P>
	We could also say many other things about that party that talks 
out of both sides of its mouth. That party says one thing during the 
election campaign and another when elected. The members of that 
party do not give a damn about the promises they made about the 
GST or the Constitution.
<P>
	I would say the Liberal Party's motto, when campaigning, is: 
``We are never too poor not to make promises''. So the Liberals 
promise anything and, when in office, they forget their promises, 
telling themselves that they will certainly fool the people in the last 
six months by giving out grants, thinking that people will not 
remember anything.
<P>
	In a big convention where they will get people together, they will 
give them free food and drinks, have a big party and get applauded 
for keeping 87 per cent of their promises. They will dare put on 
another big media event.
<P>
<B>(1550)</B>
<P>
	We know quite well that the Liberal Party's main promises have 
never been kept. The Liberal Party's distinctive feature is indeed to 
govern with the objective of remaining in office and-as the old 
people back home would say-to grease its friends' palms. This 
reform is a very small one. The amendment that is proposed to us 
could at least limit the damage.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is 
important for me to get on the record concerning what is happening 
here today and to talk about some of the very reasoned amendments 
the Reform Party has put forward. I do not think there is anything 
here that is out in left or right field. Very serious ideas have been 
put forward by our party to try to improve this bill.
<P>
	We hope the government is, even at this late hour, considering 
some of our proposals that we think would make the elections act 
better. They would also help all Canadians believe, understand and 
hope that the government is concerned about consensus and  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6676"> 6676 </A></B>
<P>
consultation on something as important and non-partisan as the 
elections act.
<P>
	I hope the government will consider and listen both here and in 
committee to the proposals we have brought forward. I think they 
have a lot of merit to them.
<P>
	It is disappointing that the government uses time allocation at its 
first opportunity to push the bill through very quickly. Since it 
seems to be intent on doing that, it is really unfortunate because 
this type of legislation should be built on consultation, 
co-operation and an all-party consensus.
<P>
	Therefore, first of all I have to voice my displeasure and concern 
that time allocation is being used again in the House. It is almost 
like the New York stock market; every day is a new record around 
here for the number of times the government has used time 
allocation. It has certainly been used far more than it was used 
under Mulroney. It is used routinely to put measures through the 
House when good planning could have obviated the necessity.
<P>
	Mr. Kingsley, the chief electoral officer, brought forward this 
report back in March. It has been available to the House for months 
and months. Instead, it is dealing with the legislation at the 11th 
hour. It has to be rammed through in two days or else. It has to go to 
the Senate and be rammed through there and it has to come back.
<P>
	The government has had this report from Mr. Kingsley for six or 
eight months. That is just poor House management. I do not know 
what the deputy House leader has to do with that, but he should 
take note that it should not be necessary to routinely use time 
allocation in the House.
<P>
	Just two weeks ago we debated the speech from the throne 
because we had nothing else to talk about. Instead of debating 
issues of the day and having ample time to do it, we reverted back 
to the speech from the throne. Everybody droned on about 
something that is eight or ten months old that nobody cared about 
and there was no issue at hand, instead of debating important 
legislation. That is poor management and a disrespect to the House 
and to the work of members of Parliament.
<P>
	Obviously I cannot restate that again except to say that it is very 
disappointing and very discouraging to those of us who thought 
that we would have ample time to debate serious subjects like this.
<P>
	On the particular motion, there is some good logic why there 
should be notice given for byelection dates. The hon. member for 
Lethbridge, a man with as much experience in parliamentary 
affairs as the Prime Minister and with as many years in public 
office as anyone in the House, has pointed out the obvious need for 
fairness toward opposition and government parties alike.
<P>
	The proposal is that opposition parties should be given notice of 
any byelection that may be coming up. It should not be dropped out 
of the blue. The opposition party does not have the inside track that 
the government has when it decides to choose its byelection dates.
<P>
<B>(1555 )</B>
<P>
	If the number of days in the writ period are to be shortened and if 
someone resigns on the government side-of course this is well 
discussed behind the scenes and the government decides on a 
date-the members on the opposition side do not know it is 
coming. All of a sudden someone has been promoted to heaven, or 
the other place, as they like to call it here. They find they have a job 
for life and all the perks that go with that. I do not agree with that 
but it is another issue for another day.
<P>
	It is particularly disturbing if it happens to be in a riding where 
opposition parties do not see it coming. Suddenly they find 
themselves scrambling to make up ground with only a 36-day 
period to do so. For example, a candidate may not have been 
chosen, or a war chest put together to fight that election. 
Sometimes a party's constitution requires several days' notice to 
get things up and running. It is very difficult for an opposition party 
to mount the campaign it should and which democracy demands. It 
should be a fair and unbiased election period.
<P>
	I hope the government will listen to the amendment. Reform has 
put forward a couple of ideas. First, it should be a minimum 30-day 
period before the byelection could be held. Obviously that gives 
everybody the same writ period but at least everybody gets a little 
bit of notice. It has been Reform's longstanding belief that a 
byelection should be held a maximum of six months after a seat 
becomes vacant.
<P>
	The way it is right the Prime Minister must call a byelection but 
he does not have to call it for six months. He has a year after that to 
call it. There could be people without representation in the House 
of Commons for 18 months. We have seen it happen before where a 
byelection is put off and put off. That is unfortunate for the 
democratic process where people are clamouring for a 
representative who no longer exists to do something for them in 
Parliament and they do not have that person there for them.
<P>
	To be fair to the political parties there should be a 30-day waiting 
period if we are going to have a 36-day writ. A 30-day waiting 
period is the least we could ask for. I would hope the government 
would consider a six-month maximum so that people in this 
country are not without representatives for longer than six months. 
Surely six months is enough time to organize a byelection. If it can 
be done in 36 days surely it can be done in six months. Let us not 
play politics with the people's right to be represented. Let us let 
them have a seat here in the House and put a six month maximum 
on it.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6677"> 6677 </A></B>
<P>
	There is a realm of reforms that could be considered in the 
whole elections act. Some are not covered here. Reform of course 
made quite a play for fixed election dates. The reason for that was 
so the government does not get the inside track, does not have 
an advantage that opposition parties do not have available to them. 
That includes many things, everything from contributions, to tax 
deductibility of the same and so on. There are many things that 
could still be and maybe should still be considered by the 
government in the months ahead.
<P>
	On this motion I appeal to its sense of fairness. I hope the 
government has been listening to these debates and will look at 
what are very cogent arguments. We are trying to be reasonable and 
fair. From a majority government's point of view it is very 
important that it is fair because obviously it can ram through 
anything it wants.
<P>
	I appeal to the government, its sense of fairness, to come our 
way on this one. Give us some of what we are asking in a sense of 
fairness. Perhaps then this time allocation pill which has been a 
very difficult one to swallow, will be somewhat easier to take if we 
see the government is serious about consultation, debate and 
compromise.

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is

time allocation has been imposed at the final stage.
<P>
	For our constituents who may be watching or listening in, a time 
allocation motion is a gag motion used by the government to 
preclude the opposition and the third party from using the time 
normally allocated to them in a parliamentary democracy to 
provide the people of Canada with information about the important 
issue of election organization, and party financing in particular.
<P>
	I will address this first group of motions, stressing that, in our 
opinion, in byelections, the electoral period should remain 47 days. 
I will get right to the point, which is that we need enough time to 
raise public funds for byelections. I might add supporting 
arguments like the fact that some ridings cover very large areas. It 
is true in Quebec and other provinces. In fact, some ridings will be 
even larger come January because of the new electoral boundaries 
coming into effect. And to run a proper campaign worthy of being 
called democratic, more time is needed, given that the parties' 
information campaign cannot play the same role in a byelection as 
in a general election.
<P>
	Coming back to the first point on my list, public financing, I can 
tell you that, as a matter of general policy, the federal government, 
the Liberal government, should have the courage to suggest public 
funding of political parties to Canadians. This is a proposal the 
Parti  Quebecois and the Quebec premier had the courage to make 
to Quebecers in 1977-it was in fact the very first act passed by the 
PQ government-and one they are still congratulating themselves 
for. I might add that even the Quebec Liberal Party was revitalized 
by having to go door to door in an effort to raise funds other than 
large corporate donations, which is the whole point.
<P>
	What does public financing of political parties mean? It means 
that political parties must not rely on large corporations for which 
donations of $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000 are no big deal, 
especially when such donations mean that citizens whose interests 
run counter to those of these large corporations systematically find 
themselves at a disadvantage.
<P>
	Indeed, the fact that the federal Liberal government did not 
include a clause providing for public funding of political parties 
flies in the face of the democratic principle ``one person, one 
vote'', each vote carrying the same weight in deciding the results of 
the election and giving all citizens the same influence on their 
members and their government.
<P>
	Basically, what the federal government is telling us is that it 
plans to continue to seek donations from these major sources of 
capital. It plans to remain under their influence. We will continue 
to be influenced by these major financial backers.
<P>
<B>(1605)</B>
<P>
	Of course, businesses have interests and these interests are often 
jobs. However, their influence is already strong enough without 
having political parties totally surrender to these groups, whose 
interests are not those of the general public.
<P>
	The Liberal Party meant to be liberal, in the broad sense of the 
term. However, it is rather conservative, if not very conservative, 
regarding this issue. What it is doing will tarnish and even 
undermine the real efforts made by candidates and by teams in 
every riding, when confronted to other teams and candidates who 
do not reject such funding.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is very proud of the fact that it got 54 
candidates elected in Quebec, including a record number who got a 
majority of the total number of votes. It just so happens that the 
Bloc Quebecois unilaterally pledged to fund its campaign based on 
the Quebec legislation.
<P>
	I know that, in other provinces, some candidates would really 
like to get elected with the concrete support of ordinary citizens, of 
people who contribute $5, $20 or, when they can afford to do so, 
$100 to exert their democratic influence. Indeed, I have often had 
discussions with members from the other side who would love to 
renew the democratic source of their funding. On this issue, no one 
from the other side can look at us in the eyes and say: ``We are not 
influenced by major financial backers''. No one can do that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6678"> 6678 </A></B>
<P>
	To be sure, we could, if we wanted, find government decisions 
that have been influenced not by citizens who voted according to 
a democratic process, not by organizations that invested time and 
effort in the riding, but by financial backers who went over 
everybody's head, who had easy access to ministers, and who were 
able to send the necessary signals to make sure their position was 
the one that prevailed.
<P>
	You might wonder why we, the Bloc, wish the Canadian 
federation would improve its democracy. I am asking that question 
in front of you because the Canadian people deserves to have a 
system that works according to democratic rules rather than a 
system that pretends to give everyone a vote but that, actually, 
creates the conditions to allow a team to get in power and 
afterwards to act only according to the interests of major players 
who remain hidden while the electoral process goes on.
<P>
	It is all the more so in the case of a byelection, when we need 
time to go about collecting funds. We of the Bloc, in particular, will 
continue to do this.
<P>
<B>(1610)</B>
<P>
	We want to have the time to do it. It might be useless for us to 
hope so, but we continue to hope that the voices will be so loud and 
so numerous on the government side that the government will end 
up adopting this practice, which is a minimum in a democracy.

	<B>Mr. François Langlois (Bellechasse, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, the 
official opposition has two motions in Group No. 5, the Reform 
Party has three. Our first motion, Motion No. 7, is to replace in the 
election legislation the notion of ``résidence ordinaire'' or ``main 
residence'' by that of ``domicile''.
<P>
	We are giving the government the opportunity to flesh out the 
proposition it made following the referendum held on October 30, 
1995. The government passed in this House a resolution to 
recognize in principle the distinctiveness of Quebec with regard to 
language, culture and civil law.
<P>
	With the notion of ``domicile'', we are addressing the third 
characteristic of the distinct society of Quebec, since this is a civil 
law notion. In Quebec, we usually define ``domicile'' as the place 
where the voters have hearth and home, that is where they 
ordinarily reside.
<P>
<B>(1615)</B>
<P>
	However, the elections legislation does not use this civil law 
notion. It seems to me that we need to be consistent, here. Since the 
government took upon itself to  recognize the distinctiveness of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6679"> 6679 </A></B>
<P>
Quebec right after the referendum, it could show it in some 
concrete way.
<P>
	Since property and civil rights are defined in the British North 
America Act, 1867 as a provincial area of jurisdiction, pursuant to 
section 92(13), it would only be reasonable, at least where Quebec 
is concerned, since it availed itself of these provisions to develop 
its own Civil Code, that the notion of ``domicile'' be used as an 
eligibility requirement for voters, along with their age. Otherwise, 
we end up with nothing but wishful thinking expressed in 
November 1995 without any repercussions.
<P>
	When drafting a bill for two nations that vote under a unique set 
of rules of law with different civil law principles, we must take into 
account the Canadian duality between Quebec's civil law and the 
common law of the English provinces, where the concept of main 
residence is very important.
<P>
	Why impose concepts of common law to a province, which has 
had a civil law tradition since Confederation and even before, since 
Quebec's civil code, must I add, was approved by the Parliament of 
a united Canada the year before the federation was born in 1867?
<P>
	Our civil code goes back to 1866. It was amended several times 
since, especially concerning matrimonial regimes. There were the 
great reforms of 1930-31 following the Dorion Report; the 1964 
reforms concerning the community of property, where the husband, 
although he is the administrator of the community, had to have the 
consent of his spouse to continue administering the community, at 
least in general; and the 1970 reform of the matrimonial regimes 
provided for in the civil code.
<P>
	From then on, the partnership of acquests became the legal 
regime in the civil code for spouses without a marriage contract. 
There were also, in the early 1980s, Bill 89, which was passed by 
the National Assembly, and the <I>Loi sur le patrimoine familial</I>, 
which was passed in the late 1980s. This new civil code maintains 
of course the general principles of French law which has always 
applied in Quebec.
<P>
	So why would the government impose upon us legislation which 
is foreign to us under section 92(13)? Why would it force us to 
accept terms which have no basis in our legal system? The Fathers 
of Confederation recognized, in 1867, that Quebec was really a 
distinct society with regard to its civil law. That did not happen in 
October of November 1995. This duality in terms of civil law was 
recognized in 1867 in the founding legislation. Our electoral law 
must respect that.
<P>
	We do not need an electoral law which uses the same words from 
coast to coast for the whole Dominion. The Dominion, in terms of 
civil law, is comprised of nine provinces that have a common law 
system and one province that has a civil law tradition, each system 
having its own merits, of course. We will not debate this any  
further. That was the first motion brought forward by the official 
opposition.
<P>
	The second motion is Motion No. 11. It is just a little strange that 
we should have had to propose this amendment. This provision 
should have been in the bill from the outset. In fact, MotionsNos. 12 and 13 brought forward by the Reform Party, which are in 
the same group, essentially call for the same thing, namely that the 
Chief Electoral Officer of Canada be allowed to use provincial 
lists.
<P>
	The same taxpayers pay for the lists of electors in the provinces, 
where the qualifications of electors are exactly the same, where the 
basic notions to have the right to vote are exactly the same, the 
notion of universal suffrage being applied everywhere in Canada. 
Yet, the bill before us today does not allow the Chief Electoral 
Officer of Canada to use provincial lists if the enumeration was 
conducted more than 12 months before the date on which such lists 
would be used.
<P>
<B>(1620)</B>
<P>
	In other words, in this connection, the bill could have said that 
Canada's chief electoral officer is not authorized to use Quebec's 
list, because the census used to create it was held in September 
1995. The census used to create it will run out next May 1, at which 
time the list will be published, and the list will be as good as 
possible.
<P>
	It will therefore be more than 12 months. It is already more than 
12 months. The federal government will not be able to use this list, 
put together at a cost of several million dollars, because the 
legislator does not wish to recognize the quality of the list drawn up 
by Quebec's director general of elections. The government does not 
wish to assume its responsibilities with respect to this work and to 
legislation that is more forward looking than the federal legislation.
<P>
	They tell us: ``We have not checked the validity of the lists 
drawn up by Quebec. Quebec's lists are prepared for different 
polling divisions''. These are logistical problems, computer 
problems.
<P>
	If Quebec is able to use its permanent list for municipal elections 
in which the polling divisions are completely different, why is it 
not possible to use Quebec's provincial list for a federal election in 
which polling divisions are larger?
<P>
	Let the computer experts work it out, but as a declaration of 
principle, I think it obvious that, in the interests of harmony, and 
also of economy, of the public money for which we are all 
accountable to our constituents, the broadest possible use of 
provincial lists should be permitted. I am not speaking only of 
Quebec's list. It could be Alberta's, or Prince Edward Island's, 
drawn up with the assistance of Elections Canada on top of that. It 
is rather strange to see electoral lists drawn up by Elections Canada 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6680"> 6680 </A></B>
<P>
excluded from use in a federal  election under the pretext that more 
than 12 months may have gone by.
<P>
	The correction proposed in Bill C-63 at the committee stage is 
only a partial one, not allowing the use of the Quebec list of 
electors. In other words, the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada will 
not be able to use the Quebec list of electors for the election of 75 
members of this House.
<P>
	I respectfully submit that the Bloc Quebecois amendment and 
the Reform Party amendment strongly resemble each other. Ours is 
more binding on the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada, in that it 
requires him to attempt to conclude an agreement with the Director 
General of Elections of Quebec, whereas the Reform amendment 
does not go quite as far, requiring the Chief Electoral Officer of 
Canada to check that the provincial voter's register is adequate. If it 
is found to be adequate, he ought then to make use of it.
<P>
	I sense that the hon. member for Calgary West is dying to 
explain his amendment. I shall therefore yield the floor to him, 
with your permission, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
rising to speak on Group No. 5 of the report stage motions relative 
to Bill C-63. As the hon. member for Bellechasse has noted, there 
are five motions in this group, three presented by the Reform Party 
and two by the Bloc Quebecois. They concern three subject 
matters, two of which I was going to address quickly but I think I 
will spend a bit of time on the first one, given some of the remarks 
by the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	Motion No. 7 presented by the Bloc Quebecois is a very 
interesting one. It simply changes the wording in a particular 
section from ``is ordinarily resident'' to ``is domiciled''. As the 
member explained very well, this is a switch from terminology 
used in common law to terminology used in the Quebec civil code. 
At the same time I point to the change away from the terminology 
that is generally used in the Canada Elections Act, not just in this 
section but in other sections and also in the general 
communications of Elections Canada, to terminology more 
specific to the Quebec elections organization. It is a very 
interesting proposal and one which on the surface seems fairly 
trivial. We would tend to oppose it because we believe in keeping 
the terminology the way it is.
<P>
<B>(1625)</B>
<P>
	My colleague from the Bloc Quebecois made an interesting 
observation and I hope that Liberal members were listening to his 
intervention. He said that the change which he is seeking is 
consistent with the government's notion of the distinct society 
clause which was passed through the House late last year. It is 
important because this motion is really the tip of the iceberg. There 
are other motions, which I am sure we will have a chance to  
discuss today, in which the Bloc Quebecois is suggesting that large 
sections of elections law and the referendum act in Quebec would 
supersede, or give guidance to or even in the case of the one in 
question, have veto over federal legislation.
<P>
	This may well be an accurate interpretation of the wording of the 
distinct society motion that this Parliament passed, to which the 
Reform Party was very much opposed. It shows the can of worms 
that the motion is opening.
<P>
	Frankly, on a point like this, a reasonable accommodation could 
be made. It seems perfectly reasonable to me that where notions are 
virtually identical, in the English version of a federal law we could 
use common law terminology and in the French version we could 
use the civil code terminology. As long as the notions are more or 
less the same that would not create a problem.
<P>
	However the member for Bellechasse, by proposing this motion 
and by justifying it the way he has, has raised the broader issue that 
is raised by the distinct society clause, that is, the idea that there 
would be a comprehensive special status for Quebec and that it 
would involve, even on something as important as elections law, a 
completely different relationship between the Government of 
Quebec and the Quebec elections office and the Government of 
Canada and the Canada elections office.
<P>
	That is instructive because the distinct society clause has 
potential problems. The clause as passed by this House was very 
broad in application. It was worded very broadly.
<P>
	The Reform Party-myself and the leader of the Reform 
Party-proposed an amendment to that motion which would have 
made it clear that this particular motion did not give additional 
powers to the Government of Quebec, did not circumscribe charter 
rights and did not grant any kind of status to Quebec which would 
allow it to claim sovereignty under international law. We proposed 
that in an amendment and it was rejected by the government.
<P>
	Although I oppose this motion, the hon. member for Bellechasse 
has made a point which is consistent with the policy of the 
government. That is why the government should be rethinking its 
policy. I suspect that some day somebody will take these matters to 
court to suggest that the distinct society resolution has a wider 
impact on federal law than the government was previously willing 
to admit.
<P>
	Those are my comments on Motion No. 7. I will move on to 
some of the motions which the Reform Party has proposed.
<P>
	Motion No. 13 would delete from Bill C-63 the provision which 
would provide the voters list annually to sitting members of 
Parliament and registered political  parties. We do not believe that 
is in the interests of voters nor is it necessary. We have said all 
along that in creating a register it should only have information 
which is either necessary or highly relevant and it should only be 
used for the explicit purposes for which it was created. In this case 
that is the holding of a federal general election or alternatively, the 
holding of other elections in other parts of the country where there 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6681"> 6681 </A></B>
<P>
is co-operation with provincial, municipal and school board 
elections authorities.
<P>
<B>(1630 )</B>
<P>
	This particular provision in the bill goes entirely against that. 
This provision basically says that the purpose of a register is not 
just for elections but for the ongoing political use by registered 
parties and sitting members of Parliament. It seems to me that is 
not appropriate. Certainly under the act there are uses for which 
this list is prescribed, but if there is wide circulation of these lists, I 
can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that they will be used for all kinds of 
purposes, both political and non-political.
<P>
	An additional concern is why should this additional information 
be provided to incumbents? In several cases when we had 
discussions in committee-and I will not quote members by name 
because these were in camera discussions-we repeatedly raised 
our concerns with several elements of Bill C-63. A number of 
members repeatedly said that as an incumbent this information was 
useful to them which seemed to us, in the case of particular MPs 
and in the case of the government, to be missing the point.
<P>
	The point is that the purpose of an elections list is not to provide 
proprietary information or give advantages to incumbents. That is 
not the purpose. In Reform's view, the provision of a list out of the 
register to MPs or to registered political parties every year is 
improper. That is not the purpose of the list.
<P>
	The permanent register should help to provide lists for the 
purposes of elections at all levels of government across the country, 
not to political parties and not to MPs. Sitting MPs and political 
parties already have some of this data from previous elections and 
they can get it elsewhere. The purpose of this list is not for their 
general political marketing activities. It is important to make that 
point.
<P>
	As the member for Bellechasse mentioned, both he and I have 
proposed motions dealing with a very similar subject. Reform 
Motions No. 8 and No. 12 and Bloc Motion No. 11 would allow the 
chief electoral officer of Canada to use elections lists from other 
registers that may exist in the country for the immediate purposes 
of avoiding a pre-election enumeration across the country which 
would be very costly.
<P>
	I could go on at some length on this point. The particular 
approach in implementing this bill, having a  pre-election 
enumeration before the next election to implement the shortened 
electoral period, is a quick way to start the register but potentially it 
is very expensive. The Reform Party has had some concerns about 
this. We suggested in committee that the government find ways of 
using recent enumerations or other electoral records as a way of 
avoiding a coast to coast enumeration.
<P>
	The government did agree to some amendments in committee 
which would require the chief electoral officer to use lists where 
the enumeration has been conducted within the last year. In the case 
of Alberta and Prince Edward Island we will probably not be 
having pre-election enumerations in those provinces. There is an 
enumeration under way in Alberta as we speak. That represents a 
saving.
<P>
	However the big provinces that are not captured by that 
amendment are Quebec and British Columbia. Quebec and British 
Columbia are developing permanent voters registers. The one in 
B.C. is in place and the one in Quebec will be in place soon. If they 
could be used prior to the next election for the purposes of 
assembling the register, it would obviously save an enormous 
amount of money. These are the second and third largest provinces. 
Together we are talking about roughly one-third of all the ridings in 
the country. It would be a very significant adjustment if this could 
be made.
<P>
	All the Reform Party and Bloc amendments would allow would 
be for the chief electoral officer to have the option of using those 
lists. That option is not provided in the bill now. It is true, as many 
on the government side have pointed out, that there are some 
technical problems with incorporating these lists. It is also true that 
in the time frame the government has given itself, which is the end 
of April, it would be impossible to use those lists, certainly in the 
case of Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1635)</B>
<P>
	What that tells us is that the government should be rethinking 
this approach. It should be looking at an approach which at least 
allows these lists to be used in the first place by the chief electoral 
officer and then looking at the time line, not bringing this system in 
until later in the year in a way that would allow the technical 
obstacles to be overcome. The cost saving would be absolutely 
enormous.
<P>
	It would also be far more consistent with the scenarios that were 
originally laid out before the procedure and House affairs 
committee when draft legislation on this subject was first 
reviewed. It is important to point out that when the government 
originally came to the Reform Party and to the other opposition 
parties with the proposal for a 36 day campaign, the scenarios it 
laid out did not foresee the implementation of a 36 day campaign 
and a permanent register until at least a year after the legislation 
had been adopted.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6682"> 6682 </A></B>
<P>
	The scenario presented to us in this bill came about at the last 
minute. We only became aware of it after the bill was tabled in 
the House. The scenario here is very different from the scenario 
we agreed to.
<P>
	I understand why the government wants to hurry this process. 
However, in hurrying this process and with the particular 
constraints it has provided for itself, the government has created a 
situation where the implementation will actually be significantly 
more costly at the outset rather than saving money. We know there 
are savings in the long run but we can minimize the initial costs by 
proceeding in a way that captures every province that can be 
captured. Obviously if we do it in April we will not capture British 
Columbia or Quebec. If we do it later, we have that option.
<P>
	In any case, the bill should be amended so that the chief electoral 
officer at least has the option of considering usage of those lists if 
circumstances are fortuitous for him.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois amendment differs from our amendment in 
one respect which I think was already mentioned by the hon. 
member for Bellechasse. The difference is that the Bloc 
amendment has a somewhat more constraining tone to it on the 
chief electoral officer than ours. I believe that to be true.
<P>
	We understand the constraints of the chief electoral officer. He 
wants to make sure that we pursue implementation of the register 
with a minimum of risk to the integrity of the voting process and 
the integrity of the compilation process. We understand that is the 
case and we support him in that. Therefore, we want to give him a 
great deal of latitude on this and the Bloc wants to give a little less. 
Our position on this is somewhat more moderate and I would say in 
concluding it is because we are such a moderate party at heart.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to speak to Bill C-63, an act to amend the Canada 
Elections Act and the Referendum Act, at the report stage and more 
specifically to Group No. 5 and Motion No. 11 standing in the 
name of the hon. member for Bellechasse.
<P>
	I fully support his motion to the effect that there should be an 
endeavour to conclude agreements between the Chief Electoral 
Officer of Canada and his provincial counterparts, and especially 
with Quebec's director general of elections, on the use of lists of 
electors.
<P>
	I shall, if I may, add some general comments on this bill. This is 
my first chance to speak in the debate on Bill C-63.
<P>
	The bill will make it possible to establish a permanent register of 
electors and would set the minimum duration of a federal election 
campaign at 36 days. The computerized register of electors will be 
established from information collected by means of an 
enumeration held outside of an electoral period, probably in the 
spring of 1997.
<P>
<B>(1640)</B>
<P>
	A preliminary list will be distributed within five days of issuing 
the writ for the next election. The lists will be used in other, 
subsequent consultations. The election campaign will therefore last 
a minimum of 36 days instead of 47, which is the case today.
<P>
	Let us take a brief look at the history of the federal electoral 
legislation we are about to amend. On October 27, 1964, the federal 
government appointed an advisory committee headed by Alphonse 
Barbeau, with a mandate to inquire into the limitation and control 
of election expenses incurred during federal elections.
<P>
	In its report, the Barbeau committee recommended as follows: 
one, political parties should be legally recognized; two, a degree of 
financial equality should be established among candidates and 
among political parties; three, an effort should be made to increase 
public participation in politics through tax concessions to donors; 
four, costs of election campaigns should be reduced, by shortening 
the campaign period, by placing limitations on expenditures by 
candidates and parties, and by prohibiting the payment of poll 
workers on election day; five, public confidence in political 
financing should be strengthened, by requiring candidates and 
parties to disclose their incomes and expenditures; six, a registry 
should be established to audit and publish the financial reports 
required, and to enforce the provisions of the proposed ``Election 
and Political Finances Act''; seven, miscellaneous amendments to 
broadcasting legislation should be enacted to improve the political 
communications field.
<P>
	These recommendations were implemented at the time of the 
reform of the electoral act in 1974, which included the following 
basic principles: first, a limitation of candidates' expenses; second, 
the publication of contributions to and the expenses of all political 
parties; third, the encouragement of individuals' participation 
through the according of tax credits for political contributions and 
government funding of political parties. These fundamental 
principles continue to underlie the federal electoral act and remain 
in effect.
<P>
	At the end of the 1980s, the Conservative government set up the 
Lortie commission to review the Canada Elections Act. In its 1991 
report, the commission refused to go along with the real and truly 
democratic funding of political parties.
<P>
	Current federal regulations do not cover nomination campaigns, 
leadership campaigns, candidates' political activities prior to 
elections, party trust funds, most riding association activities and 
the activities of interest groups during campaigns.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6683"> 6683 </A></B>
<P>
	Big business is the major contributor to the traditional political 
parties and has the greatest influence on government.
<P>
	I have here a list of contributions to the Liberal Party of 
Canada's campaign fund in 1993. The list of contributors includes 
all the major companies and banks in Canada. The Bank of 
Montreal, for example, contributed $94,000; the Royal Bank, 
$88,000; the Toronto Dominion Bank, $80,000; SCN-Lavalin, 
$73,000; Bombardier, $49,994; Labatt, $62,000; Air Canada, 
$30,000; Nova Corporation of Alberta, $50,000, and so forth.
<P>
<B>(1645)</B>
<P>
	This really shows the influence of companies on policies of a 
government, of a political party. Today, the Liberal Party is funded 
in large part by big business, by the major banks, in Canada, and 
cannot therefore act in the interests of ordinary people, being too 
much influenced already by these political contributions.
<P>
	Passed in 1977, under Premier René Lévesque, the Quebec 
Elections Bill provides that only an individual, not a company, can 
make a contribution. This legislation eliminates the political 
influence that some vested interest groups could have. Obviously, 
the objectives of those vested interest groups are more to change 
the thrust of public policy than to allow a political party whose 
ideology is close to that of a member of those groups to get into 
power, to stay in power.
<P>
	The Quebec Elections Bill limits contributions to $3,000 per 
year, per elector. It is the director general of elections of Quebec 
who monitors the election expenses of political parties. Also, the 
official representative of each party must file a yearly financial 
report with the director general. This report is in the public domain.
<P>
	Bill C-63 draws on the report of the Royal Commission on 
Electoral Reform and Party Financing, that is the Lortie 
Commission. This bill also draws on the recommendations of the 
chief electoral officer of Canada.
<P>
	The permanent list of electors will abolish the need for the door 
to door census we previously had to do before each election. 
Thanks to that list, and the shorter electoral period, the country will 
save $30 million on each election.
<P>
	Finally I would like to say I condemn the government for 
resorting to patronage when dealing with the election of the 
returning officers. Nearly all the officers have been replaced in 
Quebec, even though the chief electoral officer had said some of 
the returning officers should stay.
<P>
	Once again, I suggest that these returning officers should be 
appointed by the chief electoral officer, following a competition, 
just like public servants. For all those reasons, I have some great 
reservations about Bill C-63 and I think I will vote against it.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, one of the 
most interesting things in coming to this House is taking a look at 
the amount of discussion there is over issues that on the surface 
would appear to be rather arcane, even bordering on meaningless. 
Certainly those who may be watching this on TV would ask why 
members are going on and on about the elections act and all of its 
details.
<P>
	In fact this bill is possibly one of the most important bills that the 
House will consider. After all, we live in a democracy. The 
democratic process is one in which the people of any country have 
the opportunity to choose those who are going to be representing 
them, their views and their wishes, in a Chamber such as this where 
the laws the land will be enacted and some will be repealed. This 
place should reflect the values of Canada. That is what this 
Chamber is all about.
<P>
	If we do not take great care and if we do not have great precision 
in the way we construct the way in which members of this Chamber 
will be elected to represent the people of Canada, then we end up 
with things out of balance. We then end up with things in our 
society that simply cannot be changed because there is a higher 
power than this Chamber. And indeed there should never be.
<P>
<B>(1650)</B>
<P>
	In parenthesis I think of the situation in Belarus at this moment, 
where it is my understanding that the president of that country who 
was elected two years ago, has been requesting, demanding in fact, 
and is holding a referendum on whether he should be given more 
and more autocratic power which of course is the exact opposite of 
what a democracy is all about.
<P>
	We took time, care and precision on coming to this bill. I have 
been encouraged by the reports I have received from the member 
for Calgary North who is very capably representing the point of 
view of our party in this debate. I have been encouraged by him to 
understand that there are provisions which we have proposed in 
goodwill to the government and that the government, as we speak, 
is giving serious consideration to supporting those amendments 
that would improve the bill.
<P>
	In a previous intervention I said that we spend a lot of time in the 
House and sometimes end up in very aggressive partisan positions. 
The bill should reflect less partisanship and what we consider to be 
the best interests of the people of Canada.
<P>
	Reform Motion No. 13 would delete the part of Bill C-63 that 
provides for the annual provision of voters' lists to MPs and 
parties. The Reform Party do not believe this is in the best interests 
of or for the benefit of the voters.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6684"> 6684 </A></B>
<P>
	I draw the attention of the House to this because it seems to 
me that the purpose of and the use of voters' lists are very 
restricted. To step outside of those prescribed uses is an illegal 
act. Unless someone is going to break the law and step outside 
the prescribed purposes of the list, what would the value of the 
lists be?
<P>
	I am not looking at it so much from the point of view of the cost 
of the preparation and distribution of the lists, which would 
probably be in the millions of dollars and is an important issue. I 
am more concerned about the actual value of those lists. If they are 
going to be provided to MPs and their parties, what is the actual 
value of the lists if they are not going to be used to the advantage of 
the incumbents, or at the very least, as a marketing tool for the 
political parties? I ask what is the relevance of these lists?
<P>
	I have said that I do not want to be partisan, but again I am going 
to step away from that for a second. Being the heritage critic I am 
familiar with what is presently going on in the distribution of the 
flags under the encouragement of the heritage minister. It has been 
particularly interesting the number of people who have contacted 
my office knowing that my party is concerned about the fact that 
there will be approximately $23 million spent on the distribution of 
these flags all across Canada. People have recognized that it is a 
touchy, feel good thing by the heritage minister that will not 
accomplish anything. However, some things have been happening 
that have given me cause for concern.
<P>
	When the heritage minister was trying to authenticate the 
reasons why the Reforms members who had helped their 
constituents get flags was doing an awful thing, she would stand in 
the House and recite on a riding by riding basis how many flags 
went to a given riding. If the heritage department can prepare lists 
on a riding by riding basis, surely that list in turn can give the name 
and address of where a flag was shipped.
<P>
<B>(1655 )</B>
<P>
	If that information can appear in the heritage minister's hands, it 
could undoubtedly appear on the desk of any member of 
Parliament. Presumably the people who would be most interested 
in this initiative would be Liberal MPs. That gives us an idea of 
how quickly this information could potentially be misused when 
the government of the day uses the Canadian flag as a tool to get a 
list of people. The documents going out to those people are signed 
by members of Parliament. Of course, the individuals who ordered 
the flags have never or seldom been in contact with those members 
of Parliament.
<P>
	With respect to motion No. 13 I ask the question of Liberal 
members: Although we know that the provisions of the bill 
purposely restrict the use of the names and the information on the 
list and although we know that the breaking of those restrictions is 
an illegal act, would we not be safe in assuming that someone 
somewhere would  end up using that list for purposes that are 
outside the prescribed uses of the list?
<P>
	I ask the people of Canada to think about this. If that list is going 
to be circulated to incumbent members of Parliament and to parties 
between elections and, supposedly, those people are not supposed 
to be using the list, then why are we doing it? What is the purpose 
of doing it in the first place?
<P>
	Motion No. 12 would permit the use of existing permanent 
voters' lists in B.C. and Quebec. Again we look at the timeframe 
issue which the hon. member for Calgary West mentioned.
<P>
	The government, for reasons best known to itself, has decided to 
accelerate this process. It allowed only two weeks for this bill to be 
in committee. The House was not sitting during one of those weeks. 
That gives us the idea that maybe there is an agenda.
<P>
	If we permit the use of existing voters' lists in B.C. and Quebec, 
which would reflect, as my colleague has said, one-third of the 
electors of the country, even if we could not meet the arbitrary 
deadline that has been established by the Liberals to rush Bill C-63 
through, with the acceptance of motion No. 12 the expanded 
timeframe would give Elections Canada the opportunity to become 
involved in saving a tremendous amount of money by merging the 
two lists. It only makes sense to merge the lists, not only at the 
federal level but also at the provincial, municipal and regional 
district levels.
<P>
	Motion No. 11 was proposed by the Bloc. That motion is very 
similar to our motion No. 12 which I just described. The difference 
is that it would call for the mandatory use of these lists. We are 
proposing that there be more discretion permitted on the part of the 
federal electoral officer.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to be able to make these 
interventions. For the people who are interested in this debate, I 
hope they realize that as we grind our way through, this is a very 
important bill which has to do with the very foundation of our 
democratic process in Canada.
<P>
<B>(1700)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, before I start, I would like to congratulate the Bloc 
Quebecois member, the member for Bellechasse, for his excellent 
job on the committee that reviewed the bill.
<P>
	I think the member for Bellechasse did his very best to improve 
the bill, to bring it up to par with the elections bill we have had in 
Quebec for several years now, which provides for a fairer and level 
playing field when election time comes around.
<P>
	The member for Bellechasse attempted to show that the time had 
come for the government to modernize this  act. The time had come 
to have a less costly act, an act putting a limit on the political 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6685"> 6685 </A></B>
<P>
influence some pressure groups have on the government. The time 
had come-I would like everyone to listen because this is very 
important-for the government to put a ceiling on contributions. 
The time had come to demand more transparency. Unfortunately, 
we see none of that in the bill.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the Liberal government opposite made no change 
whatsoever. As always, it has hung on to its bad old habits. This 
means that corporations will still be allowed to contribute 
thousands of dollars. Pressure groups will also be allowed to 
contribute money. After the elections, they will have their hands 
tied, as is usually the case in these parts.
<P>
	There is this old saying the Bloc Quebecois likes to quote: ``Tell 
me who is funding you and I will tell you who you work for''. 
Unfortunately when a company contributes, as mentioned 
earlier-the member for Bourassa listed the companies that 
contributed $50,000 and $60,000 to the Liberal government 
opposite-obviously it expects something in return. This might be 
why, from time to time, we end up with policies which make no 
sense whatsoever.
<P>
	This might be why the government adopts policies benefitting 
pressure groups, as was clearly the case with the Pearson deal. 
Regularly, in this place, we ask ourselves the following question: 
``What does it mean when the government proposes such things?'' 
Perhaps we should check to see if a stockholder or a person who 
holds some position in the lobby group has given or is still giving 
large amounts of money to the Liberal government so that it can 
govern the way that group wishes. This is rather appalling in a 
democratic system.
<P>
	The government had an opportunity to bring about some changes 
in this regard, to put more transparency in this. But no, it failed 
again. The government had an opportunity to give some meaning to 
a certain motion on distinct society that was passed in this House, 
and, in that piece of legislation, to give Quebec some additional 
powers.
<P>
	I know that, in the group of motions we are now examining, 
there is the whole issue of ``residence'' and ``domicile''. For the 
information of the Speaker and our viewers, I will read the motion 
that was tabled on November 29, 1995 by the Prime Minister 
himself. We are about to celebrate the first anniversary of that 
motion. It will not be a celebration for us, Quebecers, but only a 
date to forget as quickly as possible. I want you to be aware that, 
since that date, November 29, 1995, nothing has changed. The 
Liberal government is not even able to draft a piece of legislation 
that would be quite easy to prepare to give more power to Quebec, 
in connection with the motion that was passed.
<P>
	That motion read as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Whereas the People of Quebec have expressed the desire for recognition of 
Quebec's distinct society;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(1) the House recognize that Quebec is a distinct society within Canada;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) the House recognize that Quebec's distinct society includes its 
French-speaking majority, unique culture and civil law tradition;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	This is extremely important for what I will be saying now.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) the House undertake to be guided by this reality;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(4) the House encourage all components of the legislative and executive branches 
of government to take note of this recognition and be guided in their conduct 
accordingly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1705)</B>
<P>
	This means that in a piece of legislation similar to the one before 
us, this motion was worth something. If the government motion 
tabled on November 29, 1995, meant anything, some of its key 
elements should be reflected in Bill C-63 we are now debating. 
Most importantly, if Quebec's distinct status was indeed 
recognized, it would have been recognized in this bill by providing, 
among other things, for a minimum 25 per cent representation for 
Quebec, but there is no such thing in there.
<P>
	As for the specific group of motions we are considering, its 
effect on the bill would be to explicitly recognize the fact that, in 
civil law, the concept of residence has no meaning. The bill would 
state that, in Quebec, the place of residence would be referred to as 
suggested by the hon. member for Bellechasse in his proposed 
amendment. The words ``she is ordinarily resident'' could be 
replaced with ``she is domiciled and to vote at the'' local polling 
station. I think this would be a minor change, a very small thing 
really.
<P>
	If the government stood by its own position and the motion to 
recognize Quebec as a distinct society meant anything, the official 
opposition, represented by a Bloc member, would not have had to 
impress this upon the government. The government would have 
automatically acted in accordance with civil law, as clearly stated 
in the motion, which insists that organizations act this way.
<P>
	But instead, a very important aspect of Quebec's civil law, the 
concept of domicile or place of residence, is ignored. I hope the 
government understands. I hope they will have second thoughts 
about this amendment proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, although 
this seldom happens in the House, and eventually decide to vote for 
the amendment so that the word ``domicile'' can be used, making 
this the main point to consider in clause 6 of Bill C-63 amending 
section 53 of the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	I could argue on and on about this. I will limit my comments to 
the group of motions before us, Group No. 5. Another major point 
is the permanent voters list. To effect savings, why not provide in 
the bill some mechanism allowing the use of the permanent list  
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6686"> 6686 </A></B>
<P>
maintained by Quebec and other provinces, as proposed by the hon. 
member for Bellechasse in Motion No. 11?
<P>
	Why have federal officials create a whole new list when Quebec 
already has one. Quebec has paid for this work to be done. I do not 
accept that it is not up to date. If my information is correct, it will 
be on May 1. In any case, the federal government will not start 
work on its own list before April. We could wait for the permanent 
list from Quebec and other provinces where such a mechanism 
exists.
<P>
	Just think of the money we would save. The Minister of Finance 
is trying to save billions in welfare and unemployment costs. This 
is an ideal way to save money by capitalizing on work already 
done, and excellently done as far as Quebec's director general of 
elections is concerned.
<P>
<B>(1710)</B>
<P>
	Why not accommodate this request from the official opposition? 
It is very simple, there are only two minor amendments. If the 
government wanted to be sincere in its sincere approach, and to 
give effect to certain things it has already passed, it would give in 
and approve the amendments moved by my colleague from 
Bellechasse.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I thank 
you for the opportunity to speak again on amendments to the 
Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	In this group of amendments there are two basic principles that 
we are talking about; first, the principle of utilizing voters lists at 
the provincial level and permanent lists which are available to us so 
that we can better identify the constituents who would be on the 
federal list. The idea here is certainly the cost savings that would 
come about because of that.
<P>
	The second principle we are looking at is the matter of whether 
we should provide voters lists to constituencies on an annual basis. 
We ask why we should do that.
<P>
	The Reform Party has moved an amendment saying that there 
does not seem to be a good purpose and therefore we should 
eliminate this provision in the act as suggested by the government 
for annual distribution of updated voters lists to the registered 
political parties.
<P>
	In terms of the B.C. and Quebec voters lists that could be 
available and may be available so that they can be used as the 
federal list, we should think first of all of the savings that could 
occur. If we look at the provinces of Quebec, British Columbia, 
Alberta and Prince Edward Island, just those four lists, some 45 per 
cent of Canadian voters would be on a voters list if we used the 
current lists that are available at the provincial level.
<P>
	The committee that studied this, and this comes as well from the 
electoral officer, said that if we had a permanent voters list in 
Canada we would save something like $14 million. So we are 
looking at the  subsequent election, the one after the one in the 
spring of 1997, to save $14 million.
<P>
	If we could use the lists from the provinces of British Columbia, 
Quebec, Alberta and Prince Edward Island, about 45 per cent of the 
population of Canada, we could save 45 per cent of $14 million in 
the upcoming election, in the 1997 election.
<P>
	We have said a number of times in this House that is most likely 
when the government is going to call the election. It should tell us 
about that rather than keep hiding it. It should tell us that in the 
spring of 1997 there will be an election and then we would all be 
able to prepare accordingly. There could be a saving over $10 
million if those four lists were used.
<P>
	After a presentation by my colleague from Calgary, the 
government has agreed to use the lists from Alberta and Prince 
Edward Island. Now we are saying let us add two more, from 
British Columbia and Quebec, and do everything we can to make 
sure those are added to the permanent voters list of Canada. Look at 
the savings. I think that in itself would merit the support of the 
House of Commons for the amendment as suggested.
<P>
	I think that is the strongest argument. The information is 
available. Why not use it accordingly?
<P>
	If we look at the other amendment before us in terms of the 
voters list being distributed annually, I in my greatest imagination 
cannot understand why the government would want to facilitate the 
distribution of a voters list annually to all the constituencies in 
Canada and as well to every registered political party across this 
nation. What good use is there for that list in the years between one 
election and the next? Its primary purpose is to list people who are 
eligible to vote in an election.
<P>
<B>(1715)</B>
<P>
	We all know that during an election period candidates use the list 
for campaign purposes. That is legitimate. It is used in a variety of 
creative ways to communicate with voters encouraging them to 
support one party and not to support the other parties in the race. 
That is what it is all about.
<P>
	Candidates have to communicate with the voters in some format. 
Some candidates have the facility and the time to phone thousands 
through the voters' lists. During that period the candidate is able to 
make the calls that are necessary and communicate their attitudes 
and their ideas. That is for a good and reasonable purpose.
<P>
	What about in between an election date and the dropping of the 
subsequent writ? What could happen during that period of time? It 
is true we could have these election lists available to all political 
parties. The Reform, Liberals, Bloc Quebecois and the Progressive 
Conservatives, if they have adequate people to do this, could do 
mail outs from the lists.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6687"> 6687 </A></B>
<P>
	What is the purpose and why would this list be provided at 
thousands and thousands of dollars in cost? I know from practical 
experience over the years most of the lists would sit on the shelf 
and never be used at all. Out of the some 301 seats that will exist 
in Parliament after the next election, I am sure if one constituency 
out of the 301 uses the lists in between elections in any practical 
way or any way that is of value to the constituents that would be 
a miracle in itself. I do not see that at all.
<P>
	If a constituency could come up with a good reason to use the list 
between the election date and the dropping of the next writ then I 
suggest that rather than produce these lists in a mass way that we 
should look at an option. The option is that a member, having some 
desire to use the list annually to communicate with his or her 
constituents, put money up front and pay the basic cost for the 
production of that list.
<P>
	If it costs the Elections Canada office $1,000, $2,000, $5,000 or 
whatever the cost to produce the list, it should be done at cost. 
Elections Canada should not make a profit. Then that member 
should send a cheque to Elections Canada and say why and for what 
purpose that member would like a list of electors. The member 
could enclose a cheque for $1,000 or $5,000, whatever is 
established by Elections Canada. Elections Canada could transfer 
either the list or software to the member of Parliament at that point. 
I believe that would be adequate and look after some special need 
that I cannot think of at the present time. That would certainly 
serve the purpose.
<P>
	Failing to amend the legislation in that light, if the government 
just leaves it as it is at the present where it says every year we turn 
the crank and an updated list is sent to every constituency in 
Canada, to me that is not good enough. I would have to vote against 
that kind of provision in the act. We should deal with the issue now. 
We should amend it so that no lists are provided between the date 
of the election and the dropping of the next writ, or we should make 
a provision in the act whereby a constituency, if necessary, can cite 
a good reason and purchase the list at cost from Elections Canada. 
That would satisfy the need of those kinds of persons.
<P>
<B>(1720)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Zed (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
have been listening with great interest to certain aspects of this 
debate. It might be helpful to put a few of my points of view on the 
record, particularly to let my colleagues in the opposition know 
that there is still some interest in some of the issues they have 
raised.
<P>
	Things are not cast in stone. They obviously are not black and 
white. We are trying to develop a consensus. We continue to 
welcome the interventions of both opposition parties, particularly 
by the members who participated in the debate at the committee 
stage.
<P>
	In principle I have a great deal of sympathy for the point of view 
expressed by my colleague from Calgary West relating to the 
byelection campaign period. There may be some way to make 
some accommodation on that matter as the days progress. I note 
that byelections are covered by the Parliament of Canada Act, not 
this act as my hon. colleague knows. That act is not being debated 
at the moment.
<P>
	The motion in the name of my colleague from Bellechasse in this 
group talks about the concept of domicile. As my hon. colleague 
knows, the concept of domicile is not found in the Canada 
Elections Act. The entitlement to vote in a federal election is in part 
based on the fact of being ordinarily resident in a polling division. 
The term ordinary resident is fully defined in sections 56 to 62 of 
the Canada Elections Act.
<P>
	I was pleased to hear several members opposite say that in 
principle they supported the establishment of a register. All parties 
have had a consensus that a register makes a lot of sense for a 
modern Canadian democracy that is evolving. It is a much more 
efficient way and a cost effective way. I hope over the course of 
several electoral events that dozens or tens of millions of dollars 
will be saved by the establishment of a registry.
<P>
	I listened with great interest to the comments made by the House 
leader for the Reform Party. It is important for the record to show 
that the reason the Alberta and Prince Edward Island lists were 
considered to be more consistent with this legislation was based on 
the freshness of information that was coming from both of those 
electoral districts.
<P>
	It is important to remember that while the British Columbia and 
Quebec lists may very well work, unfortunately due to the time 
frame of when this bill would come into force, presuming it 
receives approval in the other place, the information that would be 
on the British Columbia and Quebec lists would not be as fresh. 
The best information when the officials were at the procedure and 
House affairs committee was that the quality of the information 
would be less than perfect.
<P>
<B>(1725 )</B>
<P>
	It was for that reason the government felt that the Alberta list and 
the Prince Edward Island list would be appropriate. It is not 
inconsistent to establish a federal registry by using provincial lists. 
I have agreed with that point of view all along. There can be some 
significant cost savings at the provincial level and even at the 
municipal level, depending on which region of the country is able 
to use the federal registry.
<P>
	We want to build the first federal register with the most current 
voter information. This is why we will only use provincial lists that 
have been completed through a door to door enumeration within 
the last 12 months of the date of the last federal enumeration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6688"> 6688 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, while I understand the points of view that have been 
raised by my hon. colleagues, for the record I wanted to draw that 
to everyone's attention.
<P>
	Motion No. 9, moved my hon. colleague from Bellechasse, 
makes it mandatory for incarcerated electors to provide their 
names, sex and date of birth. It is important to acknowledge that in 
Canada we have a system of voluntary registration. Bill C-63 is 
based on the principle that electors voluntarily would provide that 
information. Therefore, there is no mandatory obligation to provide 
that in the bill. I want to offer that comment to the motion of my 
hon. colleague.
<P>
	Motion No. 10 is moved by the hon. member for Calgary West. 
Once again I want to draw the House's attention to the fact that the 
privacy commissioner and the chief electoral officer have informed 
the procedure and House affairs committee that gender information 
is useful as an administrative identifier for electors who have 
names that are common to both sexes. Obviously in French and 
English we can all think of names that may be somewhat confusing 
from a gender point of view.
<P>
	It is also important to mention that the privacy commissioner did 
not see the voluntary collection of privacy information as a 
significant issue as it relates to gender and did not recommend it.
<P>
	My hon. colleague from Kootenay East has made a very strong 
case for that. Again, at this point in the day, I want to acknowledge 
the points of view that he has raised, particularly as it relates to the 
security and privacy of women. No one would argue with the 
member for Kootenay East due to his size or his sex, but other 
people may feel a little intimidated. However, I want to tell my 
hon. colleague that we have been listening very carefully and if 
there are ways that we can consider some accommodation we are 
still open to it at this point.
<P>
	The maintenance of the federal registry is something that I 
believe is also contained in Motions Nos. 12 and 13. The use of the 
federal list is also contained there. I want to once again remind my 
hon. colleagues that what we are trying to do with this legislation is 
to ensure that Canadians have the most modern and most current 
information before them. The best information, as it has been 
presented by the officials at Elections Canada, is information that is 
brought forward on a 12-month basis.
<P>
	Therefore, it is not to try to prejudice any particular group in the 
country. I notice that both British Columbia and Quebec would find 
their lists not as current as Alberta and Prince Edward Island. It was 
for that reason that the government moved in that direction.
<P>
<B>(1730)</B>
<P>
	I believe that sums up some of the comments I wish to contribute 
to the debate. I thank my hon. colleagues and ask for their patience 
as the days move forward on this important matter, amendments to 
Bill C-63.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, unless 
I am mistaken, the list in question will not be used for the next 
election, but for the following one, which is a number of years 
away, probably seven or so.
<P>
	The feeling of urgency expressed by the member opposite makes 
me wonder somewhat. It is as though he wants to justify the fact 
that election lists made by the provinces, including the state of 
Quebec, are not being used. The member sounds like he wants to 
eliminate or avoid the use of these lists when he says that they will 
not be ready for the next election. However, this is not the issue. 
This is not the object of the legislation before us. We are talking 
seven years down the road.
<P>
	In all fairness, the hon. member opposite should consider using 
provincial lists to ensure a better use of public moneys. We keep 
talking about avoiding duplication. Here is an excellent 
opportunity to do things right, because we have the time to do so. 
We have several years ahead of us to set up a fair system.
<P>
	You will agree with me that this is not a list that Quebec will be 
able to use in the context of a federal election, given that, seven 
years from now, our province will likely have become a sovereign 
state. Still, the arguments raised by Reform Party members make 
sense. Indeed, whether we are talking about the Canada of today or 
the Canada of tomorrow, it makes sense to make better use of 
public moneys. Therefore, we should immediately start planning to 
use provincial lists.
<P>
	This brings me to make a comment. You will recall that, in 
Quebec, we experienced certain problems. For example, on a 
number of occasions, residents from another province voted in 
Quebec by using their secondary residence, a cottage or what have 
you, or some other scheme.
<P>
	If there was only one list and only one source of data within each 
province, this kind of double residency status that allows a person 
to vote in two different jurisdictions would no longer exist. I 
imagine that if these things happen in Quebec with out of the 
province residents, they must also occur in other provinces.
<P>
	So, while the issue of a single list is first and foremost a matter 
of making good use of public moneys, it also ensures having 
reliable information. With two lists and two sets of data, 
consistency will be a challenge. But if we have only one list and 
specified, well identified data sources, a higher level of integrity 
will be possible, and it will be that much easier to monitor and 
maintain that integrity in our list.
<P>
	It is a better solution from all points of view. Not only costs will 
reduced, but we will also have a better quality list. The process the 
government party is suggesting has two flaws.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6689"> 6689 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1735)</B>
<P>
	Expenses will be duplicated. Surely, we cannot afford to spend 
money we do not have, especially if expenses are duplicated. 
Furthermore we will end up with lists whose integrity will never be 
assured. In fact we are quite certain their integrity will not be 
adequate. Comparisons will be made between both lists and 
inconsistencies will remain.
<P>
	In this House today, we have an opportunity to implement a 
smarter process that will save taxpayer dollars. The Canadian list 
will be made up from provincial lists, and the level of integrity will 
be extremely high.
<P>
	I repeat that Quebec will probably never have to use such a list, 
but I think that, at this time, this is what should be done out of 
respect for taxpayers who pay for government operations. This is a 
golden opportunity to use cautiously taxpayer dollars, reduce costs, 
and in the process, get more for our money. Opposition parties are 
fully playing their role of looking after the public interest.
<P>
	I cannot understand why the government party seems to think or 
rather insists that provincial guarantees are inadequate. It is 
deliberately ignoring better solutions, and refusing co-operation 
and a better use of taxpayer dollars.
<P>
	I cannot understand why. It is really strange. You will pardon my 
persistence, but I will ask once more the government party to 
reconsider. This list will be used seven years from now. It seems to 
me we have all the time we need to do things correctly, and I cannot 
understand why we should not do it. In conclusion, I hope the 
wisdom that prevails in opposition parties will also prevail in the 
government party.

	He said: Madam Speaker, since there are eight motions in this 
group, I will call upon the generosity of my colleagues to speak on 
items that I will certainly overlook. A little earlier, my colleague 
from Calgary West gave an interesting and intelligent speech on the 
concept of distinct society.
<P>
	If there is one thing we can be sure of when the hon. member for 
Calgary West addresses a problem, it is that he will ask the real 
question. There were no false pretence or political dodging when 
he spoke on the concept of distinct society and on what it could 
represent.
<P>
	The first intrinsic notion we refer to when we speak of a distinct 
society is the one outlined in the 1987 Meech Lake agreement. 
What was this notion of distinct society? It was a clause that would 
have been entrenched in the Canadian Constitution affirming the 
distinct nature of Quebec. This clause in the Constitution would 
have had precedence over the distribution of powers between the 
federal government and the provinces. Any interpretation of the 
Constitution would have taken into account the notion that Quebec 
is a distinct society.
<P>
	This has nothing to do with the unfortunate motion mentioned 
earlier by the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm and passed by 
a majority in this House on November 29, 1995, as part of an 
exercise in wishful thinking on the recognition of distinct society. 
We see today that even the bill now before us does not reflect the 
civil law concept of domicile. We must take these things into 
account.
<P>
<B>(1745)</B>
<P>
	But the concept of distinct society is everywhere in this group of 
motions. What do we want to do? First, we want the Canada 
Elections Act to contain provisions similar to those in the Quebec 
Elections Act on the financing of political parties to be sure that, at 
the federal level as in Quebec, only eligible voters can fund 
political parties. We want to ensure that large and small 
corporations, unions, and lobby groups can no longer legally fund 
political parties.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer of Quebec, Pierre F. Côté, when he 
appeared before the House Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs, had given a clear answer to the hon. member for 
Calgary West. What is important in Quebec's election bill is to 
define properly what we want. Shall it be one person one vote, or 
one buck one vote?
<P>
	In Quebec, in the last 20 years-it will be 20 years next 
year-all governments have respected a principle now  well 
established in Quebec's political custom, a principle according 
which no corporation, union or pressure group can provide funding 
for a political party. Only an eligible voter can do it, to a maximum 
of $3,000, according to Quebec's laws.
<P>
	It took some courage for a newly elected government to 
undertyake such a reform, in 1977, because it is not easy to 
organize funding by the population, to go and visit your 
constituents week after week, to ask them how they judge your 
performance, to ask them also to support you financially.
<P>
	The recall procedure, for the Bloc Quebecois as well as other 
Quebec political parties, is a year-long process because you sound 
out your constituents quite well when you ask them one by one to 
contribute $20, $50 or $100, and not $60,000, like the hon. member 
for Bourassa mentioned earlier.
<P>
	You would need 600 constituents contributing $100 each to 
equal a big $60,000 cheque donated by a company. It is much 
easier. But then debts can be called in. It is a lot more difficult for a 
political party to say no to someone who donated heavily to its 
campaign fund than to someone who made more modest 
contributions. This is the purpose of one of our amendments.
<P>
	We have moved that amendment to avoid the sort of hurried 
debates we are having today, where the only consultations there 
were were made at the last minute and where everyone is running 
about every which way to see if it would not possible to obtain an 
eleventh hour concession that could make the bill acceptable and 
save a few clauses with cosmetic changes, when in fact the whole 
process was flawed from the start and Elections Canada and the 
government ventured dangerously close to conflict of interest, if 
they did not actually have one.
<P>
	If the amendment we are proposing today had been adopted, the 
House would get advance notice when the government wants to 
amend the Elections Act. Political parties should be consulted 
before the introduction of a bill on election legislation. As I will 
repeat tomorrow at third reading of Bill C-63, neither the official 
opposition nor the Reform Party were consulted. It is a partisan bill 
that will lead to a partisan decision.
<P>
	We will also propose to amend the referendum legislation, Bill 
C-110, which gives a veto to almost everybody and which at the 
time I called a big fat chicken with legs for everybody, so that the 
veto clearly applies to referendums.
<P>
	This is to say that before calling a federal referendum, the 
federal government will have to have the approval of the regions 
and the provinces, including Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, 
two western provinces representing 50 per cent of the population 
and two Atlantic provinces representing 50 per cent of the popula-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6692"> 6692 </A></B>
<P>
tion. As for the question to be asked, the approval of the provinces 
will be required.
<P>
	Second, there will have to be agreement regarding the results. 
The federal government will not be able to give effect to a vote on a 
referendum question if any of the groups I mentioned has objected 
to the question.
<P>
<B>(1750)</B>
<P>
	Finally, we propose that, if the result of a referendum held under 
provincial legislation differs from the result of a referendum held 
under federal legislation, the one held under provincial legislation 
will prevail, thus demonstrating that it is the provinces that created 
the federal government and not the reverse, in case this has been 
forgotten.
<P>
	My grandfather would puff on his clay pipe and tell me to 
remember that confederation was the creation of the provinces, that 
the federal government was not responsible for our existence. 
Almost everyone in Canada has heard once in his life that the 
federal government was a creation of the provinces.
<P>
	We have created a monster of such proportions that it now thinks 
it created everything, when the reverse is in fact true. It was the 
provinces that gave birth not to Canada but to the constitutional 
government that we know today. Contrary to a certain widely held 
philosophy, Canada was not created in 1867. It existed before that.
<P>
	It existed when your Acadian ancestors, Madam Speaker, were 
there, long before the constitutional order of 1867 existed, long 
before the Europeans arrived. The First Nations were here when 
Canada came to be. To think that Canada has been in existence only 
since 1867 or that it will fall apart because of a constitutional 
reform is to misjudge tradition, the history that forged the soul of 
this people. It will withstand another constitutional reform.
<P>
	My colleagues can add to what I have said. I have tried to deal 
with the eight motions in Group No. 6, which cover the Bloc 
Quebecois's major amendments. I would again like to congratulate 
the member for Calgary West for his solid understanding of the 
problem I am raising concerning distinct society. He is not in 
agreement with me, and I am not in agreement with him. But at 
least he is asking the real questions and giving a genuine response, 
as he sees it, unlike the people across the way, who pretend not to 
understand the problems. They sidestep the issue, because they are 
too afraid of what lies beneath the surface.
<P>
	It is true that distinct society is a term that gives Quebec greater 
powers, that makes it possible to interpret the Canadian 
Constitution so that the division of powers provided in sections 91 
and 92 of the present Constitution would be set aside and 
precedence given to an interpretive clause of this sort. In this 
regard, the hon. member for Calgary West is right.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am rising to speak on the Group No. 6 amendments to Bill C-63. 
All eight of these motions have been proposed by the Bloc 
Quebecois.
<P>
	As the hon. member for Bellechasse has indicated, these motions 
cover a wide range of subject matter and are obviously of major 
significance. I would share his concerns about the entire process 
here. It does seem to be unfortunate that in reviewing elections 
legislation we are essentially restricted to discussing matters of this 
scope and importance in only a few minutes before we move on to 
voting on the bill on a timetable imposed by the Liberal 
government.
<P>
	I am very concerned about the partisanship in this. It is 
something we had hoped to address. As I have said repeatedly in 
this debate, we had hoped to be able to support this legislation but 
we are still not in a position where we can do that.
<P>
	Having said that I do have grave reservations about most of these 
amendments, the one motion which I believe my party can support 
is Motion No. 29. Motion No. 29 goes to the heart of this concern 
about partisanship. This particular motion by the Bloc Quebecois 
would require the government to consult the House and specifically 
the opposition parties for future amendments to this act. That has 
been a practice in the past and I think it is a practice we should 
continue and in a serious way get back to.
<P>
	I will reiterate what the member for Bellechasse said on Friday. I 
think it is ridiculous in a mature and democratic country that 
elections legislation would be imposed at the end of a Parliament. 
The rules of the game change by only one player, presumably for 
its own benefit. That is not the way elections law works in an 
advanced democratic society.
<P>
	Nevertheless, I do want to take some time to address some of 
these other motions. These other motions have to do with a range of 
subjects but generally speaking, what they attempt to do in my 
opinion is to impose much of Quebec's electoral legislation and 
Quebec's election practices on the federal government. This is a 
much more radical view of federalism than either I or my party 
would subscribe to.
<P>
<B>(1755)</B>
<P>
	In this House there are three very different views of 
Confederation which come out over and over again.
<P>
	One is the view of the Bloc Quebecois which on a certain level 
has been not just the view of two founding nations, but a view that 
this is very much a confederal arrangement and everything that 
goes on federally is really a creature of the provinces. In effect the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6693"> 6693 </A></B>
<P>
federal government really should only communicate with citizens  
through the provinces. That is one of the extreme positions.
<P>
	The other extreme position is the historic position of the Liberal 
Party which is very much a centralist position. I know in Quebec 
the Liberals refer to themselves as federalists. This often makes the 
debate confusing because in fact they are not really federalists. The 
Liberal Party historically has been a centralist party which views 
the provinces as little more than units of administration, but not as 
entities that have sovereignty in their own areas of jurisdiction, 
which in fact we would maintain is the case under the Constitution.
<P>
	The Reform Party view is of a federal state where both the 
provinces and the federal government are entities with clear powers 
in their own jurisdictions. Both have rights to communicate with 
their citizens directly.
<P>
	I will deal with these amendments randomly because I want the 
House to understand how radical some of them are. For example, 
Motion No. 32 would amend the referendum act so that the regions 
would have a veto over a referendum question posed by the federal 
government. The formula laid out here is the five region formula 
that was in the government's bill on constitutional referendums, 
Bill C-110, at the end of the last session.
<P>
	This goes much further than that. Bill C-110 was a formula for 
the approval of constitutional amendments. This is not a formula 
for the approval of a referendum question. We all realize the 
referendum act at the federal level, as in Quebec, is merely a 
consultative device. This is an approval process for a question to be 
asked of the people of Canada by the federal government. I do think 
this is an extreme position by the Bloc Quebecois. My Bill C-341 
challenges the belief that the Government of Quebec can ask a 
binding question that concerns the future not just of Quebec but of 
all of Canada in Quebec only and on its own terms.
<P>
	Yet this particular motion tries to put in the elections act and the 
referendum act a motion which would proscribe the ability of the 
federal government to ask a question of Canadians without the 
prior approval of the Quebec government. I cannot think of a 
motion that someone could put in here that is more unacceptable to 
Canadians outside of Quebec. In fact it is unacceptable not just in 
the case of Quebec; to me, the idea that the Government of Ontario 
or the Government of British Columbia could veto the wording of a 
referendum question across the country is absolutely outrageous.
<P>
	The federal government has referred some of the Quebec 
government's constitutional agenda to the supreme court. There is 
a need in the opinion of the Reform Party for the federal 
government to be able to pose direct questions to the people of 
Quebec on the issue of sovereignty and separation if we are looking 
at another referendum down the road.
<P>
	In the past, the Government of Quebec has not only posed 
questions which we believe have been fundamentally misleading, 
but also it has posed questions and has an agenda behind those 
questions which is clearly illegal and unconstitutional under 
Canadian law. It is more than appropriate, in fact it is essential in 
our view, that the federal government not only retain but also 
exercise its right to consult the people of Quebec directly on their 
real opinions on things like the issue of separation and on notions 
like a unilateral declaration of independence. I cannot imagine a 
proposed amendment to this bill that would be more unacceptable 
than this one.
<P>
	Motion No. 35 is similar to Motion No. 32. Motion No. 33, like 
Motion No. 24, is a motion of wide application. It would 
effectively impose wide sections of Quebec electoral law upon the 
federal government, specifically those sections dealing with party 
financing. It would apply the financing provisions of Quebec's 
electoral law not just to federal elections but to federal referendums 
as well.
<P>
<B>(1800 )</B>
<P>
	Let me go over some of the provisions. A lot of them concern 
matters which are already covered in federal elections law such as 
the role of auditors and party agents in making financial reports.
<P>
	Some of these rules have broad sweeping content. For example, 
these are the rules that restrict fundraising to individuals. Corporate 
bodies, unions and organizations cannot contribute to political 
parties. It provides for public financing of political parties directly, 
based on percentage of vote, and deems what kind of non-financial 
contributions count as political contributions. It restricts the ability 
of people to contribute to political parties to no more than $3,000 in 
a single year.
<P>
	Some of these notions I could support. I have never had a 
problem with the concept that only voters should contribute to 
political parties. However, these amendments are of a wide and 
sweeping nature and we do not have time to debate them. Suffice it 
to say there would not be anywhere near consensus in the House on 
some of these restrictions.
<P>
	The chief electoral officer of Quebec explained to the committee 
that there is a history behind the development of some of the 
electoral practices in Quebec. They were designed to clean up the 
corruption which we saw, particularly prior to the quiet revolution. 
There have been great advances made in Quebec, but the fact of the 
matter is that in our view some of these proposals have problems of 
their own and would be regressive if applied to the rest of the 
country. We would be very resistant to some of these ideas, 
certainly if there were not an opportunity for further discussion.
<P>
	There is a great deal of material here and further Reform 
speakers will have a chance to address it.
<P>

<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to speak to this group of motions to amend Bill C-63, an act 
to amend the Canada Elections Act and the Referendum Act. This 
group of motions deals particularly with political party funding. 
However, I would like to say a few words on other aspects of the 
bill before dealing with the ones now before us.
<P>
	First of all, it is a good thing to shorten the campaign. Means of 
communications are a lot more advanced than they used to be. This 
shortening should make it possible for everybody to have a bit of 
energy left at the end of the campaign and to be ready to get down 
to work the next day.
<P>
	That having been said, there are still things that could be 
improved in this bill. A lot of amendments were brought forward. 
For example, in Quebec, we have a permanent register of electors. 
Now the federal government wants its own list when it could have 
used the existing lists. People have been enumerated on several 
occasions in recent years, particularly in Quebec. Enumeration has 
almost become an annual event. On top of that, Statistics Canada 
conducted its regular census last spring.
<P>
	A lot of money has been wasted over the last few years. It may 
have been a lack of vision on our part not to move faster towards 
the establishment of a permanent computerized list. We are now 
moving in that direction. However, that has already been done in 
Quebec. It would simply be a matter of making the necessary 
adjustments for the list to reflect federal ridings instead of 
provincial ridings. With today's technology, there is no reason not 
to proceed with these adjustments, which would save us a lot of 
money.
<P>
	There is an amendment that would have been desirable and even 
important, one that has been moved and discussed on many 
occasions by the Bloc Quebecois. It is the issue of political party 
funding. It is a rule that we already comply with.
<P>
<B>(1805)</B>
<P>
	The law in Quebec limits the financing of political parties by 
ensuring that only individuals can contribute limited amounts. This 
is a way to avoid becoming the victims or lapdogs of large 
corporations which have the means to make financial 
contributions. Every year a list of financial donations, some of 
which amount to $100,000 or more, is published, not to mention 
the donations which do not appear on the list or are divided among 
different branches, subsidiaries and the like.
<P>
	So we could have seized this opportunity to make a valuable 
contribution to the legislation by adding provisions on the 
financing of political parties. I say we could have done so and there 
will be opportunities to do so with the amendments proposed, but 
there does not  seem to be much will on the government side to 
proceed in this way. It is not the first time that Parliament has had 
an opportunity, since the last general election, to vote on a much 
more democratic act regarding the financing of political parties.
<P>
	What is the reason for this? We have to understand the dynamics 
of this issue and I believe it is worth explaining to the public why it 
is preferable to have political parties financed solely by 
individuals.
<P>
	Generally speaking, people who give money to political parties 
do so because they believe in the goals they pursue. In the case of 
the Bloc Quebecois, a goodly number of sovereignists actively 
support the idea of a party in Ottawa which defends sovereignty 
and defends the interests of Quebec. There is a reason why they 
contribute and campaign. They are entitled to be active within the 
party, to take part in meetings, and so on, while at the same time 
financing the party. They therefore have a vested interest. They 
give money, contribute, buy memberships, because of that interest. 
This allows them to express support of a cause, a commitment to 
specific policies defended by a political party.
<P>
	And what about those who contribute $50,000. $75,000 or 
$80,000 to a political party? Are we to believe it is out of altruism, 
out of charity, that they give so much? I doubt it. Most people, 
when they look at that, also wonder just what axe they have to 
grind. These are often very active people, with their own lobbyists, 
people that pressure the government, the cabinet, individual 
ministers. Then they get the changes that they want, ones that bring 
them results. They practically do a cost-effectiveness study-I 
contribute $50,000 and then I get a bit more than that back, often a 
lot more.
<P>
	Is this how we want political parties to be funded within a 
democratic system? Absolutely not. As long as they are able to 
receive these contributions, this is certainly how it will be. The 
parties will be at the mercy of lobbyists, of organizations that are 
far better organized financially. One needs only look at the present 
situation, where for instance there will be a debate next year on the 
Bank Act, while we are living through a great many economic 
difficulties around job creation or maintaining a decent social 
security safety net. Meanwhile, we see some institutions that are in 
better shape than ever before, making more profits than they ever 
did.
<P>
	We saw this during the past few weeks. Anyone who is a bit 
more familiar with the stock market will know that people are still 
investing massively in the banking sector because it is very 
profitable. There may be a problem at some point, but they can 
afford it. If you look at the contributions to the government party 
and add up this column of figures, it is also very profitable for the 
Liberal Party to be on good terms with these people.
<P>
	Of course it is a lot harder when you have to do your fundraising 
with donations of $10 and $15, $20 and $5.  It takes a long time. To 
collect $100,000 this way takes time, energy and a good 
organization. But it does force members to be closer to the 
grassroots and realize that they have to defend the interests of Mr. 
and Mrs. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="6695"> 6695 </A></B>
<P>
Average, as opposed to a business which makes a lot of money, 
donates only a very small fraction of its profits to a political party 
but certainly expects something in return.
<P>
	The system can never be perfect because these people will 
always try, in a roundabout way, to exercise pressure and to lobby. 
We cannot avoid that. However, to legislate against it would put on 
a lot of pressure. Those who do not comply with the legislation will 
be liable to severe penalties and have to pay the political price for 
failing to comply with the legislation governing political parties.
<P>
<B>(1810)</B>
<P>
	I have no doubt that in the end, adopting such amendments 
would ensure that political parties, especially the big parties we 
know such as the Liberal Party, or those we used to know, I should 
have said, like the Conservative Party and others, have to get closer 
to the grassroots which does not give as much but would require a 
better organized and more permanent political organization.
<P>
	This would prevent situations of the kind that arose at the last 
convention of the Liberal Party which I had a chance to attend, 
where people slapped each other on the back and said we are the 
best and everything is fine, while out in the street, many citizens 
are experiencing problems and wondering why the federal 
government refuses to make any commitments and set objectives 
to improve the economy and the employment situation. And yet 
they say everything is fine.
<P>
	Of course, when we get people who are more connected to 
reality and did not pay $500 to register for this convention, they 
will tell us something entirely different from what we might want 
to hear, but that is normal, that is healthy, it stimulates discussion 
and makes politicians do more and have a greater concern for the 
redistribution of wealth and for other areas by which people are 
affected.
<P>
	The question we might ask, because it seems clear that it is a 
better system, is how is it that no one in this party-or, in any case 
as we will see shortly, perhaps a few-why are there not more 
people, particularly among those in authority, supporting the idea?
<P>
	Obviously, because it would cut off major sources of revenue for 
their party, and they know very well how it works. It is easy. It 
provides a network and it also allows future party candidates to 
establish a network to eventually reach the position of Prime 
Minister.
<P>
	So they look for funding everywhere, and in significant amounts. 
This is no longer appropriate. We are coming up to the year 2000, 
and we must modernize our political  institutions. One way to do 
so, clearly, is to ensure political parties are funded democratically.
<P>
	We limit ourselves to public funding. It is not always easy, as 
those who work in our political organizations can testify. The 
funding campaigns we wage year in and year out put us in 
permanent contact with people who comment on the government's 
action and on our own, when we come to call.
<P>
	This is what it means to build a democratic system where people 
have a little more influence than merely a vote every four or five 
years. There is ongoing contact between the voter and the political 
parties and this encourages people to participate in democracy, that 
is, to follow what is going on, to be aware, and enables us to 
maintain contact and thus have a broader base. It promotes a 
healthier democracy.
<P>
	I urge those whose mind is not already set to draw the necessary 
conclusions and make a move they can think back on with pride 
when they have retired from politics. Admittedly, it is often 
frustrating for government members not to be able to influence the 
course of things as much as they would like, because the power is 
concentrated in the hands of the cabinet, of those who cash the 
cheques and get the money. Today, they can ensure they will be 
able to say that they helped pass a bill of historic significance, by 
changing how political parties are financed.
<P>
	At some future date, they will be able to say: ``I was there when 
this bill was passed'', instead of having to say: ``I was in hiding'' or 
admitting to voting as they were told so as not to cause 
embarrassment to their party. I can see there are many members on 
the other side, including members from Quebec. I am looking 
forward to seeing how they will vote, because, in Quebec, political 
parties have to comply.
<P>
	By members from Quebec, I mean the few Liberal members 
remaining in Quebec. I am curious to see how they will vote and 
how they will explain to their voters that they did not want to 
submit to a democratic financing system, when this is the norm we 
set for ourselves in Quebec a long time ago.
<P>
	This issue was settled through legislation passed by the 
Lévesque government. Of course, here, things move more slowly. 
We sovereignists would be quite proud to make it our legacy, 
before leaving this Parliament, to help modernize democracy, 
through public financing. I am pleased to see some members 
nodding. Perhaps all it would take is ten or fifteen minutes more to 
turn a few of them around.
<P>
<B>(1815)</B>
<P>
	I will conclude by urging those few progressive Liberals 
opposite to support the amendments moved by the Bloc Quebecois 
to put in place a democratic public financing system. I think that 
they would be quite proud of themselves for doing so when they go 
to bed tonight.
