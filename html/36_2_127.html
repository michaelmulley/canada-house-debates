</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Svend J. Robinson (Burnaby—Douglas, NDP)</B> moved for 
leave to introduce Bill C-501, an act to amend the Marriage 
(Prohibited Degrees) Act (marriage between persons of the same 
sex). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I have the honour of tabling a bill today 
which would amend federal law to recognize the right of gay and 
lesbian people to marry.  Currently federal common law restricts 
the institution of marriage to marriage between one man and one 
woman.  This is a clear denial of the right to equality for gay 
and lesbian people extended under the charter of rights and 
freedoms which, by the way, was pioneered by the late Prime 
Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time is long overdue for recognition that the relationships 
of gay and lesbian people are just as strong, just as loving and 
just as committed as those of heterosexual couples.  The bill in 
no way diminishes the strength of heterosexual marriage.  It does 
not in any way affect the religious status of marriage.  It would 
amend federal law to ensure full equality for gay and lesbian 
couples and to extend to those of us who are involved in 
relationships the right to marry under federal law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motions deemed adopted, bill read the first time and 
printed) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Would the hon. member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt tell the Chair which of the bills standing in 
his name on the order paper he is proposing to introduce? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B> Mr. Speaker, I gave notice of this on 
Friday.  I am not sure exactly what number has been assigned to 
it.  It is an act to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I would like to inform the hon. 
member that the only bills we have on notice at the moment are an 
an act to amend the Canada Elections Act (hours of polling in 
Saskatchewan) and an act to amend the Parliament of Canada Act 
and the Canada Elections Act (fixed election dates). 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand that notice may have been given yesterday of a bill 
and if that is the case it would not be on the order paper for 
introduction until tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am told the hon. member did file his notice on Friday last, 
after 2.30.  Because the notice time had closed and since the 
House did not sit on Monday or Tuesday it does not count as 
notice time, so he has to wait the appropriate time.  It counts 
as having been delivered yesterday for that purpose because he 
was too late on the Friday.  That is why there is this delay.  He 
will be able to do it tomorrow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
I realize now what has happened.  Obviously as a result of the 
death of a former Prime Minister the House did not sit on Monday 
and Tuesday, so that is why this has happened.  Rather than 
having to wait until tomorrow, I wonder if I could have unanimous 
consent of the House to introduce it today in light of the 
circumstances.

yesterday, to seek unanimous consent to adopt without debate 
Motion No. 37, which would seek concurrence in the second report 
of the official languages joint committee, encouraging that the 
city of Ottawa, the capital of Canada, be officially bilingual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is there unanimous consent for the

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Unanimous consent was denied to my request to introduce a bill 
today, but I believe that the hon. member who denied it may have 
misunderstood.  In any case, I believe I do now have unanimous 
consent of the House to introduce the bill today.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini (Sydney—Victoria, NDP)</B> moved that the 
fifth report of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights, presented on Wednesday, June 7, 2000, be concurred in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to move concurrence in that 
report and by way of background to indicate exactly why I am 
doing that.  I have very real concerns.  I know those concerns 
would be shared by other members of the justice committee, and 
certainly by other members of my party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In June of this year the justice committee met to discuss a 
private member's bill dealing with the Westray mine disaster. The 
justice committee considered that bill.  A motion was moved by 
me.  A great deal of work was done by the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  There has been a great deal of 
work done on this bill by the leader of my party, the hon. member 
for Halifax, and by the hon. member for Churchill in Manitoba. 
This issue is not just an Atlantic issue.  It crosses all lines. 
There has also been a great deal of work done by the hon. member 
for Winnipeg Centre, our justice critic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the justice committee there was a rare and I think unique 
feeling when the committee determined that the justice department 
should bring back to the committee a bill giving substance to the 
spirit of the report filed after the Westray disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are rules that determine when the minister can respond to 
that motion from the justice committee.  There is no requirement 
for an election for another year and a half.  I am concerned, and 
I know my concern would be shared by other members of the House, 
that if an election were called and the House did not proceed to 
its full mandate this most important issue would die on the order 
paper.  We would have to begin all over again in a new 
parliament, seeking to give life and legislation to the spirit of 
the report of Justice Richard and to bring justice to the 
families of those involved in the Westray mine disaster.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to repeat the history of that unfortunate day in 
Nova Scotia and, indeed, that unfortunate day in Canada.  I will 
for the record indicate the brief facts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members who have followed this debate will know and as many 
members who have led and allowed their names to stand as movers 
and supporters of this bill will know, it was on May 9, 1992 that 
the Westray mine exploded, killing 26 miners.  The coal mine in 
Pictou was officially opened eight months earlier.  Federal 
financial assistance was approved which permitted the project to 
proceed.  There were very real questions surrounding the 
operation of that mine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After the explosion on December 1, 1997, and after five and a 
half years of work, a four volume report was produced from the 
Westray mine public inquiry, entitled “The Westray Story:  A 
Predictable Path to Disaster”.  The report was scathing. 
Comments have been made by myself and by other members who have 
spoken in support of some kind of legislation that would prevent 
the same kind of thing from happening again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote, as I have before, from the words of Mr. Justice K. 
Peter Richard.  He said “the Westray story is a story of 
incompetence, of mismanagement, of bureaucratic bungling, of 
deceit, of ruthlessness, of cover-up, of apathy, of expediency 
and of cynical indifference”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fundamental and basic 
responsibility for the safe operation of an underground coal 
mine, and indeed of any industrial undertaking, rests clearly 
with management. 
In this disaster there is no question that these labourers went 
underground into a situation where they ought not to have gone 
and they paid with their lives.  There is no question that if 
this act had been done by an individual there would have been a 
charge of homicide.  Because it is a corporation and because of 
all kinds of legal implications coming from that, justice has 
never been achieved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In his report, Justice Richard recommended very clearly that 
there be a new criminal offence that would impose criminal 
liabilities on directors and other responsible corporate agents 
for failing to ensure that their corporation maintained an 
appropriate standard of occupational health and safety in the 
workplace; that there be a criminal offence of corporate killing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know the statistics.  We know that almost 10,000 workers die 
every year as a result of their work and possibly because of 
corporate negligence.  We know that three workers are injured 
every day on the job site.  From the time the justice committee 
met in June until today, how many months, how many lives how 
much corporate irresponsibility have taken place?  No mechanism 
exists in the criminal code for the courts to deal with this in 
the way that Justice Richard envisioned as a result of the 
Westray mine disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that members from the United Steelworkers were at the 
justice committee hearing.  They have done a tremendous amount of 
work on this bill.  They have provided background notes. They 
have had legal counsel work on the bill. Everyone who was in the 
room the day the justice committee met was impressed with the 
spirit of co-operation from all parties that asked the Minister 
of Justice to bring forward legislation. It was a most amazing 
day.  This crossed party lines.  The member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough worked very closely with us on 
this issue.  The chair of the justice committee was moved by the 
testimony he heard from families who had been affected by the 
Westray mine disaster.  Coming out of this was a moment when 
partisanship was put aside in the name of justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We face the prospect of losing, if not today perhaps in the next 
week or two, the momentum and the opportunity to have legislation 
brought forward if parliament prorogues and an election is 
called.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today I am rising to remind the Minister of Justice, the 
Minister of Labour and members of the House of the importance of 
this legislation.  It has been literally years in the making.  It 
has taken the blood, the sweat and the tears of the families of 
the Westray miners to bring it this far.  It has taken the 
perseverance of the United Steelworkers.  It has taken the 
putting aside of partisanship by members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear from the minister, either tomorrow or when 
the House resumes on October 16, some indication that before an 
election is called—and I have indicated that there is no need 
for an election call—the legislation will be brought forward 
immediately to be given passage in the House in whatever form it 
takes to get it on the books and into the criminal code so we do 
not lose this opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns about that from a number of perspectives.  As a 
lawyer who has dealt with the criminal code and as someone who 
has been interested in justice for a long time, I have a very real 
concern that when we have a report that makes a strong 
recommendation and it is not acted on, then the administration of 
justice falls into disrepute.  Respect for the justice system is 
a cornerstone of any civilized society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now have a situation that cries out for justice.  We have 
done the studies and have finished the report.  We have agreement 
from the parties.  We have to give life to that if the public, 
and especially the workers of this country, is to have respect 
for the justice system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have concerns about it because I come from a coal mining 
community.  The member who seconded my opportunity to speak 
today, the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, comes from a coal 
mining community.  In fact, it was the coal miners in our 
community who went into the Westray mine to retrieve some of the 
bodies of the workers and who put their own lives at risk for 
their brothers in the mine.  Those people have contacted me and 
the member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton and have asked whether 
there is going to be legislation.  They wanted to know if we 
were going to give life to this legislation so that workers who 
go down into the mines and workers who put their lives at risk in 
terms of labour every day would be protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will there be some accounting at the end that says the 
corporation can be held liable for gross mismanagement, for 
negligence or, and this is where we take a further step, for 
malice aforethought, for deliberate actions, knowing that they can 
result in the loss of life? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and other members have heard from our constituents and from 
people across the country who want this legislation passed.  I do 
not think I exaggerate the urgency of bringing this legislation 
forward in the name of justice, in the name of the Canadian 
people, in the name of the workers of the Westray mine who lost 
their lives, and in the name of those people who came before the 
committee and testified in the most moving way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the brother of one of the miners who was killed 
sat at the table and told his story of his quiet, dignified 
search for justice.  It moved everyone in the committee to the 
point where we could put aside partisan differences and say that 
something needed to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we need to do is amend the criminal code so that corporate 
executives and directors are held accountable for workplace 
safety.  This is not something foreign.  This has been done in 
other jurisdictions.  Such legislation exists in Great Britain 
and Australia, and there is a movement in the United States to 
review it. 
It is not something that is unfathomable or that has never been 
done in another jurisdiction.  It exists.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is an opportunity to examine other pieces of legislation. 
We have done that.  I can cite chapter and verse of other 
legislation in other countries that makes it an offence for 
corporations to knowingly put the lives of their workers at risk 
in order to maximize profit, open a mine or make sure that the 
last shipment of goods gets on the train. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What price do workers in the year 2000 have to pay for corporate 
profits, and not even for corporate profits sometimes, but just to 
make sure that the order book is full and the work gets out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Westray mine disaster, the corporation knew there were 
faults in the mine and knew that the equipment was not working 
safely, 
but it put great pressure on the non-unionized workers to go into 
the mines every day, and the workers went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people have said that the workers had a choice and that 
they did not have to go.  When I hear that I think about all the 
workers who go out to work every day in order to feed and clothe 
their children, pay their mortgage and be courageous citizens. 
That is their priority.  They put their lives and safety at risk 
in order to work.  To say that they have a choice, especially 
in the part of the country that I come from where the 
unemployment rate is high and the opportunity for work is 
minimal, is not so easy. To choose not to work is not so easy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the Atlantic coast, whether it is in fishing, mining, 
forestry or farming, we have a history of that kind of dangerous 
work.  The first time I spoke to this bill I talked about what it 
was like growing up in those communities.  What we know from 
growing up in Nova Scotia is the sound of the whistle when there 
is a disaster in the mine.  We know what it means for the men and 
women on the fishing boats in the north Atlantic when we look out 
at the horizon and the storm clouds gather. We know what it is 
like in the steel mill when there is a catastrophe.  We grew up 
knowing these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accidents can happen as a matter of chance, but when they happen 
because a corporation has determined that the lives of its 
workers are not a factor in determining the balance sheet, then 
it is time for us to say that it is a crime.  It is time for us 
to say that when a corporation knowingly determines to send men 
and women possibly to their deaths and it has the means to 
prevent that and does not, it is time for us to say that it is a 
crime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I rise today on this motion because we said that in the justice 
committee.  We sent it to the minister and asked for a bill to be 
brought back that would make it a crime for those directors and 
corporations to kill their workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we will hear it again today in question period and there 
will be some banter back and forth about when there will be an 
election.  The Prime Minister may say that we will be in our 
seats on the 16th, 17th or 18th, but there may be an election 
call after that.  Everybody has his or her own reasons for an 
election call.  I am not afraid of it and am prepared to fight 
it.  However, when we have important pieces of legislation in the 
making let us not put those pieces of legislation at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Minister of Justice, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Labour to issue a public statement.

</I></B></P><P align=left>They do not have to because they have a few days before they 
have to report back to the justice committee.  However, in the 
name of decency, in the names of the members of the justice 
committee who brought forward a unanimous report and of the 
witnesses who testified, I ask them to indicate within the next 
two days whether they will bring forward to the House legislation 
giving life to the commitment made by the justice committee, by 
the steelworkers and by the families of the miners who went 
underground and lost their lives.  Anything less is negligence 
and arrogance on the part of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know this legislation is needed.  That is not contested.  We 
know this legislation is important.  That is not contested. 
We know the legislation can be brought into effect.  That is 
not contested.  Why wait?  Let us do it.  We will have other 
legislation pushed through the House before an election call. The 
government has no hesitation about pushing through its EI 
changes.  The government may have no hesitation to put through 
its health accord.  In the name of decency, let us bring forward 
a bill that we can all agree needs to be enacted and give life to 
the Westray legislation.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, again my hon. colleague from 
Sydney—Victoria on the beautiful island of Cape Breton has given 
one of the more eloquent speeches the House has ever heard in the 
history of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member comes from the coal mining area of Cape Breton. 
If people across the country, especially the government and the 
official opposition, listen to what he said about decency and the 
protection of workers, by the time 5 p.m. today there is a good 
chance that three more Canadians will be killed on the job.  That 
is most unfortunate and is an alarming statistic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-20 is coming from the Senate on tobacco legislation and 
Imperial Tobacco seems to be 100% behind it.  However, we have 
not heard anything about what corporations or multinationals 
think about this particular bill.  Could the hon. member speak on 
the multinationals who support the Liberal Party and the Canadian 
Alliance?  Does he suggest that they may be against the bill in 
order to account for themselves when it comes to this type of 
action? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Mancini:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the question 
and I am thankful for the compliment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard a response from corporations or the 
multinationals with regard to the Westray legislation nor do I 
think any other member of the justice committee has heard one. If 
they have, I have not been apprised of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are silent because there is a recognition that this may 
change the way corporations do business to some extent.  I do not 
want to use a broad brush to paint every corporation.  There are 
some corporations that take the safety of their employees very 
seriously.  They are to be applauded.  They have nothing to fear 
from this legislation.  There are some employers and corporations 
that work with the unions to negotiate collective agreements and 
health and safety standards.  They have nothing to fear from this 
legislation and they should be congratulated for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is corporations like the owners of the mine in Westray who, 
if there were any question about the owners' culpability in this, 
not only sent these men to their deaths but evaded the justice 
system.  They refused to testify at a public inquiry.  They hid 
behind jurisdictional questions of warrants to demand their 
appearance.  The managers of that mine did everything possible 
not just to evade responsibility but to refuse to testify to help 
shed light on how the tragedy happened.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are the corporations, the managers and the directors who 
have something to fear from this legislation, as well they 
should.  I think many of the corporations have been silent in 
that regard because that may be the kind of management they want. 
It would be most helpful, and I suppose it would help the 
corporate image, if those companies that believe in workers' 
safety came forward and said they were prepared to support the 
legislation.  However, we have not heard that yet.  I issue the 
challenge to every chamber of commerce in the country to read the 
proposed Westray bill and indicate their support and their 
citizen obligation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I very much support and attach myself to the 
comments made by the member for Sydney—Victoria.  I know that he 
has a very innate personal interest in this, as was apparent by 
his remarks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a matter which unfortunately could be put on the slate 
as more unfinished business on the part of the government.  We 
have seen many indications that the coming days and weeks may 
result in an election call.  This is an election call that I 
think a growing number of Canadians are looking at with a great 
deal of cynicism.  They are viewing this as merely opportunistic, 
something that is being driven by polls rather than by public 
commitment and a commitment to complete very important pieces of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is but one among many.  We know that there is a health 
accord which was ratified by the provinces and is supposed to in 
some small measure address the crisis in our health care system. 
That legislation is a postdated cheque which will never be cashed 
if the House is dissolved for a general election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is important legislation pertaining to the criminal code, 
the youth criminal justice act, which is badly in need of fixing 
or replacing.  We know the government gave a commitment over 
seven years ago to do something about that legislation.  However, 
we are on the possible eve of an election and it has not been 
done. That promise has not been kept or fulfilled. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are numerous pieces of important legislation regarding the 
environment, health care, justice and taxation.  There are 
important legislative initiatives which do receive support from 
the opposition.  They will simply die on the order paper. 
Canadians need to understand that.  The initiatives will go to 
the Senate, if they pass through the House, and will be gassed. 
They will not see the light of day.  These are hollow promises. 
If the government is to point to this legislation as something 
which has been fulfilled, it is dead wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular debate that was brought about by the hon. member 
for Sydney—Victoria deals with Motion No. 79, which was moved by 
the Progressive Conservative Party.  It called upon the 
government to respond to the recommendations of the Westray 
report by Mr. Justice Peter Richard on the tragic event in 
Plymouth, Nova Scotia when the Westray mine exploded killing 26 
men. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That poignant moment resulted in the renewed discussion about 
workplace safety, the renewed focus on how we could try to 
prevent such disasters and how, through legislation, we could 
bring about greater accountability and responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not all disasters are preventable.  Arguably and quite rightly, 
this is one that most agree could have been avoided by taking 
proper steps to ensure the safety of those workers who went down 
into the mine was protected and that all the necessary steps had 
been taken by the management and the province, which oversaw the 
safety of the workplace environment.  It could have been avoided 
if those parties had taken real cautions to ensure that a 
dangerous workplace environment did not exist.  Sadly, that did 
not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has already been much discussion on Motion No. 79 in this 
place which was a carry-over from a previous parliament before 
prorogation.  It gave members of the House the opportunity to put 
forward their positions and their party's position. 
Initially, members of the government were very reluctant to 
embrace even the idea of bringing this matter to the public 
debate.  They were very reluctant to discuss it.  They did not 
want this matter to go to the justice committee, where it 
eventually did aspire.  When it got there, as was alluded to by 
the member for Sydney—Victoria, there was an incredible catharsis. 
There was suddenly a change on the part of the government in its 
willingness to discuss this issue.  It was very heartening and 
encouraging to see that happen because it washed away some of the 
partisanship and politics involved in workplace safety and in 
this type of issue.

<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make no mistake about this.  This is a human issue.  This 
is an issue that touches lives and potentially takes lives if we 
do not act.  The indication that we heard from many of the 
witnesses was that shocking numbers of people are 
killed and injured in the workplace every day.  Not all of that 
is preventable and we would be naive to suggest otherwise. 
However, the reality is that much of it is preventable.  Much of 
what has to change and evolve as a result of initiatives from 
this place is the attitude and the thinking on the part of 
corporations and people who have the final say over the setting 
of rules and regulations within the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we do that?  Part of the solution lies in changes to the 
criminal code which will bring about a sense of accountability 
and will in instances where there is neglect and obvious 
situations being ignored, bring about some form of 
accountability, deterrence and denunciation.   All of this is in 
the name of public protection and in the name of prevention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a mother's milk type of issue and one that everyone can 
agree on.  Yet we do not seem to have the inner fortitude or the 
ability to mobilize to get this matter moving in terms of 
legislation.  We had that unique opportunity at the justice 
committee as was referred to.  There was a very real significant 
move in the room.  I was in that justice committee and felt it as 
well.  There was a genuine intent that we would move forward. 
Sadly, that seems to be lost.  Like many of the other initiatives 
we have seen, it stands there on the precipice ready to take that 
leap yet, cynically, all of that is cast aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an opportunity to salvage that.  We can ask for and 
rightly so expect that the government will now take the 
initiative and bring about legislation.  The justice department 
should have been clearly instructed.  The intent was there. The 
intent of parliament was what led this motion to get to the 
justice committee.  Then it continued, it snowballed and we did 
hear testimony from the United Steelworkers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard the testimony of Howard Sim and Vernon Theriault.  Mr. 
Theriault was part of the heroic effort by draggermen from Cape 
Breton, Pictou county and surrounding areas who went down into 
the mine with the hope that some life had survived the tragic and 
massive explosion in Plymouth.  That is the sort of human spirit 
that should inspire us to keep the dream alive of somehow 
bringing about improved laws and legislation.  It is not the 
total answer by any means but it certainly moves the yardsticks 
and takes us forward in a futuristic way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hear the rhetoric.  We hear constant references that we have 
to do this and that this is the underpinning of parliamentary 
democracy.  We hear some party members, the Liberal Party members 
in particular, very cynically indicating that they are the only 
ones who speak out for Canadians.  That is not the case.  It is 
completely cynical to suggest that this party, this natural 
governing party as it likes to refer to itself, is the only one 
speaking out for the interests of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are faced with an issue of complete moral duty when we talk 
about protecting lives and workplace safety.  It is something so 
fundamental.  When people get up in the morning and go out the 
door to their workplace, whether it is into a factory or on a 
trawler or in the woods or into a mine or an office building, it 
is not too much for them to expect or hope that they will be able 
to return to their homes safely that evening to be with their 
loved ones. 
Surely that is not something which should be too much for any 
Canadian to expect.  Yet we are tasked in this place with trying 
to ensure that is just what happens.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously there are workplaces that are more dangerous than 
others, but there are natural consequences that can flow from 
putting oneself in harm's way.  I think particularly of firemen 
and police officers for whom it is implicit in their job 
descriptions that they may find themselves in danger.  We should 
be looking constantly for ways to improve safety and protection 
of human life.   We can do that through legislation to a large 
extent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is all.  That is the simple, fundamental goal we are 
seeking, all members of parliament across party lines, across the 
floor, and we hope not too many more will cross the floor.  This 
is something that is most serious and most timely.  The easy 
thing to do would be to do nothing.  The easy thing to do would 
be to simply bump along. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an aberration when we see bold moves from the Liberal 
government.  It has inherited a healthy economy, or at least an 
economy that has stabilized, much as a result of a prior 
government's economic planning, plans and legislative 
initiatives, bold and unpopular as they were.  When I say 
unpopular, members of the same Liberal government while in 
opposition chastised and absolutely railed against those 
initiatives.  However, through the glass ceiling of hypocrisy we 
have seen that attitude change.  They have embraced and called 
their own the same legislative initiatives they railed against. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not to digress on that record, to look at this issue with 
anything other than a humanistic, impartial eye is a derogation 
of our responsibility.  We must encourage the Minister of Justice 
and her department.  I would suggest it is broader than just 
looking at criminal code amendments.  The issue goes beyond 
simply suggesting that changing one provision or one section of 
the criminal code will provide the answers.  We have to look at 
labour laws.  We have to look at occupational health and safety. 
We have to include the provinces to ensure that there is the same 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk of standards I talk of the health care issue we will 
be debating at some point in the very near future.  Again, it is 
spurred very much in its timing because of a looming election. 
Health care is not fixed.  Let us be clear about that. The 
government is putting back a portion of the money removed since 
it took office.  It is putting back a small portion that in many 
ways pales by comparison to what was removed.  It reminds me of 
Freddy Krueger offering a band-aid to one of his victims after he 
slashed them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are tired of that type of cynicism.  They want to see 
action.  They want to see real action, not just the perception of 
action and talk of action.  The government has not lived up to 
its commitment in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has talked a great talk.  It has given very much the 
perception and feeling to Canadians that health care is fixed, 
that the criminal code has been fixed and that taxation is under 
control.  That is not the case.  One only has to visit a local 
hospital, to talk to individuals who are struggling to get by, to 
talk to a student who is saddled with a huge student loan and 
debt and has to leave the country to find work, or to talk to 
individuals who are doing their very best as single parents to 
get by on seasonal employment and face horrendous cuts to 
seasonal unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all this coming to fruition and with people struggling out 
there, the government says that it will help.  By the way, since 
Canadians will be going to the polls very soon, the government 
wants to remind them that it is helping them.  It asks them to 
forget about the fact that it is the one who put them in the 
situation.  It is now ready to throw a rope and pull them ashore. 
It sees that they are drowning and it will now throw a rope. They 
are only being pulled halfway ashore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Canadians want to ask themselves is whom do they trust to 
be on the other end of the rope.  Which national leader do they 
want to be pulling them in as they are drowning?  Do they trust 
the person on the other end of that rope? 
I would suggest there is only one leader in this place that 
should earn and has deservedly earned the trust of Canadians, and that 
is the Right Hon. Joe Clark. He has always done what he said he 
would do.  When we talk about trust in government—

it is embraced and rallied forward by the government, it is not 
an issue that will go away any time soon, nor will the problems 
in health or the problems in our economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians expect that members of parliament, and in particular 
the Prime Minister, are here to lead.  We heard a great deal 
about leaders and leadership in the past number of days.  To be a 
leader one needs vision.  That seems to be what is lacking in 
this place and in this current government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no vision.  The government bumps along and reacts to 
crisis.  When the wheels are off it offers some support, some 
comfort.  To prevent future problems, to somehow lay out a plan 
that will address problems before they happen, is the particular 
issue we are focused on in this debate.   In terms of workplace 
safety, how do we put in place legislation that will save lives 
and prevent injury? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look at the full equation.  When these types of things 
happen there is a huge economic impact as well.  Not to be 
callous or take away from the human impact, but when companies 
are forced to shut down, when persons are out of the workplace 
and compensation is due and deserved, when lives are lost and 
families are then faced with the horrible hardships that result 
from that type of situation, there is economic impact, that is 
something that is borne by all Canadians.  We are lucky to have a 
social system that reacts, sometimes inadequately, but it is there 
to help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we can prevent these tragedies, if we can prevent this type 
of lasting harm to humans, the human impact and the economic 
impact that results, why would we not do that?  We have lots of 
time.  We do not need to go headlong rushing into an election. 
We have plenty of time to react.  We have unfinished work, 
unfinished business before the House.  Let us take the time.  Let 
us sit on the weekend if we have to.  Let us get legislation 
done.  Let us get the work done that people have entrusted us to 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion brought forward by the Progressive Conservative Party 
did get to the justice committee.  It did bring about a raised 
awareness and a consciousness on the part of people in this place 
and people across the country toward the issue.  There was a 
willingness to act at that point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing that is preventing that now, the only impediment, 
is the government's timetable and, I would add to that, its 
priorities which seem to be very much out of sync with the 
priorities of others in the opposition and most Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Westray mine sits silent.  The assets are being liquidated. 
Yet that memory is still very poignant in Pictou county, in the 
province of Nova Scotia and around the country.  The Westray mine 
has become a symbol of the tragedy and the horror that can take 
place when unsafe work conditions exist.  It has become a symbol 
for every type of work.  Let us not let that tragedy repeat 
itself. 
Let us not let those lives that were lost be in vain.  Let us not 
let the heroic efforts that were made in the wake of the Westray 
mine disaster go unnoticed and unsubstantiated by efforts to 
prevent.  We do have a chance to do that now.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My friend spoke of the legal implications, the malice 
aforethought, the callous approach and the grindings of the 
justice system that resulted in the aftermath of Westray.  Civil 
implications were pursued.  What was particularly striking, which 
doubled and exacerbated and made worse the Westray disaster, was 
the disaster which occurred in the legal system and the 
wranglings that took place.  We have to try to cut through that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would we not try to streamline efforts in our justice system 
to address issues quickly and in a timely fashion so that justice 
is done, seen to be done and truly done?  That was one of the 
many lessons that came from Westray. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a chance now to act as my friend indicated.  We urge the 
government and the Minister of Justice and her department to 
respond quickly.  Let us not rush headlong into an election.  Let 
us do the important work we are elected to do.  Westray will 
always be a reminder.  Let us learn from those mistakes and move 
forward.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Kelowna, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I found the hon. member's statement very interesting.  I 
read the motion in some detail as the member was speaking and I 
would like him to clarify something for me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion states that in the opinion of the House the criminal 
code or other appropriate federal statutes should be amended. 
That is a pretty broad request.  It does not specify whether it 
is the criminal code that is to be amended or whether it is to be 
some other corporate legislation or some other justice 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly impressed by his reference that we must make 
sure that justice is done.  I could not agree more.  Justice is 
what we want in Canada, and in particular the liability of 
directors.  There is a provision today in legislation about the 
liability of directors who do not do their job and things of this 
sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it really amendments to the criminal code that should be 
studied or other legislation?  Could the hon. member give some 
clarification as to exactly what he intends? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member has made an 
important point that deserves clarification.  The criminal code 
as indicated is but one aspect.  It is about liability.  It is 
about the use of the civil code to pierce the corporate veil. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the chain of evidence is unbroken and if there is clear 
indication that safety provisions have been ignored and a person 
has been placed in a situation where there is real danger that 
was avoidable, directors and those in managerial positions should 
face a degree of accountability.  If a stream of evidence pointed 
directly to knowledge that was ignored, if a dangerous situation 
could have been remedied and a decision very often for financial 
reasons led the person to inaction, there should definitely be a 
degree of accountability. All these evidentiary matters would be 
examined by a court with the benefit of the presumption of 
innocence and all the protections that exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What other types of legislative initiatives can we look at?  We 
could look at coal mine regulations which are within federal 
purview.  Occupational health and safety is another area that we 
could look at.  Other federal labour codes that exist in the 
country could be looked at.  The difficulty with much of this is 
provincial standards and the provincial approach to safety in the 
workplace.  It is very much in the hands of the provinces to 
regulate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need federal statutes and legislation that encourage 
accountability, that encourage liability, and that will bring 
about a sense that there will be an accounting and deterrence and 
denunciation of irresponsible behaviour by those who not only in the 
practical sense may have created a dangerous situation but 
those who knew of it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what I mean when I talk about attitudes changing. For 
years it has been assumed that those in the upper echelon in the 
business world, those who in many instances drive businesses to 
move ahead at breakneck pace, will not be held accountable, that 
they will somehow be able to step back and say “I just make 
business decisions”.  Business decisions affect lives, and 
business decisions, if they are driven only by profit, certainly 
create danger.  That is what we learned at Westray, just as 
political decisions can very much create danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is truly to be about accountability and justice, that 
means many things to many people.  Justice very much talks about 
fairness.  It talks about accountability.  It talks about 
openness.  That is what we should all be striving for.  That is 
what we can do by changing things in the legislative scheme in 
parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am honoured to stand in this Chamber today and talk 
about the motion put forward by my colleague from 
Sydney—Victoria. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is fitting that we are having this discussion today.  Over 
the last seven days, day after day, minute after minute, 
Canadians have talked about what former Prime Minister Trudeau 
left Canadians.  They talked about his legacy.  They talked about 
his love for all Canadians and his belief in justice for all 
Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What have we become as a country when we are unwilling to place 
a value on human lives?  That is what we are talking about. We 
are talking about individuals day in and day out whose very lives 
are put in jeopardy because of corporations' race to the bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are we asking for?  We are asking for the recognition for 
responsible corporations.  But as I have heard the hon. member 
for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough say, what is the rush? Is 
there an election?  This is about morality.  This is about us as 
parliamentarians and our responsibility. I believe we 
have a responsibility to the workers in this country to recognize 
the value of their lives.  All we are asking is that corporations 
be held accountable and responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a part of the country that has been known on a 
number of occasions to have deaths occur specifically in the 
coal mines.  While some are workplace related, they are due to 
the very essence of the job. When people sit and read the Westray 
story as I have a number of times, it should send shivers through 
the spine of every Canadian.  Those 26 lives should have been 
protected. Their deaths could have been prevented in the 
wonderful race to the bottom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have become a society that looks upon its citizens as mere 
vehicles and not human beings.  As Canadians have clearly said 
with respect to the legislation, we have a responsibility. 
We as parliamentarians have a responsibility to say that we want 
corporations to be accountable and we want them to be responsible 
if they play a role in the deaths of their workers.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is exactly how simple this is.  It is not complicated. 
Contrary to what the government would like Canadians to believe, 
that is exactly what this is about.  It is about saying to 
companies across the country that they have a responsibility to 
ensure the health and safety of their workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough said, I 
believe it is our responsibility as parliamentarians and 
Canadians to make sure that the deaths of those 26 men were not 
in vain, not only for us as Canadians but for their children.  We 
must show their children that their dads did not die in vain, 
that we as parliamentarians and Canadians have learned a valuable 
lesson because of those deaths, and that we remain committed to 
doing everything we possibly can to make sure that deaths like 
those are not repeated again. If they are, then those who are 
responsible have to be held accountable.  That is our job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I go back to my first comment, for all of us in the House to 
take a minute today and ask ourselves what are we really doing 
here when we are not willing to stand and say as Canadians and as 
a government that we value our workers.  That is what this is 
about.  It is about values.  Let us show some values as they 
relate to Canadians.  Let the government show how it values 
workers.

<A NAME="LINK58">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK59"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Jim Peterson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that 
Bill C-45, an act respecting the provision of increased funding 
for health care services, medical equipment, health information 
and communications technologies, early childhood development and 
other social services and to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal 
Arrangements Act, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, it is truly a great honour for me to 
present for second reading Bill C-45, the Canada health care, 
early childhood development and other social services funding 
act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The legislation stems directly from the historic landmark 
agreement reached by Canada's first ministers on September 11 in 
our nation's capital.  I say landmark because the meeting 
involved 14 governments of different political affiliations and 
ideologies collectively agreeing on a plan to renew health care, 
to improve the support system for early childhood development and 
to strengthen our other social programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As its contribution to these agreements the federal government 
is providing $23.4 billion in new federal investments.  Most 
important, the first ministers committed to the key goals of 
Canada's health system for the future, namely to preserve, 
protect and improve the health of Canadians, to ensure that 
Canadians have timely access to health services anywhere in 
Canada based on need, not on ability to pay, and to ensure the 
long term sustainability of the health system so that care 
services will be available to all Canadians in future years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the first ministers gave Canadians 
their commitment to strengthen and renew health care services 
through partnership and collaboration, with the federal 
government as an equal partner in this renewal. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An agreement was also reached in the area of early childhood 
development. I should point out that while the premier of Quebec 
has expressed some reservations about this agreement, he shares 
the same concerns and principles as his counterparts regarding 
early childhood development. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill implements four federal funding commitments in support 
of the agreement.  First, it increases the Canada health and 
social transfer by an additional $21.1 billion to provide the 
provinces and territories with stable, predictable and growing 
funding over the next five years, funding for health, 
post-secondary education, early childhood development and other 
social programs.  Of this $21.1 billion, $2.2 billion will be 
invested in early childhood development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the accord provides that $1 billion will go to a new 
medical equipment fund to enable provinces and territories to 
purchase modern, much needed diagnostic and other medical 
equipment.  These funds will be available as soon as the bill is 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we are investing $500 million in an independent agency 
mandated to accelerate the adoption of modern information and 
communications technologies, including electronic patient records 
to provide better health care to every one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, $800 million will go to the health transition fund to 
support innovation and reform in the area of primary health care. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the federal government, along with the 
provinces and territories, plays a supportive role for the 
health system and other social programs.

provinces were at an all time high.  For the CHST it was $30.8 
billion.  In addition, we have equalization to the provinces and 
territories which totals $10 billion, for a total in transfers to 
these other jurisdictions of over $40 billion. Since this accord, 
in addition to this $40 billion we have the additional funds of 
$23.4 billion over four years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the CHST, which is the largest federal transfer, it 
provides the provinces and territories with cash payments and tax 
transfers in support of their social programs.  The CHST also 
gives them the flexibility to design and administer their own 
programs provided, however, that the principles of the Canada 
Health Act and the prohibition on residency requirements for 
social assistance are upheld and respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1995 the federal government has strengthened the CHST four 
times.  In the 1996 budget we established an annual CHST cash 
floor of $11 billion.  The 1998 budget raised the annual CHST 
cash floor to $12.5 billion.  The 1999 budget announced an 
additional $11.5 billion investment over five years in funding 
specifically for health care.  The last budget provided an extra 
$2.5 billion in cash over five years for health and 
post-secondary education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This $14 billion funding increase in the last two budgets raised 
the cash component of the CHST by 25% over its 1998-99 level.  It 
helped the provinces and territories deal with the immediate 
concerns of Canadians regarding health care, including the 
problems of waiting lists, crowded emergency rooms and the lack 
of diagnostic services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to discuss the bill's specific measures in detail.  The 
new funding commitments for the CHST build on the previous 
increases in the CHST transfers.  The $21.1 billion of additional 
cash that we bring forward for the CHST provides stable, 
predictable and growing funding for the CHST over the next five 
years.  This is the largest investment ever made for health, 
higher education and social services.  The provinces and 
territories can now give top priority to accelerating the changes 
we need in order to give Canadians the high quality health care 
they deserve, to provide new supports to early childhood 
development and to strengthen our other important social 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this additional money, CHST cash transfers to the provinces 
and territories will rise to $18.3 billion in 2001-02, to $19.1 
billion in the next year and to $21 billion in 2005-06.  By then 
CHST cash will be fully 35% above its current level of $15.5 
billion.  Moreover the value of the CHST tax points will grow to 
$18.8 billion over the next five years.  Altogether the federal 
transfers to the provinces and territories through the CHST for 
health, post-secondary education and social services will grow to 
$40 billion by the year 2005-06.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The current CHST legislative framework will be extended to 
provide a new five year funding plan and will be extended again 
in three years to provide an ongoing five year plan.  The new 
funding commitment establishes an unprecedented planning 
stability and certainty for the provinces, to allow them to go 
forth and help renew our health care system. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings me to the federal government's sizeable investment 
in early childhood development, which is the focus of this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members know, the early years are crucial to a child's 
development.  Governments realize that they need to invest in 
the services that support children during their early years in 
order to help them reach their full potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has already made a number of major 
investments in early childhood development through initiatives 
such as the national child benefit supplement, the Canada child 
tax benefit, the child care expense deduction, the GST credit 
and extended EI parental leave for working parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal, provincial and territorial governments are now 
involved in an important initiative for early childhood 
development which would get Canadian children off to a good 
start in life at a critical stage in their development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In support of this new initiative, the federal government will 
contribute $2.2 billion over the next five years. 
The governments of the provinces and territories have agreed to 
use these credits to promote healthy pregnancy, birth and 
infancy, improve parenting and family supports, strengthen early 
childhood development, learning and care, and strengthen 
community supports. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These new investments, together with the incremental investments 
of the provinces, will provide families with better access to 
services such as prenatal classes and screening, preschool 
programs and child care, and parent information and family 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments have agreed to report publicly on what they are 
doing so that their progress can be tracked by Canadians. 
Canadians will know how much money is being spent, how well 
services are being delivered and what this means to the health, 
well-being and development of our children.  Whether through 
partnership with provincial governments and territories or 
through federal initiatives, governments are working to ensure 
that all Canadian children are given the best possible start in 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of health renewal, first ministers agreed on a 
shared vision of health and stated in their final communique: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will have publicly funded health services that provide 
quality health care, and that promote the health and well-being 
of Canadians in a cost effective and fair manner. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first ministers are committed to strengthening and renewing 
Canada's health care services through partnership, through 
collaboration.  They agreed on an action plan that focuses on 
access to care, health promotion and wellness, primary health 
care, the supply of doctors, nurses and other health personnel, 
home care and community care, pharmaceutical management, health 
information and communications, and health equipment and 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most important, they agreed that all governments must be 
accountable to Canadians for their health care spending.

<A HREF="#LINKT18"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of those accountability provisions of the agreement, 
provincial and territorial governments will report on how they 
have invested these funds in health renewal and medical 
equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To deal with immediate pressures, the government is providing 
funds to upgrade medical equipment and invest in new technologies 
to provide Canadians with more timely access to high quality 
care.  Through this bill the government is investing $1 billion 
in a medical equipment fund with which the provinces and 
territories can acquire and install much needed diagnostic 
equipment and treatment equipment, such as MRIs and CAT scans, 
over the next two years.  Again governments will be expected to 
report on how this money is spent.  Provinces and territories 
will be able to draw on these funds as soon as this bill is 
passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will also provide $500 million through an 
independent corporation which will be mandated to accelerate the 
development and adoption of modern information communications 
technology systems such as electronic patient records.  This will 
allow the sector to keep up with other sectors of our economy in 
adopting the new information and communications technologies.  It 
is a key ingredient to building a health infrastructure in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More specifically the development of electronic health records 
will ensure our ability to guarantee Canadians that even with 
these electronic records, which will do a great deal of good in 
streamlining the system, there will be stringent measures in 
place to protect the privacy, confidentiality and security of 
health care information.  Canadians can be assured that their 
personal health information will be strictly guarded. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This co-ordinated approach has many benefits. Duplication will 
be reduced.  Efficiency in the exchange of information between 
health care providers will be improved.  There will be better 
access to services and increased service delivery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, Canadians can now be assured of the unwavering 
commitment of their governments to renewed health care, to 
support for early childhood development and to support for other 
social programs.  This bill provides CHST funding for the 
provinces and territories that is growing, stable and predictable 
so that they can plan for their future. It provides provinces 
with immediate funding for buying medical diagnostic and 
treatment equipment. It provides all governments with the funding 
growth and the stability to significantly step up their efforts 
to renew and modernize Canada's health care services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Above all, Canadians will have an accountability framework, 
report cards, to better help them judge the results for 
themselves of how money on health care, early childhood 
development and medical equipment is being spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this accord we see 14 governments with shared goals and 
priorities, 14 governments which have given these measures their 
blessing.  They have made Canada truly work for the benefit of 
all our citizens.  I believe that when history is written it will 
cite this landmark accord as among the truly great 
accomplishments of our time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that history will cite the role of extraordinary 
leadership provided by our Prime Minister.  Without his 
determination, wisdom and immense ability, this accord, this 
shared vision of the future of health care for all Canadians with 
all levels of government working together, would not have been 
possible.  In conclusion, I salute that role of extraordinary 
leadership.

I ask leave to share my time with the member for Esquimalt—Juan

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Does the House give its consent for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to enter this 
debate today because it is an issue of great importance to 
Canadians.  As we rush headlong into an unnecessary and 
unwarranted election, we are being asked to quickly push the bill 
through so the Liberals can look a little better than they do 
right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is there such a notable health care crisis in this country? 
Where did it come from?  I have been sitting here thinking about 
the different things that have happened over the last number of 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember way back in 1961, when most of the members in the 
House were not even born, my brand new wife and I left 
Saskatchewan, the home of medicare, and moved to Alberta. There 
was no public health care in Alberta. It was a privately operated 
system called MSI, Medical Services Incorporated.  We paid a 
small premium every month and received excellent medical care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those were the days before the technological on-off switches for 
having babies, and soon after we were married, within the 
mandatory 10 months, our first daughter was born.  Our new 
daughter and her mother received excellent care. I remember being 
very pleased with the care they received. Later on my wife had 
some complications and she had to go to Calgary where she 
received prompt, efficient and excellent care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now think back about 20 years, and it is amazing that it is 
already 20 years, when my dear wife again had a severe medical 
challenge. It is called cancer.  She had a biopsy on Wednesday, a 
final diagnosis on Friday and surgery on the following Monday. It 
was amazing, just like that; quick, quick, quick.  It worked. 
That was in 1980. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I am told that people with the same kind of medical 
emergency are on waiting lists for up to four months for the same 
operation.  People with cancer cannot wait. That is deplorable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spoke to a young man in my riding not very long ago.  Relative 
to my age he is young but I guess he is old to some of the 
youngsters in the group here.  He has a medical challenge which 
requires some diagnostics.  While he is waiting anxiously, and I 
must emphasize the word anxiously, the hospital is telling him 
that he can get in some time near the end of October. It was a 
couple of weeks ago when I was speaking with him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a crisis in health care.  Where did it come from?  With 
all this blowing that the Liberal government wants to do now, 
where did the crisis come from?  I can tell the House where it 
came from. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have in my hand here, and I will hold it so that it cannot be 
seen as a prop, the budget 2000 document that was tabled in the 
House by the Minister of Finance.  It just so happens that in 
this document the Liberals are bragging about improving the 
quality of life of Canadians and their children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at this document and I see the amount of cash transfers 
for health from the federal government to the provinces.  In 1993 
it was $18.8 billion.  In 1994 it was $18.7 billion.  I will not 
keep reading the years but the amounts are $18.8 billion, $18.7 
billion, $18.5 billion and $14.7 billion.  These figures are 
right in the minister's own document. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government administered cuts to health care and we 
are surprised that there is a health care crisis. The Liberal 
government took the money away and now it is giving some of it 
back and it wants all of us to cheer.  It is like the guy who 
robs me of my wallet and asks me to thank him because he gives me 
money for bus fare home.  It is absurd.

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government has literally cut billions of dollars out 
of the health care budget for the provinces.  It is administered 
by the provinces.  Now it is gingerly giving some of it back and 
it wants a bunch of praise because we expect this unanticipated 
election this fall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By the way, just to digress a little, if the election is this 
fall it will have been called even earlier than the early call in 
1997, just a little over three and a half years into the mandate. 
I do not know whether members are aware of it, but if there is 
an election every three and a half years instead of every four 
years, it increases the cost of the elections by over 12%.  Why 
would we not use that money for health care instead of having 
needless elections?  The only purpose of the election is that 
the Liberals want to get re-elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As another aside, I cannot help but mention that this week our 
party started running some ads.  How did we finance them?  I and 
a whole bunch of Canadian Alliance members across the country 
have donated money to the party in order to run the ads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I noticed also this week the Liberal Party has started running 
ads.  Who has paid for them?  The same guys. We have paid for 
them because they are tax funded ads with the Government of 
Canada name on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is talking about all this wonderful money that it 
is putting back into health care. I have to be kind, so I will 
simply say gently that it is a myth.  The Liberals have taken so 
much out and now they are gingerly putting some of it back and 
they want everyone to cheer and vote for them again.  I am 
offended by that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned those ads are inaccurate.  They do not 
communicate truthfully to Canadians what has actually happened. 
As far as I am concerned they are nothing but blatant election 
advertising at taxpayers' expense prior to the writ being 
dropped.  I am very offended by that and so should every Canadian 
be offended by that, because it is so wrong to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned the numbers.  Over the years the government 
decreased the numbers and then it started adding to them.  The 
Secretary of State for International Financial Institutions, who 
gave the speech on behalf of the government, talked about the 
$11.5 billion which the government put back in.  Again that is 
messaging.  It is really gross messaging in terms of shading the 
truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the government says it is putting in $11.5 billion, almost 
all Canadians assume, because we deal with annual budgets, that 
it is $11.5 billion per year.  Well, it ain't, if I can use that English 
inaccuracy to make a point.  It just ain't true. The fact 
is $11.5 billion was projected.  Most of it has not been paid 
yet.  It was projected over the next five years, so it is just a 
little over $2.5 billion a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the same as a policeman who stops me for speeding and 
asks how fast I was going.  I could say I was going 400.  The 
purpose of my trip was to go 400 kilometres. If I said that I was 
going 400 he would give me a whopper of a ticket but actually I 
was going 100, planning on doing that for four hours and doing my 
400 kilometre trip. The same thing is true here.  We are talking 
about rates of expenditure of public money for health care.  It 
is so much per year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is doing the same thing again in Bill C-45, which 
proposes to put all this extra money into health care.  It did it 
again by saying it is spending $21.1 billion on health. What a 
wonderful number. What years are we talking about?  It starts on 
April 1, 2001. The Liberals are going to win an election on it, 
but they are not even talking about putting any money into health 
care. They are in other parts of the bill. In the part about 
the $21.1 billion it begins April 1, 2001. The next payment is 
April 1, 2002, the next April 1, 2003 and then it goes to 2004 
and to 2005.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the years 2001 to 2005, the Liberals are going to put in a 
total of $11.2 billion, around $2 billion to $2.5 billion a year 
on average.  It is way in the future but they are advertising it 
on TV as if the money is here now.  They are not stating that it 
is way in the future.  They want Canadians simply to be duped 
into believing that they are doing wonderful things for health 
care so they will vote for them again because they want power.  I 
find that offensive and we should put an end to it.  It is very 
disturbing to me that this has occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not talking too much about the health care system per se 
because I am primarily a finance critic.  However, I would like 
to talk a bit about the history of the Liberal government.  I did 
a little math.  I love math.  I get out my calculator and play 
with numbers for recreation.  Other people bore themselves to 
death by doing things like golfing.  I like solving little math 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already described how since 1993 the funding for health 
care went down and then went up again.  After 2005 it actually 
will be higher than it was in 1993.  However, after 2001, with 
the total amount of money that will be put into health care, it 
will still be less than the amount that was being transferred in 
1993.  It went down so low that this bill will not even bring it 
up to the 1993 levels. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I did was take the numbers from 1993 all the way to the 
projections for 2005, a total of 12 years.  I will not read the 
numbers, but members can check with me later if they want them. I 
did a calculation to find out how much the amount had increased. 
By the year 2005 the government will actually be putting in more 
than in 1993, 12 years earlier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That works out to an increase of 11.7% over 12 years.  That is 
an average increase, compounded annually, of 0.9%, less than 1% 
per year.  Our population has grown bigger than that.  We are 
falling behind per person.  We are putting less and less into 
health care per capita and the government wants to applaud 
itself.  I am sure that anyone who knows the facts will not 
applaud.  The government needs to applaud itself because that is 
the only applause it will get, I am sure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot help but think about the government's concern for 
children.  It loves to talk about children but it is missing the 
most important thing.  I am very grateful that when our children 
were young we could afford, with sacrifices, to live on one 
income.  In our family it happened to be that I was chosen to 
earn the income and my wife was a full time mom.  Now two of our 
children who are married have children.  We have four wonderful 
grandchildren.  I am very grateful that they each have a full 
time mom.  I assure members that is not without sacrifice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term Liberal government is an oxymoron.  Liberal comes from 
the same root word as liberation and freedom.  Instead, the 
Liberals tax us to death and control our lives.  It is shameful. 
The Liberal government thinks that it does best by taxing people 
so heavily that both parents have to work, then it wants to be 
kind and give money back for social services to look after 
children who really do not have an effective home to live in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be better if we so arranged our fiscal affairs that 
families would be taxed at a level where they could actually 
afford to make that choice?  The operative word is choice. 
We know that easily two-thirds of families, when given a free 
choice, would choose to spend time at home with their young 
children.  That is not a choice under the contradictory term of 
Liberal government.  That choice is taken away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to emphasize again that under the programs of the 
Canadian Alliance, not only would we fund health care adequately, 
working together with the provinces in harmony, giving them the 
authority to operate the health care system efficiently, but we 
would also reduce taxes for families so that those choices would 
be real and viable.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I could go on and on but I choose not to because I know we are 
eager to hear what my colleague has to say in terms of the health 
care system.  He will talk more about that part of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply want to conclude by emphasizing that what the Liberals 
say and what they do are two different stories.  The ads on 
television this week and what is actually happening is not the 
same story.  One is designed to win the next election.  What they 
are actually doing, by their policies and actual practices, is 
putting health care at serious risk in this country.  It is time 
to replace these Liberals and put into power a government that 
thinks clearly about these things, communicates clearly with the 
Canadian people and will fix the problem. 
<P><A NAME="LINK61"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Elk Island 
and the House for allowing me to speak on an issue that is very 
close to all our hearts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-45 is five years too late.  Everybody in the House knows 
and understands the problems we have, not only in our health care 
system but in our education system and in the welfare programs 
that we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a situation today in health care where there is an 
increasing disparity between the resources that we have to pay 
for and what we ask for.  As time passes, as we get older, as our 
demographics change and as the demands on our health care system 
increase, that gap between what we have to pay for and what we 
demand of our health care system will increase and widen.  The 
result will be extraordinary pain and suffering for Canadians 
from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we support the addition of $5.5 billion into the system, 
as my colleague from Elk Island so eloquently stated, this is but 
a drop in the bucket.  This will do nothing and it is little more 
than an election ploy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, the bill should have been put forth five years ago because 
it will only get us back to 1995 levels.  The public may not know 
or understand this, but when the funding actually comes in it 
will only get into the sharp edge of health care one and a half 
years from now.  What will happen to all the patients who sit and 
suffer in quiet pain and suffering at home?   People are 
suffering and waiting for timely access to health care, the 
timely access that the Minister of Health likes to stand up and 
crow about.  He says that all Canadians must have timely access 
to essential health care services and that the government is 
doing that.  That is bunk.  That is absolutely untrue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us talk about the truth.  Let us talk about what is going on 
in health care in Canada today.  For more than five years the 
government has removed funding for health care on the one hand, 
while on the other hand, it has restricted the provinces from 
giving their patients, the sick people in their provinces, the 
chance to get the care they require.  The provinces have been 
hamstrung.  Their hands have been tied behind their backs and they 
have been unable to be innovative because of the federal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is disingenuous of the government to say on the one hand that it 
will uphold a system.  We all want to ensure timely access to 
essential health care services in a public system for all 
Canadians.  Canadians should not have to pay out of their own 
pockets for health care or be refused health care as a result of 
having no money in their pockets.  No one in the House wants 
that, least of all us, but for heaven's sake we should not use 
politics and try to stand up and be the great white knight 
defending people's health care when in reality we are actually 
restricting the ability of people to get health care when they 
need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All of us here have a common interest in ensuring that our 
public health care system is strengthened.  However, since the 
Liberal government came to power it has been restricting the 
provinces' ability to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the words in the bill are good.  The bill talks about 
collaboration, about commitment and about the desire to have a 
publicly funded, sustainable health care system where people have 
timely access to health care services. 
However, they have been talking about that for seven years.  The 
reality can best be illustrated by the story of Mrs. Marilyn 
Slater, who lives on Vancouver Island.  She is a 64 year old who 
recently had her hip replaced. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1155"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1155

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mrs. Slater was paralyzed with pain because of her hip and 
desperately needed an operation.  About two years ago she went to 
see her physician.  He told her that she would get a hip 
replacement within two years.  She waited in pain for two years 
to get her hip replaced.  This was the health care system that 
was supposed to give her timely access to essential health care 
services.  Was it timely?  No.  Was it essential?  Yes.  Did she 
suffer?  Yes.  Is this what the Canada Health Act or the 
government is supposed to uphold?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is completely unfair to allow people like Marilyn Slater and 
so many others across this country to suffer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the hospital where I sometimes work, a situation has occurred 
over the last year.  People are on waiting lists for a little 
over two years before they can get in to see an orthopedic 
surgeon.  Because of a lack of money, the hospital told the 
orthopedic surgeons, knowing they were working only one day a 
week in the operating room, that, although the hospital was 
sorry, it would have to cut the operating room time to a half day 
a week.  This pushed the waiting lists for a patient to be seen 
in this community, which serves half of British Columbia, to 
three and a half years.  A three and a half year wait to see an 
orthopedic surgeon for patients in severe pain has nothing to do 
with health care and everything to do with being inhumane.  It is 
torture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are ways of dealing with this, but for heaven's sake, 
putting forward a bill that will put money into the sharp edge of 
health care, some of it a year and a half from now, and 
ultimately put us back to where we should have been five years 
ago, is not good health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the bill goes through and the money goes to the health care 
system, we will still have people suffering, like Marilyn Slater 
and the people in northern British Columbia.  This is happening 
all over the country.  Barrie and Peterborough hospitals 
routinely close down their emergency departments because the 
hallways are filled with people on gurneys and they cannot fit 
any more in.   Why are those people there?  They are there 
because they cannot get a bed in a hospital.  The hospitals are 
saying that they do not have enough money to pay for nurses and 
open up beds. That is not good health care and it is happening 
across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If anybody says that we have timely access to health care, I 
would like to know where, because it does not happen too often. 
It happens to people who are acutely injured, to be sure.  It is 
only because of the bravery and courage of our medical health 
care workers in the field that they are able to do this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need solutions.  We have a manpower crisis.  The government 
gives vague concepts of how to relieve this but where are the 
specifics?  The specifics need to be talked about now because in 
the next 10 years we will have a lack of 112,000 nurses in 
Canada.  The average age of the physician population right now is about 45 
to 46.  There is a crisis today in virtually every medical 
specialty, whether it is in neuropathology, neurosurgery or 
general surgery.  The list goes on.  We need an effective plan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to propose one plan to the government, speaking 
personally.  The government should work with the provinces to 
allow an expansion of the number of people not only in medical 
schools but in nursing colleges and technology schools. Let us 
not forget the medical technologists who are an integral part of 
our health care team.  Many of them are working one and a half 
jobs just to fill in for the lack of personnel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One option may be for the government to pay 10% to 15% toward a 
student's tuition fees and in return the student would serve an 
equal number of years in an underserviced area.  That would 
relieve the maldistribution problem that we have.  We know that 
if a medical worker goes into an urban setting during a period of 
time it is very difficult to attract them to an underserviced 
area; in fact it rarely happens.  What we have to do is catch 
them when they get out of school. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT25"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT25"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking personally, this plan would allow people to have their 
tuition fees paid for the amount of time they are in school.  In 
return they would provide an equal number of years in a rural, 
underserviced area.  That is what is done in military training. 
It can be done in health care.  If that is done it will provide 
some access to people who are desperately in need of care in 
rural settings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect I want to talk about is education. The situation 
now is that post-secondary education has been completely gutted 
for a number of years.  Students are having a very difficult time 
making ends meet and have had an onerous burden placed 
upon them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly it is true they have to pay for their tuition, but 
what is happening now is very interesting and actually violates a 
sense of egalitarianism the government likes to profess to have. 
Money has become a significant factor in preventing people from 
gaining access to professional schools.  In the faculty of 
medicine at the University of Toronto it costs about $10,000 a 
year to become a doctor.  I could not have become a physician if 
those had been the fees when I was going through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is a major restriction now to people of low to middle class 
means.  They cannot afford to send their children to professional 
faculties any more.  Now those faculties are becoming the purview 
of the children of the rich.  That is not right.  No one in the 
House would like to see that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As our party and our former leader have in the past, let us talk 
about an income contingent loan replacement scheme.  Our scheme 
would enable students to put back the money they have taken out 
in loans.  Those moneys would be put back in a way that is fair 
to them and fair to taxpayers.  We have encouraged and have tried 
to put the government on notice in this regard for a number of 
years.  We have indicated that these students have suffered. Some 
of them had to end their studies because they could not afford 
them.  The plan our party has put forth would enable them to 
study and it would be fair to taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of children, my colleague from Elk Island spoke 
very eloquently about the need for strengthening the parent-child 
bond.  We cannot have an inequitable tax regime such as we have 
today, which does not enable parents to spend more quality time 
with their children.  This has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years we have been asking the government to ensure that 
there is tax fairness between parents who choose to go to work 
and parents who stay home.  It is not difficult.  It could be 
changed simply.  Let us change it.  We need to do that.  The tax 
system of today also restricts the ability of many parents to 
stay at home.  As a result parents are forced into the workplace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to consider, if we are to engage in a childhood 
development scheme, something that will work well.  The Minister 
of Labour has been a leader, as has the minister responsible for 
children, on how we can ensure the basic needs of kids are met. 
As the Minister of Labour knows through her program in Moncton, 
strengthening the parent-child bond very early on will have an 
enormous, profound, positive effect on the development of a child 
into adolescence and into adulthood. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact someone won the Nobel prize for showing that the 
developing brain in a child is like a sponge.  If we subject a 
child to sexual abuse, violence, improper nutrition, a lack of 
proper parenting or a lack of discipline, we find the child's 
brain does not develop properly and his or her cognitive 
abilities and emotional strength built early in life do not 
necessarily happen.  We need to look at the body of evidence that 
actually works and to work with parents to ensure that takes 
place.  It has to start early on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>BC Reports contained a very good front page article, in the last 
two weeks, on the issue of fetal alcohol syndrome, the leading 
cause of preventable brain damage in the country today.  Almost 
half of all people in jail today have fetal alcohol syndrome or 
fetal alcohol effects.  It is an entirely preventable problem. 
It is devastating problem for children. Their cognitive 
abilities are destroyed.  Their average IQ is 68.  They have 
difficulty with interpersonal relations.  Unfortunately many of 
them, as we have found, go into lives of crime.  It is 
preventable. 
In order to prevent it we have to start before, in the prenatal 
phase.  An effective head start program that strengthens the 
ability of parents to be good parents would work to prevent that.

<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us imagine if we were able to do that not only from a 
humanitarian basis but from a total cost basis.  One of those 
children costs the system almost a half million dollars a year up 
to age 18, and it is preventable.  Let us imagine the savings if 
a child does not go to jail, which costs $100,000 a year in a 
juvenile institution.   As someone who has worked in jails for a 
number of years, it is terrible to see.  It is a waste.  It is a 
waste for the taxpayer.  It is a waste for the human being.  It 
is a waste for society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could only encourage the government to follow along with the 
lead of my colleague, to work with what it knows is effective to 
strengthen the parent-child bond and to look at the tax regime. 
If something is to be implemented, it should not be a national 
day care centre but a program that strengthens the parent-child 
bond so that the parents can be better parents to their children. 
We know that is the most effective way.  Also we must ensure that 
children get proper nutrition and that parents have the means to 
do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the welfare system, another aspect of CHST, we know there are 
two populations on welfare: those people who will never be able 
to take care of themselves, but thankfully we have a system that 
allows us to do that, and another population that would like to 
work but for reasons cannot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the biggest complaints we receive from people on welfare 
is that they do not want a handout.  They want a hand up.  What 
really aggravates them is that they want to get some skills, some 
training, and they need a bit of help to enable them to do that. 
However what they find is that they are penalized when they try. 
They are penalized when they say they want to work a bit, to get 
back into the workforce and to develop the skills that will 
enable them to provide for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the way the current welfare system is structured it rewards 
people for staying at home and not working.  It actively 
penalizes individuals who are trying to get the necessary skills 
to stand on their own two feet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that is not the objective of anyone in the House, but we 
have not seen leadership on the part of the government to work 
with the provinces, because it is a provincially managed program, 
to reform our welfare system so that we can give people who want 
to work the tools and the skills to enable them to stand on their 
own two feet.  They would be so grateful for that, that votes, 
money and accolades would go to whomever does it.  That is what 
we need.  We need leadership in these areas and we need reform of 
the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health said on November 27, 1999, and this can 
be ascribed to education and to welfare, that medicare would soon 
be unable to provide Canadians with timely access to medical care 
unless major reforms are undertaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not seen, and I do not know if anybody else has seen 
them, those major reforms coming down the pipeline.  We certainly 
see nice words in the bill.  There is a commitment to some funds 
that will put it back to 1995 levels, but we do not see the major 
structured reforms of leadership that will be required on the 
part of the government to make those reforms relevant and 
effective for the 21st century, be it health care, be it welfare, 
be it education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There rests on the shoulders of the government an extraordinary 
opportunity in leadership.  Why does it not call the first 
ministers together again?  They should be locked in a room along 
with the relevant ministers and told that the problem has to be 
fixed.  At the end of the day they all have the same interests. 
We need to have the interests of the public at heart.  They 
should put away the nonsense, the political drivel, and sit down 
to fix the problem, given effective solutions that already exist 
in the country today.  They exist.  Good solutions from not only 
our country but from around the world exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at the German model for health care.  We could 
take the best from Moncton, Michigan and Hawaii for children.  We 
could look at welfare programs in other parts of the world that 
give people a handout to give them a hand up.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could look at manpower solutions that would address a problem 
that if not dealt with today would result in the deaths of many 
Canadians tomorrow.  It is not something that we could deal with 
tomorrow, because this problem affects us today.  It takes four 
to twelve years to train the people we need after high school. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could only beg on the part of myself and my colleagues that 
the government takes Bill C-45 and implements it but gets back to 
the drawing board now to help people who are suffering in quiet 
desperation and enduring years of pain unnecessarily.  Let us get 
together and do that.  Let us implement the solution.  Let us not 
wait five years to make any changes.  Let us do it this year.

<P><A NAME="LINK62"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to thank my colleagues here for unfailingly supporting my 
actions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First off, I want to say that we are extremely happy with the 
agreement negotiated after a hard fought battle with the 
provinces.  I will have an opportunity to mention it again, but 
I want to say to this House that, at a later stage of our work, 
either in committee or here in committee of the whole, if that 
is how our work is to be done, I will table two amendments, 
which I will explain in the course of the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first amendment concerns the section of the bill dealing with 
the acquisition of medical equipment for which a trust will be 
set up with an injection of $1 billion in resources.  It was 
agreed in fairly detailed terms that the use of this amount for 
the provinces would be broken down.  We would like to introduce 
an amendment that would clarify this even further by setting out 
in clause 2 how the amounts of money will be distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 40 minutes allotted me, I will explain it in greater 
detail, but we will be introducing an amendment to clause 3 as 
well, on funding for communications technologies.  This refers 
to the part of the agreement concerning the pooling of data 
relating to health care, the whole health information network 
the premiers have agreed to set up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois finds something particularly revealing in the 
agreement before us. 
Members will recall that at the first of the Minister of 
Finance's budgets containing cuts to the transfer payments the 
Bloc registered its objection.  It warned the government 
against—one of the means available to the government—making this 
federalism dysfunctional.  Furthermore, as of 1994, we felt the 
federal government might destabilize the provinces' public 
funds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, although a draft agreement provides some relief by 
injecting $23 billion over five years into transfer payments, we 
cannot forget that between 1994 and the Minister of Finance's 
latest budget the provinces have been deprived of a total of 
$42 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of Canadian federalism, when they say it is a 
system with two levels of government, that each is supposed to 
be autonomous, as constitutional law teaches— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp:</B> Indeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Réal Ménard:</B> My colleague from Beauharnois—Salaberry has even 
taught this to his students. It is hard to imagine in a federal 
system worthy of being called one that a government can 
literally strangle the provinces with its policy, and this is 
what has happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in fact so true—and I want to make this point in my 
preliminary remarks, because I want to spend time on the 
essential issue of health—that in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996, 
governments, especially that of Quebec, witnessed a sort of 
transfer of clientele. 
In other words, all the cuts to health care or to employment 
insurance have had the effect of preventing people from 
qualifying for programs they had access to previously.  They 
ended up turning to the program of income security in increasing 
numbers. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1215"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is so true that some authors, such as economist Pierre 
Fortin, have estimated that the restrictions arising from 
the various federal government cuts have cost the Quebec public 
treasury additional millions.  Clearly the agreement before us 
provides reparation.  We must not ever forget that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no small matter, when we consider the years 1994, 1995, 
1996, 1997 and up to today.  What was needed was a common stand 
by all the premiers, be they New Democrat, Conservative or 
Liberal.  Brian Tobin has, in recent years, added a strong voice 
to this debate. 
He called upon the federal government to re-establish the 
transfer payments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat, we are going to subscribe to the agreement we have 
before us.  We are going to make amendments, but we want the 
money to be made available to the provinces as promptly as 
possible.  We are dealing with the outcome of a mess that was 
literally provoked by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of why we on this side of the House are 
sovereignists. It makes no sense for there to be two orders of 
government, one of them with more financial means than the 
other because of its taxation powers and the division of 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is where the question lies. In modern life, as we are 
living it in this month of October in the year 2000, the major 
responsibilities our citizens expect us to meet fall under the 
jurisdiction of the provincial governments. 
Whether it be health or education, these are areas of 
responsibility that are at the core of our fellow citizens' 
lives, and ones on which the federal government has virtually no 
say, despite the fact that it is better off financially, with 
more financial resources than the provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless, without this common front, without the doggedness 
of the Bloc Quebecois which has made this a guideline, a 
baseline, a kind of leitmotif for all of its political action 
since the Minister of Finance's budget, without this concerted 
effort by the various actors putting pressure on the federal 
government, I do not believe that this would have been 
accomplished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, another explanatory factor for the agreement 
reached by the first ministers at the September 11 conference, 
in addition to all the ones that have come out of Winnipeg via 
Ottawa, is the imminence of a federal election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister, cabinet and the whole government caucus knew 
full well that it would have been unthinkable to call an 
election after impoverishing the provinces, after exerting very 
real pressure on the health system, without doing something to 
restore the sharing of fiscal responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To make things clear, let us take a look at what this agreement 
provides. The agreement is based on six major points. First, it 
seeks, as I said, to restore transfer payments. A total of $23.4 
billion will be invested over the next 5 years. Next year it 
will be $18 billion, then $19 billion, $20 billion and $21 
billion. Transfer payments will be increased to $21 billion and 
about $2 billion will be kept for policies directly aimed at 
young children. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, a $1 billion trust will be set up for the 
acquisition of medical equipment. 
It is critical to realize how important this is for the health 
system, because medical technologies change very rapidly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last winter, I met the administrators of the various hospitals 
on the island of Montreal. I wanted to know how things were 
done, what their major management challenges were and what it 
meant, ultimately, for an administrator to provide health 
services to a community. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT29"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT29"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1220

<A HREF="#LINKT28"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the administrators told me about the importance of renewing 
the technological equipment in the medical sector. Acquisition 
costs for these technologies are extremely high and the life 
expectancy of this equipment is about five, six or seven years 
at best. So $1 billion will be earmarked for the acquisition of 
medical equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is too vague and an amendment will be necessary, 
because we want to correct that flaw. 
We want it to be clearly stipulated that the proposed funding, 
the $1 billion for the acquisition of medical technologies, will 
be entirely consistent and in no way discretionary with what was 
agreed at the meeting of first ministers in Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I draw the attention of all parliamentarians to the fact that 
the final press release for the Ottawa conference gives the 
breakdown of this $1 billion for 2001-02.  The totals are given 
for each province.  For 2000-01, Quebec will be receiving 
$119.9 million; the amount for the following year will be 
$119.2 million.  We must not find ourselves in a situation where 
we pass a bill that is not very clear about what the first 
ministers agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an extremely important part of the agreement. 
We attach very great importance to it and that is why we will be 
tabling an amendment here in the House if we go into committee 
of the whole for the subsequent stages. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the $1 billion fund for the acquisition of medical 
equipment, the purchase and installation of modern diagnostic 
tools and other medical equipment that is obviously urgently 
needed, there is a $500 million fund for the installation of 
health information technologies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is also an important feature of the agreement. We know that 
each of the provinces has a database and computer networks, 
information that may give a clearer picture not just of the 
progression of diseases, but of various trends in the medical 
community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the Ottawa conference this past September 11, the first 
ministers agreed to exchange this information.  The purpose of 
the information exchange is to ensure compatibility among the 
various information systems so that data may be exchanged at 
high speed without any technological hitches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was made very clear in the communiqué.  There was no 
reference to Canada-wide information standards, as there is in 
the bill.  In order to make things very clear for those who are 
listening to us, and in order for them to clearly understand the 
reason for our amendment, I would like to read what the first 
ministers had agreed to in their final communiqué at the end of 
the September 11 conference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Specifically in relation to health information and communication 
technology, both Premier Bouchard and Minister Marois agreed that 
it is important to have this exchange of information, and to 
have it work both ways, so that the provinces may also benefit. 
For example, the federal government has a health information 
network. 
It is important that this information circulate as freely as 
possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that every time the government of Mr. Bouchard, and of 
Mr. Parizeau before him, had the opportunity to serve the 
superior interests of Quebec, it made a contribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I would remind hon. members that any time there 
was an opportunity to allow Quebecers to benefit from a change 
for the better in the status quo as far as their day-to-day 
services were concerned, the sovereignist governments, which are 
as everyone knows extremely vigilant in defending the interests 
of Quebec, whether in the time of René Lévesque, Jacques 
Parizeau or Lucien Bouchard, have taken advantage of that 
opportunity.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind members that the manpower agreement was 
negotiated by Louise Harel.  It was not accomplished under the 
Bourassa government.  It was vitally important to have a single 
window in Quebec in 1995 for those receiving income security and 
those receiving employment insurance.  Quebec had had enough of 
making a distinction in connection with changes in the labour 
market that for too long had resulted in a duplication of 
programs that left the public confused.  The result is that as 
we speak, someone who is unemployed in Quebec can access all of 
the Government of Quebec programs through a single window and 
does not need to go through a multitude of intermediaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The sovereignist governments, because their allegiance is to 
Quebec alone and to the people they represent, have, in very 
current matters that are at the heart of our fellow citizens' 
concerns, been able to come up with agreements where the 
federalist governments could not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have just given the example of manpower, but I could have 
given other examples.  I would, however, like to get back to the 
matter of health.  On the subject of health information and 
communication technology, it was agreed at article 7 of the 
agreement, which I quote, that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>All governments have made major investments in health 
information technologies in recent years to improve care and 
health system management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First Ministers agree to work together 
to strengthen a Canada-wide health infostructure to improve 
quality, access and timeliness of health care for Canadians. 
First Ministers also commit to develop electronic health records 
and to enhance technologies like telehealth— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telehealth is remote health care.  I will give you as an example 
the case of a person who is x-rayed in Lotbinière riding but 
needs further treatment in the Saint-Luc hospital. 
It is then possible with telehealth to send the x-ray and the 
information by means of an electronic and computerized process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Telehealth will become extremely important in the coming years, 
because we know that the treatment individuals are to receive may 
not be available in their community.  I will continue reading 
from article 7: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—over the next few years. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here I draw the attention of the members, because this is where we 
will introduce an amendment. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments will continue to work collaboratively to develop 
common data standards to ensure compatibility of health 
information networks. 
This will lead to more integrated delivery of health care 
services. They will also ensure the stringent protection of 
privacy, confidentiality and security of personal health 
information. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It goes without saying that this information must be secure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are several causes for concern in the bill.  I repeat, 
Premier Bouchard and the health minister, Pauline Marois, have 
agreed that in order to follow developments and understand 
events in areas relating to health care it is important to have 
information circulate.  That is understandable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give you an example. The Quebec public drug plan covers 
certain drugs. 
We want to know if the equivalent of the drugs covered by this 
public program exists in other provinces. How much does AZT or a 
new medication for hypertension cost in Quebec, and what is its 
equivalent in other provinces? It would be helpful to provide 
this kind of information through a network, and that information 
should be accessible to all the stakeholders, but there is 
absolutely nothing on national health standards.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, the leader of the Bloc Quebecois, the deputy 
leader of the government and yours truly were very surprised—let 
us not forget that we received the bill late yesterday 
afternoon—to see that the legal wording of clause 3 reads as 
follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>3. The Minister of Finance may make a direct payment of $500 
million for the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 2000 to a 
corporation, to be named by order of the Governor in Council on 
the recommendation of the Minister of Health, for the purpose of 
developing and supporting the adoption of Canada-wide information 
standards and compatible communications technologies for health 
services in Canada. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, there is a difference between the text of 
the final release approved at the first ministers' conference on 
September 11 and the legal wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the different wordings in the release and in the bill 
are an accident because the legal officers did not accurately 
reflect the will of the premiers and of the Prime Minister. That 
is possible, but the Bloc Quebecois will have to propose 
amendments, and I understand that the government will support 
such amendments. This will ensure an adequate process for 
everyone, and I gather that there will no obstruction from any 
side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are the main points of the agreement. 
I wanted to go over it again because I think it is vital to our 
understanding.  Had it not been for the vigilance of the Bloc 
Quebecois, the common front presented by all the first ministers 
and, I think we would have to agree, the impending election, we 
would never have arrived at an agreement such as this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wish to take this opportunity to remind the House that 
one year ago all the health ministers had asked their officials 
to try to determine the progression of health care costs.  We 
cannot say this often enough.  It would have been unbelievable, 
completely shameless of the federal government, and it 
would have shown a complete lack of civility and political 
good grace if the federal government had not made this gesture 
of atonement.  This is the atonement of a hegemonic government 
that has repeatedly taken advantage of its financial position, 
that has acted unilaterally to make the provinces poorer, often 
creating additional costs for their respective treasuries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this was documented in a study, which I have summarized, 
because it is 200 pages long.  This was a study commissioned by 
all health ministers.  First, it looked at a well-known demand. 
At the time, all the provinces were calling on the federal 
government to restore transfer payments to 1994 levels 
immediately.  This is pretty much what is being proposed.  In 
this, the provinces have been successful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile calling to mind that the study in question 
indicated that total provincial and territorial health 
expenditures were $11 billion in 1977.  Why did they choose 
1977?  Because, hon. members will recall, that was the first 
year the existing programs were reformulated and the first year 
reference was made to established programs financing, the famous 
EPF. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall that in 1977 the provinces were spending $11 
billion on health, whereas this year they will be spending $56 
billion.  This gives us an idea of the effort the provinces have 
had to expend in order to continue to provide health services to 
their respective populations.  In parallel with the stepped up 
efforts of the province, the federal government has disengaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am asked to speak to people working in the health sector 
or at conferences, I always remind my listeners that for the 
year 2001-02, for example, if the government of Quebec wanted to 
provide exactly the same services as this year's to its 
population without adding any new services, its health budget 
would have to go up 5%.  Thus, the health budget of the 
government of Quebec is rising more rapidly than the collective 
wealth being generated by the people of Quebec.

<A HREF="#LINKT31"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the dramatic situation that is going on.  Once again, if 
the federal government had not re-established the transfer 
payments, it would have been extremely difficult for the 
government of Quebec to manage without jeopardizing other 
equally essential missions in the Quebec community.  I think I 
have explained this sufficiently, so I will go on to the 
conclusion of the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thank the hon. member for Québec for being here with me in the 
House.  I do not think I have ever made a significant speech 
without her support.  As far as politics is concerned, we are 
just about joined at the hip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The main thrust of the conclusion of the report by all the 
ministers of health is extremely interesting. 
Let me read that conclusion. It says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A review of the block funding for health shows that the gap 
between the current amount of the federal contribution, and the 
amount at which that contribution could be if it had increased 
significantly, has constantly grown bigger. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a big difference between the health care system of the 
eighties and that of the year 2000-01. For one thing, new 
diseases have surfaced. For example, AIDS was unknown before the 
eighties. Still, we won the battle against AIDS which, during 
the eighties and the early nineties, was a deadly disease. It is 
now a chronic disease, because we can control it with triple 
therapy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important factor is, of course, the aging population. 
The Quebec population ages faster than the population in other 
countries. I have some figures here. Mr. Speaker, knowing your 
intellectual curiosity, I will be pleased to share these figures 
with you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 35 years, one quarter of Quebec's population will be over 55 
years of age. In Germany or in France, it will take 65 years for 
that same phenomenon to occur, but in Quebec it will only take 
35 years. Imagine the pressure that this puts on the public 
health system, but also the challenge that we will have to face 
when restructuring our health services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our generation is not the same as the generation of our parents 
or grandparents. People will not necessarily accept to live 
outside their homes when they get old. They will want to stay 
longer and longer, as long as possible, I would say, in their 
natural community. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is one item of the budget that will be increasing, I am 
happy to tell the member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel, because 
he is our oldest member, although he is still very alert.  He 
may even be the oldest member of the House.  No, I think that 
distinction is reserved for the member for Terrebonne—Blainville. 
In any event, the member for Argenteuil—Papineau—Mirabel is the 
Bloc Quebecois critic for seniors' issues.  We know that one of 
the budget items that will be growing in both absolute and 
relative terms is home care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Governments are going to have to devote considerable effort to 
keeping people in their home setting.  This means that the focus 
of service will have to shift from institutions to the 
community.  This is called primary care. 
This is why the agreement provides for $800 million over five 
years to study how to keep people in their home setting as long 
as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was asked to speak for 30 minutes and I think I have done 
that.  I will sum up with three points. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1240"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois is delighted that the federal government has 
finally loosened the purse strings and is about to invest 
$23.4 billion over the next five years.  We will of course make 
sure that Quebec gets its fair share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On examining the bill, we noticed discrepancies between what the 
first ministers wanted and the wording of the bill.  The Bloc 
Quebecois is going to move an amendment to clause 2 in order to 
ensure that the established population-based shares do indeed go 
to the provinces as agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the compatibility of the various information networks and 
databases, which everyone agrees is important for a 
comprehensive overview, we will ensure that we do go the way of 
national standards, because this is not necessary and because it 
was not what the first ministers agreed to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I assure the House of our desire to help see that 
the bill is passed quickly.  I understand that in any event the 
government is going to agree to the amendments moved by the Bloc 
Quebecois.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, needless to say we welcome the opportunity to finally 
debate in a meaningful way the health care crisis in Canada 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to note that this is the first time in the 
last three years and four months since we were elected to this 
place in June 1997 that we have before us a bill from the 
government pertaining to the number one issue of Canadians.  For 
three years and four months we have known full well that the 
country and its health care system is going deeper and deeper 
into crisis, but it has taken three years and four months for the 
government to finally bring the matter to the House and to allow 
for a thorough debate on this very critical issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill, whatever it is called, whatever number it has and 
whichever minister presents it, is clearly the government's 
supposed solution to its mismanagement of the health care 
situation in Canada today.  Let us be under no illusions about 
what the bill is.  It is the result of pressure, pushing, 
cajoling and prodding from Canadians everywhere in the country. 
It is a reluctant step in response to that outcry, that 
outpouring of concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we in the New Democratic Party welcome this 
opportunity.  We have been raising the issue tirelessly in the 
House for the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members in the New Democratic Party caucus feel a tremendous 
responsibility to ensure that the work of our forefathers and 
foremothers in the CCF and the NDP in pioneering medicare is 
carried on.  The House will appreciate that we feel the 
pioneering work, that innovative contribution to Canadian public 
policy, has in fact been jeopardized by the inaction, passivity 
and lack of leadership by the federal Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is clearly a need for the House to debate the health care 
issue.  There is clearly a need for the House to ensure adequate 
and thorough review of the bill before us.  I hope we have that 
opportunity.  One gets the impression that the government is in 
fact attempting to push the bill through in short order.  One can 
imagine our concern after reading news reports today quoting the 
Minister of Health's suggestion that the House would deal with 
the bill in one day. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1245"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine our shock and concern when we read, as is mentioned in 
the Charlottetown <I>Guardian</I>, that the Minister of Health 
suggested at the federal-provincial health ministers meeting that 
the provinces bend the ear of opposition members of parliament if 
they want to ensure the bill passes before a possible fall 
election. I hope this is not accurate.  I hope that members in 
the government are not trying to manipulate parliament or trying 
to use this place as a rubber stamp. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before this parliament is one of the most important issues in 
the history of this country and the government wants to shove it 
through.  It wants to cut off debate.  It wants to deny the 
opportunity for thoughtful analysis, scrutiny and reflection.  As 
some of my colleagues in the House have said, is this just 
another cynical election ploy to create the illusion, the false 
pretence to the Canadian public that the government is actually 
doing something on health care after neglecting this field and 
doing nothing for seven years?  Surely not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely this place is not about satisfying a particular party's 
agenda to advance its election timetable.  Surely this place is 
not about satisfying the political agenda of one party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that we have some opportunity to debate this very 
important issue.  We hope we will have that opportunity.  We will 
certainly do our part to thoroughly review the bill and to offer 
our careful analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget, and let us be mindful of the fact that the 
bill was delivered to us yesterday at 3 p.m.  Let us not forget 
or ignore the fact that this is a substantial piece of 
legislation.  Let us not forget that we have a responsibility to 
ensure that this opportunity in the history of Canada is not 
forsaken for the whim of a political electoral agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that the House has never had a debate 
initiated by the government on the state of health care in the 
entire last three years and four months. We have also never had 
the opportunity to discuss this matter in the Standing Committee 
on Health, the parliamentary committee that is supposed to be the 
body, the avenue, for thorough review and study of the issues of 
the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health care is the number one issue of the day.  The health care 
system is in crisis.  The government is clearly under pressure to 
listen to the voices of Canadians and we have not even had the 
opportunity to discuss this matter in the health committee.  It 
has not been for lack of trying.  In fact we have had motions 
before the health committee to convince the Liberal members on 
that committee that the committee should be reviewing the state 
of health care and should be providing important input and advice 
to the government. Of course the trained seals across the way 
rallied around the Minister of Health, who gives the directions. 
They cut off debate and denied the opportunity and assured us we 
would never have an opportunity as parliamentarians to thoroughly 
discuss this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are with our backs against the wall, I guess the 
Liberals would probably say.  Here we are being told we have a 
limited opportunity to discuss the number one issue facing 
Canadians.  I say shame on the Liberals.  Shame on the government 
for not allowing this place, this democratic institution that 
speaks on behalf of all Canadians, to have a say in the future of 
health care in this country.

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we thought we were being manipulated by what we are hearing 
in the media and what the ministers are purported to have said at 
the health ministers meeting, it certainly has been confirmed by 
the full coverage of the government's advertising campaign. As we 
speak, $8 million of ads are happening to espouse the virtues of 
the deal and presumably of the legislation before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How is it that we are supposed to be offering a thorough 
analysis and ensuring proper parliamentary procedure around Bill 
C-45 when ads are already running saying it is a done deal?  The 
ads are already saying it is over.  Are we nothing but a rubber 
stamp?  Is that all we are today? Let us hope not and let us hope 
we have a bit of time to discuss these issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are talking about the whole process and the clear sense 
we have that the government wants to push this bill through, let 
us look at the fact that the health committee has yet to 
reconvene.  The health committee has yet to meet, elect a chair 
and plan an agenda.  That says it all about how much the 
government cares about the democratic process and parliamentary 
procedures and respect for the institution. It has bypassed, 
ignored and violated every process available to parliamentarians. 
It has denied us the opportunity to speak on behalf of Canadians 
who care deeply about the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the rush?  Why is the government rushing the bill 
through if that is the case?  Clearly the bill implements the 
September 11 deal of between the first ministers.  That deal causes 
grave concern to all of us and does not even ensure that the 
increased transfer payments kick in until 2001. After reading 
this bill it will be clear that the Liberals want to rush through 
a bill that is not really meant to be operational until the 
spring of 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously we wonder what is the rush.  The Liberals may argue 
that they need the bill to implement the special funds that first 
ministers agreed to pertaining to equipment, information 
technology and transition funds.  If that is the case, then 
surely they would agree to split the bill.  Give us an option to 
deal with what is urgent and pressing and allow for a much more 
thorough and comprehensive debate in terms of the whole issue of 
transfer payments and the future of medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One also has to wonder, if it is so important to rush this bill 
through to make those special funds operational, why is it that 
only the funds pertaining to equipment and to information 
technology are mentioned in the bill?  If, as the minister of 
revenue said earlier, the idea of transition funds to reform our 
primary health care system is so important, why is that not 
mentioned in the bill?  Does the government have other ways to do 
that? If so, why is that other means not used to deploy the funds 
for the equipment and information technology parts of the 
agreement? It just does not make sense, unless this is simply a 
cynical ploy to present a facade, an illusion, to the people in an 
election soon to be called. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget there have been seven years of neglect.  Let 
us not forget that the government is now trying to compensate for 
incompetence, mismanagement, neglect and lack of leadership over 
the last seven years.  Let us not forget that it was in 1995 that 
the bunch across the way took the biggest single bite out of 
health care funding in the history of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the government had an opportunity to act 
on a blueprint presented to parliament, the government and the 
Canadian people from the national forum on health.  It suggested 
exactly what needed to be done for the future of medicare and the 
government sat on it and let it gather dust. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that in 1997 the government in its most 
cynical move ever, but maybe not as cynical as the one we are 
about to see, decided to campaign on the ideas of national 
pharmacare and home care. 
Three years and four months have passed since that time and not a 
step has been taken to move toward the implementation of those 
ideas.  We have nothing but broken promises and empty rhetoric 
when it comes to the most fundamental issues of health care 
today.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget that the government had an opportunity in the 
last budget to do what Canadians said it should do, to do what 
every provincial and territorial government said it should do, to 
do what every health care organization in the country said it 
should do.  That was to increase financing and transfer payments 
for health care in a way that was significant, sufficient and 
predictable to meet the growing needs and demands on our system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the government do?  I am sure it knew it had a pretty 
significant surplus back then, given the projections we are 
hearing today of $33 billion for the present fiscal year.  The 
government probably knew it had a pretty good surplus back in 
February 2000.  What did it choose to do?  It gave two cents for 
health care for every dollar in tax cuts. That was it, the two 
cents for health care budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent six months clamouring, pushing, prodding and cajoling 
the government to do something.  We asked that it address the 
needs and the crisis in the health care system.  We asked that it 
ensure that at this time of opportunity funds be put into health 
care at least to get us back in line with a 25% federal share of 
health care financing and ideally a 50:50 partnership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here we are today and finally it has chosen to act, to take a 
small step, a tiny step.  With the September 11 deal, as outlined 
in this legislation, the government has put back most of the 
funds that it itself cut out of health care in 1995, but not 
quite.  It is not even the full amount.  We are still about $900 
million short, if I am not mistaken.  It still will not kick in 
until next year.  There is still no long term predictability and 
sustainability in the system.  Of course, we have to keep in mind 
that it has a limited timeframe.  There is a five year period and 
nothing beyond that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even on the issue of money, which is only part of the picture 
and part of the work required, the government did a half job. It 
took a partial step.  It could not even complete the task at hand 
when it came to the transfer payments it slashed back in its 
first term of office in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be under any illusions that this is a historic deal. 
Let us not try to paint this for something it is not.  My 
goodness, the Canadian people are smarter than that.  They know 
what this deal is all about.  They are prepared, as we are, to 
acknowledge it is a small step, but it certainly is not a plan 
and a vision for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My goodness, no wonder Canadians are asking if there really is 
any difference between the Liberals and the Alliance.  Are the 
Liberals not just doing what the Alliance is saying?  The 
Alliance leader has said that national standards are not needed. 
Obviously we totally disagree with that approach but the 
Liberals, who had an opportunity to move on national standards, 
let it drop off the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance has said that we do not need to have any 
enforcement of the Canada Health Act by way of financial 
penalties.  The Liberals let it happen.  They just do not enforce 
the Canada Health Act.  They had an opportunity with bill 11 to 
do something, but they stood back and let that bill on private 
for profit hospitals make its way through the legislative route. 
Today we are facing this black moment in our history, this dark 
period in our time, where bill 11, the first bill in the country 
for private for profit hospitals, has become law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had a golden opportunity not just to stabilize 
the system, but to move forward.  I dare say it had the will and 
the support of many around the table at the first ministers' 
meeting on September 11, but it chose to go with the bare minimal 
approach.  It chose to do the least possible. It chose risk 
management over dreaming big dreams and planning for the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is missing in this deal is a plan for the future.  Despite 
what the Prime Minister has tried to suggest in the House and 
despite what other members are saying today, there is nothing in 
this deal to advance the country toward a national pharmacare and 
home care plan. There is nothing.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Alliance members are clapping about that.  Alliance members 
obviously do not support any kind of strengthening of the 
medicare system.  The Alliance has actively advocated private, 
for profit health care.  We do not expect much support from 
members on that side of the House for our position today, but we 
hold out a tiny bit of hope that maybe somehow we can get through 
to the government today to tell it clearly not to miss the 
opportunity to go back to the drawing board and come up with a 
plan that can be implemented now to renew and strengthen 
medicare. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are at a crossroads.  We said that last spring.  We can go 
forward in terms of building a universal public health care 
system, or we can let it lapse into a two tier American style 
health care system.  We are still at that crossroads today 
despite the bill.  We are still here because of the lack of 
courage, the lack of dreaming, the lack of vision, the lack of 
decision making and the lack of leadership from the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I conclude my remarks by saying let us have a chance to debate 
this issue, to talk about the future and build a strong medicare 
system.  Our fight, from our point of view, is far from over.  It 
is clear to us that we cannot fix health care without a plan to 
control drug prices, without a national home care plan and 
without the courage to fight privatization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will keep speaking out in parliament and everywhere across 
the land so that we can continue to take steps toward restoring 
and renewing medicare.  We will be even louder in our demands, in 
pushing for a national plan and a national vision, because the 
very future of medicare is at stake.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, what takes place in the House from 
time to time is very unfortunate.  Different parties, the 
opposition, and even, heaven forbid, sometimes people on the 
government side, actually come up with some good ideas. 
Unfortunately they couch them among much rhetoric and dogma.  We 
lose the good part of what these members have to say when there 
is so much nonsense tied in with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to question the member who just spoke about a 
specific aspect that was raised in my riding by an NDP cabinet 
minister who is running for the Liberal Party nomination.  It is 
an interesting situation.  He raised the matter of Alberta's bill 
11, which is legislation that authorizes the provincial 
government to contract with the private sector to provide 
services that the government is not able to provide in a timely 
manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what the NDP is so adamantly opposed to, but in my 
province of British Columbia, which has an NDP government, 
exactly the same thing is done.  The Workers' Compensation Board 
and the NDP provincial government contract with the private 
sector and hire doctors to queue jump, to bypass the system. Both 
the WCB and the NDP government frequently send patients to the 
United States health care system.  The only difference is that it 
has not been legitimized through legislation.  That government 
tries to pretend it is not doing that while in fact it has been 
doing that for far longer than Alberta has. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the hon. member opposed to in Alberta when her own 
provincial wing in British Columbia has been doing exactly the 
same thing? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am glad to have 
this question because it is very important for the people of the 
country to know exactly where the political parties stand when it 
comes to something as fundamental as our universal public health 
care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I tell the member who expressed an opinion here today that he is 
wrong, that what Alberta is doing through bill 11 is endorsing 
and legitimizing private, for profit hospitals for the first time 
in the history of the country.  We happen to believe that there 
is no room for profit in our health care system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously members of the Alliance Party have backing from 
private market forces and multinational corporations that want a 
piece of the pie. 
They see the health care system solely in terms of the potential 
for making money.  They see it as an $82 billion golden egg.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not.  We happen to think that the only way to run our 
health care system is to continue on the path of non-profit 
public administration, ensuring universal access to everyone in 
the country regardless of the money they make and regardless of 
where they live. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are obviously having to deal with an incredible barrage from 
the forces of darkness in the country who believe that the only 
way to save our health care system is to allow for a private 
parallel health care system.  That does not work.  It is not more 
effective.  It does not save money.  It does not deal with 
waiting lists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a party that talks all the time about the most effective and 
efficient way to go, why does it not support us in our efforts to 
ensure that the medicare model, which as we know is fundamentally 
sound, is allowed to take us into the millennium to be the basis 
upon which we build a system that is truly responsive to the 
needs of Canadians?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member for her passionate and 
informed remarks on this very timely and important matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in this party very much embrace the same concept that much of 
what is wrong with health care now is more than just money.  The 
money that has been proposed here is inadequate.  The premier of 
her province, the premier of my province and others gathered with 
the Prime Minister with the genuine intent that they were looking 
for some indication the government was sincere in its approach 
and sincere in its intent to try to repair what is happening, to 
try to repair the undermining and the tearing of the fabric of 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Progressive Party of Canada and our leader have been 
proposing as one part of the remedy, not the be-all and end-all 
but one part, is to inject some stability and some long term 
commitment to the funding for health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that the system is in need of nurses, doctors, 
equipment and beds, the fundamentals, but they also need to know 
there will be a plan that will allow them to plan for the future, 
that will allow them to address the ever increasing complexities 
and changing atmosphere in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member also agree that this addition of a sixth 
principle to health care is what is needed as a starting point 
and that this is what should also have been included in this 
accord? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member referred to the current government as the forces 
of darkness.  I would go one step further.  The Prime Minister 
has become the Darth Vader of what has happened to health care. 
He is aided by the storm trooper Minister of Health and the 
faceless ewoks on the backbench who are ready to just let this 
happen.  This is the quick fix:  throwing a little money at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleague from New Brunswick Southwest has indicated that in 
the province of New Brunswick this influx of cash will result in 
nine days of funding.  That is how quickly the money will be used 
up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It is only six days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  That new influx of cash will last 
between six and nine days.  That is an indication of what is 
really happening.  This is very much money that is promised at 
some point in the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the deathbed reprieve that has been offered by this accord, 
is it stability of funding?  Is it a commitment that the money is 
to be there not only in the short term but in the long term?  Is 
there also an agreement, a willingness and an openness on the 
part of the government to work with provincial health ministers 
to look at the big scheme? Is it a mechanism which will allow for 
fundamental approaches that will keep doctors, nurses and 
hospitals open and working together on a non-partisan level to 
ensure that health care will be there for Canadians in the 
future? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  What is at stake here is how we build a system that is 
sustainable for the future.  That is where I believe the 
government missed the boat.  It missed a golden opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there was a will among many of the 
provincial premiers around that table to look at a broader 
vision of health care.  I know that from Manitoba there was a 
real desire for and an interest in having leadership from the 
government around a national pharmacare plan.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead of any kind of commitment to pursue a mechanism for 
advancing and renewing medicare, instead of sending a clear 
signal about where medicare has to go in the future, we got 
nothing but more task forces, working groups and studies on all 
the key issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the critical human resource question and the crisis we are 
soon to face in terms of a nursing shortfall we got a committee. 
On the matter of drug prices skyrocketing out of reach we got a 
committee.  On the question of home care we got a committee.  On 
the questions of basic accountability and national standards, 
so-called report cards, and I hate to even use those words, we 
got a task force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hardly think that this was taking advantage of the 
opportunity.  At a time when there seemed to be the will and 
spirit to move forward together, the government dropped the ball, 
backed away, did the bare minimum and refused to show any kind of 
leadership in bringing different forces together and going 
forward.  Canadians will pay the price for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In very short order people will realize that this so-called 
historic deal is hardly what it is cooked up to be.  In short 
order Canadians will realize that the money is by and large 
already spent since there was such a need in the system and 
provincial governments were facing such a pinch because of rising 
health care costs and declining federal funds.  Canadians will 
know very soon that the government let them down and that we 
missed a wonderful opportunity in our history. 
<P><A NAME="LINK66"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the 
bill can most aptly be titled the postdated cheque bill because 
it promises a restoration of funds to provinces, to patients and 
to medical professions across the country which simply will not 
come on time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last dramatic action the government took with respect to 
Canada's health care system was that it made a deliberate choice 
to put the heaviest burden of its restraint measures upon 
Canada's health care and social systems.  That was a deliberate 
choice.  That was a clear demonstration of what it is now 
customary to call Liberal values.  The Liberals picked first on 
the sick.  They picked first on people who are in need in 
society.  That is where the burden of the cuts came. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last dramatic action was a series of unilateral cuts that 
were made without warning.  They were devastating cuts that have 
done more to damage the health care system than any other single 
set of circumstances faced by the country in the last several 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After five years of pain the government today suddenly calls for 
debate on Bill C-45, which would have cash transfers for health, 
post-secondary education and social services returned to 1994 
levels, not by this year but by the year 2002-03. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the government finally repent?  This was not the 
government's will.  It was pushed to this agreement by the 
provinces of Canada and by the virtual certainty that sooner or 
later it would have to stop hiding and face the people of Canada 
in a federal general election.  Left to its own devices, the 
government would have continued to let the health care system 
drift into the disarray that has caused such hardship across the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before these payments are made another 18 months will pass. Full 
restoration of the cuts will only occur eight years after the 
cuts were so brutally made.  I repeat, those cuts were the single 
biggest factor in the erosion of the health care system in the 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The change today is not driven by the erosion of the health care 
system.  The change today is driven by a cynical political 
calculation of fear of an election in which the Liberals would be 
held to account for the damage they have done in hospital after 
hospital, home after home, family after family, right across 
Canada. 
They had every opportunity to change this policy earlier and they 
did not do that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I look at the legislative agenda of this parliament, I am 
struck by one thing.  Whether the issue is employment insurance 
or whether the issue is health care funding, every initiative by 
the Liberal government is being driven by an attempt to repair 
the damage done by earlier Liberal Party initiatives.  This is 
simply a damage control government.  This is not a government 
that is seeking to serve the interests of the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims this is full restoration of funding.  It 
is not.  The bill cheats the provinces, the patients and the 
health care professionals of Canada by at least $3 billion.  Had 
it been passed and effective this week and had moneys been 
committed this year, nearly $3 billion more would be in the 
system than is in the system under the bill before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians will not see any of the restored funds this winter. 
The first instalment only occurs next April 1.  That is quite 
clear in Bill C-45.  It is also clear with this cynical 
government that the Liberal Party ads are running but the money 
is not moving.  That is the height of cynicism in a system like 
this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important failure of this accord, apart from the fact 
that it is a postdated cheque that cheats the recipients, is that 
the government still has not assured the provinces of stable 
funding in the future.  That means provinces, health care 
professionals and people who are ill or fear being ill are 
subject once again and still to the threat of massive unilateral 
cuts in health care funding by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The funding for the next four years does not recognize actual 
health costs or other factors contributing to rising health 
costs. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has yet to guarantee the provinces stable 
funding in the future.  The votes for the coming four years do 
not take into account the present costs of health care nor the 
other factors affecting these costs.  Despite the reinstatement 
of the transfers, we have no assurance that the federal 
government will not unilaterally cut transfers once again in the 
event of an economic recession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The arrogance of this government is beyond all.  With an 
election on the horizon, it is now telling the provinces to push 
the opposition to pass the bill in a day. Why did the government 
not listen to the provinces and the opposition in recent years, 
when we were saying that unilateral cuts to health care had hurt 
Canadians considerably? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In January 1997, the provincial and territorial ministers of 
health informed the federal government that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cuts in federal transfer payments have resulted in a 
critical loss of revenues for the provinces and the territories, 
forcing them to make rapid changes to the system and seriously 
threatening their ability to maintain existing services.  The 
reductions in federal funding accelerated the movement to reform 
a system that lacks the ability to absorb and sustain the 
adjustments that that requires. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Did we hear an announcement of funding for health care?  No. How 
did the Prime Minister react?  In response to the demand put to 
him by the premiers at the annual Saskatoon conference, the Prime 
Minister apparently expressed doubts about the unconditional 
payment of votes to the provinces.  He wanted to impose 
conditions in order to prevent the provinces from funding income 
tax reductions with this money. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is clear is that the Liberal Party's political agenda has 
held back health care in Canada.  The federal government's 
interest is not in standards.  That is the flag it flies behind. 
It is not interested in standards.  It is interested in control. 
It does not matter what happens in hospitals across the country. 
It does not matter what happens to people who are sick or fear 
being sick. 
The government wants to control every single penny and if 
Canadians suffer that is just too bad.  That is unacceptable in 
any civilized system.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time the government removed its contribution and 
increased its demand for control.  This is happening at the worst 
possible time in the evolution of the health care system because 
of the insistence on rigidity, the insistence on control and the 
absolute refusal to work with the other partners in the health 
care system to give us a better system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are living through a period now in which our health care 
system is assaulted by several fronts.  There have been dramatic 
changes in technology.  There are dramatic impacts upon the 
system by an aging population who will be able to stay alive and 
active much longer than before.  There are profound changes 
brought by the possibilities of medication and by pharmaceutical 
and other developments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a time of immense change.  This is a time of great 
opportunities for leadership.  This is the time when a Pierre 
Elliott Trudeau or a Lester Pearson would have risen to the 
occasion, but not this government.  What the government has done 
is turn tail and run and let the health care system in Canada 
fall into tatters.  That is absolutely unacceptable to any kind 
of Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we have a deal before us to restore the funding cuts which 
were made unilaterally.  The agreement is overdue.  It pays less 
than is owed but it is welcome because the system cannot stand 
to be starved any further.  However, in all of this talk about 
putting some of the money back, in all of the focus on the 
postdated cheque, the clear reality is that we have not taken a 
single step closer to having a modern and contemporary health 
care plan based upon the principles of the Canada Health Act to 
ensure the health and security of Canadians into the next 
century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is money in the system now, or there will be in a couple 
of years, but there is no plan because this is a government which 
congenitally does not plan.  It is a government of drift rather 
than a government of seizing the initiative and assuring the 
leadership of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The three day meeting of the health ministers this week came up 
with a nursing strategy that will establish committees to 
investigate the chronic shortage, to measure resources and to 
examine changing trends.  Nurses have been saying for years that 
there were chronic shortages in the health care system.  We hope 
we have nurses left in our system by the time the Liberal 
government finishes studying what is wrong.  The ratio of 
practising registered nurses to the Canadian population in 1999 
was one nurse for every 133 persons.  In 1989 the ratio was 
1:120.  The average age of an RN employed in nursing in 1999 was 
43, up from 41 in 1994. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill is silent on how it plans primary care reform.  We know 
from the first ministers' conference that $800 million will be 
invested over four years to support innovation and reform in 
primary care.  We do not know from the bill how that funding will 
be distributed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Elizabeth Witmer, the minister of health for Ontario, is quoted 
as saying that with the primary care funding, 70% will go to 
provinces and territories and 30% will go into a fund that will 
have some Canada-wide applications, but that money is not going 
to be made available until next April. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ontario will have to put more money in to meet expectations 
until the federal cash arrives.  Ontario can do that. 
Unfortunately, not all the provinces in the country have that 
ability.  This is an issue that is seriously missing in the 
government's health care deal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government claims that it is interested in the same quality 
of health care system across the country.  However, it has forced 
this upon the provinces, giving them no alternative but to accept 
this or nothing, which leaves the poorer provinces with a lower 
standard of health care than the others.  What kind of Liberal 
values does that represent?  Where is the health plan for 
palliative care and hospital infrastructure?  All of them are 
important aspects of primary health care reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Bill C-45 the provinces will know their funding for health 
care up to April 2005.  That is five years.  It takes 10 years to 
train a doctor.  Doctors are integral to the reform of primary 
care.  The Canadian Medical Association has just sent me, and I 
am sure other leaders, a copy of a letter in which says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the CMA's estimation the total cumulative funding commitments 
contained in the First Minister's agreement are more than $17 
billion less than what we forecasted as needed to ensure the 
sustainability of the health care system.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That is $17 billion less.  Not only is it less, it is late. 
There is far less here than meets the eye.  The government is 
spending more money this month on health care ads than it is on 
health care.  That is simply unacceptable in a nation like this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Pharmaceutical management is an important part of our health 
care system.  At the first ministers' meeting there was discussion 
about developing strategies for assessing the cost effectiveness 
of prescription drugs and means of drug purchasing costs.  There 
is no concurrent commitment by the federal government to improve 
the timeliness of drug approval.  Some pharmaceutical companies 
offer evidence that drug therapies reduce institutional care. The 
government has direct input in approving new drugs that help 
Canadians avoid lengthy institutional stays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Medical Association has stated that an 
unnecessarily long approval process delays access to new 
medications that may improve patients health status.  However, 
the median time for regulatory approval of new drugs in Canada 
has been significantly longer than in countries such as the 
United Kingdom, Sweden.  Our country has been criticized in 
several independent reviews on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most important retreat that we evidenced today has not been 
the cut in funding, brutal and deadly though that has been in 
some cases. The most serious retreat has been the retreat from 
leadership by this federal government.  The Liberals came to 
office at a time when the economy of Canada was growing sharply, 
largely because of initiatives which they opposed in opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OECD acknowledges that Canada's economic strength was won by 
the initiatives of a decade ago on trade, on the GST and on 
deregulation.  The government did little to earn the surplus 
tabled last week and has done nothing at all to ensure those 
funds would be wisely invested in the future of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the most favourable possible economic circumstances, the 
government has let the Canadian health care system fall into 
disarray.  Was that inevitable?  Did other governments of the 
world do that?  Of course they did not.  Other governments cared 
more about the health of their citizens than this Liberal 
government.  That has shown up in the comparisons that have been 
made by independent agencies around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Canadian government sat back and let Canada's health system 
decline so sharply that even the World Health Organization ranked 
Canada behind most of the comparable world in the quality of our 
health care.  Imagine that in the system of the Canada Health Act 
and in the system of medicare Canada is ranked by the World 
Health Organization behind most of the comparable world.  Why is 
that?  It is that we have a government in office that will not 
show the leadership that earlier Liberal governments showed.  It 
lets things drift in the dust.  It insists on jurisdiction but 
shows no leadership at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has the resources and the tradition to be first in the 
world, but the government has brought us to 30th instead of 
first. If I may say so, it is not only the health care system 
that it has damaged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I spent a good amount of time this summer talking to people in 
Kings county and Hants county in Nova Scotia who are very much 
involved in the health care system.  Some are nurses, some are 
doctors, some are administrators and many more are people who are 
trying to get a doctor for a remote community or trying to ensure 
that it is possible for older people to travel easily to get 
their supply of drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I speak to people in the medical profession I hear over and 
over again that the problem is not just that the money is not 
there but there is a sense that there is no movement in the 
system, there is no plan and there is no hope.  On a question 
like medical care where we have been in front of the world for so 
long, there is no hope. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is that?  Is that the fault of Canada, the Canada that 
created the Canada Health Act, the Canada that created medicare? 
Of course not. 
That is the fault of the federal government in office today which 
has backed away time and time again from exercising the 
leadership that would have let Canada continue to be a leader in 
providing the highest quality health care to its citizens.  The 
government has failed and Canadians are paying the price for that 
failure.

</I></B></P><P align=left>More is at stake here than the health care system, because what 
it has done on health care it is doing on other aspects of the 
Canadian community.  It is not drawing together people who want 
to be together.  It looks for polarization.  That is its new 
theme.  It looks for ways to divide Canadians instead of heeding 
the hopes of parliament.  Instead of heeding, it is responding to 
the requests of provinces.  It ignores them until it is time 
finally with an election looming to bring them together and to 
offer a deal they cannot resist, a postdated cheque.  That is not 
leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A system of co-operation in Canada, of co-operation among 
governments with professionals, with concerned citizens, is what 
we need to restore the country.  As in so many issues there has 
been no leadership by the federal government.  Even now its 
action has been forced by the combination of provincial pressure 
and the impending election.  There is not even the slightest hint 
of federal leadership in developing a new health plan for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I listened to the debate, as I watch what this minister and 
this government are doing, it seems to me they are moving closer 
and closer to where the leader of Her Majesty's official 
opposition says he wants his government to be.  The federal 
government is drawing back from leadership in health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I am reaching the end of my time, so let me conclude on 
this note.  There is one level of government in Canada able to 
speak for all of Canada.  It is not just a question of money.  It 
is not just a question of jurisdiction.  It is a question of 
authority.  If the national government will not lead, the system 
will not succeed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government does not lead.  Our system is in trouble because 
there has not been the leadership that is needed.  The bill is a 
long overdue step in the right direction, but it is a faltering 
step.  It is a step under duress.  It is a step that promises 
more than it delivers.  Unless there is a plan to go with the 
money then the Canadian health care system will continue in that 
long decline that began with the election of this careless, 
drifting government.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened attentively to the right hon. member. I would 
like to remind him that in 1993 the government inherited a fiscal 
framework and a $42 billion deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further, in the 1995 budget there was a non-confidence motion on 
the floor of the House by the then opposition Reform Party.  The 
then leader of the Conservative Party, the member for Saint John, 
voted that the cuts the government made to try and put the fiscal 
framework back together were not deep enough.  That is where the 
Conservative Party stood in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another point we have to make is that there is not a member of 
parliament in the House that does not want a good health care 
system for the country.  The notion that the member and his party 
are the only ones that care about a proper health care system is 
not factually correct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a Prime Minister of Canada can pull 10 premiers together, 
including a separatist premier, and unanimously agree on a pact, 
I think that is something that Canadians respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I learned some time 
ago that when a member like the hon. member dwells so much in the 
past it is because he has a great fear of the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here talking about what needs to be done now because the 
system has suffered grievously over the last seven years, not 
only from the cuts but from the absolute absence of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks to me about bringing together different provinces and 
different groups.  I know it can be done.  I know it could have 
been done by any minister of health or any Prime Minister on that 
side who wanted to do it, but there was no will there to do it.

government to come to the table, it gave the provinces a take it 
or leave it deal, a postdated cheque that was better than nothing 
at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not talk to us about leadership.  There has been no 
leadership on health care, no leadership by the government on 
making the federal and provincial government work together.  This 
is a government that cuts and runs, a government adrift.  It is 
the Canadian people who pay the price. 
<P><A NAME="LINK68"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay—Boundary—Okanagan, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will make this very brief. The only 
thing that is worse than the cuts and the policies of the federal 
government over there is the hypocrisy of the member who just 
spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talks about the cuts of the Liberal government.  What about 
the fact that funding went down to 27% from 50% during his watch 
when he was a minister of the previous Conservative government? 
That is a cut of 46% of federal funding.  Now he wants to point 
the finger at the people across the way who are no more to blame 
than the Conservatives are.  They are all in it together: 
Liberal, Tory, same old story.  Nothing has changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is a 
better poet when he quotes someone else than he is a contributor 
to reasonable debate in the House.  We know the position of his 
party on health care.  The position of his party is that the 
federal government should continue to withdraw.  The quite 
startling position of his leader is that the role of the federal 
government in a system like that of Canada should be as a 
mediator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the hon. member think there would ever have been a Canada 
Health Act had the Prime Minister of Canada acted only as a 
mediator?  Does anybody in the House believe that there would 
have been a Canada at all if the leaders of the federation had 
acted only as mediators? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a prominent role for the Government of Canada to be 
played in the health care system.  The Canadian alliance reform 
party is running away from that role.  Unhappily what it does by 
ideology the Liberal Party does by drift, running away from the 
leadership that the health care system needs. 
<P><A NAME="LINK69"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Solomon (Regina—Lumsden—Lake Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I take this opportunity to congratulate the leader of 
the Conservative Party on his election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also make reference to the fact that the member for 
Kings—Hants talked about the Liberal legacy.  I would like to 
ask a question of the leader of the Conservative Party about the 
Conservative legacy.  In particular, under the Conservative 
government Bill C-91 was passed, the drug patent legislation, 
which provided 20 year monopoly pricing authority for 
pharmaceuticals with regard to prescription drugs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals promised to repeal that if they got elected in 
1993.  In fact they did not repeal it.  They enhanced it and we 
have therefore seen the cost of health care increase 
substantially due to the fact that prescription drugs costs have 
increased substantially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the leader of the Conservative Party now stand in the House 
and refute the legacy of the Conservative government when it 
passed Bill C-91 and support the repealing of Bill C-91? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, on the contrary, that 
initiative was an initiative which has not only brought 
significant innovation to the development and discovery of new 
drugs in the country but consequently helped to address and cure 
diseases that would otherwise not have been addressed and cured. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also provided tremendous economic momentum to many parts of 
the country.  It helped Canada move into an era in which we could 
move, if we chose, to the frontlines in the new economy in 
research and development.  It was precisely the kind of 
initiative that a government of a modern country has to take if 
it is to stay in the leadership of a rapidly changing world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things members of the New Democratic Party will have 
to learn some day is that we cannot run away from the world. 
There is no place to hide out.  If we are to become leaders in 
the world then we have to engage the modern world on its terms. 
That is what that bill did.  That is what this party intends to 
continue to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, one thing that concerns me about the health debate is 
that the Leader of the Opposition is now saying there should not 
be any national standards in which the federal government 
participates in setting, that the standards should be determined 
by the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that kind of system were created, and he has said the 
standards should be determined by the provinces, we would end up 
with an end to national medical care.  We would have a patchwork 
system that differs from province to province. We would have a 
system that is much better in wealthier provinces and poor in 
poorer provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the leader of the federal Progressive Conservative Party 
disagree with the leader of the very conservative reform Canadian 
Alliance? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I certainly disagree 
with the position of the leader of reform alliance party which 
would have the Government of Canada withdraw, not only in the 
field of health but in many other fields that are important to 
the Canadian public interest, from the role of leadership that 
has helped make us a country.  This is not simply a division over 
policy.  This is a division over views of the country.  Are we a 
country or are we not? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the reform alliance party has Canada becoming 
less and less important to its parts and to its people.  I reject 
that absolutely.  I believe that in the establishment of national 
standards there has to be a very active role by the provinces, 
but also there has to be a very active presence by the national 
government, which is the only government of all people of Canada. 
That is the way in which we would intend to proceed as a 
government of this country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Daniel Turp (Beauharnois—Salaberry, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to address, on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, the bill on 
fiscal arrangements for the health sector. Earlier, my 
colleague, the hon. member for Hochelaga—Maisonneuve, presented 
the Bloc Quebecois' views on this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, it is important to stress that the Bloc Quebecois 
endorses the criticisms that were just made by the leader of the 
Progressive Conservative Party. 
The Bloc Quebecois agrees with a number of criticisms addressed 
to the government in view of the fact that this bill is being 
introduced on the eve of a general election, and in view of the 
incredible harm caused to the health system across the country, 
including in Quebec, by the government's cuts to transfer 
payments to the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is surely because of the fight led by opposition parties in 
the House, including the Bloc Quebecois, that the federal 
government has finally heard the voice of reason. The Liberal 
Party finally realized what terrible consequences its cuts have 
had, not only on the health program, but on its users, on sick 
people in hospitals and other health care facilities. Indeed, 
their situation got worse because of the drastic cuts made by 
the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is easy to show what impact these cuts have had on Quebec's 
health program. As members know, between 1994 and 2000, the 
government made cuts of $1 billion each year, that is, six years 
of cuts of $1 billion, $500 million of which could have been 
allocated to our health programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These cuts resulted in the 
elimination of more than one quarter of the budgets of 
Montreal's hospitals, more than one half of the budget of all 
the CLSCs in Quebec, almost the whole budget earmarked for home 
support, four times the annual budget of Ste-Justine hospital 
for children, more than three times the budget of the Royal 
Victoria Hospital, or over one quarter of the cost of the 
prescription drug insurance plan.

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the real impact of the federal cuts to health, the cuts 
it had to re-examine.  That re-examination was possible only 
because of an agreement and a coalition of the provincial 
premiers, and Quebec premier Lucien Bouchard played a pivotal 
role.  He supported until the end the desire of the provinces to 
assume their responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the leader of the Progressive Conservative Party, the 
Bloc Quebecois and the government of Quebec have always insisted 
that the lead role in the health field be given back to the 
provinces, and thus to Quebec. 
The present constitution of Canada requires Quebec's 
jurisdiction over health to be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Faced with this common front, these objections and this 
effective opposition from the parties in the House, the Bloc 
Quebecois in particular, the government was forced to enter into 
an agreement at the last minute.  This would not have been the 
case, if there had not been a federal election looming.  That 
same federal election also appears to have prompted the 
government to table a last-minute bill aimed at implementing that 
commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have examined the bill. 
We have studied it, although we did not have much time to do so, 
but the Bloc Quebecois finds that, even if its intention is to 
implement the agreement and the commitments arising out of the 
press releases issued in the aftermath of this agreement and the 
first ministers' meeting, there appear to have been a few little 
slips, a few little problems that the government ought to 
resolve itself by making some amendments.  We are going to 
propose some amendments ourselves, if it does not listen to 
reason on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Two of the provisions in the bill present a serious problem and 
need to be brought to the attention of all hon. members, because 
they do not appear to properly implement the agreement reached 
between the first ministers a few weeks ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, there is the very basic question of the amount of the 
funds that will be paid to each province under the commitment 
made by the Prime Minister of Canada and the provincial premiers. 
Subclause 2(2) of this bill indicates that the amounts will be 
determined in accordance with the terms of the trust indenture 
establishing the trust into which will be deposited the amount of 
$1 billion for medical equipment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not very clear for a government that calls for clarity 
in other matters.  This provision is silent on the amounts that 
were agreed upon during the first ministers' meeting.  We have 
cause to be concerned about the fact that the government could 
use the establishment of the trust and use the discretion given 
it by this bill to change the amounts if that were its intention. 
This is why we in the Bloc Quebecois will insist that the bill 
mention the amounts agreed upon by the first ministers and that 
they be clearly established within the text of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a limit to the trust that may be put in the Liberal 
Party of Canada in these matters.  It cut its health care 
transfers without consulting the provinces.  It might want to use 
this bill and its subclause 2(2) in order to change the rules of 
the game as set by the first ministers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one serious objection the government absolutely must 
take into account if it wants our party's support: if it 
introduces no amendments, we ourselves will move, at the 
appropriate stage, an amendment to correct a very significant 
failing of this bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our party is also very concerned about certain words used in the 
bill, which are not at all consistent with the agreement reached 
by the first ministers.  I am referring to clause 3 of the bill 
in which the Minister of Finance is invited to make a payment for 
health information and communications technologies and to 
allocate, as agreed by the first ministers, the sum of $500 
million. But this amount will go to a corporation to be named by 
order of the governor in council for the purpose of developing 
and supporting the adoption of Canada-wide standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had thought that this idea of Canada-wide or national 
standards had been sorted out during the discussions at the first 
ministers meeting. Participants had said that the bill should 
talk about common standards, which was much less at odds with 
federal principles. Once again, we must remind the government 
that health is a provincial jurisdiction.  It is the provinces 
who must assume leadership and jurisdiction in the matter of 
health care. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, we see the federal government's intention to 
interfere in this jurisdiction by pushing for Canada-wide 
standards.  Perhaps it is just a translation error, and if so, we 
would hope that the government would make the necessary 
correction.  Canada-wide information standards has been 
rendered in French by normes pancanadiennes.  If this is not 
an error of translation and the intention is that national 
Canada-wide standards must be adopted, we cannot agree. 
The Bloc Quebecois has always fought the idea that there ought to 
be national standards across Canada in an area that falls 
exclusively under provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this wording is maintained, it will be in violation of the 
agreement to which Premier Bouchard gave his approval at the 
first minister's meeting.  Let them not try to do in an 
underhanded way what they did not succeed in doing openly.  The 
provinces managed at the conference to impose the point that 
health is a provincial jurisdiction in which the federal 
government ought not to interfere, as it always seems to have the 
intention of doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois position is that this bill needs corrections 
to two of its fundamental provisions, because these are 
incompatible with the agreement on which a consensus was reached, 
an agreement between the provincial premiers and the Prime 
Minister of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If these amendments are not adopted, the Bloc Quebecois reserves 
its position, when the time comes to vote on this bill.  It will 
always be mistrustful of a government which has shamelessly 
slashed transfer programs in the health field.  The government 
has caused suffering to Quebecers and to many other Canadians, 
and sought to stifle the provinces at the very time that health 
care costs were increasing exponentially. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these remarks I shall conclude my speech, trusting that the 
government will understand that this bill needs amending before 
it can earn Bloc Quebecois approval or assent.

about supporting Canadians' access to timely, high quality health 
care.  Let us talk about what is really going on in the trenches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Prince George the waiting time to see an orthopedic surgeon 
is three years.  In Victoria the waiting time this year has 
doubled.  Why?  No beds, no money, no nurses.  The result 
is that people are going down to the United States to get 
essential health care.  The government's response is to bring 
back the funding to the 1993 level.  In the words of Dr. Ralph 
Lapp, an orthopedic surgeon in Victoria, “Things are getting 
worse at a time when people are thinking that they are getting 
better”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Health said that the status quo is not an 
option, that medicare will soon be unable to provide Canadians 
with timely access to health care until major reforms are taken. 
The Minister of Health said that one year ago.  Where are those 
reforms?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the healthy outcomes of children is an important priority for all 
Canadians and Health Canada advises that breast feeding plays a 
very important part in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the growing child breast feeding reduces infectious diseases 
during childhood, promotes optimal brain development and provides 
protection for premature infants against life threatening 
illnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the mother breast feeding reduces the risk of breast cancer 
and ovarian cancer and enhances the bonding process and decreases 
the risk of osteoporosis.

families, protects the environment, improves the health of our

</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly, the benefits of breast feeding are very substantial. 
Therefore, I am very pleased that effective January 1, 2001 
maternity and parental leave benefits will be extended to one

Mr. Speaker, we have now endured seven years of Liberal waste and

has a plan to pay down our national debt and to lower taxes for 
everyone.  We will end tax discrimination against single income 
families and replace the current Liberal tax system which 
penalizes hard work and overtime. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the Canadian Alliance plan, everyone will receive a basic 
personal deduction of $10,000 including a $3,000 deduction per 
child.  A family of four under the current regressive Liberal tax 
plan starts paying tax at an income of only $16,000.  Under the 
Canadian Alliance plan, a family of four would not start paying 
income tax until its income exceeded $26,000, and then only at 
the single rate of 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of this very simplified and fair tax plan, Mr. Speaker, 
perhaps you yourself will join with millions of other Canadians 
in the next election and vote for the Canadian Alliance.

Canadian Alliance proposes a flat tax which would have exactly 
the opposite effect of a fair and progressive tax system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under this plan, the higher the income, the bigger the tax 
break.  For example, a taxpayer earning $30,000 would receive a 
tax reduction of about $600, while another taxpayer earning 
$200,000 would receive a break of over $22,000.  That is not 
fair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government believes tax cuts must benefit all 
Canadians, but first they must benefit those who need it the 
most: low and middle income Canadians and families.  Our five 
year plan will reduce personal income taxes by an average of 15%. 
Combined with cuts in the last three budgets, annual personal 
income tax reductions total 22%, and for families with children, 
at least 30%.  That is a fair and equitable approach to income 
tax reform.

any contact with the coalition in Yugoslavia which won the

if there have been any specific requests of Canada from the

who might be affected by the unrest in Yugoslavia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question about two Canadians in particular, Shawn Going 
and Liam Hall, who have unfairly been held prisoners in a jail in 
Belgrade since August. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Has the government been in touch with Mr. Hall or Mr. Going

<P><A NAME="LINK126"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Denis Paradis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the decision to extend 
the remand period is unacceptable for those prisoners.  Canada 
believes that there is no legitimate reason for their continued 
detention, which is clearly motivated by political purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We appreciate the efforts of the OSCE, the United Nations and 
our bilateral partners to help secure the release of the four

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Yugoslav people have risen up following the decision by the 
constitutional court to annul the elections.  Former president

has asked Russia to recognize the former leader of the 
opposition, Mr. Kostunica, as president. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the Deputy Prime Minister if the Government of 
Canada also intends to recognize Mr. Kostunica as the winner of 
the elections and the rightful president of the Yugoslav 
federation. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

majority in the first round of presidential elections on 
September 24. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not accept the validity of yesterday's ruling by the 
constitutional court which tried to overturn the September 24th 
elections and called for new ones next summer.  This is clearly a 
political move on the part of Mr. Milosevic to retain power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore we urge Mr. Milosevic to accept the clearly expressed 
will of the Yugoslav people and, as I said before, to step down 
now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier—Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
according to the latest news, President Milosevic has left 
Yugoslavia.  President Clinton is asking Russia, a key player on 
the issue, to recognize Mr. Kostunica as the president of the 
Yugoslav federation, because he was duly elected, as the Deputy 
Prime Minister has just acknowledged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore ask the Canadian government a second time if it will 
recognize that Mr. Kostunica is indeed the president elect of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Herb Gray (Deputy Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, our position on this matter remains the same as it 
always has been.  I will add something to the answer given to her 
previous question.  It is the international practice to recognize 
states rather than individual governments of those states, but we 
are demanding that Mr. Milosevic step down now.

Speaker, for the past seven years the government has mismanaged 
and played politics with the military procurement process, with 
the taxpayer paying half a billion dollars in 1993 when the 
Cormorant or EH-101 contract was scrapped. Now on the eve of 
delivery we have received access to information documents that 
reveal serious deficiencies in the Cormorant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell the House when the first Cormorant search

cost? 
<P><A NAME="LINK167"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (Minister of National Defence,

would have cost had we gone along with the Tory proposal which 
the Alliance now appears to be going along with.  We will not 
take delivery of any helicopter unless it is in fit condition, 
good to fly and meets our operational requirements. 
<P><A NAME="LINK168"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Art Hanger (Calgary Northeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, Canadians have been waiting a long time for the 
delivery of the search and rescue helicopters and so has the 
military.  Now we have learned from the government's own 
documents that the helicopters will possibly be delayed for 
another 30 months at an additional cost of $18.5 million. The 
government has meddled in this process for far too long and that 
is why we are running into these problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Minister of National Defence accept the blame for this

over there on the opposition benches.  Those members cannot seem 
to read documents very well, as I have found in the past. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The operational requirements of the military have always been 
first and foremost for the government.  We want to make sure that 
we get the right kind of helicopter that meets military needs and 
is the best value for the taxpayer dollar.  We will continue to 
operate on that basis.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Homolka is a convicted killer.  She is using taxpayer money

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the solicitor general agree in the first place that

<P><A NAME="LINK179"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, that is interesting because unless the assessment is 
completed by January 6, Homolka will be out of prison having 
served just two-thirds of her sentence.  This fight, at taxpayer 
expense, I might add, will ensure a delay in the assessment and 
she will walk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why did the solicitor general get into this mess in the first

will discuss it with House leaders a little later on.

unfinished business from last week and this week, including Bill 
C-45 and Bill C-44 at whatever stage they are then and to advance 
them as much as possible; Bill C-17 which I described before; 
Bill S-17; and a very short but important bill, Bill S-26, the 
B.C. Telus bill, which I understand there is some urgency to 
adopt.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to ensure that the letter will be tabled as soon as

different if documents were tabled during question period, but 
that is not the case.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>BILL C-247 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Randy White (Langley—Abbotsford, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, as I advised the clerk, I rise on a point of order. 
Last June 14 the House leader of the official opposition raised a 
point of order regarding his Motion No. 425 on the order paper, 
which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a message be sent to the Senate to acquaint their honours 
that this House wishes to convey its dismay regarding the undue 
delay in the Senate's progress on Bill C-247, an Act to amend the 
Criminal Code and the Corrections and Conditional Release Act. 
Members of the House of Commons have expressed their distress at 
the unnecessary delay in dealing with this legislation and in the 
interest of co-operation between the two chambers, and, 
ultimately service to the Canadian public, the House feels 
compelled to express its serious concerns regarding the handling 
of Bill C-247 by the Senate. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe he intended the motion to be placed on the order paper 
so as to be moved at routine proceedings under the rubric 
motions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have concerns of my own about the fate of Bill C-247 and I 
will just read one aspect of it.  It provides that a sentence 
imposed for the offence of sexual assault under section 271 of 
the criminal code shall be served consecutively to any other 
sentence for an offence under that section.

<A HREF="#LINKT62"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was awaiting your ruling, Mr. Speaker, before taking any 
further action of my own on this matter.  The hon. member's point 
of order is well taken.  I wait for the day he moves the motion 
so I can participate in the debate and vote in favour of his 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is important because Bill C-247 was gutted at committee by 
the government leadership.  Thankfully it was restored by the 
power of the backbench and opposition members when it was 
reported back to the House.  Since the government backbenchers 
are feeling a little taken of advantage of and abused lately, 
this would be a perfect time in my opinion for them to flex their 
muscles again on the issue.  Speaker Fraser ruled, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rubric motions usually encompasses matters related to the 
management of the business of the House and its committees, but 
it is not the exclusive purview of the government, despite the 
government's unquestioned prerogative to determine the agenda of 
business before the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is speculation that the Prime Minister will call an 
election.  In that event Bill C-247 would die on the Senate order 
paper.  I suspect we know that the government did not want the 
bill to come into law and there it sits in the Senate some 15 
months.  I believe we have an obligation to the House to go back 
to the Senate and ask where that bill is and when it is coming 
forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I ask of the Chair is that the Chair communicate to the 
Senate its concern about the fate of Bill C-247.  I am sure we do 
not want that bill to die in the Senate after going through all 
this hard work and difficult time in debate to make sure it got 
out of here as best we can after third reading. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I thank the hon. member for his 
intervention on Bill C-247, which as he says is an act to amend 
the criminal code and the Corrections and Conditional Release 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House will recall that this is already the subject of 
private member's Motion No. 425 standing in the name of the hon. 
member for Fraser Valley.  On June 14 he also raised a point of 
order concerning the motion and its progress in the Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the issues raised by the hon. member for 
Langley—Abbotsford and Fraser Valley are the same, it is my 
intention to return a ruling to the House in the next few days. 
It will be returned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not the purview of the Chair to wonder or question when or 
if there will be an election.  We will carry out our duties as if 
we have five years to serve here.  I will get back to the House 
with my ruling in the next few days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona came to see me about a 
question of privilege and I have a direct question for him.  I 
said he could raise it.  I presumed it was a question of 
privilege arising out of today's oral question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  It is not out of question period today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  If it is not out of question period, I will 
wait until tomorrow to hear the question from the hon. member so 
that we follow the procedures.

another speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The Speaker, in 
rising to ask for debate on Bill C-44, asked for questions and 
comments of the last speaker.  If the member who was on his feet 
for questions and comments were here, I am sure we could put forward 
an appropriate motion to see whether the House would agree to 
revert to questions and comments and then go forward.

<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today on a very serious issue that is a concern for many 
people, not only in my riding, Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, but also 
right across the Atlantic region and the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Workers who depend on seasonal industry are found not only in 
the riding of Beauséjour-Petitcodiac but anywhere in Canada where 
the main industry is seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, the Liberal government decided to make changes to 
employment insurance plan, while knowing that HRDC had a 
document showing that, just as an example, 75% of seasonal 
workers in New Brunswick lived on less than $10,000 a year. 
Still, the government attacked these workers, even though they 
had been saying day in and day out that they opposed the 
changes.  When I led the coalition against the cuts to 
employment insurance in New Brunswick, we told the government 
what impacts the cuts would have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to meet with the former human resources development 
minister and present her with a petition containing 17,000 
names. These people were saying that the cuts were going to hurt 
them badly, that they represented discrimination against 
seasonal workers and were therefore unacceptable, and that the 
poorest of the poor would be the ones paying for the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the Prime Minister, who came to get elected in the riding of 
Beauséjour, turned around and said “I visited the area and 
people there are all drunk in taverns, while collecting UI 
benefits”. The people of Beauséjour—Petitcodiac responded to that 
comment on June 2, 1997. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People from my area have had enough of being laughed at, 
denigrated and called lazy. The Prime Minister of Canada said it 
and the Canadian Alliance said it again just now, everyone in 
the Atlantic provinces is lazy and does not want to work.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one thing to say to the members of the Liberal Party and 
the Canadian Alliance: people from my area are hardworking, they 
are educated and they work very hard. When there is work, they 
work. They have no problem with working, except that work in our 
area is seasonal. Nobody wakes up in the morning saying “I want 
to be a seasonal worker”. It is the nature of the industry to be 
seasonal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada must understand that, Ontario must understand that, 
Alberta must understand that, the government must understand 
that. The members of the Canadian Alliance must absolutely 
understand that people in my area are not lazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I myself worked in the seasonal industry, and I can assure the 
House that nobody can call me lazy, far from it. I am tired of 
hearing this sort of thing. I am tired of hearing that the 
people in my community are all lazy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who are known as hardworking people in western Canada? Who are 
considered relentless workers, people who work seven days a 
week? The people from Atlantic Canada who have to leave their 
communities to find work. Our young university graduates who 
have to leave their communities and their families to go and 
work in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not what Canada is about. That is not what our party 
wants. Our priority is to ensure that everybody has equal 
opportunity to be gainfully employed all year round. As people 
in my region would say “We would easily trade our EI benefits 
for a full time job. Any time. No problem”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is, we have a government that is attacking the 
worker instead of the problem, and that is not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of weeks before a federal election and the Prime 
Minister comes in and says “Oops”.  The Minister of HRDC said 
herself that it was a punitive measure.  Ça punissait les 
travailleurs. If it does punish the workers why did it take the 
Liberals four years—two weeks before an election call—to say 
that they made a mistake?  Can they fix all the problems they 
have caused in those communities over the last four years?  How 
many family break-ups have there been?  How many kids have been 
forced into the school breakfast program because their parents 
can no longer feed them because of the cuts to EI?  How many 
parents have been forced to go to food banks because of the cuts 
to EI? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can anyone imagine being a single parent making $10,000 a year 
and having the Liberal government take part of that money away? 
According to a member of the reform alliance party, $10,000 is a 
comfortable salary.  I would like to see that member try to live 
on $10,000 a year.  I think she would change her mind. Perhaps 
what she needs is to end up living on $10,000 a year. Then she 
would understand what it means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Alliance members are saying that they are going to govern 
this country.  I doubt it.  I doubt very much if Canadians will 
accept the kinds of comments made in the House by the reform 
alliance members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Lazy maritimers, they called them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Yes, lazy maritimers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A report was released last week stating that 40% more children 
are living in poverty today than we had 10 years ago.  It keeps 
increasing on a daily basis.   The Liberals are wondering why we 
have more poor children.  If the parents are poor the children 
are poor.  That is how it works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have eight food banks in my riding and I have 82,000 people 
living in the riding.  Every one of those eight food banks told 
me last week that they have seen an increase in people using the 
food banks directly because of the cuts to EI.  They are not 
saying maybe.  They are saying directly.  Who made the 
cuts? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I collected EI when the Progressive Conservative Party was in 
power.  I was able to feed my son and myself and pay my rent with 
that EI cheque.  We cannot do that any more with this Liberal 
Party in power.  We need to change.  Not only do we need to 
change the EI program, we need to change the government.  We need 
to sit on that side and fix what the Liberals have broken, which 
is exactly what we intend to do after the next federal election.

who is against who in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is over there but during her speech she spent a 
great deal of time attacking, of all people, the reform 
conservative alliance.  This is a bill on which all opposition 
members should be united in opposition to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member really think it is more fun to bite the ankles 
of the Alliance and lick the hands of the government than it is 
to act as a member of parliament in opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member should not 
make statements about seasonal workers having a comfortable 
annual income and that they do not need any help.  On top of 
that, the government is going to cut all regional development for 
the same regions that need development to solve the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The employment insurance program is not the problem in our rural 
communities.  The problem is that we do not have jobs.  The party 
that the member represents is saying that it does not agree with 
regional development.  I have no problem saying that the Liberal 
government has made mistakes and has caused a lot of hardship, 
but I can also say that the Reform Party would do the same, if 
not worse. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, on a number of occasions we have sat here listening to 
members of the opposition talk about what the government is doing 
wrong and especially how it has affected those of us in Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the hardships that has been caused with respect to what 
the government has done to EI is the government's clear ability 
to take the money off the backs of Canadian workers and apply it 
to the debt.  This has caused tremendous hardship in my part of 
the country.  There is a little piece of reality in this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process of taking money off the backs of Canadian workers 
and the unemployed and applying it to the debt was started by the 
Progressive Conservative Party.  That is how the Liberal 
government was able to get away with it.  I would like the member 
to comment on her party's role in what the Liberal government has 
done to Atlantic Canadians and seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have to say that the 
member might have her facts a bit wrong. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was a seasonal worker at the time the PC Party was in power 
and I was able to feed my kids.  When the PC Party was in power 
there was a $6 billion deficit in the UI fund.  Today there is a 
$30 billion surplus.  We cannot look at the difference.  I never 
had a problem feeding my son when I was on UI.  There was enough 
money available for me to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the Liberal Party in power, single parents do not have 
enough income to feed their kids or provide them with shelter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member should put her politics aside and look at who the 
culprits are here.  The culprits are the Liberals.  The PC 
government did not have a $30 billion surplus.  We had a $6 
billion deficit.  That was the reality. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I noticed that the speaker from the 
PC Party and the speaker who preceded her were somewhat indignant 
over a remark that I was purported to have made, that all 
seasonal workers earn comfortable incomes.  I want to take this 
opportunity to set the record straight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I talked about were seasonal workers who earn comfortable 
incomes being given additional moneys by the government.  The 
comfortable income is the nearly $50,000 that seasonal workers 
will now be able to earn before any of the EI is clawed back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This member and the member who spoke before made the ridiculous 
assumption that I would consider $10,000 to be a reasonable 
income.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, that was a clear misinterpretation and distortion of 
what I said.  I would like to set the record straight.  I would 
like to ask the hon. member whether she believes that seasonal 
workers who earn nearly $50,000 should have no clawback on their 
EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am just going to quote 
her words from the French <I>Hansard</I>. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She said “Now that he is about to call an election, the Prime 
Minister has decided to increase EI payments to seasonal workers 
who already earn a very comfortable annual income”. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is I would rather concentrate on the majority 
of seasonal workers, like I see in New Brunswick, who are living 
on less than $10,000 a year.  The member would rather look at the 
small percentage of some seasonal workers somewhere in Canada.  I 
do not know where she is finding them but she is saying there are 
some.  I know that in <I>Hansard</I> she specified a comfortable 
annual income in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>She would rather concentrate on that small percentage— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Regional prejudice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B>  That is regional prejudice.  She is 
dividing them.  She should be concentrating on the majority of 
seasonal workers who are in trouble today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  The time provided

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia—Matane, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I hope you 
will show some tolerance because I have a brief comment to make 
and a brief question to ask. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My comment is that the government opposite is heartless. I said 
before that the Prime Minister was a son of darkness and I am 
still saying that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is my question. Does the hon. member think it is reasonable 
to require 910 hours for young people? Personally, I think it is 
inhuman and totally unrealistic. I would like my colleague to 
comment on that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his 
question. It is certainly impossible for our young people to 
work 910 hours. That is the problem. Our young people end up 
leaving our communities. Instead of coming back to contribute to 
the economy of our region after finishing their postsecondary 
education, they have to leave. It is a problem and I agree with 
the hon. member on that.

indicate that I will be dividing my time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-44, commonly known as the Liberal vote enhancement bill, 
has been touted as an initiative to make life easier for low 
income workers or needy EI recipients.  However its promise, like 
most Liberal promises, is fraudulent.  On the eve of an election, 
the government, with a lot of huffing and puffing, proposes to 
tinker with a system which desperately needs a complete overhaul. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few decades ago we had a UI system that worked.  It was based 
on true insurance principles.  Over the years its original 
function as an employer-employee funded program to provide 
temporary income in the event of unexpected job loss has been 
perverted, complicated and made grossly unfair by mostly Liberal 
governments.  The result is a mishmash of ill-conceived social 
programs, excessively high premiums and a massive surplus which 
is largely inaccessible to those most in need of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It long ago ceased to be an insurance program by any definition. 
Instead, it has become a political cash cow for the government. 
The government is now collecting about $10 billion per year more 
in premiums than it pays out in benefits.  The piddling changes 
proposed in the bill will decrease that overcharge by about 12% 
but most of the rip-off will continue.   I would dare say that if 
a legitimate insurance company tried to operate in that fashion 
charges would be laid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The surplus is not even protected in a separate fund for high 
unemployment emergencies.  Excess collections are bled into 
general revenue and may be used to pay for any goofy scheme that 
the government comes up with.

</I></B></P><P align=left>To refer to the money collected as insurance premiums is, as I 
said, fraudulent.  It is a payroll tax, nothing more, nothing 
less.  Think how much more economically beneficial it would be if 
the government desisted from ripping off workers and employers 
and left that $10 billion a year in their pockets.  Employers 
would be able to have money to hire more people on their actual 
payroll—job creation—and workers would have more money to spend 
on goods and services, thus creating even more jobs.  It would be 
a win-win situation even for the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no consistency in the system, nor will there be with 
the proposed changes.  On one hand, even well paid seasonal 
workers, fallers, heavy equipment operators and people like that 
will be able to draw EI benefits with the clawback threshold now 
raised to $48,750. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few yappers on both sides of the House have attacked the 
member for Calgary—Nose Hill for describing some part time 
workers as earning a comfortable living.  I would say that 
anybody earning $48,000 a year is earning a comfortable living, 
and there are millions of Canadian workers, most of them employed 
full time, who would dearly love to have incomes of more than 
$48,750. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the other hand, we MPs regularly receive complaints from low 
income people who have been denied benefits, in spite of having 
contributed to the system for many years but who are unable to 
surmount the obstacles placed in front of them by an inflexible 
and obdurate bureaucracy.  To qualify for EI people need more 
hours of work if they  have never made a claim than if they have 
been in and out of the workforce like a fiddler's elbow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have documented cases of workers who worked 500 to 600 hours 
in the previous year, who had premiums extorted from them under 
false pretences for many, many years and who found themselves 
ineligible for benefits or training because they had never 
previously touched the system.  They needed a minimum of 910 
hours before they could take their first bite of pogey.  They are 
penalized for their own self-sufficiency.  That is perverse and 
it is cruel. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a sane system operating under the same principles as other 
types of insurance, individuals with clean claims records would 
be given favourable treatment, but under Liberal EI they are 
penalized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Letters which I received from successive HRD ministers regarding 
this anomaly have been mostly regurgitations of EI regulations 
which I and my staff are quite capable of extracting from 
departmental bumph.  We get the stock bureaucratic slop such as, 
“please be assured that I will continue to closely monitor the 
situation” or “multiple job holders and part time workers have 
all of their hours of work insured”.  Like hell they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I informed the previous minister of a worker who after 20 
years in the labour force was unable to access an upgrading 
program, his reply said in part: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale behind this entry requirement for new entrants and 
re-entrants was to discourage a cycle of reliance on Employment 
Insurance by ensuring that workers, especially young people, 
establish a significant attachment to the labour force before 
collecting Employment Insurance benefits.  The intent was also to 
strengthen the relationship between work effort and entitlement 
to benefits by requesting claimants to have a reasonable labour 
force attachment before collecting benefits. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That was his rationale for denying benefits to a middle-aged man 
who had worked and paid his premiums for 20 years.  What an 
insult, not only to my constituent, but to me.

They have certainly never had to worry about accessing UI.  It is 
the elite rule and we are paying a price for that. Canadian 
workers pay a price for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another constituent was laid off after working full time for 10 
years.  She innocently accepted part time work for more than a 
year rather than apply for EI.  When she lost the part time job 
as well, her efforts to remain independent had cost her any 
chance of benefits because of the 910 hour rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This mess that has been created in EI, largely through the 
efforts of the people sitting on the other side of the aisle, has 
to be addressed as a whole, not with this little bit of piecemeal 
“tinker here, fix there and fiddle there”.  This will not repair 
the system.

eloquent and pointed comments on this bill.  For many years we 
have been trying to reform the EI system which has been a cash 
cow system for the government and in effect a tax on the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My hon. colleague has fought for many years to improve the 
situation for many of his people, particularly those who are most 
impoverished.  What does he suggest be done to make the EI system 
more effective to enable those people who cannot help themselves 
to get back into the workforce for a longer period of time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are two things. 
First, bring the premiums into line with the need so that they 
are not building up this huge surplus which as I said, if it was 
out there in the general economy would help to create jobs in 
some small way and therefore decrease the need for EI. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, do away with the convoluted rules which now exist and 
which are becoming more convoluted by the day, certainly with the 
new amendments to the act.  We need to simplify regulations so 
that people who have religiously paid into the system for years 
will be eligible to tap into the funds if they do have sudden and 
expected unemployment.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about people who work in the forestry, tourism, 
agricultural and fishing industries. The members opposite seem to 
believe that many of these workers are already earning a lot of 
money and would get even richer with the elimination of the 
intensity rule and the changes to the clawback provisions. But 
this is not the case. Seasonal workers, at least most of them in 
my region, often earn $20,000, $25,000 or $30,000 a year when 
they have the opportunity to work for several months in a row. 
Quite often, they have to make do with the minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be possible for the member to urge the other 
members of his party to reconsider their position on this issue? 
We are not asking them to approve the government; that is 
something we have not done ourselves. We believe that the current 
bill does not go nearly far enough to reinstate a fair EI 
program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it not be possible for members of the Canadian Alliance to 
reconsider their position in order to treat these workers more 
fairly? A good way for them to do so would be to go into the 
field and see how these people really live so that we can put a 
stop to all the misconceptions that the government has been 
circulating for so many years. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was a seasonal worker in 
mineral exploration for many years so I do know a little about 
the subject.  It was by choice.  I could have taken a nine to 
five job year round, but I made good money like a lot of seasonal 
workers do. I simply did not have to work the full year.  Not 
every seasonal worker earns minimum wage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member had been listening to my reply to the member 
for Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, he would have heard me say that one 
of the solutions which we as a party would propose for the 
problems with EI would be to do away with all the convoluted 
rules which have developed over the years for tapping into it. He 
was not listening. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to Bill 
C-44.  I hope to dispel some of the myths around the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a long time the EI system has been in disarray.  Rather than 
helping or improving the situation of those who are unemployed, 
it has actually retarded their ability to get a job.  That might 
seem on first blush to be counterintuitive but we will go through 
it and describe how the government's support of the current EI 
system has prevented Canadians from gaining long term employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had an enormous opportunity with Bill C-44 to 
truly reform the EI system to help those who cannot find a job 
and to help with income support during periods when people are 
unemployed through no fault of their own. Unfortunately it is 
actually damaging their ability to gain long term employment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill increases the minimum amount which a person can earn 
before receiving a clawback of the EI money from $39,000 to over 
$48,000. Prior to earning $48,000 a person can receive EI 
payments and there would be no clawback whatsoever.  A clawback 
would be a maximum of 30% of moneys over that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would someone making $60,000 or $70,000 a year be receiving 
EI payments from the government? There are enough poor people in 
Canada today.  In fact over four million people in Canada are 
labelled as having some degree of poverty. Why is it that with 
the limited amount of money we have, people who make a fairly 
high amount of money have access to EI? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would like to make EI a true insurance.  The limited amount 
of moneys should actually go not only to help people who are 
unemployed through no fault of their own but also to give them 
the skills and training they need to be employed for a long 
period of time.  That is what should be done rather than catering 
to the lowest common denominator of people who go through the 
cycle of working a minimum number of hours and then receiving EI 
payments.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a form of institutionalized welfare that we are pandering 
to with the current system. We should not allow that to happen. 
It is not fair for the employers who pay into the EI fund.  It is 
not fair for the unemployed people who need the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Interestingly enough the high level of premiums that the 
government supports and which employers have to pay is retarding 
the individual's ability to work.  The artificially high premiums 
which provide over $10 billion a year for the government purse 
are actually a tax.  It is money that has been taken away from 
the private sector and put into the government's hands to 
redistribute as it sees fit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect those moneys are pulled away. That money is taken out 
of the private sector from employers who could have used it for 
skills training, to enhance their business, to become more 
competitive and to have lower taxes so that they could expand their 
business and hire more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The high EI premiums are a tax on the private sector. They have 
impeded the ability of the private sector to employ people, which 
has caused an artificially high level of unemployment and 
unfortunately has contributed to our lack of competitiveness. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Cypress Hills—Grasslands mentioned, we 
have asked to put the EI system on true insurance principles. Let 
us bring down substantially the payments the private sector makes 
so that companies have more money in their pockets to hire 
people.  People would not be taken off the rolls serially. People 
would not be working as seasonal workers and would not work only 
910 hours a year or 470 hours a year depending on who they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not have to cater to the lowest common denominator.  We 
provided an excellent solution. By reducing the amount of money 
companies would say thank you because they could hire a number of 
people, put them back to work and those people would not be on 
the EI rolls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not rocket science but it needs to be done.  It is common 
sense.  It should have been done a long time ago because, yes, it 
is hurting employers, but it is also hurting the employees that 
we profess to wish to help. The government should listen to what 
we are saying on this side.  It would go a long way to improving 
the EI system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at this issue in the larger context, it goes back to the 
mid-1960s and the government's war on poverty.  The idea was to 
engage in a process of handouts and a process of what it called 
economic redistribution.  Is that really the best way to go about 
it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We on this side strongly support efforts to help those who 
cannot help themselves. We certainly want to give people a 
handout while they are in need.  What most people want is a hand 
up, not a handout.  Most people on the welfare and EI rolls want 
to go back to work.  Why not invest some of that money in skills 
training?  Why not give people the skills so they are not 
seasonal workers for chunks of their lives?  I am sure they would 
want to work most of the year, not part of it.  By doing that we 
would have a vigorous and competitive economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the bill is indicative of the over-arching Liberal 
philosophy that has poisoned the economy of our country for 
decades.  It is an example of a move toward mediocrity.  It is a 
move toward catering to a lower common denominator.  It does not 
empower the individual.  It empowers the government to take money 
from companies to redistribute as it sees fit.  Why?  A cynic may 
think that it was to buy votes.  Historically that is what has 
happened.  The government is taking money out of the pockets of 
individuals and doling it out in other parts of the country.

gone into the maritimes at the rate of 10 times what they were 
one year ago.  People in the maritimes see through this.  They 
are saying “Do not take us for fools.  We know what you are 
doing.  You are trying to buy us off”.  The people in the 
maritimes do not want this.  They want the maritimes to be a 
competitive, vigorous centre, an economic tiger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are looking at models such as Ireland.  They wish the 
government would show the leadership that the Irish government 
has demonstrated to its people.  Ireland was an economic 
backwater for many years and the people of that country finally 
said they would not take it any more.  What did the Irish 
government do?  It lowered taxes.  It relaxed its labour laws. It 
invested in education.  It removed the egregious rules and 
regulations that were choking the private sector.  Ireland is now 
receiving 50% of all investment that goes into the European 
Union. It is an economic tiger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in the maritimes like that vision.  They are looking at 
leadership from the Canadian Alliance to see how they can do it. 
They know they are not getting leadership from the government. 
The government doles out money, but the people in the maritimes 
do not want handouts.  They want an environment in which they can 
thrive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proof is in the pudding. The Canadian Federation of

approve of the bill.  They are against it.  The Canadian Labour 
Congress is against the bill because it crushes people's ability 
to work.

who cannot take care of themselves and who are unemployed through 
no fault of their own. It is that balance that we are 
championing. It is that balance that the government would be wise 
to listen to.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank my hon. colleague 
for the question, but I think the larger question at hand here is 
why we would want to cater to enforcing seasonal work.  Why do we 
not look to full employment with people working all year long? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seasonal workers do not want to work part of the year.  The 
people in my neck of the woods do not want to work part of the 
year.  They want to work all year long.  They want to make a lot 
more money.  They do not want to be on employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has taken money away from the private sector and 
it is inhibiting the private sector's ability to employ people 
all year long.  That is what is going on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should take out the regional differences, which is what we 
have been saying for a long time.  For political reasons this 
bill and its predecessor, the rules governing EI, have allowed 
the government to gerrymander situations and to ensure that there 
are regional differences.  Why should there be regional 
differences?  People should be treated equally across the 
country.  An unemployed person on the west coast, an unemployed 
person in Quebec and an unemployed person in the maritimes are 
unemployed people and they should be treated equally.

be concerned, that it was not about lowering tax levels alone. It 
was about investing in people, about investing in post-secondary 
education, about the very programs that the hon. member and his 
party condemn every day in the House.  If he had studied the full 
aspect of what in fact was the success in Ireland I wonder what 
he would say to his colleagues who get up and condemn the 
minister of HRDC for her initiatives to ensure that people do get 
a chance to get a hand up and a chance to get full employment. 
The reality is that he is comparing a very tiny country with a 
country that has great regional differences. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is misrepresenting the fact that my province of Ontario and 
my workers who work in the construction industry have asked for 
this change.  It is this caucus that has asked for changes to the 
current EI system.

not speaking disparagingly about the NDP, the Bloc or the

situation they did reduce taxes.  They did make investments. They 
did relax labour laws.  They did remove the rules and regulations 
that choked the private sector. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They did not make an investment in handouts to the private 
sector.  The large numbers of international companies that have 
gone into Ireland, high tech companies such as IBM, Xerox and 
many others, have gone there to set up shop because the tax 
structure, the labour laws and the educational standards are 
excellent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asking for a long time that we look at those 
pillars of an economy that make it strong, like the lower taxes, 
the removal of egregious rules and regulations and the strong 
educational system, and ensure that the country has them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Handouts from HRDC that go to friends of the government in power 
are not what they do in Ireland.  That would crush the private

rules of the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I am concerned, Bill C-44 on employment insurance makes 
very minor adjustments and can be considered an electoral 
goody. The Liberal government had no choice but to amend the 
Employment Insurance Act.

of the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a bill without substance and clearly inadequate for the 
large numbers of workers without jobs. It is a cosmetic bill, 
which will cost the government a mere $500 million when all is 
said and done. That is not much, compared to the $32 billion 
accumulated in the government's coffers. We know that this year 
alone $7 billion went directly to paying down the debt.

the right direction, but it is too little. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The maximum insurable earning threshold will be raised from 
$39,000 to $48,000 for the purpose of the clawback on EI 
benefits. The government is giving a little break to those who 
earn up to $48,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a new parent who leaves the work force, it will be possible 
to go back four years, instead of one year, to calculate the 
number of eligible hours for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I repeat that this is a step in the right direction, but Bill 
C-44 does not respond to many inequities facing several workers. 
First, young people will still have to work 910 hours to qualify. 
We know very well that it is difficult for a young person to 
accumulate 910 hours. The work force no longer provides stable 
jobs. Instead, it provides insecure and part time jobs. 
Consequently, it is too much to require 910 hours for a young 
person to qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole issue of independent workers has not been dealt with. 
We know that, in Quebec, they represent 16% of the population. In 
this bill, the issue of independent workers is not being dealt 
with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois had made several proposals for refunding 
premiums for people who earn up to $5,000. We know that, today, a 
person who earns $2,000 pays premiums, but that above that 
amount, premiums are never refunded. We would have liked that cap 
set at $5,000. Students work in the summer, pay employment 
insurance premiums and do not get a refund of premiums paid on 
income over $2,000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are special benefits that include maternal benefits. 
Again, there will be some irritants for pregnant women. They will 
have to work 600 hours, contrary to workers in some regions who 
will receive benefits after working for 420 hours. This is a 
double standard. If we want to encourage women to have children, 
they will not find adequate measures to deal with their 
situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are well aware that the government's proposal to double the 
maternity leave is clearly inadequate. We know that many women 
do not use the maternity leave—I think the ratio is about 
52%—because they cannot afford to stay home for any length of 
time with benefits that represent only 55% of their salary. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very often, women who do stay home with their children do not use 
the whole maternity leave. It does not make sense to give a one 
year maternity leave to women who cannot afford it, who cannot 
afford to stay away from work for a year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government did not seriously address the Employment 
Insurance Act and all its ramifications. It did not address the 
status of seasonal workers either. 
In Baie-Comeau, Trois-Pistoles or Rouyn-Noranda, there are 
inequities in the treatment of seasonal workers. The government 
has not dealt with their problem. Discrimination will continue. 
The proposed measures are meagre compared to the huge surplus 
piling up in the EI fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is quite pleased with the accumulated 
surplus. As he said so clearly in the House “Let me enjoy this, 
if it is the only problem I have”. He thinks this is a minor 
problem. When workers are excluded from the EI benefits, or have 
their meagre benefits reduced under the intensity rule, the 
Prime Minister is not, as we know, the one who is faced with the 
problem of being jobless.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the government has not really dealt with reduced benefits 
for seasonal workers. This category of workers is only entitled 
to reduced benefits. For instance, the government refused to 
increase the benefits to 60% of the wages of the workers to take 
the increase in the cost of living into account. It could have 
indexed EI benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The EI program has been and continues to be totally out of touch 
with reality, even if the government wants us to believe that the 
program is in sync with the labour market. It is not; it is 
totally out of whack. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The figures speak for themselves. When the reform was 
implemented in 1997, there was a decrease of 16.4% in the number 
of EI claimants, compared to a 4% drop in the unemployment rate. 
It was the same for several years. But those figures only apply 
for 1997. Between 1993 and 1999, the number of regular claimants 
decreased by 52.4% and the unemployment rate was at 28%. As 
members can see, the number of claimants dropped twice as much as 
the number of the unemployed. In percentage, the number of 
unemployed workers is decreasing more slowly than the number of 
claimants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we believe that this reform is far from suited to 
the realities of the labour market. 
We can say it is a small victory, a half-victory for the Bloc 
Quebecois, as the numerous demands made by my party for a 
comprehensive reform of the new employment insurance legislation 
have led to three small measures taken by the government in Bill 
C-44. This will bring some comfort to certain workers who have 
lost their jobs. However, a lot of people have been forgotten, 
including women, young people and seasonal workers. The 
government should have made other changes to allow more people to 
qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The premium rate was reduced; it is all fine and well to lower 
it to $2.25, but if the majority of unemployed people are not 
covered, I think we are missing what the main purpose of such 
legislation should be, that is, helping those who find themselves 
without a job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I would like to repeat a word used by the person who 
was responsible for this issue before, who said he was “shocked” 
when I was putting questions to him and telling him that this 
reform would be devastating for thousands and thousands of 
unemployed people. We certainly cannot give the government high 
marks for these three very small measures.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, first of all, I 
am going to respond briefly to the comments of the Bloc 
Quebecois member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find the tone of her comments very surprising.  She is a 
little condescending, I must say with her remarks about these 
three very small measures.  To say these three very small measures 
is misleading to start with; there are more than three measures, 
regardless of their size.  It should also be pointed out that 
the Bloc Quebecois does not seem to be united in its response to 
Bill C-44, since the Bloc Quebecois member who just spoke has 
described, in detail, all the aspects she thought were 
particularly negative.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>But on September 18 in Chicoutimi, her boss, the Bloc Quebecois 
house leader, said—and unfortunately I do not have the text 
before me, so I will have to rely on my memory—that he welcomed 
this bill, because it would create jobs for seasonal workers and 
women.  So I would ask the hon. member across the way to start 
singing from the same song sheet as the other members of her 
party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for women and young people, let us not forget that women in 
particular will be affected by this new legislation, because in 
most cases they are the ones who stay at home. 
They are the ones who will be able to continue to receive 80% of 
their salary from the time they stay home with their children. 
So I do not think that there is really anything to criticize 
about this bill as far as women are concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for young people, let us remember the context in which the 
bill was drafted.  It is part of a large number of measures 
being proposed by the Department of Human Resources Development, 
that is, that— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold: </B>Is there a question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco:</B> It is a comment, and I think I am allowed a 
comment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  I apologize.  I 
remembered the name of the member, but I was struggling for the 
circonscription. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
commenting on my remarks.  We will see how these measures are 
applied.  The people will pass judgment on the reform of 
employment insurance as compared to the old unemployment 
insurance legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen how frustrated people are and we will see that 
sectors have been forgotten in this reform.  The government 
should have made an in-depth reform, for example, with an 
examination of the real problem of seasonal work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can say that time has proven us right.  We forced the 
government to make changes and we were the mobilizing force with 
respect to the impact of the measures contained in the Employment 
Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not saying that we are not happy with the measures 
proposed, but I think they do not go far enough with regard to 
the scope of the problem of lost jobs and the people who will 
continue to be denied employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mention should be made—and the member opposite did not refer to 
this—of the size of the surplus the government took from the 
employment insurance fund.  The contributors to it are the 
workers and the employers and not the government.  All of this 
money that went to reduce the deficit disappeared into the 
government's consolidated fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will accumulate more surplus, perhaps to a lesser 
degree, but it could perhaps have been a lot more generous to 
those who are without a job and receiving a mere 50% or 55% of 
their salary and who have to work a certain number of hours 
before they are entitled to benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will be following this matter closely, and, despite the 
member's enthusiasm, I am sure that the public will support us 
once more.  The Bloc Quebecois has been here since 1993, and we 
have done studies on the impact of the Employment Insurance Act, 
and the people sided with us. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin (Charlevoix, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to rise today to speak to Bill C-44, not so much on account of 
its content, but to speak up for seasonal workers in the 
Charlevoix riding, as well as those in the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, 
lower St. Lawrence and north shore regions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill before us today is mere window dressing. On the eve of 
an election, the government introduced a bill it wants to push 
through the House in an attempt to save a few seats and deal 
with problems in the regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the employment insurance reform in 1996, the minister has 
been mandated by the government, the Prime Minister and the 
Minister of Finance to squeeze $5 billion a year out of the EI 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How does the Department of Human Resources Development manage to 
collect a yearly surplus of $5 billion? It is a hidden tax on 
employment, collected mainly on the backs of seasonal workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current minister and her predecessors have always acquiesced 
to the request, producing $5 billion a year to be put toward 
reducing the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last week the Bloc Quebecois asked the Prime Minister whether 
the bill the minister was going to introduce in the House would 
provide more money for workers and remove the criteria which 
have penalized seasonal workers year after year? The Prime 
Minister's answer went somewhat like this: the government has 
wiped out the deficit and there is a $31.2 billion surplus in the EI 
fund. The government intends to remove the rules that had been 
introduced to reduce benefits by 1% every year for five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1996, the Bloc Quebecois has been decrying the EI reform 
in the House. Thousands upon thousands of petitions have been 
tabled. 
Thousands and thousands of them, mayors, aboriginal communities, 
regional municipalities—in short, all manner of socio-economic 
stakeholders—have expressed their disagreement so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This summer, a problem was experienced in Charlevoix and the 
north shore, the result of zone redistribution.  The reform 
includes a draft regulation permitting the minister to readjust 
his or her employment insurance zones every five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a problem in the Gaspé.  There was much sympathy for 
the Gaspé because of the plant and mine closures.  There was 
also a problem with the seasonal workers in the Gaspé and the 
Magdalen Islands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At that time, the minister was really attentive to the people of 
the Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands. 
She decided to create a special zone to include the Gaspé, of 
course, the Magdalen Islands and the riding of Matapédia—Matane, 
the riding of my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister said that she had consulted with MPs on this 
infamous geographical redistribution, the member for côte nord 
and the member for Charlevoix were never consulted.  At the last 
minute, the minister noticed that the zone was far too small, so 
she decided to add the lower north shore to it.  This had a 
devastating effect on the unemployment rate in Charlevoix and on 
the north shore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having created this zone, she ought to have created a pilot 
project for the Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands. 
This way, once the economic situation improved and employability 
gradually got better, the pilot project would have ended. But 
no, that is not what she did. She gave something to the workers 
in the Gaspé, at the expense of those in the north shore and 
Charlevoix regions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because she needed an additional $5 million, $6 million or 
$10 million to pay for the 420 worked hours for 32 weeks of 
benefits, the minister offloaded the problem squarely onto the 
other side of the river. As a result, the Charlevoix region is 
now in the same situation as the Gaspé and the Magdalen Islands, 
the lower north shore having been removed from our zone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Charlevoix, the north Shore, the Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, the Lower 
St. Lawrence and the Montmagny—L'Islet regions ended up in a single 
zone.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are asking and what the petitioners are asking is for 
the government to leave us in the zone in which we were, in 
northern Quebec, or at least to include us under the new 
rezoning in Quebec's northwest region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this commotion since July 9 has resulted in people 
mobilizing and organizing protests, and coalitions have sprung 
up. We have consulted with the municipalities and people have 
made representations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Following that, the minister came to propose transitional 
measures. Under these transitional measures, after July 9, the 
new requirements would be 525 hours of work for 21 weeks of 
benefits. This is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to the people 
of Charlevoix. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between July 9 and September 17, the people who have worked 525 
hours will be entitled to 21 weeks of benefits during the 
winter. Then the revenue minister came to Charlevoix to tell us 
that the minister had come up with transitional measures to help 
seasonal workers, and these measures were to come into effect on 
September 17. They had come up with a transitional measure, Mr. 
Speaker, and I am sure that you would agree with me and that the 
revenue minister could stand up and confirm what I have just 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With all the pressure we exerted, the protests, the 
demonstrations, the coalitions and the meetings with the 
minister, we were able to sway the government. A Liberal member 
would not have been so lucky, because the minister would have 
told him “Be quiet, do not embarrass me, do not bother me with 
your problems”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem was solved thanks to the insight of the people of 
Charlevoix and the north shore. If you ever come to the north 
shore, you will see that as friendly as the people are over 
there, they are also real fighters. In 2000 and 2001, workers 
will need 420 working hours to get 32 weeks of benefits. In 
2001, the minister comes back with 420 working hours for 28 
weeks of benefits. In 2002-03, it will be 450 working hours 
for 24 weeks of benefits, and in 2003-04, 525 working hours for 
21 weeks of benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister told us we will have to get used to it. Used to 
what? To living on welfare? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> To tightening our belts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Is it, as the hon. member for Jonquière put 
it, to get used to tightening our belts and getting poorer and 
poorer? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People who work 15 weeks a year cannot contribute to RRSPs at 
the end of the year to save on income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister said people would have to get used to working for 
longer periods. I checked. In the tourism industry, is it 
possible to make the seasons last longer? 
I went to the massif near Petite-Rivière-Saint-François. Is it 
possible to ski between June 24 and September 15? Apparently not. 
It would appear that the skiing season ends on April 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I checked to see if it was possible to extend the fishing season. It would 
appear that it is impossible, at 30 degrees below zero, to go out 
for lobster, crab or groundfish on the St. Lawrence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also looked at the forestry industry. Is it possible to cut 
timber in the winter in four feet of snow? It would appear that 
it is impossible to travel in the forest with machines. If 
workers use snowshoes to get there and cut down the trees in four 
feet of snow, in the spring the stumps will be four feet high. 
It does not make sense. There would be too much waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also looked at peat bogs. Would it be possible to install a 
dome over peat bogs to warm up the atmosphere to make the season 
last longer for these workers? Again, that does not appear to be 
logical. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All that to say that the Bloc Quebecois will vote in favour of 
this bill because, even though it is cosmetic and has a definite 
pre-election flavour to it, it is a step in the right direction.

for in the House of Commons since the 1996 reform, and we hope 
the government, after the election, will continue to listen to us 
and grant special status to seasonal workers in Charlevoix, 
north shore, lower St. Lawrence and Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. 
<P><A NAME="LINK235"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have a few comments and a question for the hon. member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the idea for this reform came up last June, there was a 
so-called consultation.  I referred to HRDC officials in my 
riding, who suggested to the minister that she maintain the 
status quo, since the economic indicators showed that was 
the best course. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time this reform just mentioned by the hon. member was 
introduced in my riding, the minimum number of hours had jumped 
from 420 to 490, which is absolutely shocking.  Our first 
questions were these. What will be the impact?  What percentage of 
workers will be affected?  What will be the shortfall 
economically?  It seems to me that these were perfectly 
reasonable figures to want to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I therefore invited the HRDC economist to come and share his 
figures with us.  To my great surprise, it was the chief actuary 
who came all the way from Ottawa to meet with groups in my 
riding interested in the issue.  He ended up telling us he did 
not have these figures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that the government has produced a reform without 
knowing the economic impact on families, without knowing how 
many people were going to be without benefits in the month of 
February?  I am speaking today on behalf of these families. 
This is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is more, this complete sham of a bill has the potential to 
restore balance and a certain justice, but instead of that, what 
we have is window dressing.  I admit that the bill is headed in 
the right direction, such as with the idea of eliminating the 
intensity rule. 
As for the rest, however, it is wrong to think that this is 
progress.  What it is, is electioneering, which is completely 
unacceptable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member think it right that 
the chief actuary—who is supposed to know the figures, who is 
preparing a reform, does not know the figures, the impact, the 
percentage of workers who will be affected and the economic 
shortfall for the region? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gérard Asselin:</B> Mr. Speaker, in response to my colleague 
from Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, a big meeting was held at 
Baie-Comeau, and all the senior people from Human Resources 
Development Canada were brought in.  The departmental official 
who made the recommendation to the minister never took the human 
aspect into consideration.  He had allocated so many millions to 
compensate the Gaspé that he had to get them back from the north 
shore and in Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The departmental official told us that in Sept-Îles, 
Baie-Comeau, Mont-Joli, Rimouski or Rivière-du-Loup, there is a 
very low rate of unemployment.  The problem, as in 
Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean, is not in the major centres.  Between 
Baie-Comeau and Quebec City, there is the upper north shore and 
Charlevoix, where there is a lot of seasonal employment. I would 
say that 70% of people employed in tourism cannot qualify for 
employment insurance, along with people new to the work force, 
and many seasonal workers just barely qualify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An extremely negative reaction was forthcoming from the Human 
Resources Development Canada offices in Sept-Îles, Quebec City 
and Saguenay—Lac-Saint-Jean.  The three or four directors of 
these centres, including the one in the lower St. Lawrence, 
expressed total disagreement with this regulation, recommending 
the status quo instead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem, as I have said, is that instead of having a pilot 
project to temporarily solve the problems in the Gaspé, the 
departmental officials turned everything upside down in their 
reform.  From a desk here in Ottawa, it is hard to see what is 
going on in the regions.  A person has to be an MP to know what 
is going on there.

sharing my time with the hon. member for Bras d'Or—Cape Breton. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak to Bill C-44, 
an act to amend the Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill does a number of things.  It extends the period for the 
application of certain provisions of the Employment Insurance 
Act.  It changes the method of calculating the maximum yearly 
insurable earnings.  It exempts persons who receive certain 
special benefits from being considered as new entrants or 
re-entrants to the labour force.  It removes the reduction of the 
rate of weekly benefits.  It changes the premium rate applicable 
to insurable earnings.  It reduces the number of cases in which 
benefits have to be repaid and it makes various other 
consequential amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I rise to indicate that the NDP supports the bill, the 
word support almost gets caught in my throat, because we do have 
some grave reservations around the legislation and what it 
attempts to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it does take a step toward addressing the critical 
conditions of Canadian workers, especially those who are working 
in seasonal industries such as forestry, fishing, tourism, 
transportation, the auto industry, construction and various other 
trades, it does not go far enough, and I emphasize this, for the 
many workers who need help but cannot get any because some 
provisions of the Employment Insurance Act make them ineligible 
for EI benefits.  While it is a step in the right direction, we 
feel a lot more has to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes that are spelled out in the bill are changes that 
are important for people living in the Atlantic provinces.  I 
should state right at the outset that people in the Atlantic 
provinces are not lazy, as the Canadian Alliance would like the 
public to believe.  We are not lazy.  We are not unwilling to go 
where the jobs are.  We are not indifferent to the opportunities 
available to us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Atlantic provinces we are very industrious.  People in 
the Atlantic provinces are hardworking.  They are more than 
willing to go to where the jobs are if the opportunities do not 
exist in the Atlantic provinces.  Unfortunately over the years, 
because of the treatment of the Atlantic provinces by the 
Conservative and Liberal regimes, we have not had the 
opportunities to succeed on our home turf in the same manner that 
others have had. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am pleased to say that I have travelled to many parts 
of Canada.  Everywhere I go I always run into Nova Scotians, 
Newfoundlanders and New Brunswickers, people who have gone to 
where the jobs are because they are determined to care for and 
look after their families, so much so that they will pull up 
roots from the Atlantic provinces and move elsewhere to provide a 
living for their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will dispel the myth being put out there by the Alliance.  It 
indicates that people in Atlantic Canada are looking to the 
Alliance for guidance and support.  That is far from the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To turn to the government, the reason we have concerns about the 
bill is that we feel the government has not had the desire to 
make any real substantive changes.  It is quite interesting to 
note that the changes being made are coming on the eve of an 
election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has not learned yet that people in Atlantic 
Canada are not naive enough to accept handouts at the time of an 
election.  While it is important to make changes, and these 
changes are important, let us not delude ourselves as to the 
timing.  The government has had seven years during which it could 
have paid some very serious attention to unemployment in the 
Atlantic provinces and to making the situation much better for 
people who are unemployed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there are changes in the legislation that will have a 
positive effect on the lives of those who are unemployed, we 
still feel that major changes are required if one is to deal 
adequately with the problem of unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important when we are talking about unemployment not to 
treat unemployment after the fact, not to be coming in when there 
is a problem and saying that we will fix this and patch it up by 
doing this, this and this.  There is an important connection 
between unemployment and the attitude that we in society take to 
preventing unemployment.  We should adopt a preventive approach. 
There is a connection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard we should be looking at the kinds of training we 
are providing and the kinds of jobs we are putting forward for 
our youth.  It is very important to invest in the young people of 
our country in a meaningful way.  Yet look at what is happening 
to a lot of our young people.  They are attending university and 
struggling to obtain an education so that they can become 
productive members of society, and they find themselves faced 
with huge tuition fees.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Nova Scotia I believe we pay the highest tuition fees per 
capita in the country.  Yet we expect our young people to be able 
to eke out a living for themselves under those conditions. What 
happens is that they come out of university with high debt loads 
before they even have an opportunity to have a job.  In terms of 
student debt, they owe anywhere from $25,000 and up. That is one 
measure the government should be looking at very closely if it is 
concerned about this cycle of unemployment and this cycle of 
dependency that comes from unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also be investing in our women, in looking at the 
kinds of opportunities that should be made available to our 
women.  Regardless of what people may say about how far we have 
come in terms of gender equality, it is still pretty much a man's 
world out there when we look at business, industry and various 
professions.  I had the opportunity not too long ago to speak to 
the Canadian Society of Civil Engineering.  The first thing that 
struck me when I looked around the room was that there was a 
whole roomful of men with one or two women in that profession. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet we know that when it comes to designing infrastructure and 
looking at what is important for our society, women, who 
constitute at least 50% of our society, have a very important 
role to play.  Quite often they bring a much different 
perspective to what the needs are than men do.  We must have that 
balance in our approach. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government should be looking at the kinds of things that 
support women in the jobs they are doing, in the professions they 
are seeking.  We had a good example of how that was not done 
until the government was forced to the wall when we look at the 
pay equity issue and how hard we had to fight to have it dealt 
with by the government.  All of this ties in with the question of 
unemployment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can look at investing in our minority groups and in the 
aboriginal people of our country.  When we look at the conditions 
on reserves and in the aboriginal communities we see that the 
poverty rate is much higher than elsewhere, as are the death 
rate, the incidence of diabetes and all kinds of things.  Also 
the unemployment level is much higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yet when opportunities come up whereby aboriginal people are 
desirous of making a living for themselves, when they want to 
enter into sharing resources and make a living in a very 
productive way, we see the government taking a hard line rather 
than sitting down and starting negotiations before a crisis 
arises, a crisis where we can look out on the water and see small 
fishing boats being rammed by huge government boats.  These 
things are not right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not right.  This all ties in with the attitude that we 
have when we approach problems and start devising legislation. Is 
obtaining votes the only motive for devising change in 
legislation?  Do we devise change only at a time when we feel it 
will be popular to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suggest that we talk about the high degree of unemployment in 
our aboriginal communities and that we look at the lack of 
opportunity that quite often exists for people of minority 
status.  I look at people who have come here from other parts of 
the world and are driving taxis.  All they can do is drive taxis 
because we have some kind of magic formula which determines that 
only people born in Canada who have degrees in engineering can be 
engineers, or that only people born in Canada who have degrees in 
trades can perform those trades.  We have to change our attitudes 
if we want to make the country work, if we want to produce a 
society that is fair and just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude on that note.  We have to be serious about the 
underlying root causes of the problem and not just tinker around 
with the symptoms of the disease.  Let us deal with the disease 
itself, bring about a cure for that disease, and work hard to 
make the country the kind of country of which we all can be 
proud.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Yorkton-Melville, Gun Registry; the hon. member 
for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, Employment Insurance. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, like my 
New Democratic colleague, I have a hard time supporting Bill 
C-44. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my region, hundreds of thousands of workers have taken to the 
streets in recent weeks to oppose this bill, which does not go 
far enough as far as seasonal workers are concerned. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1645"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT82"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT82"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1645

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>They also oppose the fact that Bill C-44 offers nothing to older 
workers.  In the riding of Jonquière, in a few weeks, 250 older 
workers will lose their job.  They have been unable to put enough 
into the pension plan to enjoy an honourable retirement.  They 
hoped that the government would include passive measures in Bill 
C-44 to help older workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know whether my colleague in the New Democratic Party 
has this problem in his riding, but I think that everywhere in 
Canada at the moment, beyond what the government is saying about 
the employment insurance fund, it could have established passive 
measures enabling workers who have contributed for years, who 
have worked hard to earn decent salaries, to have a decent 
retirement so they could step aside to make room for younger 
people to take their place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear my colleague from the New Democratic Party 
speak on this problem, which the government is ignoring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the member for 
her question. She is right. It is a real problem because the 
government is not listening to the people. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is becoming more apparent, when we see the large number of 
demonstrations in our streets today, that governments are not 
listening to the people, and they should be.  It is disturbing to 
see women marching in order to put forward to the government 
their need to be treated fairly.  We have aboriginal people 
blockading roads and so forth to get the government to seriously 
consider their treaty rights.  We have older people taking 
measures to get their rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member is quite right.  This is a problem, not only in 
Quebec, but right across the country.  It is time we had a 
government that is sensitive to and responds and listens to 
the people so that we will have a society that is fair, 
appropriate and just. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to ask a 
supplementary question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is taking money out of the EI fund. This money 
belongs to the workers and the employers. Does my colleague not 
find it outrageous that the government is using money that 
belongs to the workers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister says that we must be compassionate and that 
this is the difference between his government and the Alliance. 
Does my colleague not think that the government is speaking out 
of both sides of its mouth? There is a hidden tax in the EI 
fund, which does nothing to help workers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only about 40% of all workers currently have access to EI. I 
would like to hear what the hon. member has to say about the 
government helping itself to the workers' money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gordon Earle:</B> Again, the hon. member is right, Mr. Speaker. 
Our employment insurance critic, the hon. member for 
Acadie—Bathurst, addressed this issue on many occasions. He even 
used unparliamentary language—“to steal”—but he was right. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has in fact taken money, which we know belongs to 
the unemployed workers and the employers who have paid into this 
fund, and used it to augment its budget and build a huge surplus. 
It is now tossing that money back in little dribs and drabs to 
the people of Atlantic Canada and telling them they should be 
grateful for getting a little back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again the member is quite right.  It comes down to attitude and 
sensitivity on the part of government.  It should be listening to 
the people.  It should do what is right and do it by the 
standards which Canadians pride themselves in, which demand 
respect for each other and our government.  In turn, the 
government should have respect for its citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to address Bill C-44, an act to amend the 
Employment Insurance Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is almost ironic that we are here tonight talking about the 
Liberals tinkering with the unemployment insurance, given that 
over the course of the last seven days, day after day, minute 
after minute, all of us have heard Canadians talking about our 
former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau and the legacy he 
left them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although at times not all Canadians agreed with the former prime 
minister, I think there is a sense across the country that he did 
believe in justice for all Canadians.  What he also taught 
Canadians was to reach for the unreachable, to touch the 
untouchable and to dream the impossible dream.  In order to do 
that he taught us to believe in ourselves and that it was the 
responsibility of the government to empower its citizens, and 
that it was also the responsibility of the federal government to play an 
active role in that empowerment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now I stand here in the Chamber and ask myself what kind of 
legacy the Liberal government will leave Canadians.  What 
kind of legacy is the Prime Minister going to leave children, 
like my 11 year old daughter and my two year old son?  Today in 
the discussions we had some sense of what that legacy is going to 
be.  It is going to be about long waiting lines for health care 
and people who cannot access critical surgeries they need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the unemployed, what legacy has the 
government left?  Being from Atlantic Canada I have to say 
it has been very clear that since 1993 the Liberal government has 
clearly made a frontal assault on not only seasonal workers but 
on Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As my colleague from Halifax West noted, we have to ask 
ourselves, why now?  Why at this point in time?  We know there 
are a number of members on the opposite side of the House who have 
urged the government to recognize the problems its changes to EI 
have made and to effect some change.  I guess the question is can 
we deny that in this bill there is no change?  No we cannot say 
that.  There has been some tinkering with the legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of HRDC stood time and time again in the House and 
told us that her department was monitoring the changes to the 
employment insurance.  Up until approximately two months ago she 
continued to tell us that Canadians thought it was working fine. 
We know that is not a reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my part of the country people are not seasonal workers 
because they want to be.  There is no such thing in the country 
as a seasonal worker.  It is the work that is seasonal.  People 
in my riding want nothing more than to work 365 days a year with 
holidays and vacations.  However, at the hands of the Liberal 
government they have had difficulty doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some people on the opposite side of the House talk about the 
dependency on the government in Atlantic Canada.  In my part of 
the country the dependency was created by the same Liberal 
government.  We had walls which cost Canadian taxpayers over a 
million dollars.  We heard about projects like Scotia Rainbow. 
Cape Breton Island is full of those kinds of projects.  Were 
those projects initiated to assist people in gaining employment? 
No, they were not.

<A HREF="#LINKT83"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for those projects and others was to make sure that 
the Liberal government could continue to funnel money to its 
friends and do it on the backs of poor individuals in Cape Breton 
who wanted nothing more than to get up every morning, go to work, 
come home and feel good about their ability to feed and clothe 
their kids. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about dependency, it has been created by the 
government.  In 1997 less than 20% of young people between the 
ages of 15 and 24 qualified for unemployment insurance.  We heard 
the government stand up time and time again to talk about how 
good it had been and how much it had done for youth.  Today that 
figure is only 15%.  That is the good job the government has 
done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thirty-two per cent of women who are unemployed receive 
employment insurance benefits.  I even have a problem referring 
to it as the government employment insurance.  As we know, it 
originated as a safety net, as unemployment insurance.  We paid 
into it in the event there was a possibility that some day we 
might have to take out of that.  However, when the name changed 
the government abandoned the unemployed of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why change it now?  Are we on the eve of an election?  Mr. 
Speaker, you might have more of an inside track than I do, but it 
sure sounds like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the finance minister's own words were that any economic 
recovery would bypass Cape Breton.  This is about buying votes. 
Everyone knows it.  Backbenchers on the government side know that 
is what it is about.  This is not about helping the unemployed. 
This is not about helping seasonal workers.  This is about taking 
money from an individual's cheque for a specific purpose and then 
using it for another purpose. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that is the definition of fraud, when we take something 
meant for something specific and use it for something entirely 
different.  We have a finance minister who sits in the House and 
who goes across the country and boasts about his $33 billion 
surplus. What does this legislation mean in terms of putting 
anything back?  It means 1.5% of that $33 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do Atlantic Canadians buy this?  No way.  Do Canadians buy this? 
No way.  We have a Liberal government that talks about values and 
talks about its commitment to social programs, but Canadians have 
suffered from the actions of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have no doubt that the government should never under estimate 
Atlantic Canadians.  Atlantic Canadians sent them a clear message 
in 1997 and said “No more.  You are not going to use us any 
more”.  Atlantic Canadians will say that again.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphan Tremblay (Lac-Saint-Jean—Saguenay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
question for my colleague. I have here an OECD document entitled 
“The OECD Jobs Strategy”. It makes several recommendations. Some 
of these recommendations are to make work schedules more 
flexible, and to review unemployment packages and related 
benefits. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1700"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report says further: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to bring more flexibility to the labour market in a 
number of countries, it was essential to make unemployment 
packages and other social benefits less generous, to tighten up 
eligibility rules. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The following quote can be found further in the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the only country which appears to have implemented the 
recommendations regarding the reduction of the level and length 
of benefits made as a result of the first set of studies. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does this mean that the government is implementing international 
strategies dictated by the OECD in the belief that if benefits 
are too generous, workers will become lazy and will no longer 
want to work? People do not want handouts; they want work. That 
is abundantly clear. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen the government make indiscriminate cuts without a 
care about their impact on families. I have people coming to my 
office who in February will experience the spring gap. They will 
not qualify for social assistance and their unemployment 
benefits will run out. What are they going to live on? Thin air? 
I believe the government is completely out of touch with the 
harsh economic realities in certain regions. It makes no sense 
whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the government to go further with this bill, it can do it. 
All summer long, we heard it say it could not do anything 
without introducing a bill. Here is that bill, but it does 
nothing. It is totally absurd. I am looking forward to my 
colleague's remarks on this. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not think there 
is a doubt in anybody's mind how much more difficult the 
government has made it for Canadians, whether it is people trying 
to access health care, whether it is people trying to access 
unemployment insurance or whether it is our youth who are trying 
to access a quality education, one they can afford. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight there will be 1.5 million Canadian children going to bed 
hungry.  The reality is very clear, especially to the people in 
my part of the country.  This is about an election, not about the 
unemployed.  What a legacy for this Prime Minister to leave 
Canada:  1.5 million Canadian children who will be going to bed 
hungry tonight.  Children are not poor.  They come from poor 
families.

gives me a great deal of pleasure to speak in the debate this 
evening.  Before I get into the substance of my speech, I want to 
say that I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada has a big seasonal economy.  We have a lot of 
seasonal workers in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador.  As 
we are all very well aware, the first set of changes brought in by 
the Liberal government a few years ago had the effect of making 
life totally and completely miserable for seasonal workers in 
Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be under no illusions.  The changes that the Liberals 
are bringing in today in Bill C-44 will not make life any better 
for seasonal workers in Atlantic Canada.  As a matter of fact, 
they will make very little change at all because most of the 
changes coming forth under Bill C-44 are really only cosmetic 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a a couple of changes to the clawback provision and 
the intensity rule. 
It also makes it a little bit easier on folks who are on 
maternity leave to get back into the system again.  We fully intend to 
support these kinds of changes but we have to make it perfectly 
clear what Bill C-44 does not do.  Bill C-44 will be looked at 
for what it does not do more than for what it does.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to stress that the new rules will not change, in any way, 
shape or form, the qualifying time for a seasonal worker.  It 
will not change the number of hours that a seasonal worker will 
need to qualify for employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new rules will not change the duration of time that an 
individual can draw employment insurance for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The new rules, believe it or not, will not do a single thing 
with respect to the devisor rule, which is a millstone around the 
neck of a seasonal worker because it lowers the benefits of 
seasonal workers by as much as $100 or $120 a week. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the last two and a half to three years we have been 
screaming for those kinds of changes and we have not been able to 
effect these changes.  However, the Liberals have brought in a 
couple of cosmetic changes that they feel will get them through 
an election campaign over the next couple of months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The net result of all the various cutbacks the government has 
made over the last three and a half year period to employment 
insurance has been that only 35% of people who get laid off 
actually qualify for benefits.  Because women happen to be in a 
different work pattern than men, maybe it is because of family—

<A NAME="LINK245">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-44, an 
act to amend the Employment Insurance Act, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as I was saying a moment 
ago, only 30% of the women who get laid off in this nation will 
qualify for benefits.  That is absolutely horrendous for seasonal 
workers in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know if all members of the House fully realize and 
respect what seasonal workers go through in Atlantic Canada.  We 
have a big seasonal economy in Atlantic Canada.  We have a lot of 
fishermen, loggers and construction workers, people who make a 
very valuable contribution to this country, and that contribution 
is not recognized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was appalled a few days ago when I heard the member for 
Calgary—Nose Hill make the statement that the government is 
changing the unemployment insurance rules when seasonal workers 
are already making a comfortable living. 
She is saying this to the member for Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, who 
a couple of days ago informed the House that 75% of the seasonal 
workers in New Brunswick make less than $10,000 a year.  I would 
imagine that these numbers also apply everywhere in the 
Atlantic region, Cape Breton, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, New 
Brunswick and Prince Edward Island: 75% of seasonal workers 
make less than $10,000 a year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I cannot understand how the member for Calgary—Nose Hill could 
say that fishermen make a comfortable living.  Sure we have some 
fishermen who make a comfortable living but, for the most part, 
most of them do not.  What about the loggers in— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
The hon. member knows that the member for Calgary—Nose Hill 
clarified what her remarks were.  He is deliberately 
misrepresenting— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  That is not a point 
of order.  That is debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we know what the reform 
alliance said about Atlantic Canadians and what its attitude is 
toward employment insurance.  It has been documented.  It has 
been in the press a great deal.  I know those members are very 
sensitive about that but they will have to live with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Calgary—Nose Hill feels that the fishermen, the 
loggers and the construction workers in Atlantic Canada are 
making a comfortable living and says that we should not be giving 
them employment insurance.  I was astounded to hear those kinds 
of remarks.  It shows the blatant ignorance that the Alliance 
Party has of Atlantic Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not see any changes in this bill with regard to easing the 
qualifying requirements for regular benefits or anything that 
increases the time that an individual can draw benefits. Seasonal 
workers often refer to that time as the black hole, the time when 
they run out of employment insurance benefits and the time when 
they will be starting their seasonal job.  They often find that 
employment insurance runs out about half-way through. They may 
have to go to welfare or to savings that they have accumulated 
over a number of years in order to get by until the seasonal job 
starts again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is terrible the way government has treated seasonal workers. 
It has not recognized the kind of valuable contribution that 
seasonal workers make to the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can we do without fishermen?  No.  Can we do without loggers? 
No.  Can we do without construction workers?  No.  We in this 
House have to recognize the kind of contribution that seasonal 
workers make not only to Atlantic Canada, but to Quebec, to 
northern Ontario and to Alberta.  Virtually all of Canada has, to 
some extent, seasonal employment in certain parts of various 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is no wonder the government has a $32 billion surplus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I went to a briefing a couple of days ago over at HRDC and I 
asked the question “How much money do you have in surplus in the 
EI account?”  They gave me the official numbers, “$32 
billion”.  I said “How much are you going to spend on these 
changes?”  They said “$500 million”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we find is that the federal government is giving back 1.5% 
to the seasonal workers of Canada, who depend so much on a decent 
employment insurance system to see them through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am terribly disappointed that the cabinet representative for 
Newfoundland has not spoken to the bill and has not spoken about 
employment insurance in the House over the last three and a half 
years that I have been here.  Virtually none of the Liberal 
members from Newfoundland have had anything to say about seasonal 
workers in Atlantic Canada or in Newfoundland and what changes 
should be made to the Employment Insurance Act to make it a 
little bit better for these people.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am terribly disappointed the Liberals have decided to abandon 
the seasonal workers in Newfoundland and the rest of Atlantic 
Canada. The growing reality is the pending federal election and 
it has finally gotten to the Liberals to make these few cosmetic 
changes. They could have easily made these changes three months 
ago, or three and a half years ago when they were elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These changes could have been made but now with the pending 
federal election they want to give the impression to the seasonal 
workers in Atlantic Canada that they are doing something 
substantive to help them.  They are doing absolutely nothing. The 
Liberal Party has not yet found its social conscience.  It did 
not rediscover its social conscience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few words to say on EI as it pertains to women in the 
workforce.  I said earlier that only 30% of unemployed Canadian 
women actually qualify for benefits these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spring budget the Liberals made much of the fact that EI 
maternity benefits would be extended from six months to a full 
year.  Given the fact that 30% of women qualified for benefits 
and given that it is harder to qualify for maternity benefits in 
this day and age, much more difficult than for regular benefits, 
only a political party with the gall of the Liberal Party would 
boast about the improvement it has made to the maternity 
benefits.  However, I cannot pursue this subject because my time 
has expired.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Jocelyne Girard-Bujold (Jonquière, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened carefully to the speech made by my colleague from the 
Progressive Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few days, we will have the march of women. Women have a lot 
of demands with regard to poverty. The majority of self-employed 
and part time workers are women. These jobs pay less for women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would have thought that, on the eve of the march of women, 
the government would have been more open to the demands of women 
in Bill C-44. Unfortunately, it chose to turn a deaf ear. The 
Prime Minister also refused to meet with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the member from the Progressive Conservative Party tell us 
what the government should have done in this bill to counter 
rising poverty for women in modern society? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am very well aware of 
the problem the member raises with respect to women looking for 
that meeting with the Prime Minister.  Only yesterday I contacted 
the Prime Minister's office on behalf of women to request that he 
meet with them when they come to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has done very little for women with the 
employment insurance changes.  We are all very much aware of what 
the statistics are.  Thirty-five per cent of people nationally 
qualify for employment insurance when they are unemployed but the 
figures are a whole lot worse for women.  Thirty per cent—and I 
think a member a moment ago said 32%—of women qualify for 
employment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With a $32 billion surplus the government could have made it a 
little better on everyone, including women, great numbers of whom 
are in the seasonal workforce, especially in the tourism industry 
and what have you.  The Liberals have neglected women and 
Canadians generally.  I think they will find that people will not 
treat them kindly when the election is called.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Michelle Dockrill (Bras d'Or—Cape Breton, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will read for my hon. colleague a little comment that 
comes from my colleague from Acadie—Bathurst on the human face of 
unemployment insurance. 
It is from a mother and says “It shows the complete lack of 
compassion on the part of the government when a mother is not 
given an opportunity to support her children and when instead her 
money is used to balance the budget”.  This clearly shows the 
direct correlation between the hungry Canadian children that 
there are as we sit in the Chamber tonight, and the government's 
devastation of unemployment insurance.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member like to comment on whether the government could 
have gone further with the EI legislation and in effect made some 
good strides toward eliminating poverty in the country? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member made very good 
comments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was on a poverty committee that travelled to every single 
province in Canada speaking to people about their problems.  The 
main point so many people made when they came before us to 
present their briefs was that with respect to poverty and 
children, the children come from poor parents, from mothers and 
fathers who cannot find work, mothers and fathers who have been 
denied benefits through employment insurance.  The employment 
insurance scheme and the government cutbacks over the last couple 
of years have played a very big part in the poverty in families. 
The government could have done a whole lot more. Some $32 billion 
is a massive amount of money to accumulate on the backs of 
parents and workers who are struggling to make ends meet on a 
daily basis.  The government could have done a whole lot more. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is a pleasure for me to discuss this issue today because it 
has been on my mind for a long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government proceeds to do things that the private sector 
cannot do.  It would be fraudulent and dishonest and it would be 
subject to fines if in private life or in business in the private 
sector I did what the government does every single payday.  Every 
single payday every single employee in the country gets a 
paycheque and on the stub there is a little column marked EI, 
employment insurance premiums.  It is not employment insurance 
premiums.  That is false labelling.  It would not comply 
according to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, consumer 
affairs or anything else because it is not accurate.  It is not 
true and it is not honest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every single person in Canada who gets paid tomorrow will get a 
cheque and a certain amount will have been taken off their pay 
for an employment insurance premium.  That is not what it is.  It 
is false labelling.  It is a surcharge for working. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Already the government has a $32 billion dollar surplus gathered 
together in its unemployment insurance fund.  It does not need 
any more money as far as that goes.  Certainly it should not be 
marked as an employment insurance premium when it is not. At the 
very least there should be two columns.  One should be marked 
employment insurance premiums and one should be marked surcharge 
for working or work tax because that is exactly what it is.  It 
goes into general revenues.  It has nothing to do with 
unemployment insurance premiums.  It happens every single payday 
to every single person.  Even government paycheques are marked 
the same way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If in business I sold a garment that was said to be 100% cotton 
and it was not 100% cotton, I would be charged with false 
labelling.  If I sold a car that had 40,000 kilometres on it but 
I said it only had 20,000 kilometres on it, I could be put in 
jail.  I have to say what I am charging money for but the 
government does not have to do that.  It is false labelling. It 
is misleading, it is dishonest and it is unfair.  It is a tax on 
working and it should be labelled as such. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would not get away with that in the private sector. Recently 
there was a case where a grocery store mislabelled a chicken. The 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency came down on that grocery store 
because it had mislabelled the chicken and the person who was 
paying a certain amount of money thought that he was getting a 
certain product and he was not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens every single day on every single paycheque 
in Canada. People think they are buying unemployment insurance 
when in fact it is just a surcharge, a tax that goes into general 
revenues.  I could not get away with that in the private sector 
and I do not know how the government can get away with it either. 
That is one thing I wanted to talk about.

<A HREF="#LINKT89"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing I wanted to talk about is the seasonal worker 
issue which comes up so often.  People who are fortunate enough 
to live in areas where there are low unemployment rates do not 
understand what it is like to live in an area where there are 
seasonal workers and employment is difficult to find. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recently went to Calgary, Alberta.  What impressed me the most 
was not the buildings, the fancy cars or the people, but 
the signs in the windows everywhere which read now hiring and 
help wanted.  They were everywhere.  If a person were to put 
up help wanted signs in my town, he or she would need police 
protection because there would be so many people trying to get 
the job.  People who make comments about the lazy Atlantic 
Canadians who do not want to work and about the people who live high on 
unemployment insurance just do not have a clue what they are 
talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the house manufacturing business before I went into 
politics.  We had 125 employees and we tried our best to maintain 
a 12 month a year operation but, come October or November, there 
was just no market and nobody to buy the houses.  It was too cold 
to place them, set them up and establish them so we had to have 
layoffs.  The management and the employees worked together to try 
to get through as long as they could, but when there was no other 
choice, a layoff was required.  They were seasonal workers. 
There was no choice.  There was no alternative.  That is all that 
could happen.  Everybody tried to avoid it.  Nobody wanted to go 
on unemployment insurance.  Nobody wanted to receive half pay or 
55% of their pay.  Who can live on 55%? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what happens in certain areas of the country.  Certain 
areas do not have the opportunities and the resources or what 
have you to provide full time employment.  Those people who are 
on unemployment should not be punished just because next year the 
same thing is going to happen.  It is not their choice.  They do 
not have any opportunities or alternatives.  It just happens. 
Everybody tries to work around it.  Everybody tries to find 
alternatives for work, but in some cases there just is not any. 
In that case there is unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To fine people, to punish them because they are forced onto 
unemployment is not fair.  This bill removes that condition and 
at least that is an improvement.  It is amazing that a Liberal 
government would bring it in in the first place when the Liberals 
claim to have a social conscience and have the interests of 
Canadians at heart, especially those Canadians who need help. 
For them to devise such a scheme and punish people because they 
cannot find year round work is unbelievable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incredible that only 35% of the applicants for 
unemployment insurance will be paid.  Only 35% of the unemployed 
are able to qualify for benefits but 100% of the working people 
pay in. It does not seem fair. Again it is mislabelling.  For 
100% of the people to pay in and only 35% or fewer, especially in 
the case of unemployed women who get less, to be paid is 
completely unacceptable. It indicates how out of touch the 
Liberals are with the areas that have unemployment. It is a 
policy that punishes people.  To change it now with these token 
election changes is almost offensive and insulting because it 
would be done just because an election is on the horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years we have been complaining about this, groups have 
been lobbying to get a change and there has not even been an 
acknowledgement of the problem.  Now that there is an election on 
the horizon, all of a sudden we are going to make these changes 
and ram them through real fast.  The Liberals are going to repeal 
these offensive changes which they were so delighted at putting 
in.  Certainly we welcome the changes but the timing is 
offensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The focus should be on job creation.  Instead of focusing on 
unemployment insurance, the whole focus should be on job 
creation.  There should be a program to develop jobs and to 
provide the incentives for employers to hire more people. There 
should be incentives to reduce trade barriers among the 
provinces and among countries.  There should be ways to 
overcome all the barriers to trade for industry and small 
business in areas of high unemployment.  Are there any?  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact we had a program called the Canada jobs fund.  It was 
abused and neglected and because of that we have lost that fund. 
That was a good fund.  In my own area it was a good fund.  It was 
delivered by people in my own community and now it has been taken 
away and given to a regional office of ACOA.  I am afraid we are 
going to lose the benefits of that program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can see, Mr. Speaker, that you are going to shut me down any 
minute so I will end my speech.  Those are my main issues on this 
bill.  I will be delighted to answer any questions members may 
have.

</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government of Canada

which would double the basic personal exemption for people over 
the age of 69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I enter into an explanation of the rationale behind the 
motion, I would like to seek unanimous consent of the House to

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is noteworthy to draw to the attention of the House and all 
Canadians the undemocratic manner in which the Liberals are 
intent on governing the nation.  Therefore, before I move into a 
discussion of the actual motion before the House, in an attempt 
to illustrate the importance of that, I would like to highlight 
the degree to which members of the House and all Canadians are 
deprived of great ideas put forward by members on their behalf. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will summarize some of the bills I have before parliament 
which will never have the opportunity to be voted on because 
Liberal members are unwilling to have them come forward for a 
vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bill to protect the legal definition of marriage as the 
union of one man and one woman.  I have a bill which would 
require fixed election dates so that the Prime Minister can no 
longer play games with Canadians on the timing of an election.  I 
have a bill which would provide longer jail sentences for those 
who use a firearm in the commission of a criminal offence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bill to provide for a referendum to determine whether 
Canadians wish medically unnecessary abortions to be covered 
under the Canada Health Act.  I have a bill to amend the Canada 
Labour Code to make trade union membership in the federal public 
service optional.  I have a bill protecting persons accused of a 
crime from undue public speculation before guilt has been 
established. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a bill which would amend the Parliament of Canada 
Act regarding recognized political parties, requiring an official 
party to have at least 10% of the seats in the House, which seems 
to me to be a very reasonable level and would prevent the type of 
fringe parties we have, for example, the fifth party in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bill which would require that companies no longer to be 
forced to make payroll deductions on behalf of the federal 
government and a bill requiring transparency in pricing of goods 
for sale in Canada.  In other words, a listing of taxes could no 
longer be contained in the price of a product but would have to 
be specifically listed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also have a bill which would require federal transfers for 
welfare under the Canada health and social transfer to be 
contingent upon whether that province has a workfare program.  I 
also have a bill to eliminate official bilingualism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some of my motions include repealing the Employment Equity Act, 
entrenching property rights in the constitution, criminal code 
punishment for persons wilfully disrupting electronic commerce, 
and the motion I have currently before the House today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the eve of a federal election I have to wonder how the 
Liberal members would handle questions from their constituents as 
to why they were unwilling to vote and have a public record of 
whether or not they supported these types of motions and bills. I 
hope their constituents are fully aware of this undemocratic 
inclination and will replace them with a Canadian Alliance 
government.

</I></B></P><P align=left>My motion would double the basic personal exemption for people 
over the age of 69.  The rationale behind it is that seniors who 
have accumulated registered retirement savings plans are required 
at that age to liquidate them into a registered retirement income 
fund. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The retirement savings that have been accumulated over a 
lifetime up to that point may have to sustain a person's 
well-being, for decades to come in some cases. The timing and use 
of the retirement fund should be at the discretion of the 
individual as opposed to being a legislated statutory requirement 
of a percentage that must be removed and liquidated from the 
sheltered savings plan.  Notwithstanding that and more to the point, 
my motion would help to reduce the tax burden incurred as a 
result of the law that requires liquidation of the savings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Doubling the basic personal exemption for seniors over the age 
of 69 would affect not only those who have accumulated savings 
but seniors who have no savings.  My motion would place their tax 
exempt level at a much higher rate and would enable them to earn 
more income from whatever source of income they may have, to avoid 
the taxman to a level that is a bit more reasonable than the 
current level of only $7,231. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is worthwhile to examine the Liberal record with respect to 
taxation and the tax savings that seniors would gain from my 
measure as opposed to what the government is doing with their 
money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If my motion were law seniors would retain more money in their 
pockets at the end of each tax year.  The government has seen fit 
to use that money for such things as fountains and golf courses 
in the Prime Minister's riding.  That is offensive to seniors, 
especially low income seniors who do not have a retirement nest 
egg and are forced to work to subsidize their living, with the 
taxman taking a bite out of their earnings at such a low level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal record does not just include wasteful spending.  In 
the seven years of Liberal government we have seen our national 
debt increase by almost $100 billion.  This represents a drain on 
our social programs because such a large part of the annual tax 
collected by the government each year must be used to service the 
debt instead of paying for useful social programs that we all 
care about, such as health care and education. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result of not only the waste but the fiscal mismanagement 
by the Liberal government, Canadians are seeing a declining 
standard of living as compared to the United States.  We have the 
highest level of personal income tax of any country in the 
industrialized world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the government had a $12 billion surplus.  It has 
promoted this fact quite widely and quite proudly.  For the 
benefit of the House and all Canadians, although the word surplus 
is a sexy word, sounds good and is appealing, the truth is that 
it represents an overtaxation.  Part of the overtaxation was 
incurred by seniors who were forced by law to liquidate their 
savings.  My motion would minimize the tax grab on those seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals have increased taxes 63 times since they came to 
power.  I contrast that with the Canadian Alliance because since 
we are heading into a federal election it is worthwhile to explain 
the difference in the two approaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While the Liberals engage in wasteful spending on frivolous 
programs, the Canadian Alliance believes that the federal 
government should be focused and streamlined, that we should end 
wasteful spending and that patronage should not exist.  Grants 
and giveaways by the federal government should not exist and 
should certainly not be based on who are the friends of the 
Liberal government.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our plan, to a large extent, would make my motion not necessary. 
The basic personal deduction I am proposing should be doubled for 
seniors over the age of 69. A Canadian Alliance government 
would peg the deduction at $10,000 for every Canadian, including the 
spousal exemption, which would end tax discrimination against 
single income families.  We would also provide a $3,000 deduction 
for every child. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, a husband and wife with two children earning 
$26,000 a year would pay zero tax.  Our tax applied to income 
above that level would be a single rate of 17%.  If a family of 
four was making $30,000 the total percentage of income tax they 
would pay would be approximately 2% because they would pay the 
17% only on the amount above their exemptions, which would be 
$26,000.  In other words, they would be taxed 17% of $4,000 or 
about 2% of their overall income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A further example is that the same family earning $100,000 would 
pay 17% of $74,000, which would be the balance between their 
exemption level and the $100,000 income level.  That would come 
to approximately 13% of their income. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although it is a single rate of tax it is actually a graduated 
scale.  In the case of a family of four earning $26,000 or 
$30,000 or $100,000, they would go from a rate of 0% to 2% to 13% 
and so on as the income climbs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a very fair and progressive system.  It would deviate from 
the regressive nature of the current tax system of the Liberals 
which penalizes people for working overtime, working hard, 
applying themselves and earning more money by bumping them into 
higher rates of income tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  It is called progressivity, not 
regressivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw:</B>  One of the rules of debate in the House 
of Commons is not to be taken in by the heckling from the other 
side, but I cannot let the comment go.  I heard the hon. member 
on the other side.  Actually he has it backward.  It is 
regressive to start increasing the percentage of tax paid because 
people are working harder. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can tell a personal story.  In the last federal election 
campaign I visited the town of Humboldt.  A few residents of that 
town work in the potash mines, not that far away.  An individual 
told me he never works any more than one overtime shift per pay 
period because it does not pay.  That is exactly because of the 
regressive nature of the tax system of the Liberal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regressive approach is not restricted solely to the marginal 
increased tax rates the government has in place but also applies to many 
other rules, excise taxes, surtaxes and surcharges that the 
Canadian Alliance would completely eliminate.  It also applies to 
the tax grab the government places on the retirement nest eggs of 
seniors, which my motion would alleviate on behalf of Canada's 
seniors. 
<P><A NAME="LINK254"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond to the motion of the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt asking that consideration be given by the 
government to doubling the basic personal deduction for taxpayers 
over age 69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I checked the notice paper to get the wording and the member's 
motion in fact says basic personal deduction.  There is no such 
thing in the Income Tax Act as a basic personal deduction.  It is 
called basic personal amount and it is a non-refundable tax 
credit.  On the basis of simply the wording of the motion and 
with the words basic personal deduction in quotations in the 
motion, it actually is out of order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, had the member had a look at the Income Tax Act, I 
assume he would have got it correct.  I will respond to the 
member's motion as if he had referred to doubling the 
non-refundable tax credit called the basic personal amount. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The purpose of Motion No. 305 is to provide additional tax 
assistance to taxpayers over age 69 by doubling the basic 
personal amount.  I appreciate the hon. member's recommendation. 
However I would point out that the government already provides special 
tax recognition for seniors. 
Furthermore, the government has reduced taxes substantially in 
recent years for all Canadians, including seniors, and will 
continue to do so as resources permit.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me explain to the House why we should not support Motion No. 
305.  I would like to clarify to my colleagues that the purpose 
of the basic personal credit, a non-refundable tax credit, is to 
contribute to tax fairness by ensuring that Canadians earning 
less than a basic amount do not pay tax.  In addition, it is 
important to note that the basic personal amount has been increased 
each year since 1998. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As hon. members know, the 2000 budget proposed a five year tax 
reduction plan.  This plan provides real and lasting tax 
reductions for Canadians to ensure that all taxpayers, including 
seniors, will see their taxes reduced and an improvement in their 
standard of living. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In particular, the five year tax reduction plan will increase 
the amount that can be earned tax free by at least $8,000 by the 
year 2004.  The basic personal credit for the year 2000 is equal 
to 17% of $7,231, which reduces federal taxes payable by $1,229. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other measures outlined in this plan will benefit seniors.  They 
include:  first, the reduction of the middle income tax rate to 
23% from 26%, starting with a 2% reduction to 24% in July 2000, 
which has already happened; second, increasing the amounts at 
which the middle and top rates apply to at least $35,000 and 
$70,000 respectively; and eliminating as of July 1, 2000 the 5% 
deficit reduction surtax on middle income Canadians and 
completely eliminating that surtax by 2004. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, the five year tax reduction plan also restored full 
indexation of the personal income tax system.  In particular, the 
tax reduction plan put an end to bracket creep by restoring full 
indexation to the income tax system at the beginning of this 
year.  Of particular significance to Canadian seniors is the 
indexation of the age credit, another non-refundable tax credit 
available to seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The five year tax reduction plan is the most significant tax cut 
in 25 years.  Let me make it clear that, while substantial, the tax 
relief outlined in the five year tax reduction plan represents the 
least, not the most, the government will do.  Indeed, as 
indicated by the hon. finance minister to the House of Commons 
Standing Committee on Finance on June 8, 2000, the measures 
outlined in the five year plan will be accelerated.  Furthermore, 
the government will explore new options for tax relief for all 
Canadians, including seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I stated earlier, the personal Canadian income tax system 
already has measures in place that provide special tax assistance 
for seniors.  There is the age credit, which was introduced to 
reduce the tax burden supported by elderly Canadians.  This is 
the measure used to recognize the special circumstances of 
seniors as it affects their ability to pay personal income taxes. 
For the year 2000 the age credit provides a federal tax benefit 
for those aged 65 and over equal to 17% of $3,531, which reduces 
their federal taxes payable by up to $600.  In order to target 
the age credit to those seniors who are most in need, the credit 
is reduced by 15% of individual net income in excess of $26,284 
and is fully phased out once income reaches $49,824. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to bring to the attention of the House the 
pension income credit.  This is a 17% credit on up to $1,000 of 
pension income, which provides additional protection against 
inflation for the retirement income of elderly Canadians.  The 
government also provides significant tax assistance to help 
people save for their retirement through registered retirement 
savings plans, commonly referred to as RRSPs, and registered 
pension plans, commonly referred to as RPPs.  For these plans, the 
tax owing on the contribution and investment income is deferred 
until income is received out of those plans.  In other words, 
contributions are tax deductible and investment income is not 
taxed as it accrues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal revenue costs of tax assistance for savings, pension 
plans and RRSPs were about $17.5 billion in 1998.  This means 
that if tax assistance for retirement savings did not exist, 
taxpayers would have paid approximately $17.5 billion more in 
taxes for that one year.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clearly the system of retirement savings represents a 
significant benefit for individuals and helps to ensure that 
seniors have adequate incomes in their retirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to recognize that in addition to tax 
assistance, seniors have the opportunity to benefit from other 
federal programs such as the old age security, the guaranteed 
income supplement, and the Canada and Quebec pension plans.  I 
would emphasize that Canada's public pension system has 
significantly improved the income position of seniors relative to 
the working age population over the past several decades.  From 
1951 to 1997 the average incomes of seniors rose from 55% of that 
of the working age population to over 81% of that of the working 
age population.  It is very significant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of international organizations such as the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development and the World Bank have 
concluded that Canada has one of the best retirement income 
systems in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the government provides tax assistance in 
recognition of the ability of seniors to pay income tax.  In 
addition, the recent tax reduction plan significantly reduces 
taxes for all Canadians, including seniors.  Combined with other 
federal programs, the government directs significant resources to 
help meet the needs of our seniors.  The government is committed 
to continuing to reduce the tax burden to all Canadians, 
including seniors. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make reference to a couple of the member's comments about 
the fact that our tax system is regressive.  He said it a couple 
of times.  I noted for him that it was progressive.  He 
disagreed, saying that I had it totally reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member will know that progressivity in an income tax system 
is something that is in every industrialized country in the 
world.  Progressivity means that the higher the income, the 
higher the effective rate of taxation one pays and the more one 
pays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I asked the finance critic of the Canadian Alliance about 
progressivity and why the flat tax proposal it announced today 
would go to a single rate of <I>x</I> per cent.  It will be the 
same regardless of how much income one makes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That to me is not progressivity.  It means that we are to shift 
the burden from high income earners to the rest of taxpayers. 
Even though they would say we are to increase the basic personal 
amount for some and reduce the number of taxpayers, all of a 
sudden what it means, if they are to collect the same amount of 
taxes and if high income earners get a big tax break, is that the 
only place to make it up is to tax more heavily those in the 
middle income categories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member does not agree with that, he would also have to 
admit that if about $17.5 billion of income tax revenue is to be 
lost, the only way to make it up is to slash services and 
programs that are assisting Canadians, including seniors.  That 
will be a big issue in the next election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, our current system is a progressive system.  To reduce 
it and to lower the burden for high income earners at the expense 
of the low and middle income earners is in fact regressive.  That 
is the regressivity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has it wrong.  I would suggest to the member that not 
only should he check the wording in his motion to make sure he 
brings accurate information to the House, he should also look at 
the reality of a single tax system which would take the income 
tax revenue that the government gets from the highest income 
earners in Canada and recover that either through income taxes or 
through service fees charged to all Canadians at low and middle 
income levels.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gilles-A. Perron (Rivière-des-Mille-Îles, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to take part in this debate on Motion No. 305, brought 
forward by the member for Saskatoon—Humboldt, asking the 
Government of Canada to immediately double the basic personal 
deduction for taxpayers over the age of 69. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It certainly is an interesting and well intentioned suggestion, 
since it is aimed at helping seniors maintain a good standard of 
living in their old age. However, I think such a measure cannot 
apply to all people over the age of 69 regardless of their 
income.

<A HREF="#LINKT95"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the sake of social fairness, it is crucial that we set an 
income limit over which this deduction would be pointless. We 
could also think about a decreasing scale above the fixed 
ceiling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a report entitled <I>A Portrait of Seniors in Canada</I>, Statistics 
Canada indicates that the average income of single seniors 
decreases somewhat in the older age groups. In 1997, the average 
income from all sources for single seniors between age 65 and 69 
was $21,400, compared to $19,500 for seniors 70 years of age and 
older. 
Seniors currently have access to three taxable public programs: 
old age security, the Canada pension plan and régime des rentes 
du Québec, and the guaranteed income supplement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As in the overall population, single senior men have a 
significantly higher income than single senior women. In 1997, 
single men 65 years of age and older had an average income of 
$24,300, almost $6,000 more than single senior women. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, the income of seniors varies from province to province. In 
Ontario and western Canada, the income of seniors is higher than 
in Quebec and especially in Atlantic Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To double the basic personal deduction of taxpayers 65 years of 
age and older would be very beneficial. 
However, some seniors start cashing in their RRSPs at age 70. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would this extra money do for our seniors? Not only on a 
moral level would it be a sign of the state's gratefulness for 
its aging population, but also on a financial level it would 
provide a support seniors rightly deserve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What about our senior citizens' expenses? In some cases they 
have medical and related expenses. At long last we would live 
in a society that would no longer be ungrateful to the senior 
citizens who have greatly contributed to the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not forget inflation. Senior citizens' incomes do not 
keep up with price increases. It is wrong to believe that we 
have fewer needs when we grow old. It is often said that senior 
citizens spend less on food, clothing and entertainment. 
This is wrong, since like the rest of the population, senior 
citizens spend a significant part of their total budget on basic 
necessities such as food, housing, clothing and transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of housing, housing costs account for a sizeable 
portion of the total expenses of senior citizens living on their 
own. In 1997, they spent over one out of every four dollars on 
housing. If we stay healthy, it is not our age but the lack of 
money that will slow us down. This extra money could make life a 
lot nicer for a number of our fellow citizens getting on in 
age. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senior citizens make a significant contribution to society 
through their volunteer activities. A more generous basic 
personal deduction could be seen as a reimbursement for the 
indirect expenses incurred by elderly volunteers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am in favour of this motion, but the government should listen 
to the representations the Bloc Quebecois has been making since 
1993, namely, that the tax system should be entirely overhauled. 
Such a reform should take those making less than $30,000 a year 
off the tax roll. This proposal would help not only senior 
citizens, but a whole category of our fellow citizens who cannot 
make ends meet.

Speaker, I could not help but listen to the member from the 
Alliance when he talked about his motion.  The first thing that 
came to my mind was, will the real Alliance Party stand up? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about the initiative as helping seniors across 
the country.  I do not think we will find anybody in the Chamber 
who is not committed to initiatives that will help seniors. 
However, when I listened to the member I could not help but 
wonder why his party did not want to help the largest portion of 
seniors in terms of a national pharmacare program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have read study after study that talk about our aging 
population and the fact that, as we all know, when we get older 
unfortunately we have the need to access the health care system. 
He talked about putting money back into the pockets of seniors. I 
know that the seniors in my riding would really appreciate having 
some assistance in paying for their drugs.  In my part of the 
country I have seniors who literally play Russian roulette in 
choosing between taking medication or buying groceries.  This 
winter it will be about putting fuel in their tanks to heat their 
homes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member talked about spending on frivolous programs.  Is 
the Alliance saying that medicare is a frivolous program or that 
the Canada pension program is a frivolous program?  It is 
interesting to listen to the Alliance day after day.  When we 
look at some of the initiatives that have been put forth by the 
Alliance over the last three years, there is one key thread that 
continues to run through all of them and that is the divisiveness 
which its initiatives cause in this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talks about seniors.  Why not, as I said, support an 
initiative that would help all seniors, not just some seniors? 
Why not have an initiative to provide that anybody who makes 
$15,000 or less does not have to pay income tax?  That would 
surely help an awful lot of seniors in my part of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we have is the Alliance again bringing forward initiatives 
that will create division among various groups of our 
population.  We know all too well that once it creates division 
the Alliance is very good at fueling that division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was interesting to note that the hon. member who spoke prior 
to me said that men over 65 living alone actually make $6,000 
more than women over 65 who live alone.  Is the member for the 
Alliance targeting men with his initiatives?  If the member truly 
believes that it is the responsibility of the Alliance to create 
initiatives that help all seniors, why does his party not support 
a national pharmacare program?  Seniors across the country have 
clearly indicated that they need it and they need it now.  That 
is clearly what would assist seniors to put money back into their 
pockets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I talked a number of times today about the legacy that the 
government is leaving Canadians.  We have 1.4 million children 
living in poverty.  We have a majority of seniors who worked hard 
all of their lives with the hope that they could sit down, enjoy 
life and smell the roses.  However, seniors are being gouged 
because they have to pay exorbitant prices for drugs which they 
need to maintain breath in their bodies.

initiative that clearly will cause division within the groups in

seniors put money back into their pockets, then I ask the member 
and his party to support a national pharmacare program that will 
do exactly what the member says he would like to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Elsie Wayne (Saint John, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want 
the hon. member from the NDP party to know that there is no 
question that we would certainly support a pharmacare program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was a councillor back in 1977, the mayor of the day was 
Samuel Davis.  He was the first and only Jewish gentleman to be 
mayor in Saint John.  Samuel said to me “Elsie, I want you to go 
out to east Saint John.  There's a meeting out there.  They're 
calling it the seniors' club”.  He said he did not know what it 
meant but he wanted me to go.  I was not a senior then but off I 
went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I walked into the meeting I was really impressed with the 
seniors who were there.  They said they wanted to get seniors 
involved.  They wanted to get seniors who were lonely and living 
alone involved as well.  They started their first club and today 
there are 34 seniors' clubs in my riding of Saint John, New 
Brunswick.  We have brought the seniors out.  A lot of them do 
not need medication now because they have friends, they get 
involved and they are busy.  However, there is no question that 
they some need help. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion calls on the federal government to double the basic 
personal deduction for Canadian taxpayers over the age of 69.  All 
of us in the House recognize that with a rapidly ageing 
population, Canada is faced with the challenge of ensuring that 
our senior citizens are able to live out their retirement years 
in dignity.  The word dignity means an awful lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Studies show that approximately 70% of elderly Canadians are 
dependent on public pension plans.  It should also be noted that 
in 1997, 662,000 Canadians aged 65 and over had incomes below 
Statistics Canada's low income cut-offs.  In the same year, 45% 
of seniors aged 65 and over and living alone were considered 
to have low incomes compared with only 7% of seniors who lived 
with their families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to Statistics Canada, the average income of seniors across 
Canada is just a little over $20,000.  I want everyone 
here tonight to think about that.  Could we live on $20,000? 
How would we manage?  How would we make out?  No, members 
certainly could not do it, and seniors have a most difficult time 
with it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The OAS, the old age security program, accounts for the largest 
part of seniors' incomes at 29%.  This is followed by CPP, 21%; 
retirement pensions, 20%; non-RRSP investment, 11.6%; and 
employment income, 7.6%.  Meanwhile, 60% of the after tax income 
of seniors goes toward the basic necessities such as food, 
shelter, clothing and transportation.  There is very little left 
for someone who is renting an apartment. They do not live in 
luxury. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bottom line here is seniors.  Like other segments of the 
population they pay too much tax.  Something must be done, not 
only for our seniors but for all Canadian taxpayers regardless of 
their age.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada continues to have the highest personal income tax rates 
in the G-7.  Federal budgetary revenues are at record levels in 
Canada:  $155.6 billion in fiscal year 1998-99, up 34% since 
1993-94.  Meanwhile personal income tax revenues were $72.5 
billion in 1998-99, up from $51.4 billion in 1993-94.  That is a 
41% increase since the Liberals took power in 1993 despite the 
fact that Canada's real GDP grew by just 15% over the same period 
of time, so we know that it was increased taxes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the Liberal government claims to be reducing taxes, it 
continues to increase CPP contributions.  In the past year alone 
CPP premiums have increased by 40 cents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can and should do more for Canadians, including our seniors. 
However, the current government has difficulty in organizing its 
priorities.  It chooses to carry out an agenda of wasteful 
government spending.  We need only to ask the Auditor General of 
Canada about that.  The people of Canada should look at his 
reports. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the motion before us today, the PC Party 
believes that the basic personal exemption, the BPE, can and 
should be increased, not only for those over 69 but for all 
Canadians.  We have proposed that the BPE should be increased 
from its current level of $7,131 to $12,000.  This can be done 
over a five year period and will remove 2.5 million Canadians 
from the tax rolls.  Many of them are seniors and a lot of them 
are families in need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say I will never ever forget what Mr. 
Mykytyshyn said about our people back home.  I come from Canada's 
first city incorporated by royal charter, a city that built the country. 
Those people moved from Saint John right across the country and 
built it.  I have to say that a lot of those people from the maritime 
provinces who are in Alberta were really hurt when Mr. Mykytyshyn 
made his statements.  They said “We are out here building 
Alberta for heaven's sake, but we are from the maritimes”. These 
are the Canadians who can least afford to pay income tax yet are 
currently forced to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This would result in taxpayers saving as much as $1,200 
annually.  Furthermore we have also suggested in our task force 
report on poverty that the value of the age credit be initially 
increased by $170 by raising the amount on which it is based to 
$4,482, providing much needed relief for our aging population. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The task force on poverty went out west. 
It went into central Canada.  It went into Quebec.  It went right 
across the nation from Newfoundland right through to B.C.  There 
is poverty in all of the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians deserve tax fairness.  The reform alliance party needs 
to take some time to understand that concept.  Its 17% flat tax 
proposal really is not a flat tax.  It would give millionaires a 
$135,000 tax break while people, such as the seniors we are 
talking about today, making $20,000 would get an $895 tax break. 
It is not exactly tax fairness. Perhaps the member for 
Saskatoon—Humboldt should tell his constituents what his party's 
plan would really offer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, the PC Party does not support the motion as it 
is written.  We believe that all members of society, not just 
a little select group, deserve a tax break. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that the current annual cost to provide benefits 
to the elderly is $24 billion for the federal government alone 
and it is expected to triple over the next three decades.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I have raised my personal concerns on more than one occasion in 
the House about the ability of senior citizens to pay the ever 
increasing cost of heating their homes.  Those seniors who live 
in residence or in apartments will likely have to move because there 
will be an increase in their rents.  Those seniors who continue 
to live in their own little houses will certainly see an increase 
in their heating costs unless the government does something to 
assist them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Senior citizens on tightly fixed incomes do not have the 
flexibility to cope with soaring oil prices.  I do not believe 
that anyone in the House will deny the potential for an extremely 
cold winter this year.  I do not feel that the way to treat 
grandparents and veterans—and our veterans are all seniors in 
this nation—is to leave them out in the cold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I have stated here tonight, Canadians of all ages are in need 
of tax relief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. McClelland):</B>  As is the custom, 
the mover of the motion will have the last five minutes of the 
debate.  After he has spoken the debate will be terminated. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Pankiw (Saskatoon—Humboldt, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, first, I must say that the Liberal member who 
followed my speech delivered his speech in a very patronizing and 
arrogant manner.  I know he referred to the basic personal amount 
which I referred to as a deduction.  However, everybody knows we 
have casual discussions in coffee shops and along hallways.  In 
fact one of the members of another party referred to it as the 
basic personal exemption or the basic personal amount.  He was 
just playing word games and semantics and avoiding the issue. Not 
only was he avoiding the issue, he completely missed my point and 
referred to the Canadian Alliance plan for a single rate tax as a 
flat tax. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was sitting there when I gave my speech.  I do not 
know whether he was daydreaming but I gave a clear example of a 
family of four.  I explained that under the Canadian Alliance 
plan, a family of four earning $26,000 a year would pay an 
effective rate of zero per cent.  If they earned $30,000 they 
would pay 2%.  If they earned $100,000 they would pay 13%.  That 
of course would continue to escalate up to 17% the higher their 
income went. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member talked about progressivity versus regressivity and 
which is which.  It is really interesting to note that the 
Liberals have a tax system in place that penalizes hard work and 
overtime.  The more money a worker makes the more tax he or she 
pays, not on a graduated scale, as the Canadian Alliance is 
proposing, but on a percentage basis.  That is regressive but the 
Liberals say that is progressive.  Talk about word games. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing the member said was that in order to do what we 
are proposing we would be shifting the tax burden from high 
income earners and putting it on middle income earners.  Nothing 
could be further from the truth.  Our plan would remove 1.4 
million low income Canadians right off the tax rolls and would 
lower taxes for everybody. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member hypothesizes that it would not be possible to 
provide tax cuts to one income bracket group without burdening 
another, but the fact of the matter is that we will do this by 
simply cutting government waste and ending wasteful programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I could sit here all day and give examples of those programs: 
the regional economic development program, the job creation 
program, the grants and giveaways, the subsidization of crown 
corporations, and the list goes on.  Perhaps the most prominent 
example is the fiasco and scandalous loss of a billion dollars by 
the human resources development minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nonetheless, the point of my motion was to draw attention to the 
fact that the tax system as it exists is very convoluted and 
unfair.  It is regressive. 
The Canadian Alliance plan would not only make the tax system 
progressive, it would make the tax system much more simple and 
much more fair.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>GUN REGISTRY 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK261"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Garry Breitkreuz (Yorkton—Melville, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, on June 13, I asked the justice 
minister a question which she refused to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of my constituents, I sincerely hope that after almost 
four months she has been able to find the courage to tell 
Canadians the truth about her badly bungled gun registry and how 
much it has cost taxpayers.  For the benefit of the minister, I 
will repeat my original question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 the justice minister tabled a document entitled 
“Financial Framework for Bill C-68” that projected a deficit of 
$2.2 million over five years for implementation of the gun 
registration scheme.  It is now five years later and the minister 
has collected less than $17 million in user fees and the deficit 
is more than $300 million.  That is 150 times larger than the 
deficit first projected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who is responsible for this huge waste of money, the previous 
minister's ridiculous estimate or the current minister's 
mismanagement of the scheme? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my supplementary question I asked the minister about the cost 
of her latest advertising blitz and the firearms outreach 
program.  She ducked that question too, spouting statistics about 
refused and revoked licences and blocked sales of legally owned 
guns, all this while the minister knows full well that taxpayers 
did not need a half a billion dollar gun registry to achieve 
these results.  All that was really needed was better 
administration of the 20 year old FAC program.  As if we needed 
more proof, in 1999 the United States blocked 160,000 gun sales 
and it does not even have a gun registry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister please provide us with a cost benefit analysis 
of her gun registry program?  Will the minister please explain 
how requiring the registration of grampa's shotgun helps to 
generate these bogus blocked gun sales statistics?  Will the 
minister please explain how she is preventing these now 
potentially dangerous gun owners from acquiring firearms 
illegally from the nearest Indian reserve? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just last week I received a response to an access to information 
request from the minister's department.  Her bureaucrats failed 
to provide any information about the costs of her firearms 
outreach program as I had requested.  The minister's bureaucrats 
did provide enough statistics, however, to prove her firearms 
outreach program was another fantastic flop in a five year series 
of firearms flops. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Documents show that the justice minister's plan was to process 
1.4 million licence applications this summer.  In fact the 
department's own website reveals it received less than 300,000 
applications and processed only 102,000 firearms licence 
applications. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell Canadians how much her outreach program 
and ad campaign cost taxpayers and explain why the program was 
such a dismal failure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister's departmental website also reveals a bigger 
problem than the waste of half a billion dollars of public money. 
As of September 2, 2000, her bureaucrats had issued only 286,000 
firearms licences in the last 21 months, an average of 13,630 per 
month, and 339,000 licence applications were in processing 
or in backlog. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At its current rate of production, it will take the Department 
of Justice more than two years to get rid of this backlog and 12 
more years to process the licences from the remaining two million 
gun owners.  The government's very low estimates still have not 
even been applied.  The minister's impossible deadline is now 
less than three months away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Minister of Justice still refuses to provide this 
year's budget for the Canadian firearms program operated by her 
department.  The minister's minions are even stonewalling 
investigations from the Information Commissioner of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sources close to the minister tell us that the gun registry has 
already cost taxpayers $260 million this year and will exceed 
$300 million by the end of March 2001.  Will the justice minister 
tell Canadians what she is trying to hide?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Maloney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Justice and Attorney General of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the government has not been shirking any of its responsibility 
concerning this major public safety initiative. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians overwhelmingly share our vision and support this 
important program.  We now have more than 1.1 million Canadians 
who hold or who have applied for licences under the legislation. 
More than 1.6 million firearms are registered.  Since December 1, 
1998, more than 929 licence applications have been refused for 
public safety concerns.  As well, 1,182 licences have been 
revoked from individuals deemed not to be eligible to hold a 
licence because they pose a safety risk.  The number of 
revocations is over 20 times higher than the total of the 
previous five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot talk about the costs of this program without talking 
about the benefits.  The benefits of this program represent an 
investment of $2 per Canadian for the past five years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The costs of the firearms program are subject to the same kinds 
of review and scrutiny as any other government program.  The 
government is accepting its responsibilities, including its 
financial accountability.  It would be refreshing if the members 
opposite opposing this valuable legislation would accept their 
responsibility for playing a positive role respecting the public 
safety of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an aggressive program in place to deal with providing 
enhanced service to Canadian firearms owners.  Elements of this 
include the following services.  We have been providing face to 
face assistance to help people complete their applications for 
licensing.  We have dramatically simplified our forms.  We have 
implemented processing and system efficiencies throughout to 
provide better service to Canadians more quickly.  We have 
enhanced our call centre services to provide better and faster 
individualized assistance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the same time as we are providing better service to firearms 
owners we are providing better public safety to all Canadians. We 
are now able to do background checks before any legitimate 
firearms sale can proceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As of the end of September, over 7,770 potentially dangerous gun 
sales were the subject of additional scrutiny.  In these cases 
people with histories of violence, break and enter, theft or drug 
involvement or people who were trying to acquire guns that they 
were not licensed to purchase were the subject of additional 
checks.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>EMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK264"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I spoke today on the EI bill, Bill C-44, which is quite 
clearly a vote buying piece of legislation when we look at what 
the government is really doing, which is practically nothing 
compared to the suffering of people who have been affected by the 
Liberal government's 1996 cuts to unemployment insurance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know I only have four minutes so I will never get to 
everything that I want to say, but before I go into that it is 
important to look back at why I am a member of parliament in the 
House of Commons today and to look at what really happened. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the Liberal government campaigned that it would be 
helping workers in rural Canada, that it would be helping to 
develop those regions and would make life easier for those 
people, like the Prime Minister said when he campaigned in 
Beauséjour and told seasonal workers that they were not being 
treated fairly in those days.  Surprise, surprise.  I wonder what 
happened once he got elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once the Prime Minister was elected he introduced all kinds of 
legislation in the House.  The bill that was absolutely 
unacceptable was the one regarding the unemployment insurance 
program.  I am sure there are Liberal members on the other side 
who do not agree with what took place in 1996, but they were 
silent then.  At the time in Atlantic Canada 31 out of 32 MPs 
were Liberal MPs.  With 31 MPs on the government side, the 
government was able to pass a piece of legislation that out of 
the whole country most affected Atlantic Canadians.  The 31 MPs 
were totally silent.  They closed their eyes and supported their 
government.  They did not care about the people of Atlantic 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started to listen to what was happening.  I thought, there is 
something wrong here.  We have an elected member of parliament on 
the government side.  He is there.  He has been an elected member 
for a long time.  He actually stepped down and gave his place to 
the Prime Minister.  The riding voted for him and gave him a one 
way ticket to Ottawa.  I thought, why are those same people being 
punished for electing the Prime Minister and giving him his one 
way ticket to Ottawa. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I started questioning the MP.  I asked him if he were not 
concerned.  He indicated that they were abusing the system and 
that the system would have to be changed because there was too 
much abuse. 
He was saying this about the same people who were voting for him. 
I walked out of his office and I thought, my God, I have been 
voting for the wrong man all this time.  He has no interest in 
defending my interests and the interests of the riding.

<A HREF="#LINKT102"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is when I got involved and started to have public meetings. 
I organized coalitions.  I told people that we had a problem, 
that we had elected a member of parliament whose sole interest in 
government was self-interest and that was it.  I am not saying 
every member of the government is bad, because I know there are 
very nice people on that side, but he was our member of 
parliament and he should have been defending our interests and 
that did not happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened on June 2, 1999?  The people asked me to run 
because actually I had been representing them for the last three 
years.  Too many people were suffering and they asked me to run. 
I was a seasonal worker and I was going to run in an election.  I 
could not imagine it would happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure my time is almost over, but what I want to say is that 
people in Atlantic Canada are tired.  They are not for sale. The 
bill will not buy their votes.  They voiced their opinion on June 
2, 1999.  I will make sure that Atlantic Canadians, people from 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, be they from Albert county, Kent county 
or Westmorland, remember what the Liberals did to them in 1996.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Raymonde Folco (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not sure 
there is a question in the comment made by the member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, but there are a few things I can clarify. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First of all, Bill C-44, which was introduced by the Minister of 
Human Resources Development, is designed to help people. This 
bill is the result of the program evaluation process that took 
place in the maritime provinces and across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This process made us realize that we had to make some 
adjustments to help workers across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-44 brings necessary changes to the employment insurance 
program, changes that will benefit seasonal workers and millions 
more in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, the bill proposes the elimination of the intensity 
rule because it has not been effective and because, according to 
many, it is just a punitive measure. That is the first answer I 
can give the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Communities that depend on seasonal work will benefit from this 
new measure as they will benefit from other measures proposed in 
the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to add one basic element, namely, long term 
solutions. The government is looking for long term solutions. 
Solutions to the problems of seasonal workers call for more than 
what the employment insurance program can provide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to say this, but it is the truth, because the 
solutions will require better co-operation among governments, 
businesses, community leaders and individuals so that we can 
improve job opportunities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know life is not easy in several regions of Canada, but that 
is something we have to really work on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gilbert Dumont is the chairman of the local committee on 
employment insurance in Charlevoix, a region in Quebec that 
relies a lot on seasonal work. On September 13, he said “We must 
look for lasting solutions to the unemployment problem in our 
region, instead of relying on employment insurance”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He is right, and as I said earlier, in partnership with 
communities and businesses, we can solve this problem, which is 
a concern not only for the hon. member for 
Beauséjour—Petitcodiac but also for the government.
