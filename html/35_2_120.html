<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CANADIANFOODINSPECTIONAGENCYACT">CANADIAN FOOD INSPECTION AGENCY ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed, from December 12, 1996, consideration of 
Bill C-60, an act to establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
and to repeal and amend other Acts as a consequence, as reported 
(with amendments) from the committee; and of motions in Group 
No. 6.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the bill 
before us seeks to establish an agency that will have a number of 
powers and responsibilities regarding the food industry.
<P>
	As you know, in Quebec, we already have a body, namely the 
Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, that assumes all 
the powers and responsibilities necessary in any state to ensure the 
public has access to food that meets modern safety and quality 
standards, and does so in a cost effective way.
<P>
	This morning, I speak on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois primarily 
to make sure the agency to be established will satisfy the probity 
criteria that Canadians and Quebecers should expect.
<P>
	This is why the Bloc Quebecois proposed a series of 
amendments and, this morning, we are debating the sixth group of 
these amendments. I will now discuss them.
<P>
	The first one deals with clause 12, lines 28 and 29, on page 4 of 
the bill. The amendment that we propose provides that the agency 
is exempt from the application of section 7 and subsection 69(3) of 
the Public Service Staff Relations Act. It also states that, for the 
purposes of paragraph 92(1)(<I>b</I>) of the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act, the agency is deemed to be designated pursuant to 
subsection 92(4) of that act.
<P>
	Why do we propose this amendment? Because, in its current 
form, the agency would be a ``separate employer'' under the Public 
Service Staff Relations Act, which means that some employees 
would lose vested rights.
<P>
	The purpose of this act is not to take anything away from public 
servants, but to ensure a better integration of functions currently 
being fulfilled by three different bodies.
<P>
	This amendment is also in response to a request from the 
Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada. Given the 
parliamentary procedure, should the amendment we discussed in 
previous days be adopted, it would obviate the need for this 
particular amendment.
<P>
	I should point out that PIPS agrees with the view expressed by 
the Public Service Alliance of Canada, except that it is asking that 
the bill be amended to allow it to negotiate a number of issues that 
are important to its members.
<P>
	Again, the purpose of the bill is not to wrong public servants, but 
to better serve the public from coast to coast.
<P>
	If the government does not vote in favour of the amendments 
being proposed by the Bloc Quebecois, the result will be that 
bargaining agents for the agency's future unionized employees will 
not be able to continue to bargain in a certain number of areas. 
These areas are as follows: organization of the public service, 
assignment of duties to positions within the agency, and 
classification, appointment, evaluation, promotion, demotion, 
transfer, lay-off, and release of employees for other than 
disciplinary reasons.
<P>
	You can see, the whole House can see, that important rights, 
substantial protection that is there for the majority of employees 
under the Public Service Employment Act will no longer apply to 
agency employees when the initial two-year transition period 
comes to an end.
<P>
	This is a situation that must be drawn to the attention of this 
House. It was incumbent on the Bloc Quebecois to condemn this 
situation because, I repeat, the law must not be used, directly or 
indirectly, to tamper with the rights of public servants.
<P>
<B>(1010)</B>
<P>
	We also have another amendment. The agency is deemed to be 
included in the definition of ``federal undertaking'' in section 2 of 
the Canada Labour Code, and that that act applies, with such 
modifications as the circumstances require, to the agency and its 
employees.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7504"> 7504 </A></B>
<P>
	We are proposing this additional amendment because, in its 
present form, the agency will be a separate employer as defined 
in the Public Service Staff Relations Act.
<P>
	I would also remind members that we are introducing this 
amendment at the request of the Public Service Alliance of Canada. 
With respect to the alliance, the government unfortunately did not 
take into account the legislative positions put forward by the unions 
during consultations held by the government to determine the 
agency's status. Workers whose positions must be transferred to the 
new agency would lose benefits negotiated or integrated with the 
National Joint Council. They would thus lose any benefits they had 
under the work force adjustment directive. They would also lose 
their protection with respect to staffing and classification.
<P>
	You will understand that, in order to resolve this situation, and at 
the same time allow it to improve conditions for its members, the 
alliance is therefore asking that the government designate the 
agency as covered by the Canada Labour Code. The Bloc 
Quebecois, through its amendment, is backing the alliance's 
request because it is a reasonable one. It meets these criteria: that 
bills passed should be for, not against, improving the well-being of 
public servants.
<P>
	I hope the House will also be receptive to this amendment, which 
is so obviously justified, as you can see.
<P>
	In the few minutes I have left, I will move on to another 
amendment in the same block, this one affecting clause 13, lines 30 
to 34. This amendment follows on, of course, from the previous 
one by the Professional Institute of the Public Service, which also 
recommended this one to us.
<P>
	More specifically, the employees of the agency are to be 
appointed pursuant to the Public Service Employment Act, and not, 
under the Public Service Staff Relations Act, as the bill reads at 
present.
<P>
	We are bringing in this new amendment because, as it stands at 
present-again we must remember that the agency will be a 
separate employer under the Public Service Staff Relations Act and 
employees must not lose vested rights.
<P>
	What the Professional Institute of the Public Service is calling 
for is along the same lines as the Alliance, except that the latter also 
wants to amend the bill in a way that would allow it to negotiate a 
number of important matters for its members.
<P>
	Again, if our amendment were not supported by this House, 
there are a number of important matters which could no longer be 
negotiated by the agency on behalf of its future unionized staff.
<P>
	In short, once again the situation is worthy of the attention of this 
House, and we are pointing it out because we believe proper 
protection is in the best interests of future employees.
<P>
	I know my time is very nearly up, so I will conclude by bringing 
to the attention of members that, generally speaking, this bill rather 
freely opens the door to possible political appointments to the 
board and staff of this agency. It would be regrettable, you will 
agree, if we were to end up with a bill which might tempt a political 
party in power to take advantage of a number of openings to 
exercise what is generally called patronage.
<P>
<B>(1015)</B>
<P>
	When human beings are involved there is always the risk of 
human weaknesses, which is why I feel it is the duty of this House 
to ensure that such patronage could not be possible, by quite simply 
making the appropriate changes to the bill to prevent any 
possibility of political appointments by the party in power.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, my comments will be brief on group No. 6. This 
group of amendments deals with the staffing of the agency. It 
would make contracting and privatization of inspection services 
very difficult.
<P>
	I would like to bring to the attention of the House some of the 
concerns we heard about this aspect of the bill in committee from 
people in the food processing industry.
<P>
	Currently there is a tremendous amount of food inspection in 
some parts of the food processing industry. Maybe this is the wrong 
term to use, but we could almost say that there is overkill with 
respect to inspection. I was talking to the manager of a meat 
processing facility who said that the federal government insists that 
28 inspectors be on site to do the inspection of meat in that facility. 
He told me that a facility of the same size in the United States that 
processes the same amount of food would require three federal 
inspectors. Perhaps three is not enough, but I would think that 28 is 
far too many.
<P>
	I also talked to someone in the food processing business who 
said that the more federal inspectors there are looking over 
employees' shoulders the less diligence there is to ensure they are 
processing safe and healthy food. It is really not their responsibility 
to ensure the food is of good quality and safe for human 
consumption. There is an inspector looking over their shoulder 
every step of the way. If anything is not properly inspected it is not 
the responsibility of the employees of the processing plant. The 
focus is on the inspectors who have failed to do their job.
<P>
	Many processing plants hire their own inspectors. They feel it is 
important to have their own inspectors on site to ensure quality 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7505"> 7505 </A></B>
<P>
control and to ensure that a healthy  product is being put on the 
shelves for Canadians to eat. Therefore, in some cases there is 
duplication.
<P>
	Bill C-60 would move employees from three departments into 
one federal food inspection agency. Those employees are 
guaranteed two years of employment whether they are needed or 
not. This draws attention to the fact that the government is not 
looking at taxpayers' concerns. It is only looking at maintaining the 
bureaucracy at its present size. It is totally ruling out any 
possibility of privatization or downsizing of inspection services 
within the guidelines that are required to ensure safe and healthy 
food for Canadians. I point that out to the House as another glaring 
omission or failure of the Liberal government, one of many that has 
come to the attention of Canadians.
<P>
	We oppose motion No. 14 in group No. 6 because we think it will 
make contracting out or privatizing of inspection services in the 
future very difficult. Several of these motions are unnecessary, 
such as motions Nos. 15, 16 and 17.
<P>
	We support motion No. 18. It would give the standing committee 
the power to review the agency's appointment process. My Bloc 
colleague reiterated what I said before in this debate. Patronage is a 
problem which needs to be addressed.
<P>
	Finally, we oppose motion No. 36. It requires the government to 
develop a code of conduct for the agency's employees before the 
bill comes into force. While that is not a bad thing, we do not 
believe it is necessary in this piece of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1020)</B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Claude Bachand (Saint-Jean, BQ): </B>Mr. Speaker, when my 
colleagues asked me to speak to Bill C-60, I looked at the bill and 
at the work done by our research group.
<P>
	I was struck particularly by the motions in group 6, by what my 
colleagues had said earlier, and also by the fact that we cannot deny 
our past. I am a former member of the labour movement and proud 
of it. I worked for the CNTU for 20 years. Every time the Liberal 
government introduces a bill like this one, I think it clearly 
contradicts what the red book says about creating jobs, jobs, jobs, 
and also what the ministers are saying today.
<P>
	These ministers often claim they are the workers' friend. They 
keep telling us they are on the workers' side. This bill shows once 
again, as I said this week, that with friends like these, workers do 
not need enemies. The message is clear.
<P>
	When we talk about vested rights in the labour movement and 
when we talk about bargaining power and negotiating on equal 
terms, these are important concepts. However, we do not find them 
in this bill. On the contrary, the government wants to axe vested 
rights. It wants to axe bargaining power. It wants to axe working 
conditions.
<P>
	I think this is the logic of a lunatic. What is the point? What is 
the point of telling federal employees today to do something else, 
to give up some of their working conditions? These people are 
getting poorer and poorer. They are losing their jobs. They are 
often forced to get together in groups and bid on jobs from the 
government. In the end, we are seeing a loss of jobs and a loss of 
working conditions. All this means there is less money in the 
system. It does not take long to find out why the system is in such 
bad shape.
<P>
	That is exactly what will happen when the food inspection 
agency is established under Bill C-60. You can hear the agency 
saying: ``I am different from other employers. I am a separate 
employer. I do not want to be subject to the Public Service Staff 
Relations Act''. Really? And so what happens? Workers lose and 
are worse off than they were before.
<P>
	In my riding there are several abattoirs where a number of 
veterinaries and inspectors for Health Canada and Agriculture 
Canada are employed. Later on, these people are going to come in 
my office and tell me: ``Mr. Bachand, we are losing our terms and 
conditions of employment. What can you do for us?'' They are 
lucky to have a member from the Bloc Quebecois who is prepared 
to listen. There have been several instances where the government 
intervened and people wanted to see their Liberal members, but 
found the door locked or were met by the police.
<P>
	We never call the police, not for federal employees, not for the 
employees at the Saint-Jean military base and not for the 
Agriculture Canada employees at Saint-Jean. We invite them in and 
we listen to them. These people know that, if a Liberal member 
were sitting in the chair of the member for Saint-Jean, they would 
not be listened to carefully.
<P>
	That is one reason we try to defend them as best we can. I think 
there are more important things to do than for them to say they are 
making progress, that there is a party line and that they are obliged 
to do what the minister says. ``You know, everyone must make an 
effort''. We here this regularly from federal members and 
ministers.
<P>
	Finally, along with the agency comes a whole patronage haven. 
Think about it: the governor in council appoints the president, who 
appoints the executive vice-president. Names are already being 
proposed, and the agency has not yet even been set up. Soon, we 
will know in advance who will be on the agency's board of 
directors.
<P>
	Naturally, if the governor in council makes the appointments, it 
will not be on the basis of competence. It will most likely be on the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7506"> 7506 </A></B>
<P>
basis of colour. Blue will be  put to one side in order to intensify the 
red. This is what is likely to happen.
<P>
	The Liberals' palette of colours is very limited: it is red, red, red. 
In all likelihood, we will end up with a president appointed by the 
governor in council, that is, cabinet-a red president and a red 
vice-president. And the rest follows. Then there is an advisory 
board. The bill provides, furthermore, that the president will 
choose the employees.
<P>
<B>(1025)</B>
<P>
	Once again, the red chain forms. The president and the 
vice-president are appointed by cabinet. When the president goes 
to hire, what will the first question be: What party do you belong 
to? Competence is being set aside along with working conditions. 
The aims of the Bloc Quebecois' amendments are to bring this bill 
a little more into line and make it a little less arbitrary.
<P>
	It is also the aim of the unions to put an end to employer tyranny. 
In this case, the employer is the federal government, and things are 
going even further. The public service is being set aside so that now 
appointments will be almost political.
<P>
	Therefore, the amendments proposed by the Bloc are essential. I 
would ask the Liberal ministers and members on the other side of 
the House to better co-ordinate their words and their actions. We in 
the Bloc are fed up with hearing them say: ``We are the workers' 
good friends''. However, in action, in the legislative agenda and in 
fact, they are not the workers' friends. The very opposite is true.
<P>
	I think the workers' friends are on this side of the House, and not 
the other, and this is why we are making amendments that will add 
an element of civility to the inspection and that will ensure the 
agency is not appointed by the governor in council and cabinet. We 
do not want the agency to be all red. We want a competent agency, 
which is the reason for the amendments by the Bloc Quebecois. I 
hope the government will listen to reason on this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, to the 
hon. members who are surprised to see me speak on this issue, I 
should point out that there are several reasons for my doing so, 
particularly the fact that, as a child, I lived next door to a 
slaughterhouse. As was customary at the time, during the summer, 
the doors were open and the work was performed in front of us 
kids. We would watch operations with great curiosity, sometimes 
with awe and other feelings I will not get into. It was a small 
operation and, in those days, the workers cared about the health of 
their customers, their fellow citizens.
<P>
	Times have changed and, today, slaughterhouses are fairly large 
operations owned by very large corporations that may or may not 
be as acutely aware of their impact on public health today and in 
the future.
<P>
	First of all, we could look at why the federal government had to 
get involved when Quebec had already taken its responsibilities. 
There is a certain sensitivity because of what was called the tainted 
meat scandal, which set off a public scare that lasted several 
months. It is clear that, over this whole issue of ensuring meat 
quality and making sure it is properly handled, there is, in Quebec, 
a sensitivity that could certainly be described as distinct and which 
explains why this issue is important to the Bloc.
<P>
	We have every reason to be extremely concerned when we see in 
Group No. 6-and that is why we are proposing amendments to the 
contrary-that the agency is excluded from the Public Service of 
Canada Act and that the regulations under which the independence 
of inspectors used to be guaranteed will be twisted around and, 
contrary to what our colleagues are saying, they are very likely to 
be strongly profit-driven.
<P>
<B>(1030)</B>
<P>
	Inspections in any area, be it occupational health and safety or 
public health, require that those who conduct them on our behalf be 
assured they are totally and completely free to do what they have to 
do when stocks must be rejected or when meat or any by-product 
that does not meat quality requirements must be destroyed. As a 
result, someone who is hired for a fixed term of service and does 
not have the full protection that a collective agreement should 
provide in this respect would be likely to give in to direct and 
indirect pressure.
<P>
	This is a very serious matter. Because it is debated at the end of 
the session, some people may think it is a minor matter. It is not. 
Just think of the tragedy that struck England. I am not suggesting 
that is the way we are headed, I am simply saying that the quality of 
the job done in inspecting meat and of the procedures used in 
slaughterhouses is closely linked to health and that health is not an 
area in which we can afford to take chances.
<P>
	I hope members opposite will vote with us to guarantee this 
indispensable independence for those who conduct inspections. 
This means that inspectors cannot be removed, or be the object of 
monetary or other forms of pressure. Their work is already difficult 
because of a possible self-censorship in these hard times.
<P>
	Therefore, it is extremely important that the amendments 
proposed by the Bloc Quebecois be accepted, that common sense 
prevail, and that members opposite realize that, while it may not 
have affected the other provinces, Quebec-perhaps because of its 
history and even culture-went through a particular experience 
with the issue of raw milk cheese, which is why we would like to 
have control over the inspection of meat but, if this is not possible, 
we want to at least make sure inspectors can enjoy such 
independence. In our opinion, this implies that they be protected by 
iron-clad collective agreements.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7507"> 7507 </A></B>
<P>
	Members of this House should realize that this is clearly a case 
where it would be a definite asset to have job security, grievance 
rights, and the guarantee of working without being hassled. This 
is a plus that must be protected by the party in office, otherwise 
it will be responsible for the major inconveniences that could 
result. Since we would be the ones paying for these 
inconveniences, we urge the party in office to support our 
agreements.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to speak today to the Bloc Quebecois's 
amendments to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency Act, because 
the Liberals seem to have nothing to say about this bill.
<P>
<B>(1035)</B>
<P>
	Why is this? Because they have a short term vision. They are 
prepared to set aside Canada's reputation in the food inspection 
sector in order to be able to appoint their friends to the good 
positions and to control the entire staffing process. Since this 
government is unable to create jobs, it feels it must at least find 
some way of hiring its friends and dispensing a bit of patronage.
<P>
	That is why the Liberals have nothing to say today. Nobody is 
rising to speak on the Liberal majority side. We do not hear a peep 
out of them. We do not know whether they have anything to say in 
defence of their bill.
<P>
	I would also like to say that, in the area of food inspection, it is 
very important that the people who will be working for the 
proposed agency be completely free of all forms of influence.
<P>
	There are large companies that are major stakeholders in the 
food sector and that are in a position to influence political parties, 
so it is very important to ensure that the agency will be 
independent. When inspectors do their rounds and make decisions, 
they must be able to do so with full knowledge of the facts and 
without undue influence.
<P>
	The way political parties are funded in Canada, with large 
companies like Canada Packers being allowed to make 
contributions of $10,000, $20,000 or $50,000, when the time 
comes to declare a facility unsanitary, the telephones may well start 
ringing.
<P>
	If the agency is not independent of the government because its 
president has been appointed by the government, there is a chance 
that inspectors may be prevented from doing their work properly. 
There will be the same kind of difficulties as in the past.
<P>
	It is already very difficult in the present context to do this work. I 
recognize the quality of the people working in this difficult field. 
Some things have important economic impacts. Let us get our act 
together now so as not to add the additional burden of political 
partisanship that the government's bill is paving the way for. When 
the time comes to make appointments to the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency, some difficult choices will be compounded by 
having to consider the political affiliation of candidates.
<P>
	We have already seen this sort of thing with other boards, in 
other sectors such as immigration, and parole. A number of years 
ago, people were appointed to positions simply because of their 
political affiliation. This always creates problems, because 
sometimes the calibre of decisions made is adversely affected.
<P>
	Let us recall some things that have happened in the past. It would 
perhaps be a good thing for the government to look into the Bloc 
Quebecois amendment to clause 93 more thoroughly. The purpose 
of this amendment is to prevent the act from coming into force 
until a code of conduct and ethics to govern the appointment of 
employees by the Agency has been prepared jointly by the unions 
and the Department of Agriculture and Agri-Food. In this way, the 
rules of the game would be very clear and public, and no political 
interference with the appointment of employees would be possible.
<P>
	The objective is to do away, for once and for all, with the 
patronage which could very easily set in within this agency, given 
the pyramid of appointments set out in the bill. I believe that the 
appointments set out in the bill for the management of the agency 
make this bill sufficiently partisan already. Now they want to take 
away the employees' present autonomy and independence which 
help build Canada's reputation in the area of food inspection.
<P>
	Although inspectors may sometimes be perceived as a little 
inflexible, they are gaining a reputation for quality and honesty. 
The government is taking a backward step by sacrificing, not 
necessarily to privatization, but also by trying to lay a path to 
enable it to appoint people just about everywhere.
<P>
	If the act is adopted as it stands, I predict that Canada's food 
inspection system will have taken on a new image before 10 years 
have passed. Things will be like they used to be before with the 
harbourmaster appointments. Food inspection appointments will 
be the same. We will see a return to the old system, where 
everybody in the agency changes when the government changes.
<P>
<B>(1040)</B>
<P>
	This kind of situation is entirely inappropriate in an area like 
food inspection, where we need some degree of independence and a 
reputation for quality. Decisions must be made sensibly and 
objectively, not based on the political affiliation of the appointee.
<P>
	In a way, this would be very insulting to those who have 
performed these duties in the past. The bill provides no guarantee 
that incumbents who have performed their duties for 10, 15 or 20 
years with the utmost competence will keep their positions. A 
choice will be made, and  since there are no objective criteria, we 
have no guarantee that in the process, this will not be an occasion to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7508"> 7508 </A></B>
<P>
settle old grievances, as has been known to happen in the past in 
certain organizations.
<P>
	Granted, this could also be an opportunity to get rid of people 
who are perhaps less qualified, but some very competent people 
could be ousted as well. In the inspection field, someone who does 
his job conscientiously, as well as his immediate superiors, may be 
subject to all kinds of pressure. If he has job security, if he has a 
guarantee that his job will not be on the line whenever he makes a 
decision, he will do a much better job and stand up for the 
consumer, for those who in the end will purchase the products.
<P>
	In my opinion, this bill to establish the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency is based on a principle that may be attractive to 
federalists, and I am referring to the fact that instead of the three 
intervenors we had in the past, the government finally decided to 
keep only one, but it overlooked one thing. The provinces already 
have their own food inspection systems. And as we saw in the case 
of raw milk cheese, there are also a number of cultural differences 
between the various parts of Canada.
<P>
	I mentioned another example connected with food inspection, 
when a disease is found in a herd of cattle or sheep or whatever. In 
the past, and this applied to sheep, all animals liable to contract the 
disease were slaughtered. This worked very well in Quebec, where 
herds of sheep consist of around 200 or 300 head. The practice, the 
regulations were changed a year and a half ago, following 
representations by producers in western Canada. This is 
understandable, because they have thousands of animals in each 
herd.
<P>
	However, now they use quarantine. If a producer has 200 or 300 
animals, putting them in quarantine is the equivalent of killing his 
business. Is there no way to give the provinces jurisdiction in such 
cases, because respecting the jurisdiction of the provinces would 
make for an inspection system that would reflect local economic 
conditions.
<P>
	The same applies to the fisheries. There is no single rule that 
works for all Canada-wide systems. We have always found that 
``wall to wall'' does not give satisfactory results. Now, when you 
add the variable-the possibility of political patronage, political 
influence in decisions-the regulations and the operating standards 
will become very malleable. This cannot be if we are to ensure that 
food is properly inspected in Canada in the future.
<P>
	Let us return to the underlying principles. Yes, let us try to 
reduce the number of people involved. Yes, let us respect 
provincial jurisdiction. However, most importantly, let us give 
those who have to do the job room to manoeuvre, enough 
autonomy to make the right choices and to stand up to business 
when they have to intervene so that, in the end, in five or ten years, 
Quebec's and Canada's food inspection system will continue to be 
recognized internationally as one of the best in the world. In a 
world where the scope of exports continues to grow, we must avoid 
running the risk of crises or harming our producers in a few years' 
time.
<P>
	The winners are the producers and the consumers if inspectors 
are autonomous in their decisions. I invite the Liberal majority, 
which is silent this morning, to listen to our arguments and to 
accept these amendments, particularly the one I was defending.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have been listening to the speeches by my hon. 
colleagues with great interest. It is becoming clear to me that this is 
an issue of great concern to all members of the official opposition, 
the Bloc Quebecois, whether they come from a rural riding or an 
urban riding on the island of Montreal, like the hon. member sitting 
next to me. This is an issue of great concern not only to the people 
of Quebec, but also to everyone in English Canada.
<P>
<B>(1045)</B>
<P>
	As far as I am concerned, this is a bill I followed closely 
because, as you probably know, the riding of Berthier-Montcalm 
is a major producer of poultry, quails, ducks and pork. There are 
therefore many slaughterhouses in our riding and this industry is 
very important for the riding.
<P>
	Just recently, in my capacity as the federal member for my 
riding, I have had to fight quite hard to keep some slaughterhouses 
open and particularly to have the one in Saint-Esprit reopened. I am 
sure that you will see no objection to my saluting at this time the 
people who have fought to have this slaughterhouse reopened and I 
thank them because, as a result, 120 jobs were created and 
investments amounting to some $7 million were made in the riding 
of Berthier-Montcalm, all of this thanks to the support of the 
community, the investors and the pork producers of the Lanaudière 
region.
<P>
	That being said, I gave these figures to show how important this 
industry is, in Quebec in particular, because Quebec is a major 
processor of raw material, be it the raw milk we have heard about 
on the hill, poultry or pork. It is therefore very important to us to 
have a bill dealing specifically with this industry, that meets the 
specific, or distinct, needs of Quebecers. There too lies our 
distinctiveness.
<P>
	Unfortunately, I must say that Bill C-60 before us this morning 
does not meet these objectives. I think this bill will not meet the 
government's objective of facilitating the development of this 
industry. Worse yet, it does not give any guarantee concerning the 
whole inspection process. When there is no guarantee, one may be 
less tempted to invest money. If the changes made to the rules of 
the game are not very clear initially, investors will start asking 
questions, especially in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7509"> 7509 </A></B>
<P>
	Again in this area, Quebec is a distinct society, since we already 
have a complete food inspection organization. The Government 
of Quebec unified this whole field. If the Government of Canada 
had followed through with the resolutions that were passed here 
in this House, it would have done something about this. The 
government, and especially the Prime Minister and the Deputy 
Prime Minister, often remind us that a resolution was passed in 
this House to recognize Quebec's distinctiveness. We in the 
opposition say that this resolution was nothing but a smoke screen, 
that it gives Quebec no additional jurisdiction and means nothing 
to Quebecers.
<P>
	The subject matter of this bill is really quite mundane. Food 
inspection is not nearly as important as constitutional 
matters-which does not mean it is not important. This bill should 
have reflected the government's resolution recognizing Quebec's 
distinctiveness, if it meant something, but it does not mean 
anything. There is nothing in it to prove otherwise. This resolution 
does not mean anything. Had it meant something, the bill we are 
studying this morning would have contained a whole chapter 
specifically for Quebec, as our distinctiveness extends to the food 
inspection area. But the government did not do anything because 
the resolution it adopted does not mean anything, and we will have 
to remember that.
<P>
	That being said, the group of amendments introduced by the 
Bloc Quebecois is aimed at preventing patronage. Unfortunately, 
``patronage'' and ``Liberal'' seem to be synonymous. After 
condemning the Conservatives during the 1993 election campaign, 
what are the Liberals doing today? The exact same thing.
<P>
<B>(1050)</B>
<P>
	Perhaps the only difference-one must render unto Caesar what 
belongs to Caesar-is that they may be doing it more intelligently 
than the Conservatives. They hide what they are doing. They work 
behind the scene. They give themselves nice little tailor-made laws 
to disguise patronage. This is a case in point. Listen to this: the 
government reserves the option to appoint the vice-chairman and 
the 12 people who will sit on the committee. It is the government 
that will decide who to appoint according to criteria about which 
we know nothing so far.
<P>
	Furthermore, nothing in the bill guarantees that the current 
inspectors, who are doing a good job and seeing to the quality of 
products offered to consumers, will be hired by the agency. If they 
contribute to the coffers of the Liberal Party, maybe they will have 
a better chance of working for the agency. This is what the 
government is doing under the cover of law to ease their 
conscience. But one needs to review this in detail in order to 
understand.
<P>
	We, in the Bloc Quebecois, are open in the way we collect the 
funds for our election campaigns, in the way we get our 
funding-since it is public funding, we are  open, we show our 
books, we have nothing to hide-and we would like the 
government to do the same in its laws regarding staffing in order to 
avoid patronage and especially to force them to honour some of the 
commitments in the famous red book.
<P>
	During the 1993 election campaign-you may not remember it, 
Mr. Speaker, the government may not remember it either-there 
were promises of transparency, integrity, ethics, non partisan 
politics, appointments according to predetermined criteria, should 
the Liberals form the next government.
<P>
	Today, we are giving them the opportunity to be consistent for 
the first time in three years-it should not be too much to ask-and 
support the amendments we are proposing since in fact the thrust of 
these amendments is transparency. I am referring to Motions Nos 
18 and 36 moved by Bloc Quebecois agriculture critic, the member 
for Frontenac, seconded by a member who has his constituents' 
interests at heart, I mean the member for 
Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup.
<P>
	It might be worth reading them so that people who are listening 
can see that what we are proposing makes sense, and that the 
Liberal government is breaking another one of its election 
promises, in terms of transparency this time. We are asking the 
government to include the following requirement in the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>One year after the Agency is established, the President shall provide, for study, to 
such committee of the House of commons as is designated or established to consider 
agricultural matters, a detailed report respecting the criteria used in making 
appointments under subsection (1).</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We want the government to clearly state the criteria used to hire 
employees. We want a level playing field for everyone, be it a 
member of the Liberal Party of Canada or not. Is this clear enough, 
is it not?
<P>
	I believe the Liberal government should support this 
amendment. I believe the government opposite will pass this 
amendment, if it wants to follow through on its famous red book's 
promise of transparency. No doubt it slipped their mind. I am sure 
the government simply forgot to include such a provision, as it 
happens sometimes at the last minute when bills are being 
prepared. We are giving them the opportunity to keep their own 
election promises by supporting this amendment.
<P>
	The other amendment is similar. Its purpose is the same: equal 
opportunity for everybody who might want a job in the agency and 
all the inspectors or employees already working for that 
department.
<P>
<B>(1055)</B>
<P>
	I see my time is up. It goes by so fast. I will speak to the other 
groups later on because, as I said earlier, this is a subject of great 
concern for me, given its importance for my constituents.

statements by members. This means I will rise again after oral 
question period, but I want to start dealing with the amendments 
moved by the Bloc Quebecois on clause 16, which in fact is Group 
No. 7 of amendments to Bill C-60.
<P>
	As my colleagues have been saying since we started our 
speeches, we see there is a guiding principle behind this bill, which 
is the establishment of an iron-clad patronage system. We will be 
able to show this also with clause 16, which will ensure the creation 
of an agency that will have lost all its credibility even before it is 
set up. People will not trust the work done by the employees of this 
agency. Who will be the real losers in this bad decision based only 
on political partisanship? It will be the people in general, because, 
if we do not trust the work done by the agency's employees, we will 
not trust the inspection and this will have disastrous consequences.
<P>
	The real question we must ask at this stage is whether the Bloc 
Quebecois' concern I just mentioned is also a concern among the 
people.
<P>
	Let me say that I am very proud of my colleagues from different 
ridings, urban ones, such as the hon. member for Mercier, who just 
spoke to this bill, semi-urban ones, such as my colleague from 
Saint-Jean, or rural ones like my own. I am thinking more 
specifically of the hon. member for Richelieu, who is known to be 
close to his constituents. If there is a member in this House whom 
we can say is close to people, it is the member for Richelieu.
<P>
	You are indicating that my time is running out, Mr. Speaker. I 
will conclude and resume after question period.
<P>
	But allow me finish what I was saying in praise of the member 
for Richelieu. I was saying he is close to people, he is even perhaps 
the equivalent of the worker-priest in Montreal, a few years ago, 
who drove a taxi and whom we used to call ``the Good Lord in a 
taxi''. Using the example of the Montreal ``Good Lord in a taxi'', 
we could say the hon. member for Richelieu is Mr. Democracy. If a 
member like my colleague from Richelieu condemns this bill, it is 
because the whole population of Quebec is condemning it.

<P>
	The festival is a spectacular display of lights along the banks of 
Sydenham River in the heart of the city in celebration of Christmas 
and the holiday season.
<P>
	This year the festival has been been expanded to reach the inner 
harbour and now includes two ferry boats, the <I>Cheecheeman</I> and 
the <I>Nindayama</I>. The boats and trees along the harbour and river 
banks are trimmed with Christmas lights which shimmer and are 
reflected in the inner harbour waters.
<P>
	The Northern Lights Festival is a volunteer effort that is 
generously supported by businesses and the people from Owen 
Sound and the surrounding area. It is a major tourist attraction 
drawing busloads of people from Bruce-Grey and all of

<P>
	I congratulate all the volunteers and participants who have made 
this project such a success. The lights symbolize their hard work

the Environment wants to be one of those assorted chocolates. His 
legislation may look okay, but watch out for the inside.
<P>
	This past Tuesday the environment minister refused to commit 
to conducting a full environmental assessment of the proposed 
testing of U.S. plutonium in the Candu reactors even though he is 
required to do so under his own Canadian Environmental 
Assessment Act. As the law states, an environmental assessment is 
required if a federal authority gets involved. He said we should be 
cautious about plutonium but yesterday his party voted against a 
Reform Party bill that would ban the importation of nuclear waste 
into Canada.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made an election promise to abolish the 
GST, then broke faith. The environment minister promised to 
<P>

protect the environment, and then  he does not act. The minister is 
great at introducing legislation, but then he will not use the law.

the Prime Minister appointed Lise Thibault lieutenant governor of 
Quebec.
<P>
	A motion was passed by the Quebec National Assembly 
requesting more of a say in the appointment of the lieutenant 
governor, but the Prime Minister chose to ignore it. Once again, the 
Prime Minister of Canada is giving us an example of decentralized 
federalism at its best.
<P>
	Let it be clear that the Bloc Quebecois wants the position of 
lieutenant governor to disappear, along with the Senate. The Bloc 
Quebecois regards both of these as unnecessary, expensive and 
outdated, a throwback to the colonial era.
<P>
	These remarks concerning the function of lieutenant governor in 
no way reflect on the dignity and great worth of Mrs. Thibault as a

	<B>Mr. Vic Althouse (Mackenzie, NDP):</B> Mr. Speaker, four million 
people use passenger rail service each year in Canada. They do so 
because it is fast, efficient, curtails pollution and saves jobs.
<P>
	Many of these four million people have sent small cards to the 
government stating their wish for rail service to continue to be one 
of their transportation options. Today I carried about 150 pounds of 
these small cards to the Prime Minister's office to let him know of 
their interest and intent.
<P>
	I note that the red book spoke of implementing an infrastructure 
investment program. Some railway people have produced position 
papers showing that high speed rail, at speeds in excess of 300 
kilometres an hour, is technically feasible since Canadian 
companies are bidding on French and American contracts. High 
speed rail could also improve air quality, public safety and is 
economically and financially feasible.

Protection Act known as CEPA.
<P>
	One of the key elements of this new legislation is a stronger 
emphasis on prevention, as the minister himself said, on being 
proactive rather than reactive when it comes to reducing pollution 
and controlling toxic substances.
<P>
	As members know, Canada is known the world over for its 
natural beauty and vast green areas. Canadians do not want this 
reputation tarnished. The increased focus on prevention contained

yesterday that Radio Canada International was granted a last 
minute reprieve for another year.
<P>
	Recently, in Ottawa, the Minister of Foreign Affairs addressed a 
group of people involved in foreign policy and in the 
communications and computer industries. The minister then 
proposed an international information strategy to allow Canada to 
exert a political, economic and cultural influence in the context of 
globalization.
<P>
	The government is making the broadcast of Canadian culture and 
values a priority in its foreign policy. According to the minister, we 
must find a way to put our new technologies and expertise at the 
service of our country abroad, and to promote Canada throughout 
the world.
<P>
	However, some consistency is required. If we are to keep open 
Canada's window on the world, it is essential to ensure the long 
term survival of Radio Canada International.

	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the Prime Minister has had to face some sharp criticism 
this week, not just in the House, but also during a television 
broadcast, in the course of which he was questioned by members of 
the public. They reminded the Prime Minister that, during the last 
election campaign, he had promised to scrap the GST, something 
he denied. But the Prime Minister was seen and heard on Toronto's 
CFRB in August 1993 saying, and I quote: ``Yes, I will scrap the 
GST''.
<P>
	Will the Deputy Prime Minister finally admit that the Prime 
Minister made such a statement, so that we are not forced to 
conclude that some look-alike played a dirty trick on him, because 
we all know that the Prime Minister definitely did not tell a lie?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the member is quoting from an interview given by the 
Prime Minister on CFRB on August 26. I would like to put the 
quotation in context by giving it in its entirety.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	He said: ``Yes, I will abolish it, but I need the money. It is taking 
$15 billion and I will have to collect another $15 billion. So you go 
and sit down in a very civilized way and say to the provinces that 
the poor small businesses have items with federal tax, other items 
with provincial tax, or both, or sometimes none. So we have to 
clean up that mess and produce $15 billion''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I think the member should at least be honest enough to quote the 
Prime Minister in context.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the most honest people are the ones capable of supplying 
their own answers to questions put to them, instead of relying on a 
finance minister who admitted to having made an honest mistake.
<P>
	The Prime Minister did not conduct the last election campaign 
on his own. He did it with a team, which was elected with a 
majority, except in Quebec. The Minister of Finance admitted that 
it was an honest mistake; the Deputy Prime Minister resigned 
because she thought she had understood, along with many other 
people, that the Prime Minister had promised to scrap the GST, and 
this was the Minister of Finance's understanding as well, because 
he said it was an honest mistake. If that was not his understanding, 
there is an inconsistency, because he said it was a mistake. So, this 
whole business is certainly confusing.
<P>
	How can the Deputy Prime Minister explain that the Minister of 
Finance said that it was an honest mistake, that she resigned, that 
everyone understood the same thing, except the Prime Minister, 
who claims he did not say, or did not think he said that? We would 
like to understand these three versions, his version, her version and 
the version of the gentleman who is not answering this morning.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the member is well aware that, when I made the statement here in 
the House, I did so for the government.
<P>
<B>(1120)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, that is an even bigger problem.
<P>
	I am pleased to hear the Minister of Finance, who speaks on 
behalf of the government, being so honest, but those of us who took 
Politics 101 always understood that the Prime Minister was part of 
the government. He is therefore speaking on behalf of the Prime 
Minister if he is speaking on behalf of the government. He is 
therefore saying, on behalf of the Prime Minister: ``It was an 
honest mistake''. That is not what the Prime Minister is saying. The 
more versions we hear, the less we understand. You need a strong 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7515"> 7515 </A></B>
<P>
ego to be in politics. Every politician knows this, but what you 
really need most is a very large amount of humility.
<P>
	Would the Finance Minister promise to advise the Prime 
Minister to show a little more humility, and above all, to have the 
wisdom to admit his mistake, honest or not?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
repeat.
<P>
	Here in this House-and the Prime Minister happened to be 
here- I was speaking for the government. When a minister speaks 
in the House, he does so for the government. I gave the 
circumstances, and I made the statement.
<P>
	Once again, I think that we should look at what the Prime 
Minister said during the election campaign, even in the interview 
cited by the member. The Prime Minister said, in English:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We will look at other alternatives. All sorts of systems are being 
proposed. We wanted to take the time to sit down with the 
provinces. That is what we did. We wanted to listen to business 
people. That is what we did. We wanted to listen to citizens. That is 
what the Prime Minister said and that is what we did.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	That is what we did. The House finance committee took two and 
a half years to look at 20 options. In the end, they heard from small 
and medium size businesses, those that create the most jobs, and 
we did what they wanted to do, which was to institute a process for 
creating a harmonized tax, which is much simpler and more 
effective when it comes to job creation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do indeed have a big problem, as my colleague, the 
hon. member for Laurier-Sainte-Marie has pointed out, because 
the Minister of Finance and the Prime Minister are both members 
of the same government, claim to speak on behalf of the 
government, but are not saying the same things. We are in trouble 
here, it makes no sense.
<P>
	During the 1993 campaign, the Prime Minister said, and I quote, 
``We will scrap the GST''. Yet this week he informs us that 
``scrap'', when translated into French, becomes 
``harmoniser''-harmonize.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Can he explain to us 
why it will cost the federal government $1 billion to scrap the GST 
in the maritimes, when harmonizing it in Quebec cost him nothing?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member is well aware that, when fundamental changes 
occur in a province or in a region of the country, it is the 
responsibility, the duty, of the federal government to help that 
province or region to  adjust. We have, moreover, done just that on 
many occasions for Quebec. We have done so on many occasions 
for the western provinces.
<P>
	We made an offer to the provinces which would have sustained a 
loss of revenue as a result of harmonization. We offered to help 
those provinces. The ones eligible were the Atlantic provinces, 
Manitoba and Saskatchewan. The provinces which were not 
eligible under the criteria were Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and 
British Columbia. The three Atlantic provinces accepted the offer.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it really takes a lot of courage for the Minister of Finance 
to defend the totally undefendable position of the Prime Minister. 
He has my total admiration.
<P>
	In another vein, we were speaking of the provinces just now. 
According to Quebec Minister of Finance Bernard Landry, Quebec 
would be entitled to $2 billion in compensation for harmonizing its 
sales tax with the federal GST.
<P>
	Will the Minister of Finance respond favourably to Quebec's 
demand for compensation, or will he give Quebecers proof that 
they are left footing the bill for a bad campaign promise?
<P>
<B>(1125)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
have already responded to the hon. member's question, and I have 
already responded to Mr. Landry: we have offered compensation to 
the provinces which sustained losses. Quebec did not. Ontario will 
not. The same goes for Alberta and British Columbia.
<P>
	I do not think the hon. member would want me to offer 
compensation to provinces which did not sustain a loss. That would 
make no sense.

	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
dancing gives new meaning to the words revenue neutral. I cannot 
believe what I am hearing today.
<P>
	``Scrap, kill and abolish the GST''. That is what the Prime 
Minister promised Canadians in the last election. That is he 
promised the House Commons in May 1994 and that is what he 
promised his own caucus evidently. We have the tapes and the tapes 
do not lie. Now we have the eye witness account and proof from the 
member for York South-Weston.
<P>
	I ask this question once again because we still do not have an 
answer. Will the Prime Minister admit that he broke it and he blew 
it? Fess up.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
every time I heard the Prime Minister deal with the question of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7516"> 7516 </A></B>
<P>
GST, he put it within the context of a  government that was unable 
to give up $15 billion in revenue.
<P>
	The Prime Minister made it very clear it was crucial to sit down 
with the provinces and come up with a simplified system that 
would work. What the Prime Minister said was what this 
government did.
<P>
	It put in place a House of Commons finance committee that went 
across the country for two and one-half years. It looked at 20 
alternatives. At the end of the piece those who were creating jobs, 
the small and medium size business community, said to us: ``We 
would like to see a harmonized tax. We want to see one tax auditor, 
one set of tax forms''.
<P>
	This government wants to create jobs, unlike the myth on the 
other side. Basically that is what the small and medium sized 
business community did and gave us a tax system that is going to 
work.
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think 
it has been proved time and time again that the tax system is not 
working. This minister has a nerve to try to blame this on the 
provinces. It is just unbelievable.
<P>
	This morning this same finance minister admitted to the Press 
Club that the Liberals may have promised more than they could 
actually deliver.
<P>
	The finance minister has apologized twice now. Even the Deputy 
Prime Minister has apologized once. What is the problem here? 
Can the Prime Minister not admit that he has some shortcomings? 
There is no great shame in that. Just say sorry.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think the Canadian people would like to know this. Members of the 
Reform Party were part of the finance committee that went across 
the country. They said they supported the harmonized tax. In fact 
Reform members said they would go beyond the harmonized tax 
and would tax food and drugs. We said we would not do that.
<P>
	How can the Reform Party stand up in the House and criticize the 
harmonized sales tax when it is part and parcel of its policies?
<P>
	<B>Miss Deborah Grey (Beaver River, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
minority report said quite clearly that Reform would balance the 
budget first. That is the first sentence in that report. That is the only 
way that we can offer Canadians tax relief, by balancing the budget 
first. Any government that brags about overspending $28 billion 
can hardly be proud of its accomplishments.
<P>
	The Prime Minister is the only person in this country who really 
believes that he did not promise to scrap, kill and abolish the GST. 
Life must be pretty nice for the Prime Minister in his imaginary 
world. It truly is a magic kingdom.
<P>
	The finance minister has admitted that he has made a mistake. 
The Deputy Prime Minister also did that. Why can the Prime
<P>
Minister not just swallow his pride and spit out his foot and simply 
say sorry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as 
are most other industrial countries, Canada is going through 
fundamental economic change as a result of the technological 
evolution. As a result of the interdependence of global trade, as a 
country we are doing very well.
<P>
	The House of Commons ought to be debating the fundamental 
issues of the day, yet what do we hear day after day? Reform Party 
members stand up, totally disconnected from the reality of the 
Canadian people and engage in personal attacks. They attack 
minister after minister, member after member, because they are 
unable to deal with the issues that concern Canadians.
<P>
	Canadians want to talk about unemployment and how they can 
get back to work. What Canadians want to talk about is the 
preservation of their social programs. When will the Reform Party 
wake up and smell the roses and understand that Canadians want 
the House to deal with their problems?

	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the minister responsible for the space 
agency.
<P>
	Obviously things are out of kilter at the space agency. The 
vice-president and financial comptroller was let go for doing his 
job, because he criticized the dubious practices of senior 
management of one of Canada's major research institutes. The 
minister is taking the word only of those primarily involved, those 
who are the subject of the allegations, in his inquiry where he 
concluded that nothing happened.
<P>
	How can the minister responsible for the space agency claim that 
he fully investigated the allegations made by Mr. Rinaldi, the 
former vice-president and financial comptroller, when he did not 
even take the time to meet this person, who was dismissed for 
refusing to countenance fraud.
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the question is based on false allegations. In any case, 
public servants throughout the Government of Canada have lost 
their jobs because of budget cuts.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7517"> 7517 </A></B>
<P>
	Some of them, no doubt, consider it unfair that they lost their 
jobs. Some, including Mr. Rinaldi, have lodged a complaint 
against the government. The court will decide if he is right or not. 
I am not prepared to meet with every public servant who wants 
to make a complaint.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I think the minister responsible for the space agency 
would do well to consult his former colleague at national defence, 
because his scenario is strikingly similar to what he did, to the 
cover up, and it could end up in the same place.
<P>
	Mr. Rinaldi was definitely dismissed. A year and a half ago, he 
filed a grievance. What did the government do? And why is Mr. 
Rinaldi in court? Because the government is dragging him to court 
to contest the arbitrator's jurisdiction. It will be a year and a half 
when the federal court finally decides on the jurisdiction of the 
grievance arbitrator. There are neverthess limits to misleading the 
public, Mr. Minister. You are pretending arrogantly you do not 
understand-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> The hon. member knows 
full well she must address her remarks to the Chair.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, we know where arrogance leads, 
do we not? How can the minister go on protecting his former 
adviser, who has now become the president of the space agency, 
when, if he assumed his responsibilities, he would call for an 
outside inquiry to bring to light all these serious allegations 
regarding the president of the space agency and his executive 
vice-president, Mr. Desfossés?

<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Minister for the 
Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Minister of Western 
Economic Diversification and Minister responsible for the 
Federal Office of Regional Development-Quebec, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us understand what the Bloc is asking here.
<P>
	As I recall over a number of days of questions, it has asked for a 
public inquiry on three issues. Bloc members complain that a 
secretary tore up hand written notes after she had transcribed them 
on a typewriter.
<P>
	They complain that Mr. Evans submitted a travel expense claim 
of $116 when he travelled by automobile from Saint-Hubert to 
Ottawa, although the amount was never paid to him.
<P>
	They complain of an amount of just over $500 which was paid to 
a former employee of the space agency who later became employed 
as a political assistant in my office. When the issue was raised it 
was debatable. Therefore, the individual in question, out of an 
abundance of caution, repaid the money without any pressure other 
than the question having been raised.
<P>
<B>(1135)</B>
<P>
	These are the issues on which they wish to have a public inquiry. 
What is really happening here is that these people are using the 
House of Commons as a place in which to prosecute a claim which 
ought to be dealt with by the civil courts.
<P>
	I do not know why they think an issue that could be raised in the 
courts is a one-sided issue. For my part I am quite anxious to hear 
the evidence presented in court and to see what the courts decide. 
However, in terms of the allegations that have been brought 
forward, there is no substance based on which I could take any 
other action than let the courts decide. I would encourage them to 
do likewise.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we are not talking about GST, HST or BST, although the 
government might be talking about a lot of BS. The real issue here 
is the truth. The fundamental issue, in answer to the finance 
minister, is a broken promise. Maybe the Prime Minister should go 
visit a bank machine. It seemed to have done the trick for the 
Deputy Prime Minister. She admitted that the government had 
broken its GST promise.
<P>
	The finance minister admitted in April and again this morning at 
the press club that the government had made a mistake with its 
GST promise.
<P>
	I ask the government why the Prime Minister does not join with 
his colleagues and admit that he made a mistake when he promised 
Canadians he would abolish the GST?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the context in which the Prime Minister made his statements is 
very clear and a matter of record. They make it clear that the 
government was unable to give up the $15 billion to $18 billion of 
revenue.
<P>
	The fundamental issue is the nature of the public debate within 
this House. Somebody, for whom I have an enormous amount of 
respect, once told me that when one enters politics and it comes 
down to the basic decision of what is good for the country, if there 
is any difference between that and what is politically right then 
integrity is doing what is good for the country.
<P>
	My colleagues of cabinet who are here and indeed those who are 
in caucus know full well that at the very first cabinet meeting we 
had, the first thing the Prime Minister said to all of us was that in 
any individual instance if a choice has to be made between what is 
politically right and what is right for the country we will choose 
what is right for the country in every single instance. In cabinet, the 
Prime Minister has chosen to do the right thing. I will tell members 
right now that he is a man of great-

<P>
	This is not the 1960s. The Prime Minister should quit living in 
the past. He should be aware that we are now in the 1990s and 
technology has produced something called videotapes. By now, 
almost every Canadian has seen those tapes. They know in what 
context that promise was made before and during the election 
campaign.

How will he continue to deny the evidence of his broken promise?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have stood in this House on behalf of the government and made a 
statement. That statement speaks for all of us.
<P>
	If the hon. member wants to talk about contradictions, perhaps 
he would tell us why it is that in the most recent discovery of the 
need to create jobs in this country by the leader of the Reform Party 
and his party, he has been able to deny the fact that in 1993 in 
Penticton, the Reform Party brought down a program. At that time 
the leader of the Reform Party had no difficulty saying that it would 
cost jobs but jobs were not as important as cleaning up the deficit. 
How is the Reform Party going to deal with the fact that in its 1995 
taxpayers' budget it said that the short term employment impact of 
spending and deficit reduction was negative but manageable? What 
kind of job loss is manageable? Is it 30,000? Is it 50,000? Is it

<P>
	The Minister of Human Resources Development is jubilant, 
every time he talks about negotiating active employment measures 
with the provinces and the flexibility of federalism. When 
confronted with the figures of his own department, which show that 
between 1993-94 and 1996-97, Quebec suffered major cuts 
totalling $160 million in funding for active measures, the minister 
denies this.
<P>
	Is the Deputy Prime Minister in a position to confirm whether or 
not the federal government proceeded with cuts of around $160 
million in all active measures in Quebec alone between 1993-94 
and 1996-97?

	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

is what will be the active measures for the province of Quebec.

province of Quebec at this moment with respect to part II of the EI

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. 
member certainly did not understand the question. My question 
concerns all moneys spent on active employment measures 
between 1993-94 and 1996-97, as indicated in the department's 
figures.
<P>
	I will to quote the Minister of Human Resources Development, 
who said this week: ``I am always shocked by the attitude of people 
who like to fiddle in around with this figure or that figure''.
<P>
	Will the minister finally admit that his own government has been 
fiddling with the figures, since the additional $800 million for 
active measures were drawn from the unemployment insurance 
fund, a procedure that actually camouflages a substantial drop in 
the amounts formerly spent on employment measures which came 
directly out of the consolidated fund?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Robert D. Nault (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Human Resources Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I can 
understand that the member is having difficulty understanding the 
finances of the Department of Human Resources Development. It 
is for one reason. She is looking at the old programs that the 
province of Quebec used to have.
<P>
	We have made significant changes in programs. Those 
significant changes, for example the EI legislation, have moved a 
lot of money over to active measures. An additional $800 million is 
going into active measures in the next number of years. That 
necessitates program shifting from one area to the other.
<P>
	We have also committed $300 million for TJF. The member 
knows that those particular dollars have been reallocated from 
other funds. If she is having trouble dealing with the numbers, she

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
what we see developing here is a very disturbing trend on behalf of 
the Prime Minister. At the town hall meeting the other night on the 
national unity strategy, in order to reassure a Quebecer who is 
concerned about the future of Quebec in Canada, he said that if 
things ever got really rough he could always move out.
<P>
	His solution today is a distinct society clause. In 1989 he 
opposed Meech Lake. He said this about the distinct society clause: 
``No matter how the supreme court interprets the distinct society 
clause, it would always make francophones or anglophones feel 
defrauded''.
<P>
<B>(1145 )</B>
<P>
	Why would the Prime Minister take a position on distinct society 
today that he once fought so vigorously against and why would he 
tell a Quebecer that if things get rough he can always just leave?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, unlike the politics of the 
Reform Party, the Prime Minister is actually fighting to keep the 
country together.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
have seen the trend. The Prime Minister has flip-flopped on the 
GST. He has created imaginary homeless friends. He has blamed 
things on acts of God. He also says that blind luck is the best job 
creator.
<P>
	Let us have a reality check here. In 1989 the Prime Minister had 
the audacity to call Brian Mulroney a liar for promoting the distinct 
society clause. He said that Mulroney was telling the French 
Canadians in Quebec ``it is the best thing you ever had'' and after 
that, he turns around to English Canada and says ``don't worry 
about it, it means nothing''.
<P>
	If the Prime Minister called Brian Mulroney a liar for promoting 
the distinct society clause, will he now admit that he is doing the 
same thing today?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Prime Minister is 
promoting, as he has all his life, a recognition that in this country 
we have two founding nations, two founding peoples, with 
languages, cultures and civil codes that were enshrined in the law.
<P>
	What is unfortunate in the position of the Reform Party is instead 
of looking at where we came from, instead of understanding the 
reason we are where we are today is that we have a history of 
shared consciousness  and a history of shared commitment, what 
the Reform Party is trying to do with its politics of division will 
drive this country apart.

<P>
	Can the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans explain to the House

What is being done to ensure that all interested parties will be

<P>
	<B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, partnering is a new way of doing business in the 
fishing industry whereby the fishers will have a greater say and a 
greater share in the management of the fisheries itself.
<P>
	This is a responsibility they have been looking for more and 
more in the past. It will build on the success of our recent 
co-management agreements that we have had, the best example of 
which is the zone 19 crab agreement in Cape Breton.
<P>
	I see this provision, a major improvement in Bill C-62, the new 
fisheries act, as a tremendous opportunity for representative 
organizations and the industry to have a direct voice in fisheries 
management to develop ways to manage the fishery more 
effectively and efficiently and to provide a more stable climate for

stated: ``Until this matter is resolved, Revenue Canada will 
continue to apply sanctions such as vehicle seizures''.
<P>
	Is it the customs minister's opinion that her department has 
applied these sanctions and seizures equally on all farmers who 
have allegedly violated the customs and wheat board acts?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, customs administration in this country takes very 
seriously its responsibility to uphold several acts that are its 
responsibility.
<P>
	In this case we have been told and we are responsible to ensure 
that people who export barley and wheat across our borders have 
the appropriate permits. We consider that the job we have done is 
effective and precise in fulfilling our responsibilities.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, a Saskatchewan farmer indicated he would go public with 
information that Canadian Wheat Board officials made a deal with 
him, providing $223,000 in selection bonuses.
<P>
	Then Canada Customs filed $165,520 worth of forfeitures 
against this farmer for previous grain export violations. I would 
like to know why the customs minister has not prosecuted this 
farmer and seized his vehicles with the same lightening speed used 
to prosecute farmers like David Sawatzky, Andy McMechan and 
Bill Cairns. Is this the Liberal government's idea of justice for 
farmers?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Jane Stewart (Minister of National Revenue, Lib.):</B> Mr.

our border is tremendous.
<P>
	We have, in fact, the responsibility to ensure active facilitation 
of trade and also to ensure the safety and protection of our country. 
We uphold several acts that have been passed by this Parliament

	I suggest to the hon. member that if there are individuals who

is for the heritage minister.
<P>
	During a reception to honour the athletes who participated in the 
Atlanta Olympic and Paralympic Games, the Quebec Minister of 
Municipal Affairs, who is responsible for recreation and sports, 
learned that the Canadian Paralympic Committee did not pay all 
the costs associated with the participation of our athletes in the 
Atlanta games. So he made the commitment to give the athletes, or 
their sports associations, grants in the amount of $16,485 to cover 
half of the unpaid expenses.
<P>
	Will the minister respond to the letter dated December 2 from 
her Quebec counterpart asking her to do her share and to reimburse 
the other half of the costs incurred by the athletes to participate in 
the Atlanta Paralympic Games?
<P>
<B>(1155)</B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of

department paid a large portion of the costs of the Paralympic 
Games for Canada, we, as the Government of Canada, will

<B><A NAME="7521"> 7521 </A></B>
<P>
certainly continue to do so,  but I am inviting the Quebec minister, 
Guy Chevrette, to join us in subsidizing 50 per cent of all the costs 
associated with Quebec paralympic athletes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
Quebec minister made a commitment to pay the first half of the 
costs, will the federal minister recognize that athletes who reach 
such a high level of performance and who represent us in the 
Olympic Games should not have been subjected to this kind of 
affront?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 
Canadian Heritage, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to repeat the 
offer I am making to the minister from Quebec. Given that it is the 
Canadian government, I in particular, that has worked very hard to 
assume a large portion of the cost of the Paralympics, I am inviting 
the minister, who obviously has a very sincere interest in this issue, 
to share with me all the costs associated with the Olympic and 
Paralympic athletes from the province of Quebec so that we can 
share this on a 50:50 basis.
<P>
	I am certainly willing to look at that and I hope to hear from

whether he would rather, unfortunately, play politics with this issue

Mr. Speaker, recently the minister of agriculture was publicly

concern that the minister would introduce changes to the Canadian 
Wheat Board Act while he is presiding over a charter challenge to

changes to the Canadian Wheat Board Act while the existing act is

<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as the hon. gentleman knows, grain 
marketing in western Canada is a topic of considerable debate 
among farmers and others.
<P>
	Farmers have made strong recommendations for changes in 
legislation. Farmers are anxious for those changes to come forward 
for their consideration and ultimate enactment by Parliament as 
rapidly as possible. Indeed the Reform Party has also been urging 
the government to move in that very direction.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I did not say this is an urgent issue but perhaps the 
minister has acted irresponsibly and improperly. So I would ask the 
justice minister what steps  he will take to redress the improper 
activities of the minister of agriculture, which may be seen as 
interference by the minister in this case.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ralph E. Goodale (Minister of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Parliament of Canada has 
responsibility for introducing, considering and ultimately passing 
legislation. Obviously at any moment in time there can be a whole 
variety of litigious matters before the courts in every field.
<P>
	If we were to follow the admonition of the hon. gentleman, we 
would never consider any piece of legislation in this country if 
there were matters outstanding under previous legislation at any 
point in time. Obviously that is a formula for stalemate. Maybe that 
is what the Reform Party wishes to have but as far as this

my question is for the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	Recently the European Union and Canada agreed in principle to 
an agreement which would eliminate a threatened EU ban on 
Canadian fur imports. However, now the European Union council 
of environment ministers has rejected this draft agreement, thereby 
throwing the whole process up in the air.
<P>
	We have waited long enough for the Europeans to get their act 
together. Can the parliamentary secretary tell me if the government 
is prepared to take this issue to the World Trade Organization so as 
not to leave our Canadian fur industry out in the cold?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
for International Trade, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague is quite 
correct. For one year the Canadian government has been 
negotiating in good faith with the European commission to 
conclude an agreement with respect to this industry.
<P>
	On December 6 we initialled an agreement, and so we were very

Trade has met with Sir Leon Brittan who told us once again that he

<P>
	Yesterday, the minister introduced in the House Bill C-79, an act 
amending the Indian Act. However, this same minister, last 
September 11, stated and I quote: ``Changing the Indian Act 
requires very strong support''.
<P>
	In light of that statement, how can the Minister go ahead with his 
amendments, whereas I have on my desk letters from 542 
aboriginal nations out of 600 in Canada that are opposing his bill? 
Does he not agree that he should go back to do his homework in 
co-operation with the aboriginals, as requested in the 
Erasmus-Dussault report and by most of the stakeholders in 
Canada?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Ron Irwin (Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have not addressed the 
Indian Act since 1951 and we cannot continue to look at a problem 
only every 45 years. It has taken is two years to get to this point and 
the package which is before the hon. member and the committee 
has three processes.
<P>
	The first is substance. I am prepared to turn over substantial 
powers to the aboriginal people, where it should be, that I now 
exercise and do not want. I am prepared to take those sections that 
they want to discuss further or which may be controversial and put 
them before the committee. Its members can use their imagination 
and move into the future.
<P>
	Finally, I am prepared to make it optional. I was prepared to go 
further than that so that no one can ever say that the government 
was not prepared to transfer these powers. Now it is up to the First 
Nations to decide whether it wants to exercise these powers.
<P>
	Most important, a process is finally in place that over a period of 
years will deal with substantive issues of the Indian Act and get rid 
of that offensive act once and for all.

<P>
	The Liberal red book promises that the government will promote 
fairness and opportunity and yet day after day we have more 
broken promises. Environment Canada is apparently unfairly 
bidding against small  private sector firms for water quality and 
meteorological services.
<P>
	Why is the minister's huge department bidding against private 
firms? How can the public believe that the government is using a 
level playing field and being ethical when doing this questionable 
practice?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sergio Marchi (Minister of the Environment, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting how the Reform Party wants to pretend 
that it cares about the environment. The last time Reform asked a 
question was on May 17.
<P>
	If we look at fresh start the only thing that comes close to 
mentioning the environment is the green colour. Not one word on 
the environment is mentioned in their fresh start campaign. Reform 
members have the audacity to talk about us breaking red book 
commitments when we have introduced the Canadian 
Environmental Protection Act, the endangered species legislation, 
MMT which that party is against. We have a harmonization accord 
in the works with the provinces.
<P>
	The government is not only keep its commitments on the 
environment, but also pushing the file as well.
<P>
	In answer to the specific question from the hon. member, like 
other departments we are working within Treasury Board 
guidelines. We have met with the business community. We have 
joint ventures with those companies. It is something that is sought 
after. The good name of Environment Canada is very much a viable 
commodity.

	Since 1992, immigration officials have denied entry to addicts

	We have not received responses to any of these and the 
government has missed the deadline. These questions are to be 
answered within 45 days and today is day 55.

<B>(1220)</B>
<P>
	Will the government tell us why it has missed the deadline and 
when it plans to respond?
<P>
	While I am on my feet, Mr. Speaker, I would also like to point 
out that we also have concern about the lack of response to our 
Notices of Motions for the Production of Papers, again related to 
the airbus fiasco, the role of former Prime Minister Mulroney and 
this Liberal government in those particular contracts. We currently 
have 17 such notices and have not received anything from the 
government on any of them. We gave notice for two of these on 
March 19 and for the other 15 on September 12.
<P>
	Given that this is or at least is supposed to be the last day of

from the government. So can the government tell us when we 
might get some action on these matters?

	Resuming consideration at report stage of Bill C-60, an act to 
establish the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and to repeal and 
amend other Acts as a consequence, as reported (with amendments) 
from the committee, and of the motions in Group No. 7.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Peter Milliken (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.):</B> The hon. 
member for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead has six minutes left 
to make his remarks.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will ask for your indulgence in allowing me to 
raise all the points I consider necessary.
<P>
	Before oral question period, when we resumed consideration of 
the motions in Group No. 7 amending Bill C-60, I said that the 
people were really concerned by this bill, as I tried to demonstrate.
<P>
	I gave the example of my colleague, the member for Richelieu, 
as well as of my other Bloc colleagues who represent ridings where 
the people are different but share the same concern, that is the need 
to have credible institutions, institutions that they can trust. 
Unfortunately, as we said before and will keep repeating, the 
Canadian Food Inspection Agency that is proposed in Bill C-60 
contravenes this objective.
<P>
	I also said it was important to recall the guidelines underlying 
this bill. We have clearly shown that the president of this 
institution, who is appointed by the governor in council, will 
naturally have to show some gratitude to the government which 
appointed him. The appointee will undoubtedly also have to prove 
his political allegiance, and we hope that this person will still be 
required to have the skills needed to perform his functions.
<P>
	That being said, if the bill is not amended, the advisory board 
will, in turn, be composed of members chosen by the 
cabinet-appointed president, who will use the same criteria to set 
up an advisory board that will be every bit as political.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7527"> 7527 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1225)</B>
<P>
	As though that were not enough, there is even a clause which has 
very few equivalents, if any, at the federal level. It excludes the 
agency from the application of the Public Service of Canada Act.
<P>
	Why, Mr. Speaker? Is it to save money? Is it to make things 
easier and the agency more efficient? No, Mr. Speaker. It is simply 
because they want to have total control over the hiring process, 
because they want to circumvent existing legislation and get rid of 
the unions. They want to hire whoever they want.
<P>
	The very high risk of patronage was clearly established by my 
colleagues. And there is more. The list of arguments against this 
bill is endless. What do we find in clause 16, which is what 
amendments in Group No. 7 deal with? 
<P>
	Clause 16 will exempt the agency from section 9 of the 
Department of Public Works and Government Services Act when it 
hires experts from outside the public service. That section would 
have fouled up the government's patronage scheme, so out it goes.
<P>
	Clause 16 circumvents section 9 of the Department of Public 
Works and Government Services Act by providing that the agency 
may, with the approval of the governor in council-that is 
cabinet-on the recommendation of the Treasury Board-that is a 
minister and one of the most partisan members of this government, 
namely the hon. member for Hull-Aylmer-``procure goods and 
services, including legal services, from outside the public service 
of Canada''. 
<P>
	When I read this clause, I can already see Liberal lawyers in the 
eastern townships opening their cheque books to make 
contributions to the Liberal Party since they will be the ones to get 
contracts from the Food Inspection Agency. That is a fact. We are 
about to give them a very nice Christmas gift.
<P>
	Fortunately, our colleague, the agriculture critic and member for 
Frontenac, was vigilant and saw through it. He too has denounced 
this situation and proposed amendments which would create a 
framework for that process.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in the minute I have left, I want to address the 
amendments put forward by my colleague from Frontenac.
<P>
	What my colleague is proposing is that before procuring services 
from outside the government, namely consultant services, we make 
sure that we do not have the needed resources inside the federal 
public service. At a time when we are asking all public 
administrations to cut services and improve efficiency, it goes 
without saying that when the government needs consultant services 
it should look first among its own public servants. Many of them 
are very competent. We should use their services. That is what we 
are asking.
<P>
<B>(1230)</B>
<P>
	This is only common sense. It is terrible to have to raise the issue 
in this House at this time in our history. We understand that when 
the time comes to dispense patronage, and I will conclude on this, 
nothing can stop our Liberal friends. The economic context 
requires that everyone be cautious about the way they spend 
money, except if they contribute to the coffers of the Liberal Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I will try to keep my comments reasonably brief on 
Group No. 7 of the report stage of Bill C-60.
<P>
	I do not believe I can support the two motions in this group 
because it looks like they will make it very difficult to contract out 
or privatize inspection services in the future. Although a provision 
in Motion No. 20 seems worthy of support. It calls for open bidding 
in the private sector for any goods and services procured by the 
new agency. We were recently reminded of how important that is 
when the auditor general uncovered another untendered contract to 
Bombardier.
<P>
	Over the years we have noticed a very close affiliation between 
Bombardier and both the Conservative and Liberal governments. It 
is such a cosy relationship that it certainly makes one very 
uncomfortable. Any time there are untendered contracts without a 
proper bidding process, the taxpayer should be very nervous. 
Members of the Reform Party caucus are extremely nervous about 
the Liberal government's practice of offering untendered contracts 
to its friends in the corporate sector.
<P>
	There is a broader question concerning the single food 
inspection agency: What kind of impact will these motions and the 
bill itself have on the effectiveness of the new agency? When we 
are trying to analyze the merits and problems of a new inspection 
agency it helps to make a comparison. We need something to 
illustrate our concerns.
<P>
	An obvious comparison is the Pest Management Regulatory 
Agency which is currently under tremendous criticism by the 
industry. The PMRA is another institution that was amalgamated 
by Parliament. It has a fairly large staff. The amalgamation was 
supposed to save the taxpayers money and provide a valuable 
service to the industry. There was an outcry of protest from a 
diverse array of organizations such as the Crop Protection Institute 
of Canada, Prairie Pools Incorporated.
<P>
	The CFA was very critical of the PMRA. The Canadian meat 
processors were extremely upset. The Canadian Cattlemen's 
Association has expressed its concern. The Ontario corn growers 
are very very upset at the costs the PMRA has forced them to incur.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7528"> 7528 </A></B>
<P>
	That brings us to the issues of job security and job creation. 
The new food inspection agency will have the equivalent 
bureaucracy to the agencies and departments from which it will 
be birthed. Perhaps there will be jobs saved in the public sector 
but how many jobs will be lost in the private sector? How many 
jobs will be lost in the failure to see economic growth?
<P>
	We know that products are not being registered effectively with 
the PMRA because of all the loops and hassles that the pesticide 
manufacturers have to go through to meet needless requirements of 
the PMRA. That is costing jobs. It is costing jobs in the agriculture 
sector. It is costing jobs in the manufacturing sector. It is slowing 
the growth of agriculture and affiliated industries that support 
agriculture. That is why these very astute agricultural organizations 
are so upset with the PMRA.
<P>
	Imagine anything as diverse as the CFA, Prairie Pools, Crop 
Protection Institute, Canadian Cattlemen's Association, Ontario 
corn growers, meat processors. Even the horticulture people are 
very upset with the PMRA. It has been very difficult for their 
industry to grow and expand because of the bureaucracy and the 
clumsiness of that agency.
<P>
<B>(1235)</B>
<P>
	When the witnesses appeared before us in committee we 
challenged the government about whether or not this new single 
food inspection agency might be going the same route. In looking 
at some of the clauses we are debating today, it looks as though it 
may very well be doing that.
<P>
	I do not believe that the Bloc's amendments will correct it, but 
certainly if there was a call for bids and an open tendering process, 
it would certainly help. If the focus on job creation was more on 
seeing the private sector expand and grow, industry grow and 
creating new, long term jobs, that would be far more beneficial than 
providing security for the approximately 4,500 employees of the 
new single food inspection agency.
<P>
	I think I have made my point. I am not trying to delay the debate. 
I know we all want to get out and enjoy the Christmas season. As 
opportunity affords, I will speak to other groups and raise other 
issues later on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-Food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we are dealing 
with Motions Nos. 19 and 20 which deal with a common service 
provider. It is important to make certain that we understand what 
the government's proposal is in this area. What we are trying to do 
is make certain that there are certain providers which can be put 
together in a cost effective, common way to make sure that the 
program delivery is efficient and effective and financially sound.
<P>
	There is no question that before proceeding the agency must seek 
Treasury Board approval and governor in council approval to hire 
outside people based on cost effectiveness and a sound business 
plan. Also, since there is a crossing of different ministries required 
in dealing with the agency, there is no question that the minister 
responsible has to confer with his colleagues in cabinet and make 
certain that everyone is aware of the crossings which may happen.
<P>
	I would like to highlight as well that the proposed clause requires 
the agency to follow the normal contracting rules, including calling 
bids and tenders and respecting all current contract rules.
<P>
	Many things that are being said are being said erroneously I 
believe because there is uncertainty about all of the details that are 
included in the bill. I do want to assure everyone that the 
contracting rules put in place by Treasury Board will be confirmed 
with the agency. I assure them that the rules with regard to 
contracts for employees are in place as well. I thought those areas 
should be clarified.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to discuss this series of amendments 
proposed by the hon. member for Frontenac, who is official 
opposition critic on agricultural issues.
<P>
	The hon. member deserves to be congratulated for the quality of 
his work, and for his efficient and thorough review of this bill. The 
amendments that we are discussing today also seek to improve the 
proposed legislation, that is the Canadian Food Inspection Agency 
Act.
<P>
	The federal government finally decided to clean up the food 
inspection sector, and it deserves to be congratulated for doing so. 
However, there is the issue of provincial jurisdiction regarding this 
activity, and we alluded to it when we discussed other amendments.
<P>
	This group of amendments concerns a basic issue, even though it 
does not relate to the jurisdiction of the provinces. The same is true 
in the case of many other agencies and crown corporations: given 
the current wording of the bill tabled by the government, the 
minister responsible will be able to wash his hands of the actions 
that could be taken by the new agency.
<P>
<B>(1240)</B>
<P>
	There are examples of this at Canada Post. When it suits her, the 
minister praises Canada Post for its action, but when she is not 
pleased, she shirks the responsibility by saying that this is a crown 
corporation dealing at arms' length and that it can do as it pleases.
<P>
	This issue is all the more important in the food inspection sector, 
since decisions made have an impact on people's health, and also 
on domestic and foreign trade for Quebec and Canada. We must 
make sure the minister is fully responsible and accountable to the 
House, and that he can make any changes that are required.
<P>

<HR>

<P>
	Our amendment to clause 16 proposes that the responsible 
minister for the agency's decisions in these matters have full 
responsibility, answer questions, take corrective action and ensure 
that everything is working properly.
<P>
	Food inspection is an area that is very sensitive to public 
opinion. We do not have to imagine all kinds of scenarios. It is 
enough to remember what happened in Great Britain with mad cow 
disease. We need quick political reaction and politicians and 
responsible ministers who can act quickly.
<P>
	If we do not ensure that the minister is truly responsible for his 
actions, we may create a vacuum that will harm the reputation of 
the agency and the quality of its food inspection services. That is 
why I think it the government should consider this amendment and 
make it part of the bill.
<P>
	This amendment is in no way partisan. Its purpose is to 
recognize the role of elective representatives and the person who 
happens to be the minister responsible for this agency and to 
increase their effectiveness. There are many shortcomings and 
loopholes in the bill, in its present form, that would let the minister 
shirk his responsibilities, and this is not a good thing for food 
inspection.
<P>
	The other aspect I wanted to raise is the agency's right to procure 
legal services from sources other than the Department of Justice. 
As in the previous groups of amendments, in the food inspection 
sector it is very important for lawyers to be able to speak out with 
full impunity and not be influenced by the situation.
<P>
	I see a scenario where the agency could very well develop two 
kinds of legal contracts: there would be lawyers capable of being 
flexible in specific situations and there would be those the agency 
would use when it needs a very firm, very solid approach.
<P>
	Who will decide how contracts are awarded? Is it not possible 
that awarding contracts for legal services from outside the 
government would open the door to patronage? Will the eligible 
lawyers on the list just happen to be Liberals? And when there is a 
change of government, will the list change so that we lose all the 
expertise that has been acquired in that sector?
<P>
	As in the case of inspectors, the procedure for legal services 
must be watertight. The person who gives a legal opinion must not 
be subject to pressure in connection with his job or other situations. 
The best way to guarantee the independence of legal services is to 
ensure that those who give legal opinions are accountable only to 
the government and that they have job security. They must be able 
to give opinions that are impartial and devoid of any partisan 
considerations.
<P>
	The government has its work cut out for it in this area. It has to 
work on making the agency independent. The agency must not be 
vulnerable to political interference. It must be independent at all 
levels: inspectors, lawyers, board members and the appointment of 
the president.
<P>
<B>(1245)</B>
<P>
	That is the kind of guideline that is missing in this bill, a problem 
the Bloc's proposed amendments seek to address so as to maintain 
Canada's reputation for food inspection, which has served Quebec 
and Canada well in all our international initiatives. It must remain 
clearly and unequivocally 100 per cent unaltered. We must have an 
impeccable international reputation at all times and be able to show 
any consumer on the face of the earth that ours products are quality 
products and that the services we provide are not marred by 
irregularities.
<P>
	We have developed expertise in that area based on past 
experience. Consolidating the three government authorities into a 
single agency is a step in the right direction, but let us not throw the 
baby out with the bath water. We must not, on the one hand, make 
improvements and, on the other hand, end up creating a whole set 
of circumstances that could jeopardize the quality of the 
inspections performed.
<P>
	These amendments are part of a series of amendments tabled by 
the hon. member for Frontenac and designed to retain the goods 
aspects of the bill. But in those cases where the Liberal majority 
indulged in making changes and decided changes were necessary, 
they figured they might as well go all out and make room for some 
of their friends. I urge the Liberal majority to reconsider that aspect 
of the bill. There is still time, as we consider the proposed 
amendments.
<P>
	You do not have to pass them all as they stand, but I feel 
compelled to ask the Liberal majority to consider those that are on 
the table right now as part of this group. They should say: ``All 
right, we agree that the minister should be really accountable and 
should have to account to this House for what this agency does''.
<P>
	We must have the clear assurance that the people concerned will 
act fairly and equitably with regard to procurement and contracts, 
particularly legal contracts, as well as in acquiring any other 
equipment required for this activity. Loads of new technologies and 
new tools that could be used are being developed all the time.
<P>
	Before long, we will even be dealing with biotechnologies. Some 
moral issues will have to be considered in food inspection, and we 
will have to make sure we are not under the control of economic 
forces whose interests may differ from those of the general public.
<P>
	Ultimately, the farmer, the processing industry and the consumer 
may have diverging interests. The government's responsibility is to 
make sure the chain of production does not have any weak link, 
because in food inspection, every detail counts and a rigorous 
follow-up is required.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7530"> 7530 </A></B>
<P>
	In the past, I have seen reputations destroyed overnight, which 
is what happened in the case of the mad cow disease and also in 
the case of fish inspection. For all those reasons, I urge the House 
to approve the amendments moved by the hon. member for 
Frontenac, because they would improve this bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, today we are debating an extremely important bill. In my 
beautiful riding of Rimouski-Témiscouata, and more specifically 
in Notre-Dame-du-Lac in Témiscouata, there is a big 
slaughterhouse for pigs.
<P>
	Recently, the owners wanted to expand the facility to increase 
production. They wanted to increase the number of nurseries, and 
their plans sort of clashed with the Quebec legislation, which is 
very strict in this regard. Quebec cleaned up this sector a long time 
ago.
<P>
	The important thing is to be able to guarantee to the public that 
food inspectors can do their work professionally, and with the 
proper safeguards to prevent any problem.
<P>
<B>(1250)</B>
<P>
	In Quebec, we had an inquiry on the tainted meat scandal. 
Incidentally, it was around that time that we got to know people 
who have since become great politicians in Quebec, including Mr. 
Bouchard and Mr. Chevrette. Following this episode, we decided 
that such an incident should never happen again. This is why we 
developed legislation which guarantees to the public that the work 
is done extremely well.
<P>
	I think that the inspection of food should come under provincial 
jurisdiction. In February, the government pledged, in its speech 
from the throne, to do its utmost to eliminate overlap, duplication 
and useless spending. Since the federal government is getting 
involved in an area which, we feel, comes under provincial 
jurisdiction, it is headed in the wrong direction and should leave 
this responsibility to the provinces.
<P>
	It is also very important to make sure the integrity and the 
competence of those hired to do this work can never be questioned. 
What is being proposed is an agency outside the government, but 
whose president would be appointed by the government. This 
president would select his own board members, hire his own staff 
and so on. The whole process would take place outside the scope of 
the Public Service Employment Act. If you establish an institution 
in this fashion, you are gambling as to who will be in control.
<P>
	We can see it clearly in the case of certain other organizations. 
The government must keep its distance, remain at arm's length as 
they say in English. Unfortunately, I cannot think of the French 
word. There must be some distance between the government and 
the organizations in question. However, to move from that to  
creating agencies and skirting the Public Service Employment Act 
is a bit disconcerting.
<P>
	The Minister of Canadian Heritage did exactly the same thing. 
She created the ICO, the Information Canada Office. One of the 
deputy ministers at Heritage Canada became its director, and its 
employees do not come under the public service legislation. It 
makes you wonder where we are headed. The government says: 
``We have to cut costs, so, over a three year period, 45,000 public 
servants across Canada are going to be laid off''. What is the 
government doing? It turns around and says: ``We will need an 
office or a board here, an agency over there''. And then, when new 
organizations are created, their staff is not subject to the Public 
Service Employment Act.
<P>
	What raises concern is that new employees will be hired, but 
they will still be paid with taxpayers' money. Twenty million 
dollars were taken from the heritage budget to subsidize the ICO. 
But in that case, we no longer have any control. To a question I put 
to the minister, she answered: ``Well, the hon. member opposite 
only has to check on the Internet and she will find everything she 
needs to know about the ICO''. I have used the Internet several 
times and I am sorry to tell you that, if everyone surfing the 
Internet relies on the ICO for information on Canada, they will be 
sorry, because there are only about four pages on Canada, and most 
of it is propaganda and not information. Apart from the fact that the 
population of Canada hit the 30 million mark last summer, there is 
not much factual data to be found on the ICO site.
<P>
<B>(1255)</B>
<P>
	So we have an office that was set up. A director was appointed. 
He was given the authority to hire people and spend $20 million, 
without being subject to any public service quality control 
measure. The exact same thing is being done here with this agency. 
What is likely to happen with a quasi-government agency? 
Unfortunately, we could see a lot of party politics, favouritism and 
patronage. We will go back to the old system: ``If you vote for me, 
you will have a job, a position in the agency, in the office, in some 
other organization. Support my government and my party''. This is 
the first risk.
<P>
	We also risk having people who are almost in private sector, 
outside of government but not quite, but hired prcatically on the 
same basis as private businesses, people who, as we have seen in 
many sectors, inflate the bills and invent items that do not exist.
<P>
	We hear these days of what is happening at the space agency. We 
would have a lot to say about that. The government says: ``Come 
on, there is nothing to worry about'', when in fact we are losing 
control of public funds. For the public, this is discouraging because 
it is like shifting money from one pocket to the other and saying 
that we saved something in the process. But if we really look at the 
figures, we realize that there are no savings because even if we 
have cut employees in the  heritage department, we have created 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7531"> 7531 </A></B>
<P>
the office and given it $20 million. We may have cut positions in 
the agriculture department but at the same time we have created an 
agency that will control food quality, with all the very real risks 
involved.
<P>
	And then, there will be court cases. Who will be hired as 
lawyers? Not federal employees. We will hire our friends. A 
Liberal government will hire Liberals. A Conservative government 
will hire Conservatives. And a Reform government will hire 
Reformers. Friends will be hired to go before the courts.
<P>
	I think the public is not being fooled. They know what is going 
on. People understand that the government does not save much 
except at their expense, that it reduces its support to the less 
fortunate while it tries to set up official organizations that will 
allow it to continue to spend taxpayers' money.
<P>
	Therefore, I urge the government to carefully review our 
amendments, which are very important in assuring Canadians that, 
in the future, there will be no more political patronage and wasting 
of money and that the new food inspection procedures will be in 
their best interest.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my colleague 
from Rimouski-Témiscouata was very eloquent in making the 
connection between culture and agriculture, as was the Quebec 
agriculture minister for whom I had the pleasure of working at one 
point. And she is right. She is right because the federal 
government's actions as regards culture and agriculture are similar 
in many respects in that it is trying to eliminate public service jobs 
for economic reasons to create an agency that will operate outside 
the public service and that will give more freedom to the governor 
in council, which, as you know, means cabinet.
<P>
<B>(1300)</B>
<P>
	The first amendment put forward by the member for Frontenac 
deals with the new agency, which groups together three agencies 
that used to belong to three different departments, namely the 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the Department of 
Agriculture and the Department of Health, into one single agency 
falling under the jurisdiction of the agriculture department.
<P>
	However, we can see that people would be appointed by cabinet. 
If the amendment is not adopted, the agriculture minister, when 
criticized, could defend himself by saying: ``It is a cabinet 
decision. It is not my fault. I am not responsible. Yes, I am a 
cabinet minister, but because of ministerial solidarity-''
<P>
	Finally, it makes the minister of agriculture look good, except 
that this is a rather special operation. I nearly said ``spatial'', 
because there has been so much talk of space today, but no, it is 
``special''. We in Quebec are  not all that familiar with this custom. 
These are measures taken in Quebec in very specific cases, in very 
specific areas not generally covered by specific departments or 
sectorial departments.
<P>
	What is involved here is a food inspection agency, for which at 
least there is a precedent. At least three agencies have been doing 
the same thing. As I said yesterday, these various food inspection 
agencies have been consolidated since 1978 in Quebec. Eighteen 
years later, we see the federal government developing a desire to do 
the same thing, moreover in an area of shared jurisdiction, at least 
where agriculture is concerned. Where health is concerned, 
however, this would, in principle, be a provincial area of 
jurisdiction, except where foods from outside the country, or from 
other provinces, are concerned. But this is not always the case.
<P>
	We do not, however, have any objection to the principle of 
consolidating three federal agencies. It is clearer, at least. People 
will have a clearer idea of whom they are dealing with. But, after 
grouping the agencies together, they take a diversionary tactic and 
create one agency which will be able to operate in a different way 
than the regular sectorial departments.
<P>
	This leaves a great deal of scope for questions, not that we want 
to accuse anyone of bad faith, but still. Amendment No. 1 says: 
``Yes, but why go elsewhere looking for services, when there may 
be qualified people within the Public Service?'' This would be 
logical, particularly since the fusion may result in early retirement 
offers or job cuts.
<P>
	In this context, it seems to me that, before making such changes, 
thought ought to be given to using the services of people who are 
already working in the federal public service. That, I would think, 
would be self-evident. Yet, it seems to me that the government is 
resisting this amendment.
<P>
	The other point concerns appointments as legal advisers. 
Obviously, in Quebec, and I imagine everywhere else as well, there 
have been appointments following the political trends of the time, 
and I am not addressing only this present government with this. It 
seems that the Conservatives also had a considerable appetite for 
the same thing, which they had had to stifle during the long lean 
years. It took them nine years to catch up, with a whole series of 
appointments of lawyers and other professionals, who had all been 
frustrated during the long Liberal years by not being appointed to 
legal services.
<P>
	We in Quebec saw the same thing happen during the Trudeau 
Liberal years, if not before, and then Mr. Mulroney came along 
promising change. But the essential change he made was that he 
appointed different people. When you follow public affairs in 
Quebec, you see what is going on with federal appointments. With 
Christmas approaching, I think I could make an analogy with the 
party game of musical chairs, which it resembles greatly.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7532"> 7532 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1305)</B>
<P>
	Kids like to play musical chairs, but when political appointments 
are involved, the game is less amusing. The Senate is, of course, 
the ultimate version of the musical chairs game. When people 
cannot run around the chairs fast enough, they send them on to the 
other place. One might call this a kind of compassionate treatment. 
I do not want to say that everybody in the other Chamber is no 
good, but this is a costly duplication of an institution.
<P>
	What we have here is another example, in food inspection. The 
federal government obviously wants to keep its powers and 
responsibilities and not delegate to the provinces. It would, 
however, be much easier to say: ``There is an area where 
duplication could be avoided, because food, fish, products, 
especially in the context of free trade today, move not only between 
provinces, but between countries as well''. In this context, the 
government might well want to keep certain responsibilities. In an 
independent Quebec, in partnership with Canada, mechanisms 
could likely maintain this situation in cases where products moved 
between countries.
<P>
	We have no objection to the mechanism. Our objection is to the 
way it is set up and to the excessive powers accorded the ministers 
and the cabinet, because, as we know, the minister can recommend 
appointments to cabinet. If criticized, however, he will say: ``Yes, 
yes, but it is cabinet. You know, I am only a minister and I must not 
break ranks with the other ministers''. Yes, we understand, but we 
do not know who is right and who is guilty in this game.
<P>
	The people of Quebec and Canada want greater transparency and 
more public involvement in the management of public affairs and 
political life. It is in this spirit, that the choice of the new leader of 
the Bloc Quebecois will be by universal suffrage. He will be 
elected by all members of the Bloc Quebecois. Members of the 
Bloc wishing to take part will have to wait a few more weeks before 
the convention.
<P>
	This is the sort of situation that shows how management of 
public affairs and political life could be improved.
<P>
	Why do I say that? Because for a long time, at least in my first 
years here, I was youth training critic. I was often in contact with 
young people. What young people do not like about politics-and 
after being in politics for so long you are aware of this, Mr. 
Speaker, this will not faze you-is they would like to see some 
changes, they are tired of the same old ways, especially with regard 
to patronage appointments. Were the appointees selected because 
of their hard work for the party, or for their generous contributions 
to the party? We do not know how it works exactly and people think 
it is wrong. They would like to see a mechanism such as the one 
proposed by the member for Frontenac, namely an independent 
nominating committee.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, if I do not have the opportunity to talk to you again, 
I wish you a Merry Christmas and happy holidays.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Pursuant to an order made 
earlier in this debate, all questions in group 8 are deemed to have 
been put and deferred. The House will now proceed to a debate on 
group 9, Motions Nos. 27, 28, 29 and 30.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are now discussing the amendments in Group No. 8-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> We are debating Group 
No. 8 which includes Motions nos. 24, 25 and 26. Please forgive 
me, but the information I gave to the House earlier was wrong.
<P>
<B>(1310)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> Therefore, 
Mr. Speaker, are you saying I am right? Are we debating Group No. 
8?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Yes.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the beginning of this debate the thrust of 
this bill has become increasingly clear. I think it is important that 
we keep it in mind. I will briefly review all the comments made by 
the opposition up until now.
<P>
	This is what we have been trying to show all along, this bill, 
despite its main thrust, which is quite laudable, namely to 
streamline food inspection, bringing all responsibilities and 
prerogatives pertaining to food inspection under one single agency, 
the means used to reach this objective are totally unacceptable. 
They are unacceptable and will be counterproductive.
<P>
	We have already shown, quite eloquently I believe, that the fact 
that the president is to be appointed by the governor in council is 
par for the course, but that chances are he will be chosen more for 
his political affiliation than for his ability to do the job.
<P>
	Moreover, we have shown how extensive his powers will be, 
including selecting his own advisory board, in other words the 
power to be consulted on issues of his choice, to ask for advice of 
his own choosing that will go along with what he and the 
government, regardless of its political stripe, want.
<P>
	Moreover, it was decided, under clause 10 or 12 of the bill, not 
only to exempt the hiring of employees and inspectors of the 
agency from the Public Service Staff Relations Act, but also to set 
the terms of employment  the president would see fit to set. In other 
words, this amounts to eliminating the labour code and the long 
standing tradition we have in this country to entrust negotiating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7533"> 7533 </A></B>
<P>
labour agreements to a credible association controlled by its 
members.
<P>
	We have seen, a little further on, under clause 24 I believe, that 
the agency will be able to hire whomever it pleases, including 
outside professionals. We know what the hiring criteria will be in 
such cases. Of course, this is going to be about consultants, whether 
legal or otherwise, who will have contacts, people who are on good 
terms with the agency and known as loyal servants, not of the 
government, but of the Liberal Party.
<P>
	In the motions in Group No. 8 which we are discussing now, 
there is a reference to the report. There is an action plan the agency 
will have to submit and that will be subject to public scrutiny. How 
are they going to proceed? As I said earlier, it will be all behind 
closed doors, to speed up the process, so no one will realize what is 
going on and they can do things on the sly more often than not. The 
agency will have absolute control over the action plan it wants to 
develop. In other words, the agency will not seek the advice of the 
advisory board or the local people when preparing its action plan, 
but will seek the advice of outside consultants, which it is free to 
choose.
<P>
<B>(1315)</B>
<P>
	That is totally unacceptable and that is why the hon. member for 
Frontenac and agriculture critic has put forward amendments 
which hopefully will be considered on the basis of their merit and 
accepted. What do these amendments say?
<P>
	First, when agency officials produce an action plan, we do not 
want this action plan to be put on the shelf and forgotten as soon as 
it is tabled in this House; it should be referred to the Standing 
Committee on Agriculture instead.
<P>
	The members of this committee, government members and 
opposition members alike, take the future of the farming industry 
to heart, as, we assume, everyone else does. They want to ensure 
that the right decisions are made.
<P>
	These members will scrutinize the action plan submitted by 
agency officials and will be in a position, at least we hope so, to 
make the necessary changes before the plan is tabled in the House, 
put on a shelf and forgotten by everyone. That is what our 
amendments are all about.
<P>
	We want the agency's action plan to be referred to the agriculture 
committee for consideration and approval. This is not too much to 
ask. I cannot see how the Minister of Agriculture or the members of 
the government party could object to such a sensible motion.
<P>
	What else is suggested? That the agriculture committee, in 
considering the plan, listen to the groups concerned, those 
representing farmers from coast to coast. They could tell us 
whether this action plan is practicable and will achieve the stated 
goals at a reasonable cost.
<P>
	We could also hear from the consumer associations' 
representatives to find out whether the inspection procedures meet 
the standards or whether the inspection should target another kind 
of industry or product.
<P>
	We could also hear people from the industry. They could tell us 
whether the agency's action plan will allow them to operate 
normally, and whether it will give them credibility with the 
consumers and guarantee the good quality of food for consumers.
<P>
	Before we develop an action plan or have it tabled in the House, 
only to meet the same fate as thousands of reports tabled here, that 
is being shelved for good, it would be worthwhile, if this process is 
to be of any significance, to have it referred to the agriculture 
committee. The committee could hear from all those interested and 
make sure, even if we have doubts concerning the agency and its 
executive, the action plan is at least credible and can be examined 
and judged on its merits.
<P>
	I hope the government will consider these amendments and 
recognize the enormous amount of work the agriculture critic and 
his colleague have done.
<P>
	Since this is my last speech before we adjourn, I would like to 
extend to you my best wishes for the season.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I believe we have moved on to group No. 8. We 
support the amendments in group No. 8, Motions Nos. 24, 25, and 
26.
<P>
	Motion No. 24 suggests that a parliamentary review of the 
agency's business plan be undertaken before the bill is approved.
<P>
<B>(1320 )</B>
<P>
	Motion No. 25 supports a parliamentary review of the agency's 
business plan before the bill is approved. It also supports the 
agency consulting with industry employees first. Accountability 
which is required by Parliament is essential.
<P>
	I believe the committee did an excellent job of reviewing the 
bill. Excellent witnesses appeared before the committee. We were 
able to look at the strengths and weaknesses of the bill. However, 
when it came to implementing change, the powers of the 
committee were hampered because the government held the heavy 
hand on 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7534"> 7534 </A></B>
<P>
the committee and insisted that its members not consider valid 
amendments and instead pressed ahead with the government's 
agenda, whether or not that was the best position to take.
<P>
	To illustrate that point, I would like to mention the one 
amendment that was able to get through the clauses by clause 
session. It amended the preface of the bill. That amendment called 
for cost effectiveness. One would think that every member would 
think that is an essential measure for the bill. It would ensure that 
the new agency would be cost effective. The government said that 
was its intention. The witnesses said it was paramount. One of the 
key purposes of the agency is to make one food inspection agency 
more cost effective than having three separate agencies under three 
different ministers.
<P>
	While this was a perfectly sensible and logical amendment, 
government members voted against it. Fortunately, two 
government members supported the amendment so there was a 
split. That was the only amendment which was put forward in 
committee on which government members were not unanimous. It 
struck me as being very odd that three government members on the 
committee would vote against cost effectiveness as a principle and 
guiding light for this new single food inspection agency. That tells 
me that government members are very hesitant for the agency to be 
accountable to Parliament. That is very sad indeed.
<P>
	Another amendment we proposed at committee stage indicated 
that the fees set by the agency must be reasonable. The fees should 
not exceed a reasonable cost in providing the service or the use of 
that service.
<P>
	Believe it or not, government members voted against that 
amendment. That shows us the wrong direction in which the 
government is going. A few months earlier when we debated the 
Administrative Monetary Penalties Act, which was studied in the 
agriculture committee, we were able to amend the act at report 
stage by inserting the word reasonable. It put guidelines on a 
government agency which said it could not be unreasonable.
<P>
	Sometimes governments are unreasonable. We saw a lot of 
unreasonable things happen in the Mulroney government. Mr. 
Speaker, you were here then. You saw many of the unreasonable 
things that they did and you spoke about them.
<P>
	Governments change from time to time. Mr. Speaker, you 
probably do not think this government is unreasonable, but 
governments from time to time are unreasonable.
<P>
	The Liberal government says it is going to be reasonable. Of 
course we doubt that. It says that it will be reasonable, however, it 
will not implement a restraint or a constraint to ensure that these 
agencies deal with consumers and the industry in a reasonable way. 
The government says that it will ensure the agency will always be 
reasonable.
<P>
	Sometimes governments are not reasonable. However, if the 
legislation says that the costs must be reasonable,  they will have to 
be reasonable because it is the law of the land. If the bill is not 
followed, legal recourse should be available.
<P>
	It was extremely disappointing that government members were 
opposed to amending the bill to ensure that the costs be reasonable 
for the services provided by the single food inspection agency. This 
is at a time when the government, under treasury board initiatives, 
is implementing cost recovery. The industry is saying that many 
times cost recovery is not reasonable. Strong statements were made 
by organizations such as the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, 
the prairie pools, the Canadian Cattlemen's Association and food 
processors that said that cost recovery is not reasonable.
<P>
<B>(1325 )</B>
<P>
	The House has no powers to hold the government and these 
agencies accountable. It is not there. We wanted to put it in the 
legislation. The government said: ``No. We want the minister to 
have all power and the committee can meet and discuss these 
agencies at length then''.
<P>
	We can talk until we are blue in the face, but unless we have the 
support in legislation we do not have the clout. If an unreasonable 
government is in place then our hands are tied behind our backs. 
That is not the way government should work. That is not what 
Canadians want. That is not what was in the red book.
<P>
	The hon. member who left the Liberal ranks a few days ago 
because he could not be reconciled with his party over the budget 
and then tried to get back into the party was told: ``No way, José''. 
By the way his name is not José but I am not allowed to his name.
<P>
	However, he got up in the House and said to the Prime Minister: 
``You promised that government would be more accountable. It is 
in the red book''. When he quoted the page he was booed by his 
colleagues. They called him a traitor for quoting the red book. It 
was shocking. The government is moving away from being 
reasonable and accountable. It is disgusting. It is wrong.
<P>
	The House is studying the single food inspection agency and 
amendments by my colleagues from the Bloc. We put forward 
similar amendments in committee. As I mentioned earlier, Reform 
put its amendments forward at committee stage because under the 
new process there is supposed to be a better chance of reasonable 
amendments being considered in committee if they are presented 
before the bill is approved in principle. No way. That is another 
broken promise.
<P>
	Even a simple amendment that said the cost would have to be 
reasonable was defeated. At a time of user fees and cost recovery, 
at a time of friction between the government and the industry, the 
government said: ``No. We don't want to be accountable. The 
committee can look into anything but it has no power. There is no 
sanction in the legislation. We want to keep the minister's hands 
entirely free. We want the agency to be  able to do as it pleases, 
<P>

<B><A NAME="7535"> 7535 </A></B>
<P>
charge what it pleases for the services it provides''. That is 
unacceptable. That is unreasonable.
<P>
	The auditor general should be able to hold this agency to full 
account as well. We are concerned that the auditor general will not 
have sufficient opportunity to hold the new single food inspection 
agency accountable.
<P>
	The other day the auditor general in a report to committee that 
the whole system of guidelines for cost recovery are vague if they 
exist at all, that there are unquantifiable factors out there, that the 
department has not done its homework and does not know what it is 
talking about when it talks about what the cost recovery levels are 
for our competitors, what the expectations for cost recovery are, 
whether cost recoveries are considered to be in the public or the 
private good.
<P>
	He said that guidelines have not been put in place by the 
department of agriculture or by Treasury Board and certainly will 
make it much more difficult to determine whether this agency is 
being accountable and reasonable.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I thank you for this chance to speak to this grouping 
of motions. As I said, we support them.
<P>
	Perhaps this is my last chance to address the House and the Chair 
prior to the Christmas break. We are not sure what is happening 
here. I certainly want to wish all members a very merry Christmas 
and, Mr. Speaker, may you enjoy the holiday season. May you all 
be safe and have precious time with your families. We will look 
forward to seeing each one of you in the new year.
<P>

	The House resumed from November 6 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-214, an act to provide for improved information 
on the cost of proposed government programs, be read the second 
time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very 
pleased to speak to this bill presented by the Liberal member for 
Durham. I feel in this particular instance he is definitely on the 
right track. As this is a private member's bill I can personalize it 
and strongly emphasize how much I support the general thrust and 
intent of the bill.
<P>
	The bill will require that the estimated annual cost and the cost 
per capita of every new government program be published as soon 
as the bill that authorized it is introduced in Parliament or the 
regulation that implements it is issued. The auditor general's 
opinion on the estimate is also to be published.
<P>
	When a bill would come to this House at second reading stage 
there would be a requirement for the government to present to us 
the costs and economic impact of the bill. The actual requirement is 
that the government would have to explain the economic impact so 
that all members of this House and all Canadians could understand 
the nature of the bill. This has to be a tremendous improvement 
over what we are doing now in this House of Commons. I will use 
two examples to illustrate areas that would be improved by this 
bill: the tobacco bill and the disability aspect of the Canada pension 
plan.
<P>
	The tobacco bill is being hotly debated and hotly contested. It is 
a tough issue. There is a fine line between trying to impose 
regulations and steep taxes on this legal substance-it is legally 
allowed to be sold-and restricting the impact of this substance on 
the health and welfare of individual Canadians, especially the 
young people because of its highly addictive qualities.
<P>
	We have debated this bill. The tobacco industry and related 
lobbyists have said that the advertising and sponsorship provisions 
in the bill and the restrictive nature of the sale of cigarettes will 
force them to reduce their funding.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has not provided us with any numbers on 
the economic impact on advertising or sponsorship. He has raised 
the taxes by $1.50 per carton. He said that he could not go any 
higher, that the committee had advised him a greater tax increase 
would encourage the smuggling trade. Some of these numbers 
should have been given to us, for example the extra revenue the tax 
increase will generate.
<P>
	Why is it that cigarettes can be sold in B.C. for $44 a carton with 
a high taxation level, which encourages east to west smuggling? 
When people are in Toronto they go to the huge warehouses and 
buy cartons of cigarettes for $19 each whereas in B.C. they pay 
$44. They will spend $500 to save $500. It pays for the air fare. If 
they bring $1,000 they can really save money.
<P>
	When bills are presented, these things are not being explained to 
us as members of Parliament. If this type of explanation were 
given, a bill like the tobacco bill would not be debated just on the 
basis of emotion, the emotion of addiction, the emotion of what it 
is doing to youth, the emotion of something that supposedly is bad 
but nevertheless is legal. The bill could be discussed with some 
balance; the emotional arguments would be balanced with the 
economic arguments.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7536"> 7536 </A></B>
<P>
	The government has been trying to introduce the tobacco 
legislation for 14 months but has not been able to. People have 
been dying from smoking cigarettes. But when the health minister 
suddenly introduces the legislation, it has to be passed now, before 
Christmas. It has to be fast tracked because people are dying and 
that is all we are concentrating on.
<P>
	If a bill were presented along with its economic impact it would 
have to have a more thorough review at the departmental and 
ministerial levels before it even got to cabinet. If cabinet were to 
approve the bill with its financial ramifications, it would then be 
presented to us on that basis. That would make a big difference for 
all parliamentarians. Then we could make a proper balanced 
decision on these bills.
<P>
	I read the member for Durham's opening speech on this bill. He 
said that many members of Parliament end up voting just to go 
along with their party line, but they do not really understand what 
they are really voting for and why they are voting the way they are.
<P>
	I am currently a member of the Standing Committee on Public 
Accounts. We just finished reviewing chapter 17 on CPP disability. 
In his report the auditor general indicated that management is a 
problem in the civil service. I am not saying nor is he saying that it 
is mismanagement. The problem is undermanagement.
<P>
	There is not enough leadership, not enough guidance. There are 
not enough rules for the people in management to carry out 
effective control of the programs they are in charge of. There are 
not enough effective controls to say yea or nay to certain people on 
disability. The rules are archaic. They have been added on since 
1970. It is an abomination.
<P>
<B>(1335)</B>
<P>
	Some of these people in the bureaucracy need help. As 
legislators, we are the ones who are standing in the way. We have 
now given them the tools to work with so all they have to do is say 
no or yes to people and there are a lot of complaints. This type of 
bill would enable the presenter to make the proper changes and talk 
about the financial impact.
<P>
	An overall review is necessary in our CPP, which we are doing, 
but it is also needed specifically in the disability area. Since 1993 
the department has done 24,000 reassessments of long term 
disability claimants and found that 34 per cent of them no longer 
qualified but were still receiving benefits. Fortunately, over half of 
that money will be recoverable and the government will get some 
money back.
<P>
	It is a serious matter. There has to be a mechanism in the rules 
which states that we must present a cost benefit analysis of a bill or 
changes to a bill so that everybody understands not just the kind of 
society we are trying to create or the caring we want to show the 
people in  Canada but also the economic impact along with the 
emotional impact.
<P>
	It is important for us as legislators to give those in the civil 
service the tools to work with so they can do a proper job in 
effectively controlling the public purse strings. It is becoming far 
too easy for politicians to stand up and say that they just blew it. If 
that is what we say, then we are not assuming our responsibilities to 
pass good and effective legislation that will make spending more 
visible, that will make the cost of government more apparent that 
will be in the best interests of every single political party in the 
House and all Canadians whose tax dollars we suck out of their 
pocketbooks. We must know who spends it, who is accountable for 
it and how wisely the money is being spent, which is what Bill 
C-214 does.
<P>
	We could amend the bill a little by adding a sunset clause where 
it would be compulsory at the end of the fifth year to check out the 
viability of each of the programs to see if they are successful in 
achieving their desired ends.
<P>
	On the auditor general's opinion on the estimates, which is also 
to be published, I disagree a little bit with my colleague from 
Durham in this area. The job of the auditor general is to audit after 
the fact and not predict before the fact.
<P>
	The auditor general's job in auditing is to match the intent of 
government legislation and the intent of programs with the success 
or failure of achieving the objectives, which is what he is doing 
now. I believe that is something he can still do. He would be doing 
the value for money audits but for example, it would have been so 
much easier had the Minister of Health presented all the financial 
implications of the Tobacco Act.
<P>
	There is also the Endangered Species Act. How much is that 
going to cost? What is the impact of that act? There is hardly a 
member of Parliament here who knows what the impact of that bill 
will be. Why has that not been presented to us by the minister?
<P>
	We have a right to know how the money is going to be spent and 
who is going to have to pay for it. Things like that are very 
important, very critical and very crucial. I commend the member 
for Durham for bringing forward a private member's bill like this 
one.
<P>
	This is what is going to happen with this. The President of the 
Treasury Board has said: ``We must equip ourselves with better 
systems for evaluating the actions of government so that we can 
genuinely answer for actions first and foremost to our fellow 
citizens who are both clients and taxpayers''. He is not showing his 
support for this bill. He is staying neutral because he says it is a 
private member's bill. He says it is the job of the standing 
committees to ask those questions about what a bill costs and what 
money is going to be spent.
<P>
	My colleague from Lloydminster in a prior speech has pointed 
out how effective standing committees are in  getting that kind of 
information. The minister says: ``A cost analysis is given to cabinet 
confirming the financial impacts in a confidential memorandum''. 
If it is already being done, then share it with the Canadian public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7537"> 7537 </A></B>
<P>
and the House of Commons. It should not be any big deal for the 
minister to support this.
<P>
	I would just like to conclude with one comment by the member 
for Durham. I like this quote and will give him credit for it: ``The 
forces that would turn government back on the road to fiscal 
irresponsibility are at work today'', and they are still out there. 
``They ponder how to spend annualized surpluses, even though the 
debt stands at over $600 billion. This legislation will serve as a 
check on these forces''.
<P>
<B>(1340)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. George Proud (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Labour, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you for the 
opportunity to express my views to the House during the debate on 
Bill C-214.
<P>
	The bill proposes that the government make a declaration to 
Parliament of the estimated annual cost of every new program 
which it intends to implement. I welcome the opportunity the 
member for Durham has given me to remind the House of the 
progress the government has made in recent years and is continuing 
to pursue in this very important area.
<P>
	As an example, I would cite the improved reporting to 
Parliament project. This initiative responds to the need for better 
accountability. It entails working with Parliament to provide good, 
meaningful information not only on the costs of government 
programs but on the results we achieve in relation to the goals and 
objectives we set for ourselves.
<P>
	We would all agree on the importance of the initiative, given that 
these programs and the results are funded by the dollars which the 
taxpayers have entrusted to us to manage well and to deliver the 
services they expect and need from federal departments and 
agencies.
<P>
	In the improved reporting to Parliament project, the government 
is endeavouring to draw on the expertise of all stakeholders, 
parliamentarians, public servants, interested professionals and the 
clients and constituents whom we serve.
<P>
	Improved information to Parliament is also a key component of 
two other recent government initiatives, program review and 
getting government right.
<P>
	Program review is now in its second phase. We have been 
scrutinizing all federal activities to ask the questions that are 
important to us all, questions such as: What activity should the 
federal government continue to be engaged in? How should these 
activities be delivered? By what level of government? If federal, by 
which department or agency and at what cost and for which level of 
service?
<P>
	The results of the program review have been significant in a 
number of ways. We have clarified the roles, responsibilities and 
the priorities of federal departments and agencies. We have begun a 
thought process with respect to options for alternative 
organizational forums and mechanisms for program delivery.
<P>
	The bottom line is that program review means that by 1998-99, 
annual spending on federal government programs are projected to 
fall by about $9 billion and will be delivered by a smaller, more 
effective and less costly public service.
<P>
	Getting government right is a complementary initiative which 
involves the modernization of federal programs and services to 
meet our obligations as a government and the expectations of our 
clients today and in the years to come.
<P>
	I would encourage any member who has not already done so to 
read the progress report on getting government right which was 
tabled in this House on March 7, 1996. It describes what we have 
accomplished in clarifying federal roles and responsibilities in 
making the federal government work better and in rethinking 
program delivery so as to adjust to today's reality and the 
challenges ahead.
<P>
	More specifically, getting government right means ensuring that 
resources are devoted to the highest priorities, responding to the 
public demand for better and more accessible government and 
achieving more affordable government.
<P>
	In moving forward on this agenda, the government is mindful of 
the need to ensure that the role of the national government is 
preserved to meet core responsibilities. These include: 
strengthening our economy and economic union to ensure a 
prosperous country for ourselves and our children; enhancing 
social solidarity in Canada; pooling our national resources to 
achieve common goals efficiently and effectively; defending 
Canada's sovereignty; and speaking for Canadians collectively on 
the world stage.
<P>
	While I support the objective of Bill C-214, its enactment would 
only add to the cost of government without making any substantive 
improvement in the quantity and quality of information which the 
government is providing and plans to provide to Parliament.
<P>
	Consider the changes we have already benefited from in the 
1996-97 estimates documentation. In addition to part I of the 
estimates which provides an overview of federal spending, part II, 
the traditional blue book which supports the Appropriation Act, 
and the individual part IIIs, two important innovations were 
introduced.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7538"> 7538 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1345)</B>
<P>
	First, the government tabled a new document entitled ``Program 
Expenditure Detail: A Profile of Departmental Spending''. This 
document, while not formally constituting part of the estimates, 
represented an important step forward in that it combines federal 
program spending detail which was previously presented in both 
part I of the estimates and the budget. This provides a bridge 
between the budget document and other estimate documents.
<P>
	``Program Expenditure Detail: A Profile of Departmental 
Spending'' gives Parliament both an overview of program spending 
within the context of part I and program review and more detailed 
information on program spending by sector and by federal 
department. Program review's principal achievement will be 
structural changes in the business of government, many of which 
are already visible to all parliamentarians and the Canadian public.
<P>
	For example, in the transportation sector shifting from owner, 
operator or subsidizer to regulator and policy maker; and in the 
agricultural sector, in partnership with the provinces, moving from 
commodity based agricultural subsidies to a whole farm safety net, 
focusing on income stabilization rather than income support.
<P>
	Other important restructuring initiatives include withdrawing 
from programs which provide direct financial support to industry 
and addressing overlap and duplication to consolidate activities 
wherever possible, thereby making program delivery more 
efficient and more effective.
<P>
	The second phase of the program review builds on the first. 
Specific measures resulting from program review II which affect 
primarily the 1998-99 fiscal year include the rationalization of 
subsidies, privatization and commercialization where feasible, and 
further reductions in spending.
<P>
	While in some cases specific measures to implement program 
review II decisions will be developed over the next two years, it is 
clear to the government that innovation in service delivery is a key 
factor to our success.
<P>
	We want to move away from traditional hierarchical delivery 
structures to forms which are more cost effective and more 
responsive to Canadians. The creation of the three agencies 
announced in the speech from the throne and the budget is well 
under way.
<P>
	Another change which we saw in the 1996-97 main estimates in 
addition to the document profiling departmental spending was the 
tabling of six pilot part III of the estimates departmental 
expenditure plans. These documents are pilots or tests in the 
government's effort to address the concern of parliamentarians who 
have better information on the multi-year costs of government  
programs and constitute a key initiative in the improved reporting 
to Parliament project.
<P>
	I would like to take this opportunity to point out to my 
colleagues that the progress which we have seen today is only the 
beginning. The estimated costs of a program represent only one 
side of equation. The government is equally concerned with 
reporting to Parliament on the results.
<P>
	The government is currently considering mechanisms for 
reporting to Parliament on the performance of government 
programs in a more timely and complete manner; for example, the 
introduction of performance reports which would be tabled in the 
fall of each year rather than as a component of the planned 
expenditure information which we currently receive as parts of the 
estimates documentation.
<P>
	This government has made a concerted and ongoing effort to 
involve parliamentarians in shaping the form and content of the 
information which is presented to us not only on the cost of 
government programs but on their results. I believe our 
participation in this process is the key to improving the information 
for Parliament. The member for Durham shares our objective. 
However, I believe that the legislation being proposed presents 
potentially costly and ineffective alternatives to the initiatives I 
have just outlined.
<P>
	I believe that more focused, streamlined information to 
Parliament will make it easier to assess government programs. 
Information which is better organized and more user friendly will 
strengthen the accountability of government to all Canadians.
<P>
	I am grateful to have this opportunity to address the House on 
this proposal. I too wish you all a Merry Christmas and prosperous 
new year.
<P>
<B>(1350)</B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stephen Harper (Calgary West, Ref.):</B> Mr. speaker, it is a 
pleasure today to debate Bill C-214, the program cost declaration 
act tabled by the hon. member for Durham.
<P>
	Let me take a few minutes to outline the purpose of the act and 
what is behind it. The act, which is a votable item, would require 
departments of the government to provide a financial or cost 
analysis of each piece of legislation on its introduction to the House 
of Commons or at the time the minister or governor in council 
issues regulations or other instruments.
<P>
	The auditor general would certify that the method used to arrive 
at this analysis was fair and reasonable under the circumstance. 
The cost would be disclosed in total as well as based on the per 
capita cost for each Canadian citizen.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7539"> 7539 </A></B>
<P>
	This legislation would cause legislators and their departments to 
be more conscious of the financial impact their legislation would 
have. The PCDA, as it is called,  would provide for a greater degree 
of disclosure and accountability for government programs and lead 
toward a more integrated expenditure system. It would give 
members of Parliament and the public more knowledge and to that 
extent more control and scrutiny over how government spends.
<P>
	If this type of legislation had been in place years ago, I believe it 
is true that would not have so easily created the massive deficits 
and debt which the federal government is now forced to deal with.
<P>
	That really is the purpose of the legislation, as stated by the 
member for Durham. I think it is transparent that the legislation is 
worthy of support. It has been supported in statements from the 
auditor general and the Canadian Taxpayers' Federation. The 
retiring president, Mr. Jason Kenney, has said that he supports the 
legislation. James Forrest, the executive director of the Alberta 
Taxpayers' Federation, has indicated that they support it. During 
the first hour of debate it received fairly favourable reviews from 
MPs representing all the recognized parties in the House.
<P>
	I could also note that professional accounting organizations have 
also indicated their support. Marcel Latouche, president of the 
Charted Association of Certified Accountants has indicated 
support; the Certified General Accountants Association of Ontario; 
the Society of Management Accountants of New Brunswick and 
Prince Edward Island. They endorse the principles behind the bill, 
and I could go on.
<P>
	I guess the real question is why anybody would do it any other 
way. When we think about it, it is quite extraordinary that in this 
day and age governments would think of tabling and publicly 
adopting legislation without providing assessed cost information as 
part of the process.
<P>
	I do not believe there is any chief executive officer in this 
country who would go to his board or his shareholders and not be 
prepared to give a definitive cost assessment on a project that the 
company had undertaken. Nor would any intelligent head of a 
household enter into a major purchase, any purchase other than out 
of pocket, without making an assessment of the real costs over 
time.
<P>
	If anything, I think the bill probably does not go far enough. This 
is absolute bare bones, as some of my colleagues have pointed out. 
There are other things that could be done with the bill but which 
have not been done. There are no sunset clauses on any of these 
expenditures. There is actually no provision for making the targets 
that are assessed by the auditor general mandatory or for any 
amendment if the costs are out of range from the original estimate. 
There is no assessment required of benefits or of the present value 
of the cost stream. There is no requirement to indicate what the 
source of the income would be to cover the cost or how  precisely 
these sources are related to the benefits and the beneficiaries of any 
of the projects.
<P>
	This is a very small step, one that is worth pursuing and I believe 
ultimately worth adopting. However, it is not putting any kind of 
undue restrain on government, nor is it even challenging some of 
the basic Liberal philosophy that I think is ultimately the problem 
here. I may get into this later if I have time.
<P>
<B>(1355 )</B>
<P>
	This is what the member himself is ultimately up against 
because $600 billion in debt was not run up in this country by 
accident. It may have been run up through incompetence but it 
really came down to the heart of the Liberal Party philosophy and 
the philosophy of modern liberalism which is that government 
exists to spend, to transfer money from some people to other 
people for the benefit of politicians and bureaucrats, and ultimately 
it is a political and not an economic question on how resources are 
allocated. That is the philosophy of modern liberalism, not just to 
serve a dependency but to create it, to nurture it and to build big 
government around it.
<P>
	That is why we have the problems we do in this country. That is 
ultimately what the hon. member is up against in trying to move 
this bill forward not just with the philosophy of liberalism but, 
frankly, with a political party and a leadership that have to justify 
the last 30 years, justify the way things have been run. They 
surround themselves with the representatives of the old way of 
doing things. That is a problem when getting the House to look at 
this kind of measure.
<P>
	I would point out in the few moments I have left that this is not 
by any means the only measure that parliamentarians of various 
parties have tabled in this Parliament to attempt to bring modern 
cost evaluation and cost control to the federal government.
<P>
	I will mention a few of the private members' bills that are on the 
Order Paper right now, all of which relate to this kind of matter: 
Bill C-213 put forward by the hon. member for Capilano-Howe 
Sound to amend the Constitution Act to require balanced budgeting 
and spending limitations; Bill C-294 by the hon. member for St. 
Albert which would require the periodic evaluation of statutory 
programs, two-thirds of federal spending not subject to a regular 
review process; Bill C-342 by the hon. member for North 
Vancouver would require stated principles of fiscal management 
from the Minister of Finance consistent with generally accepted 
accounting principles and would require public periodic reports 
that deal with approaches to debt reduction, to balanced budgeting, 
contingency for risk and stable tax rules; Bill C-349 by the hon. 
member for Medicine Hat to require public disclosure and 
parliamentary scrutiny of federal user fees; Bill C-361 by the hon. 
member for Yorkton-Melville, the people's tax form act, which 
would give 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7540"> 7540 </A></B>
<P>
voters and taxpayers a say on their tax forms  in terms of what kind 
of federal government programs are supported and with what kind 
of tax dollars.
<P>
	There are various other propositions. I think all the ones I 
mentioned are reform propositions but there are others from 
Liberal members which deal with not just reforming spending 
directly but making government more accountable, whether it is 
through giving people more say on their tax form or through 
referendums or through reforms of the House of Commons. There 
are endless numbers of propositions. None of these has been 
addressed so far in this Parliament or seriously entertained.
<P>
	I would like to review some of the objections that have been 
raised to this type of legislation if I have time. Let me say before I 
get to that in summary that what all of these objections have in 
common, and I am sure we will hear this from the parliamentary 
secretary later, is somehow the theme that we are doing it right 
now. Everything is just fine the way it is. Cost control is really 
terrific. We now have only a $30 billion deficit this year. Therefore 
what are we really worried about when it comes to taxpayer 
dollars? The other objection is how can we afford to spend this 
money to control federal spending and to control the federal 
budget.
<P>
	These people never have any problem with spending money at 
the front end. They always find it very expensive to monitor. They 
can always afford to spend the money. They can never afford to 
have the accountant to keep the records. That is an amazing 
philosophy but it will come out in all the objections.
<P>
	As I say, there is really no valid reason for opposing this type of 
bill. It is standard practice in every other institution. The auditor 
general knows this is consistent with modern accounting practices 
and would like to see his office handle this sort of role.
<P>
<B>(1400)</B>
<P>
	I commend this bill to the House. I know that many Liberal 
members support it. They reject the old philosophy. I ask them to 
vote in favour of this legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roy Cullen (Etobicoke North, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to support the bill of the hon. member for Durham. 
Essentially the bill calls for a full disclosure of costs for any 
legislation brought before the House, any regulations that are 
enacted or any other instruments that are implemented by the 
government.
<P>
	This bill should be applauded. Canadians are demanding more 
accountability from their parliamentarians. I salute the hon. 
member for Durham for bringing this bill forward.
<P>
	In the spirit of the bill, I am sure the member looked at the costs 
of implementing this particular bill. I would say that the costs of 
implementing this bill would be very  limited. I am sure the 
member will bring forward those costs at a later date.
<P>
	Most departments and most ministers do some kind of 
accounting or cost estimating of what the implementation of 
proposed measures will cost. I am sure those numbers are 
reasonably available. What the member is saying in this bill is that 
those costs should be brought before the House.
<P>
	Too often in the past legislation has come before the House and 
has been passed without members knowing fully what the costs and 
the impacts of the legislation will be. In my view, there are 
different kinds of legislation. Some legislation costs a lot of money 
to implement and some costs very little. However, if the costs are 
not known, it is very difficult to make any kind of judgment.
<P>
	Another element can creep into legislation and that is the 
problem of incremental costs. A small piece of legislation on its 
own may not be that costly to implement, but given other 
legislation and other initiatives, the cumulative costs can be quite 
significant. The bill would provide a very transparent process. It 
would ensure that members of the House would know what the 
implementation costs of the legislation would be.
<P>
	This bill calls for that information to be prospective, not 
retrospective. What good does it do if the auditor general comes 
along later and says that a program cost X dollars and the benefits 
were less than the cost? At that point it is too late. This bill 
demands accountability up front in terms of disclosure. It is a much 
more appropriate way to deal with the issue.
<P>
	I echo what other members have said before me. The bill is a 
start. It is certainly not the full solution. It is a first step in a very 
important process.
<P>
	Other questions need to be answered when legislation is 
introduced and when regulations are implemented. For example, 
what would be the impact of legislation on other stakeholders? 
Other stakeholders could include other orders of government. It 
could mean the business community. It could mean a whole host of 
things. While the bill deals with the cost of implementing 
legislation within the federal government, we also have an 
obligation to analyse what legislation will do to other orders of 
government and to the business community.
<P>
	For example, a tool has been developed by treasury board and 
Industry Canada which is called the business impact test. It is used 
to assist legislators and departments to assess the impact of 
proposed legislation on business. The business impact test is 
affectionately referred to as the BIT. It is an important tool which 
parliamentarians should encourage. There is nothing to stop that 
information from being presented in the House when other 
legislation and costs are presented.
<P>
	When we look at the impact of legislation we should also be 
looking at alternatives. What alternatives were  looked at before the 
department brought in the legislation? Are there market instru-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7541"> 7541 </A></B>
<P>
ments that could be used as effectively? Are there voluntary means 
that could be implemented to achieve the same goals?
<P>
<B>(1405)</B>
<P>
	We have a habit of bringing in laws and legislation telling 
business how to run and operate its business instead of putting in 
legislation which sets certain standards and criteria that are 
required and allowing the business community to develop the 
processes by which it could meet those standards. When that is not 
done, it adds another cost to the burdens of government. It also 
makes business more inefficient.
<P>
	The way that laws and regulations are brought forward, 
developed and implemented are very complex. A number of 
processes are in place. Sometimes legislation is driven by the 
bureaucracy. Sometimes legislation is driven at the political level. 
Sometimes it is driven by stakeholder groups that create a demand.
<P>
	We need to be very cautious that we do not fall into the trap of 
building empires, whether it is building empires for bureaucrats, 
special interest groups or politicians. This legislation really 
provides a vehicle for a full debate, full disclosure and full 
accountability at the start of any proposed initiative.
<P>
	Often we debate legislation and the issues of public policy and 
law in this House. That is very important but too often we do not 
debate the fiscal impact of some of the initiatives that are brought 
forward.
<P>
	Perhaps if we had done more of this in the past, we would not be 
facing the fiscal challenges we face today. Now is the time to start 
on a new program, on a new footing. This bill allows us to do that.
<P>
	The effect of this bill, in my view, is that it will have a large 
deterrent effect that would be positive. In other words, private 
members or the government of the day will be reluctant to bring 
forward bills that have a heavy cost associated with them, and 
where the benefits are not clearly defined.
<P>
	Government is not like business. It cannot always put legislation 
in the context of cost and benefit in the same kind of quantifiable 
way that can be done in business. However, it does not preclude 
governments from adopting some of that rigour and applying it in 
any way it can.
<P>
	I applaud the member for bringing this forward. Legislation and 
regulations have a huge impact on the competitiveness of our 
industries. The market does not solve everything. We know that, 
and governments have a role to play.
<P>
	We need to really examine carefully the impact that regulations 
and legislation have on businesses because the capacity and the 
ability of businesses to develop jobs and economic activity will be 
partly a function of the  regulatory environment and the legislative 
environment in which they work and how that compares with those 
environments in the countries where competitors are domiciled.
<P>
	If we do not really look at those elements on an incremental 
basis or on another basis, we can put businesses on a footing where 
they are not competitive to deal internationally or even within our 
own domestic markets.
<P>
	This bill is a giant step forward. I applaud the member again for 
bringing it forward. I certainly will support it. I hope other 
members will.
<P>
	I too would like to take this opportunity to wish everybody a 
very happy and safe holiday and a prosperous new year.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Gallaway (Sarnia-Lambton, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
too am pleased to speak in support of this bill, the Program Cost 
Declaration Act, Bill C-214.
<P>
	It is said that the Canadian public is becoming cynical about the 
political process. I believe it was the American humorist Mark 
Twain who said that a cynic is a person who knows the price of 
everything but knows the value of nothing.
<P>
<B>(1410)</B>
<P>
	What the hon. member for Durham is trying to do with this bill is 
to put two concepts together. If we know the price of something and 
we know we are getting a good buy for the price then we are quite 
willing to pay for it. This bill is about how to determine the price 
and whether value for money is being given.
<P>
	I will give an example. If one was to go down to one of the 
luxury car lots not far from Parliament Hill, no doubt a car could be 
found that was worth $75,000. That is a lot of money. However, if I 
take the car out and test drive it, I may begin to feel that with all the 
bells and whistles and all the good things that are included, $75,000 
is not a lot of money to pay for the vehicle. In my opinion, $75,000 
is a lot of money for a car but if someone can afford it and it is good 
value, they will pay for it because it is not a problem.
<P>
	As legislators, we often get into programs that cost money but, at 
the same time, are good value. I am not quite as cynical as some of 
the earlier speakers from the Reform who only talked about the 
price and did not want to talk about the value. They were only 
interested in the cost because it is a personal lifestyle issue to them 
as opposed to what it means to us as Canadians or to the country as 
a whole.
<P>
	At the same time, as individuals, collectively we are entitled to 
know what the large picture cost is of this and what the individual 
or per capita cost is of the particular program.
<P>
	As an example, a couple of years ago in the province of British 
Columbia, the then minister of the  environment in that province 
wanted to introduce environmental legislation that sounded great. 
It was reformulated gasoline. It was a wonderful idea which would 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="7542"> 7542 </A></B>
<P>
have wonderful effects on the environment. People thought it was 
just what they needed and that the government should proceed with 
it.
<P>
	However, when the people of British Columbia found out that it 
was going to cost them eight cents a litre more to buy reformulated 
gasoline, they had very severe reservations and told the minister of 
the environment to back off because they wanted to think about it. 
Once the price had been leaked to them, they started to realize that 
maybe under those circumstances they were not getting good value.
<P>
	There is another side to this. As Canadians we know that health 
care costs a lot of money. Despite the fact that health care, no 
matter what country one lives in, has a large price tag attached to it, 
Canadians know that they are getting good value. If we compare 
ourselves to what I heard earlier from the Reform members, they 
are only interested in the price. They would prefer to adopt the 
American model which suggests that as an individual it does not 
matter what the price is as long as it is affordable. It does not matter 
if it is good value or not.
<P>
	In the United States we know they are spending at least 2 per 
cent to 3 per cent more of GDP on a per capita basis for health care, 
whereas we know in Canada it is expensive but collectively we get 
a better deal and it is better value. That is where we differ from the 
Reform Party in the role of government.
<P>
	However, that does not detract from what the hon. member for 
Durham is saying. I can recall in Ontario a number of years ago 
when government was growing that it was introducing all kinds of 
programs and would say: ``This is a great program and it will only 
cost you 15 cents a week or 15 cents a month''. That was one little 
department of the government keeping 15 cents here and 15 cents 
there. It all adds up at the end of the year when somebody has to 
pay for it. We know that the somebody at the end of the year is you, 
me and everyone else who was involved in the taxation system.
<P>
	I want to point out one other thing. We have also heard from the 
Reform members. They know the price of everything but the value 
of nothing.
<P>
<B>(1415)</B>
<P>
	I would like to point out a strange twist in their philosophy. They 
stand in their places here and talk about getting tough with 
criminals: ``Let us lock them up, do not give anyone the benefit of 
the doubt, do not consider the value of rehabilitation. Let us not say 
to a person: You have served your time, we will give you a second 
chance. I am a Reformer and I want to lock you up''.
<P>
	Maybe we should start costing what their criminal law 
amendments would add up to. Maybe we should sit down  and ask: 
What is the price that the Reform Party is putting on the criminal 
justice system? To you, Mr. Canadian Taxpayer, is it good value? 
Does it mean a whole lot to you that a person will be locked up 
forever? What does it mean to you as a taxpayer when we do the 
collective routine?
<P>
	I am not a cynic in the sense of the Reform philosophy that there 
is a price. I am saying to tie the two of them together. Let us look at 
the price and let us look at the value we will get from it. What is the 
overall cost and is it good value? Is it something Canadians want? 
Canadians will have to know what they are paying for.
<P>
	I realize a number of groups have endorsed this. The present 
auditor general has said that he shares the view that the cost of 
government programs and operations should be made more visible 
to Parliament and to taxpayers.
<P>
	Today I heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Labour talk about program review and that programs are being 
made more cost efficient. That is the right thing to do and as a 
member of the government I applaud that. We must do that. We 
have no choice. And we are doing that.
<P>
	But this is not a question of making programs more efficient. It 
is a question of telling people up front, right then when we 
introduce a law what it is going to cost the country and what it will 
mean to every man, woman and child in the country. Legislation 
has many yardsticks which can be applied to it. We put legislation 
to all kinds of tests, but this is the one test that has obviously been 
missing.
<P>
	I realize that this may impose an onerous burden on certain 
departments. After having heard the Parliamentary Secretary to the 
Minister of Labour speak, I think it is like a scene out of ``My Fair 
Lady'' where Eliza Doolittle was being taught English and she did 
not want to continue any more. She said that she was tired, fed up 
and could not carry on. In this case I would suggest that the 
department has no reason to be tired. It can carry on and it ought to 
carry on in the vein and with the intent, purpose and thrust of what 
the hon. member for Durham has proposed in the bill.
<P>
	It is ironic that the Alberta Taxpayers' Association has said that 
the bill is a good first kick at the can and deserves the consideration 
of members of Parliament. This is what the member has succeeded 
in doing by getting this bill to the floor of this Chamber.
<P>
	I know there are others who will speak to the bill today and in the 
future. At the same time I believe it is incumbent upon us to 
thoroughly examine the bill. In the end I believe we on this side of 
the House at least will conclude that we are not cynics but we do 
want to know the price and then we as legislators can determine 
whether this is good value for the people of Canada.
<P>

<P>

[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mark Assad (Gatineau-La Lièvre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to 
begin with, I would like to congratulate our colleague from 
Durham, for taking the initiative to introduce a bill to improve 
information on the cost of programs proposed by the government.
<P>
<B>(1420)</B>
<P>
	Our fellow countrymen, administrators, a list of accountants, 
which we have seen, and even the office of the auditor general have 
said that this initiative would be welcome. When we look at the 
enormous expenditures of the government, it is clear that we need 
mechanisms to ensure program costs are made public at least in 
general terms, given that it is impossible to have precise 
information and figures for a five-year period.
<P>
	But the primary initiative of this bill will be to help bureaucrats 
realize that Parliament, which has the last word on programs, 
requires information that is as precise information as possible, 
because we are aware of the impact, the ramifications, of program 
expenditures and do not like to find out, a year or two down the 
road, that certain programs have ended up doubling or tripling the 
original estimates.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this. This is an initiative I 
like very much. There is no doubt that many mechanisms do exist, 
as our hon. colleague from Prince Edward Island has said. There 
are mechanisms in place to control, if you will, or to give some idea 
of the costs of programs.
<P>
	However, I think that this proposal by the member for Durham 
would put our bureaucrats and, of course, ministers and deputy 
ministers, who are responsible for the various departments, on the 
alert, forcing them to make sure that the information provided is as 
accurate as possible, otherwise we are the ones who are going to 
incur the wrath of our fellow Canadians if they realize that 
expenditures were higher than anticipated.
<P>
	In the short time I had, I just wanted to draw the attention of my 
colleagues to this aspect of the bill. Such legislation deserves a lot 
of attention and certainly deserves to be debated. I hope it will help 
those responsible for program analysis to realize that we have the 
last word and that we need information that is as accurate as 
possible.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Anna Terrana (Vancouver East, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
will start by wishing happy holidays to everybody, to all Canadians 
including my constituents, and of course a very Happy New Year.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I wish a Happy New Year and a good holiday to all Canadians 
and to my colleagues. I also say to all my Italian friends: Buon 
anno a tutti miei amici italiani.
<P>
	I congratulate the hon. member for tabling a rather important 
bill. We need to have details when we vote as members of 
Parliament, and we also need to be convinced that the legislation is 
an important one for our communities.
<P>
	My only concern relates to the auditor general's involvement, 
since it could delay the passage of an act that can be extremely 
important for the country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Private members' bills are extremely important for the 
backbenchers who speak to their constituents and know what their 
problems are. There seem to be a lot of constraints on private 
members' bills. A private member's bill is the only tool a 
backbencher has. From my own experience I have introduced three 
private members' bills. They were intended to address injustices in 
the electoral act.
<P>
	Some people may not know that a private member's bill first has 
to be introduced. Then the member's name has to be drawn and 
eventually the votability of the bill has to be established. I do not 
think that the votability should have to be established. We should 
be able to present and discuss the bill and then if the debate 
collapses, it collapses.
<P>
	My first bill related to an injustice regarding political parties 
losing their party status. They had to decertify because they did not 
have 50 candidates. In British Columbia if we were to create a 
party, it would never become national because there are only 34 
seats, whereas in Quebec for instance, a provincial party could be 
made national because there are 75 seats. That is something which 
should have been addressed but unfortunately the debate collapsed.
<P>
<B>(1425)</B>
<P>
	I would like to support this bill. It is important that there be more 
accountability in what is presented to the House and I am prepared 
to support that idea. It is a good idea that we all know what we are 
voting on and we know from the beginning what the costs are going 
to be.
<P>
	Again, a very happy holiday to everybody and particularly to 
you, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Ottawa Centre, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I shall 
speak just a few minutes on the bill tabled by my colleague, the 
hon. member for Durham.
<P>
	First of all, I will congratulate my colleague for having presented 
a truly worthwhile initiative, one worthy of the House of 
Common's attention. I personally have had the opportunity to 
examine it and to ask a few questions, particularly of Treasury 
Board employees, in order to determine just what they do at the 
present time with regard to the information they provide about the 
House of Commons.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="7544"> 7544 </A></B>
<P>
	I am pleased to inform you that the main thrust of my 
colleague's proposal has already been implemented. The 
Department, and the President of Treasury Board, have undertaken 
to facilitate, and to provide far more information to members of 
Parliament than they did in the past. For example, in collaboration 
with the other political parties, they are starting to make it easier 
to obtain information and to provide far more reports, not only 
on the new government programs, but also on existing ones.
<P>
	The government has also taken very aggressive initiatives to 
ensure that Canadians have access to affordable programs which 
are appropriate to the population's needs.
<P>
	At the present time, the government is holding discussions with 
representatives of the provinces and territories with a view to 
saving money, while ensuring that the programs established to 
serve Canadians are appropriate and transparent.
<P>
	My problem with this initiative is that it will be redundant. Each 
year the auditor general makes recommendations on the 
government's operations, and then makes his report public. 
Historically, more than 65 per cent of his recommendations have 
been implemented, whereas the government and the ministers take 
action every time the auditor general makes recommendations.
<P>
	I think that it will bring in another type of bureaucracy one that 
will be more costly, especially when the government is already 
involved in implementing all manner of measures to ensure 
government transparency and the availability of information to the 
House and its members.
<P>
	I just wish to say that the 1996-97 estimates have demonstrated 
the government's serious intent, since it has taken tangible steps. It 
has not only talked about taking steps, it has taken them. I therefore 
wish to congratulate the administrators and the ministers for their 
initiative.
<P>
	Let me wish everyone a Merry Christmas, and as my colleague 
has said, <I>buon anno a tutti e grazie signor</I>.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Milliken):</B> Order. The time provided 
for the consideration of Private Members' Business has now 
expired and the order is dropped to the order of precedence on the 
Order Paper.
<P>
	Perhaps I might be permitted to say a few words.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On behalf of all of the occupants of the Chair, to my colleagues 
in the House and to everyone, I would like to wish a good holiday 
season.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I want to say how much the Chair and the other occupants of the 
chair-I say this on the part of all of us-appreciate the 
co-operation of all hon. members, of the clerks at the table, of our 
pages and of all those who make this Chamber work. Without the 
help of hundreds of people, we could not function here.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	To everyone, I would like to express holiday greetings from all 
of the hon. members of this House.

	Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. We hope we will not be 
back next week.
<P>
	It being 2.30 o'clock p.m., the House stands adjourned until
