	<B>Mrs. Christiane Gagnon (Quebec)</B> moved for leave to 
introduce Bill C-238, an act to amend the Income Tax Act (child 
support payments).
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this bill is to amend the 
Income Tax Act so that child support payments can no longer be 
deducted from the income of the individual paying child support 
and are no longer added to the income of the person receiving 
the payments. The bill ensures that child support payments are 
covered by the definition of earned income included in the 
provisions on deductions for child care expenses.

	<B>Mr. John Maloney (Erie):</B> Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing 
Order 36, I present a petition on behalf of the constituents of 
Erie. I wish I did not have to present this petition because I wish 
that the circumstances around this issue did not exist. However, 
they do.
<P>
	A growing number of Canadians are fiercely opposed to the 
importation of killer cards. This petition adds 475 names to this 
list. These cards are contrary to moral and ethical standards. 
Canadians abhor crimes of violence against persons. Killer 
trading cards offer nothing positive for our children or adults to 
admire or emulate. Rather, they contribute to violence.
<P>
	Not only do these cards glorify murder and the criminals who 
commit horrific acts of violence, but they act as a daily reminder 
to the victims, families and friends of the brutal violence that 
has struck down their loved ones as well as their security and 
faith in humanity.
<P>
	A clear message must be sent to any printing company and/or 
distributor that this material is not acceptable to Canadians. A 
great number of Erie residents are opposed to this product and I 
join them in calling for an amendment to the laws of Canada 
prohibiting the importation, distribution, sale and manufacture 
of killer cards.

<P>

<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Anderson (for the Minister of Finance)</B> moved that the 
bill be read the third time and passed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to 
lead off the debate on third reading of Bill C-9. The bill 
proposes to implement a number of amendments to the Income 
Tax Act that were announced by the previous government.
<P>
	Legislation to implement these measures was introduced last 
June but the bill died when Parliament was dissolved. For these 
measures to have legal effect new legislation must be passed 
now by this Parliament.
<P>
	Let me be clear at the start by explaining why we are going 
ahead with this legislation. Simply put, these past tax measures 
were introduced some time ago and many were said to be 
effective immediately when announced.
<P>
	Many thousands of Canadians took the government at its word 
and relied on these announcements when making important 
personal decisions. Many have, for example, used their RRSPs 
to buy or build houses. Other Canadians have relied on these 
announcements in making significant investments or hiring new 
employees.
<P>
	The commitments these taxpayers have made are for the most 
part irreversible. Consequently, if we were to reverse course 
many people would be put in a difficult position, an unfair 
situation, and the trust that Canadians have in their government, 
a trust that we must always strive to keep and enhance, will be 
dealt a powerful blow.
<P>
	However, we do not approach this question as prisoners of the 
previous government's actions or inactions, to put it more 
precisely. We have carefully reviewed the measures in this 
legislation and believe we can support them in their own right.
<P>
	With this in mind, let me review briefly the measures in this 
bill. First of all, there are measures that affect individual 
taxpayers. One is the extension of the homebuyers plan by one 
year through to March 1, 1994. As I mentioned before, to renege 
on this program would cause undue and unfair difficulties to 
many thousands of Canadians.
<P>
	As well, the legislation provides that starting next September 
certain higher income Canadians will have to make quarterly 
instalment payments on their taxes. At the same time some 
300,000 low income filers will be excused from quarterly 
payments and required to pay only once a year.
<P>
	Another area addressed by this legislation is one of the few 
small attempts of the previous government to foster job 
creation. The December 1992 economic statement announced a 
one-year program of relief for unemployment insurance 
premiums for increased employment by small businesses.
<P>
	This program has come and gone unnoticed by the far too 
many Canadians who are unemployed in this country. 
Nevertheless, a number of small business people have taken the 
government of the day at its word. We shall honour the bargain 
as a matter of public trust.
<P>
	The same considerations also apply to other measures 
targeted at small businesses. These include the temporary small 
business investment tax credit for purchases of eligible 
machinery and equipment from December 2, 1992 to December 
31, 1993; the extension of the small business financing program 
to the end of this year, allowing small businesses in financial 
difficulty to refinance up to $500,000 of debt at low interest 
rates; the removal of any limits on holdings of small business 
shares in RRSPs and RRIFs; and the extension of the 35 per cent 
investment tax credit available to small Canadian controlled 
private corporations for eligible research and developmental 
expenses.
<P>
	In addition, this legislation will give effect to some general 
improvements in the tax credit incentives offered to encourage 
Canadian research and development. As well, it removes the 
annual limits on investment tax credits. This limit introduced by 
the previous government in 1987 reduced the effectiveness of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3195"> 3195 </A></B>
<P>
the ITC incentives for rapidly growing firms, one of the engines 
of job growth in this country.
<P>
	The bill also assists resource companies by allowing 100 per 
cent of the first $2 million of oil and gas development 
expenditures to flow through directly to shareholders and be 
deducted by them. As well, it gives these companies greater 
flexibility in managing their affairs by removing the mandatory 
deduction of Canadian exploration expenses.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	Finally, the bill puts in place new, more flexible rules for 
investments in labour sponsored venture capital corporations.
<P>
	We did not hold out the measures in the bill as any solution to 
the challenge of job creation, but we do recognize the attempt. 
Of equal importance we recognize the commitments made by 
Canadians who have relied on these proposed measures.
<P>
	This bill should be viewed simply as a question of 
parliamentary housekeeping and therefore I urge members to 
support it.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>	Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome this opportunity to speak in the debate on third reading of Bill C-9. Previously, I had an opportunity to speak to this bill during the debate on second reading.
<P>
	At the time, without in any way denying the benefits of certain 
measures contained in Bill C-9 as described by my hon. 
colleague, the Secretary of State for Finance, I warned the 
present government not to make the same mistakes as the 
previous government. These mistakes are, in a way, reflected in 
Bill C-9. Let me explain.
<P>
	When we look at Bill C-9, we see that it contains measures 
which, although beneficial, indicate a lack of vision on the part 
of the previous government in dealing with a world that is 
becoming increasingly globalized. We often talk about 
globalization and opening borders, and we need measures to 
help our companies and workers adjust to these changes. These 
measures must provide a framework within which companies 
can be confident about developing their competitive potential.
<P>
	During the debate on second reading of Bill C-9, I also 
warned the present Canadian government about the kind of 
measures it should take. The budget had not yet been tabled, and 
I asked the Liberal government not to make the same mistakes as 
the previous government, which had failed to take steps to bring 
public finances under control, and as you know, our public 
finances are a disaster.
<P>
	So what has happened since the second reading of Bill C-9? 
First, the North American Free Trade Agreement was signed, 
but the present government failed to put in place measures to 
promote Quebec and Canadian companies or help them adjust to 
this new agreement, which includes Mexico. Instead, a big show 
was made of signing and implementing this Free Trade 
Agreement. The Prime Minister and his Minister for 
International  Trade played their part, just to say they had 
managed to reopen the North American Free Trade Agreement 
and introduce certain provisions on labour standards and 
protecting the environment.
<P>
	Our analysis indicates there was nothing of the sort. There 
was no bilateral or trilateral agreement with our U.S. or Mexican 
neighbours, no measures that would ensure protection for our 
social standards, our labour standards, and so forth.
<P>
	Despite all that, the Prime Minister and his Minister for 
International Trade bragged that they had obtained everything 
and that they were now quite ready, with appropriate measures, 
to face the challenge of the North American free trade.
<P>
	Meanwhile, and I had raised the issue at the time, the world 
was signing the biggest international trade deal since 1947, the 
eighth GATT Agreement. Once again, while the Prime Minister 
and the Minister for International Trade were boasting, sticking 
out their chests and thinking they had made exceptional gains on 
the North American level, they were losing on all fronts on the 
international level. The fact that this government did not 
shoulder its responsibilities could be very costly to Quebecers in 
the next few years.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	For example, there is the farming industry, where Canada, 
despite all it was saying, and in the middle of a debate on Bill 
C-9, lost clause XI.2c)(i) of the GATT, which had made 
flourishing milk and agricultural industries possible.
<P>
	The Liberal Party, when in opposition denounced the 
Conservatives for not having taken all the necessary measures to 
protect that clause. Well, the Liberals did exactly the same 
thing.
<P>
	They bragged that they had obtained everything, even though 
one of the fundamental pillars of Canadian agriculture had been 
discarded by the GATT settlement.
<P>
	We are not against the GATT settlement; quite the contrary. 
We are free-traders and we have always said so.
<P>
	We are for improvement of trade on the international level. 
We are for economic growth linked precisely with our capacity 
to produce, to export and to capture international markets.
<P>
	But it is almost indecent for the Liberal Party of Canada to tell 
us, Mr. Speaker, despite the fact that we are all intelligent 
people, that Canada won everything, at that time, and that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3196"> 3196 </A></B>
<P>
Canada, faced with market globalization, has put in place more 
consistent measures than those that are in Bill C-9.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, we also asked the Liberal government, when we 
considered Bill C-9 at first reading, not to repeat the mistakes of 
the past, not to repeat the mistakes of the Conservative 
government and to apply such a restrictive monetary policy, that 
at the peak of the recession, between the end of 1990 and the 
beginning of 1991, there was a 5 point difference between 
American and Canadian interest rates.
<P>
	It was an unacceptable situation.
<P>
	Therefore, we suggested that the government review the 
whole monetary policy to ensure a fairer balance between the 
desire to control inflation in the long term-which is a very 
commendable objective-and our short-term need to create 
permanent jobs that about 1.5 million Canadians, including 
500,000 Quebecers, are still awaiting impatiently.
<P>
	But instead of that, since first reading of Bill C-9, the 
government of Canada, that is to say the Minister of Finance, 
has appointed Mr. Thiessen, the right-hand man of John Crow, 
the former Governor of the Bank of Canada, as his successor.
<P>
	At the time of this appointment, the Governor of the Bank of 
Canada restated the monetary policy of his predecessor, which 
consisted in struggling against inflation at any rate no matter if, 
in the short term, we were following the same pattern the 
Liberals had denounced before. And yet, the need for jobs is 
desperate.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, from the first through the second readings, we 
have been asking the government not to repeat the errors made 
in the previous budgets, the Conservative budgets and in the 
present one, which shows a lack of long-term vision.
<P>
	Not only did the Liberal Party of Canada repeat the same 
mistakes, but it has done worse and that is where the actions of 
the government are most reprehensible.
<P>
	When I discussed Bill C-9, I would never have thought that 
the first Liberal budget would be so terrible, so outrageous, that 
it would be even more so than the most dreadful Conservative 
budget.
<P>
	Let us recall the facts. I think it is important when considering 
a budget, when one is about to pass budgetary measures, to 
remember that this government without vision has taken similar 
measures, sometimes harsh ones, as a result of Bill C-9.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	First, cuts of $5.5 billion in unemployment insurance over the 
next three years, by reducing the number of insurable weeks of 
employment and by targeting the poorest in years to come.
<P>
	As you know, for years members of this government 
denounced, not lightly but in the strongest possible terms, any 
Conservative initiative that they deemed antisocial. For years, 
Liberals have practically portrayed themselves as leftists. They 
portrayed themselves as champions of the poorest in our 
society; yet, as soon as they came into office, they slashed 
unemployment insurance by $5.5 billion. Since last week, 
desperate workers, unemployed people actively seeking 
employment and trying to regain their dignity, have come to 
realize that they have been fooled by this government. I 
understand that the budgetary measures reducing the number of 
insurable weeks have really been applied only since last week.
<P>
	Since then, in my own riding of Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, I 
have met desperate people. Those people are desperate because 
they had put some hope in this government and in the measures 
announced in the red book, but mainly measures announced 
elsewhere because the red book is nothing but a rag when 
assessed on its own merits. Those people had a lot of hope and 
saw this government, unlike the previous one, as a government 
that had a long-term vision, one that would create permanent 
jobs and would give them back their dignity.
<P>
	For instance, I think of Yan, 20 years old, who wants to finish 
high school but who, because of this careless government, its 
laxness and the fact that it tends to consider every request of 
Quebec regarding decentralization of labour training as a whim, 
because of that, Yan, 20 years old, living in the riding of 
Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot, will not be able to finish his job 
training. There is also the case of Jean-Yves, 45 years old, who 
will not be able to get training this year because of red tape and 
delays. He was told perhaps next year or in two years, depending 
on the federal financial support that has already been cut in 
several areas.
<P>
	Claude, 25 years old, has a university degree and is looking 
for a job, but he has just been penalized by the unemployment 
insurance reform. Claude, 55 years old, who lives in Quebec, is 
the victim of a plant closure, is unemployed and has been on 
social assistance for a week. Last week, I was really shocked by 
the story of Jacques, 35 years old. Unemployed, he was given 
training by the federal government, but by the time he entered 
the labour market, the training he had received was completely 
outdated and would not meet business needs. I met many people 
in that situation. Every week, the movement Action-chômage 
meets with many people in that situation, such as Rachel, 40 
years old and a mother of two children, who is on welfare.
<P>
	Instead of helping those people by introducing humane 
measures such as the ones we need right now to allow these 
people to go back to work, to get adequate training and to obtain 
permanent jobs, the members opposite, the Liberals, who were 
saying that they wanted to give back their hope and dignity by 
creating 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3197"> 3197 </A></B>
<P>
jobs, instead made cutbacks in unemployment insurance. I 
consider them antisocial.
<P>
	Another measure that I did not expect from a first federal 
budget, following the speech that I delivered about the Senate, is 
the lack, in that first federal budget, of concrete measures to 
promote job creation, except for the infrastructure program. We 
have nothing against the infrastructure program, but that 
program only meets about 3 per cent of market needs. There are 
1.5 million unemployed in Canada, including 450,000 in 
Quebec, and all we have to offer them are 45,000 jobs. Mr. 
Speaker, these 1.5 million unemployed Canadians will fight for 
the 45,000 jobs available; there will be violence.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	I also noticed that since the first and second readings of Bill 
C-9, this government has taken no concrete measure whatsoever 
to create jobs, permanent jobs in reasonable quantity and of 
reasonable quality. Everything concerning the creation of jobs 
has been dealt with in a shameless fashion. I am talking here 
about the Job Development Program where the government 
recently made some cuts.
<P>
	Another measure in the first Liberal budget which I could 
never have imagined coming from the Liberal Party of Canada is 
the abolition of the age credit. This government, those Liberals 
shamelessly reduce credits for seniors, they who used to 
denounce in the strongest possible terms any intention on the 
part of the Tories to take away from the seniors or any attempt to 
de-index their pensions or even cut them as was the case in the 
beginning. I thought these people were sincere and I now see 
that they never were. Under the guise of a social democratic 
approach, a humanistic approach, they have fooled the people of 
Quebec and Canada, and they will pay for that.
<P>
	Nor was I expecting a $2.5 billion cut over three years in 
Established Programs Financing, especially in the portion 
earmarked for post-secondary education. Members on the other 
side of the House-I am looking to see who is present 
today-keep talking about education, they keep telling us that 
education is of extreme importance in order to face present 
challenges, to face the growing competition that results from the 
globalization of trade. But they cut into funding for 
post-secondary education.
<P>
	Nor did I expect that the government would renege on a 
commitment made at the beginning of last year by the Liberal 
Party of Canada, maybe even in 1992 if I remember correctly the 
first statements regarding social housing. When the 
Conservatives cut the $600 million budgeted for the 
construction of new social housing units, the Liberals said that 
they would restore this financing, that they would start afresh 
with a new social housing development program. When they 
assumed power they quickly forgot that promise, and ignored 
the 350 persons who demonstrated in Ottawa three months ago 
to ask for decent housing conditions, for a dignity they lost a 
long time ago. These 350 persons were spending anywhere from 
30 to 50 per cent of their income on housing, at least. This is 
intolerable, and even more so when you hit a stone wall like the 
one that the Liberals put up.
<P>
	After giving hope to low income people I consider it indecent 
that the Liberal government is not coming through with a 
program, thus dashing the hopes of these people.
<P>
	Analysing Bill C-9 at third reading gives me a chance to 
discuss, as I did at first reading, the whole vision of the 
government that tabled this budget. I realize the government 
does not have a vision and will never have any. Why? It is the 
same basic question over and over again. Everywhere in the 
world, in any democracy, when there is no clear and democratic 
law providing for public financing of political parties, there is 
always the risk that the ruling party, upon taking control, will be 
unable as a government to make real decisions, good decisions 
such as abolishing all the fiscal inequities of our system.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	I remember very clearly that when Liberals were the Official 
Opposition they denounced almost daily the inequities of the 
federal fiscal system. They denounced tax evasions. They even 
denounced family trusts. They were probably trying to win over 
supporters of the New Democratic Party, which has almost 
disappeared since then. Along with members of the New 
Democratic Party, Liberals denounced the fiscal inequities of 
the Canadian fiscal system.
<P>
	However, since the last budget, nothing was done to redress 
the situation. Family trusts still exist enable very rich families 
to avoid paying between $350 million and one billion dollars a 
year to the federal Treasury. The same is true of numerous 
agreements between Canada and countries considered tax 
havens. They still sign the same kind of agreement; they still 
have regulations allowing businesses with parent companies in 
such tax havens to pay hardly any taxes on their profits, while 
the losses they incur in these tax havens can be deducted from 
profits made in Canada.
<P>
	Knowing what the position of the Liberal Party of Canada has 
been in the past, I cannot understand why they are doing the very 
thing they were denouncing when they were the Official 
Opposition, and why, after deceiving us for so many years, they 
are now totally lacking in vision and concern for social justice.
<P>
	In his recent budget, the finance minister did nothing along 
the lines of what we recommended during the first debate on Bill 
C-9. Worse yet, he managed to do even worse than all the 
previous Conservative budgets. Within three months, his 
budget, totally devoid of any sense, lost all credibility; even 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3198"> 3198 </A></B>
<P>
thoughhe cut $7.5 billion in social programs, the financial world 
reacted very negatively to his budget.
<P>
	This budget harms the poor and the financial world. In 
financial circles, people say that the government has lost control 
of the public finances, that it will not be able to bring the deficit 
down to 3 per cent of the GDP as it has been promising for so 
long. Finance people are not disconnected from reality, they 
have a very good analytical mind, just like the Bloc Quebecois. 
They know that the tax revenue projections in this budget are as 
unrealistic as those contained in all of the previous 
government's budgets. They know full well that since 1988 or 
thereabouts, each time Canada's GDP increases by 1 per cent, 
federal revenues do not increase by 1 per cent, but only by a 
mere 0.4 per cent.
<P>
	In other words, given the growth of the underground economy 
and the whole range of factors tied to the elasticity of tax 
revenues compared with the rate of taxation-I will spare you 
the technical details-economic growth in Canada results in 
lower tax revenues. Financial circles have their own highly 
skilled analysts who also know full well that this budget is not 
realistic and they have proven this over the past month. On 
reviewing all of the short-term and medium-term financial 
data, one can see the extreme volatility of interest rates, for 
example. The spread between interest rates on 90-day Canadian 
Treasury Bills-in my view, the most telling indicator of how 
the budget was received, of the economic situation and of the 
government's state of indebtedness-as compared to U.S. bills, 
was 213 points yesterday, when a mere two months ago, prior to 
the release of the Finance Minister's budget, the spread was only 
40 points.
<P>
	It is also clear that foreign investors have lost confidence in 
the Canadian dollar. A similar loss of confidence was 
experienced while the Conservatives were in office, but the 
situation has taken a turn for the worse under the Liberals.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	On the one hand, then, the budget contains some extremely 
unpopular measures which target the least fortunate, persons 
who should not have to suffer any more than they already do, 
while on the other hand, it caters to financial circles. The 
Canadian government will have to pay an additional $3 to $5 
billion at the end of next year in extra interest charges. The 
government is responsible for the increase in interest rates. It 
has turned its back on those who have recently renewed, or who 
will be renewing their mortgage shortly, by allowing interest 
rates to creep upward. All of this stems from the lack of 
credibility of the latest Liberal budget. This budget is as lacking 
in credibility as any of the previous Conservative budgets.
<P>
	The situation is very sad indeed, Mr. Speaker, and others share 
our opinion. The fact that the Dominion Bond Rating Service 
Ltd recognized that with this budget, Canada had failed to gain 
control over its public finances and that consequently, it lowered 
Canada's rating from AAA to AA+ is significant indeed.
<P>
	Considering that Scotiabank, Burns Fry Limited, the 
<I>Association des manufacturiers du Québec</I>, the Bank of 
Montreal, the <I>Conseil du patronat du Québec</I>, hardly a 
proponent of sovereignty, <I>Globe and Mail</I> analysts and the 
<I>Financial Post</I> all agree that the latest Liberal budget is as 
damaging as the previous Conservative budgets and totally 
lacking in credibility, then there has to be some truth in what we 
are hearing, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	When you are down to saying, as the Prime Minister did in 
this House on April 13, that the budget can be set aside, that 
what will determine what cuts and what measures to control 
spending need to be done and how public funds are to be 
managed is not that budget, but non-budgetary measures, even 
if the Prime Minister is somewhat disparaging about the latest 
Liberal budget, there is a semblance of truth somewhere in 
there.
<P>
	This means that the most recent Liberal budget is not only as 
bad as the Conservative budgets were, but actually worse, 
because never had a previous Prime Minister of Canada run 
down the budget tabled by his Minister of Finance as much as 
this Prime Minister has.
<P>
	So, and I will close on this, third reading on Bill C-9 has 
allowed me to see the progress made in the implementation of 
the measures, to see what actions this government has taken, 
after the alarm I tried to raise in my speech when Bill C-9 was 
read for the second time. I realize in the light of the actions 
taken, and the last budget in particular, that not one of the 
sensible, rational, well-thought-out recommendations made by 
the Official Opposition, recommendations that were mindful of 
social justice, human dignity, seniors, as well as young people 
actively looking for work and the unemployed, were taken into 
account for the action plan developed following the debate at 
second reading of Bill C-9.
<P>
	I was following the goings-on in the federal political arena 
long before becoming a member of Parliament and before 
having the privilege of debating with you and I used to think that 
the Conservatives were the most right-wing politicians in 
Canada's political history. I considered their actions to be 
inhumane, senseless measures that did nothing to address the 
problems resulting from overliberal budgeting or the Canadian 
government financial difficulties. I felt that the social price of 
these measures, especially the price to the less fortunate 
segment of society, was too high.
<P>
	Now I realize, Mr. Speaker, that the Liberal Party of Canada is 
even worse. Their ways are more underhanded. They cleverly 
wrap up right-wing, inhumane measures that hurt the most 
disadvantaged people in a progressive discourse, apparently 
intended to be open, humane, conciliatory, a discourse with a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3199"> 3199 </A></B>
<P>
distinctly economic flavour to it I would say, but based on 
economics of the modern kind, where economic analysis is 
combined with a profoundly humane sociological approach. It 
takes an anti-poverty stand. It takes a very economic approach, 
but a new kind of economy, which combines dollars and cents 
with a very humane sociological approach.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	So it covers its inhumane acts with its very humane-sounding 
rhetoric in order to deceive the people. From the election 
campaign until today, we have seen that this government has no 
shame about fooling the people as it has done.
<P>
	I will quote you a passage from an article by Laurent Laplante 
published in <I>Le Droit</I> on April 12. Speaking of the ineffective 
measures being taken by the Liberal Party of Canada to support 
economic growth, he says: ``The Conservatives, by 
concentrating their whole attention on the inflationary threat, 
finally dragged Canada into the first fully made-in-Canada 
recession. Mr. Martin has decided to do better; he wants to make 
this recession go on forever.'' I find that this passage says a lot 
about the difference between the Conservatives and the Liberals 
and I hope that we will soon be out of this regime with our heads 
held high, with dignity and a real plan for society, a plan to 
create jobs, a plan for full employment in a sovereign Quebec 
that is open to the world and takes a responsible attitude to the 
challenge facing us in an era of global markets.
<P>
	Thank you, Mr. Speaker for giving me this opportunity to talk 
about what this government has done since the first reading of 
Bill C-9.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Mr. Speaker, certainly it is a 
privilege to be able to make a few remarks on third reading of 
Bill C-9, an act to amend the Income Tax Act.
<P>
	I must confess that I have certain mixed feelings about 
addressing the bill. It introduces measures that were introduced 
by a previous government, and here we are today putting the 
measures into law. In a sense it is kind of a reverse process.
<P>
	When a government enacts or wishes to carry on some type of 
policy or objective it should move the legislation into the House, 
pass it and then implement the programs. We are kind of 
following a reverse procedure that certainly gives me mixed 
feelings in my legislative responsibilities. However it has 
happened and we are here today examining the bill as such.
<P>
	On the one hand it would seem only prudent that we support 
the bill. It is generally referred to as a housekeeping bill. As I 
have said, much of the policy in it has been enacted during the 
past year and we are just getting around to proclaiming the law 
today.
<P>
	In my presentation I will not pretend for a minute that it would 
be anything but irresponsible of us to oppose these measures 
merely on principle because of the circumstances. On the other 
hand I wish to make clear there are some principles to which I 
am strongly opposed, as is the Reform Party.
<P>
	The Income Tax Act, as we all know, has become a very 
unwieldy monster symbolizing what many Canadians see as the 
problem with government in general and that in general there is 
just too much government for all of us.
<P>
	The last attempt by a government to amend the text and 
change it led to other kinds of reforms. It led to an income tax 
surtax, an alternate minimum tax, tax deductions, tax credits 
and the complicated GST that is before the finance committee at 
the present time. All these have rather confused the matter.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	We as Reformers believe it is time to review the Income Tax 
Act and the variety of methods and means by which we collect 
funds to operate government. We think it is most important at 
this point in time. Even the forms need revision.
<P>
	Today I was given an article from a newspaper about the fact 
that Revenue Canada workers have been issued a memo inviting 
them to consult with some of their colleagues in filling out their 
tax returns. The memo says: ``The time for filing your income 
tax return is approaching. Should you require any information or 
assistance in the preparation of your return, you may contact one 
of the employees whose name and location appear below''.
<P>
	Not all citizens of Canada have that privilege, but the point we 
want to make is made by the writer of the article and others who 
have commented on it: if tax department employees cannot 
figure out how to fill out their own returns, imagine how the rest 
of Canadians feel. That is a very apt comment under the 
circumstances.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> Make all MPs do it here. That will help.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Speaker (Lethbridge):</B> Right. That is what should 
happen here, to see if we need consultation or not.
<P>
	That is an impression. It is certainly a comment on the 
complications of the Income Tax Act. I want to speak about that 
in my remarks today and where we feel the process should go in 
reviewing the tax collection system of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to make clear there are some good aspects to the 
bill. We would like to see the government continue with some of 
these programs and certainly improve on them as we proceed in 
the legislative session.
<P>
	We know young people today cannot afford to buy homes 
because they are paying too much tax. We should look at some of 
the details. While total incomes per capita have increased 170 
per cent in the last 10 years  total direct personal taxes have risen 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3200"> 3200 </A></B>
<P>
some 235 per cent. How are we doing with respect to other 
countries?
<P>
	Canadian government revenues as a percentage of gross 
domestic product have increased from 24 per cent in 1950 to 
almost 43 per cent in 1990. Also six years ago the tax burden in 
Canada was approximately 20 per cent higher than that of the 
United States. By 1992 it had risen to 25 per cent and was 
projected to increase to 30 per cent by 1997. My recent reading 
of statistics indicates that we are at that point today. It is not just 
young people who are feeling the tax burden; it is all Canadians.
<P>
	The homebuyers plan that allows those saving for homes to 
withdraw from their RRSPs to make down payments is and was a 
good idea. It not only puts the dream of home ownership within 
the grasp of more people. It provides economic spinoffs all the 
way down the line.
<P>
	A poll released in September 1993 by the Canadian Real 
Estate Association confirmed that the homebuyers plan was a 
big success. The Angus Reid poll was conducted in five major 
Canadian cities. First of all it found that four out of five buyers 
who used the plan said it was an important factor in their 
decision. It was especially important for 86 per cent of first time 
buyers.
<P>
	Second, nearly half or 49 per cent said it would have been 
unlikely they would have been able to buy their homes without 
the plan.
<P>
	Third, the plan helped a significant number of home buyers 
surveyed: 22 per cent of all first time home buyers and 17 per 
cent of buyers generally.
<P>
	Fourth, repaying their RRSPs is a high priority. Eighty-one 
per cent of respondents said it was important to repay. Fully 88 
per cent said they would repay at least at the rate required by the 
plan. Only 4 per cent said they would not repay and would 
declare their withdrawals as income.
<P>
	Fifth, home ownership was seen by 84 per cent of those 
surveyed as being at least somewhat important to retirement 
planning. Fifty-four per cent said it was very important. Owning 
a home was rated by far the most important source of income for 
retirement.
<P>
	Sixth, the Department of Finance has already reported that the 
numbers have been very impressive with nearly 200,000 
participants to the end of July 1993. These are indeed impressive 
numbers. As we well know the number of housing starts is a 
reliable indicator of the overall health of the economy.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The housing industry directly employs, to name a few, general 
contractors, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, drywallers, 
painters, landscapers, building product suppliers, real estate 
agents and lawyers. We are encouraged by such measures as the 
homebuyers plan and the results it has had. I am sure the limited 
extension of that program will be of benefit to many other 
Canadians.
<P>
	In more general terms it is our hope the new government 
makes meaningful, effective reforms of the Income Tax Act, as I 
have already mentioned, with an aim to simplifying the process 
and certainly making it less complicated and fairer.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party support a taxation policy that has as 
its principle the objective of raising funds to pay directly for 
government programs. We support a balanced budget concept. If 
we look at the history of the act it was originally intended to 
collect taxes to ideally pay for the services provided by 
government. Somewhere along the line we have lost the original 
intent of the tax system and have allowed it to become a tool to 
influence the behaviour of people. As well we have used it as a 
social reform instrument rather than a means by which to collect 
funds to pay for services. That is inappropriate and has moved us 
away from a rational responsible budget process.
<P>
	I say in a general sense now, and certainly some of my 
colleagues will talk about it in detail as the weeks proceed. We 
should be working toward a more simple, visible, proportional 
system of taxation: the flat tax that many people talk about or the 
single tax. We believe it could be fair, more applicable, more 
easily administered and more easily understood by the people 
who have to take responsibility for sending revenue to 
government each year.
<P>
	As we sit here today to assent to the amendments before us 
that were proposed by the last government, I cannot help but be a 
little cautious in my optimism. All of us in the House should not 
need reminding of the resounding message sent to the last 
government on October 25. We must be responsible in our 
deliberations and make sure we are responding to the needs of 
Canadians, not to our needs as either a government, an 
opposition party or individual MPs. We cannot allow ourselves 
to slip into those ways even in the slightest.
<P>
	I call upon government members to assure us they will give 
reform of the Income Tax Act the priority it deserves. In the 
hearings of the finance committee on a variety of proposals to 
change the GST, to fix the GST or on other options, one point 
made by a major number of presenters was that we needed to 
look at all taxing instruments of government and come up with a 
plan that is fair, more co-ordinated and more responsive to the 
needs of Canadians. At the present time they feel they are not 
co-ordinated. Often because of that some people in our 
economic system are taxed to a greater extent than others.
<P>
	If the government makes a commitment to make the 
reforming of the Income Tax Act a high priority, it shows us as 
the opposition party that it is making good on its promise of a 
new way of doing business. It also sends a strong message to the 
provinces that they should follow the lead of the federal 
government. Most important, it shows Canadians that there is 
hope for a new way of government. We cannot let fear of media 
or any 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3201"> 3201 </A></B>
<P>
other  kind of pressure inhibit our effort at reform. We have to 
try.
<P>
	In closing I take a moment to remind my colleagues in the 
House that there is a big, fast moving and exciting world beyond 
these walls. In my brief experience in this House I am often 
amazed at how this simple fact gets lost in the daily shuffle of 
papers this institution is confronted with. We often get 
distracted from some of our major causes or our major concerns. 
However we have to recognize there is another world out there 
where they are throwing around words and we are doing it in this 
House as well. They are words like information superhighway. 
We as legislators must strive to keep up and be ready for change.
<P>
<B>(1100) </B>
<P>
	I leave this portion of the debate with this final thought. 
Failure is not fatal, but in these times failure to change might be.

	<B>Mr. David Walker (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Finance):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today to rise and speak in 
favour of the motion to refer the issue of the electoral 
boundaries readjustment process to the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	The current process of adjusting constituency boundaries by 
independent commissions has been in existence since 1964 
when the Liberal government of Lester Pearson passed the 
Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act. Before then the House 
of Commons itself was responsible for electoral boundaries 
readjustment.
<P>
	The current process has been in place since 1964. After 30 
years the time has come for a fundamental review of all aspects 
of this process by the House of Commons which passed the 1964 
law in the first place.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	On April 13, 1994 this House adopted Bill C-18. It provides 
for a suspension of the current electoral boundaries 
readjustment process for a period of 24 months in order to allow 
for a fundamental review of all aspects of the process. All 
aspects of this matter should be reviewed by the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs in a thorough and 
thoughtful manner.
<P>
	Some dissatisfaction has been expressed with regard to the 
current process. I would like to take a few minutes to elaborate 
on this.
<P>
	For example, the commissions published their initial 
proposals without having a chance to obtain input from 
interested parties. When published therefore, these proposals 
often come as a complete surprise.
<P>
	From my former days as a political science professor at the 
University of Winnipeg when I followed the electoral 
boundaries review process in a more dispassionate way, I can 
tell you those in the academic community who were watching 
the process were indeed surprised by the results at times. They 
were more surprised at how difficult it was to learn in detail 
exactly how the new boundaries were set.
<P>
	Although some commissions explain the reasons for the 
proposals, they are not required to do so. It is therefore very 
difficult for a person who intends to make representations, to 
intervene with a commission, to know the reasons behind the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3202"> 3202 </A></B>
<P>
proposal and to make objections or present alternatives in an 
effective manner. In that respect the public participation process 
is not what it should have been.
<P>
	The criteria the commissions must use to set the boundaries 
may have to be rethought. The criteria are quite general and, 
depending on the approach taken by each commission, the 
rationale for drawing electoral boundaries can differ 
considerably from one province to another. That has created a 
lot of controversy in this process for setting boundaries since 
1964.
<P>
	The continual increase in the number of members in the 
House of Commons after each census is another issue of some 
concern. Since Confederation the number of seats in the House 
of Commons has increased steadily from 181 in 1867 to the 
current level of 295. All of us have heard the electors express 
frustration with the constant growth of government, the size of 
the House of Commons and the cost associated with Parliament. 
This issue should not be passed over lightly.
<P>
	The above examples are but a few of the areas that should be 
thoroughly reviewed by the standing committee. The 
government has therefore decided to ask the House of Commons 
to refer the electoral boundaries readjustment process to the 
House of Commons Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs for review and to develop improvements to the 
current procedure.
<P>
	The standing committee's terms of reference provide that it 
can bring in a bill respecting the system of readjusting the 
boundaries of electoral districts.
<P>
	The committee shall consider the general operation over the 
past 30 years of the Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act, 
including the following major issues: whether there should be a 
continual increase in the number of members in the House of 
Commons after each census as now provided in section 51 of the 
Constitution Act; a review of the method of selection of 
members of the electoral boundaries commissions; a review of 
the proceedings of the commissions, including whether they 
ought to make alterations to the boundaries of existing electoral 
districts wherever possible; and a review of the involvement of 
the public and of the House of Commons in the work of the 
commissions.
<P>
	I may add to that if we make improvements, as this House 
does in so many other areas in the way we deal with the country, 
in the way we involve people, then many of the problems we 
meet in a process such as we have in the last month in this 
particular domain will be solved. It is incumbent upon all 
parliamentarians to think of ways to improve public 
participation, in the ways in which the general public influence 
such major decisions such as the nature, shape and composition 
of their constituencies.
<P>
<B>(1110 ) </B>
<P>
	This committee is to report no later than December 16, 1994.
<P>
	Using one of the new procedures adopted by the House when 
it approved the government's parliamentary reform package at 
the outset of this Parliament, the committee will be authorized 
to frame legislation implementing its proposals.
<P>
	Again there are benchmarks in the new House where we try to 
convince Canadians and try to show by example that we are 
serious about the role of individual members, serious about the 
role of people outside of the ministries doing work as 
fundamental as preparing legislation. As I said, this will turn out 
to be a benchmark in the way we redevelop this House and its 
approach to problems.
<P>
	This will be the first opportunity for a parliamentary 
committee to initiate legislation in response to requests 
submitted by the government. We are following through on our 
commitment to strengthen the role of members of Parliament in 
developing legislation.
<P>
	The redistribution of electoral boundaries is an important 
matter for the whole country. We are requesting the standing 
committee to not only study the issue but to develop and 
recommend legislative measures it feels may be required to 
solve this problem.
<P>
	In conclusion, the readjustment of electoral boundaries 
touches important questions of democratic representation in the 
House of Commons. Now is the ideal time to have a thorough 
review of the process undertaken by the House of Commons 
itself and to hear Canadians from coast to coast to coast through 
the standing committee. The committee hearings will be public 
and outside witnesses will be heard.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, previous 
speeches made in this House pointed out the essentially 
democratic nature of the Bloc Quebecois and, in this regard, its 
willingness to respect the integrity and autonomy of the people 
it represents in every county of Quebec.
<P>
	One of our party's basic objectives, particularly in 
anticipation of Quebec's independence, is to exercise the 
democratic process as widely as possible.
<P>
	Today we take this opportunity to support government motion 
M-10 proposing that the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs be instructed to prepare and bring in a bill 
respecting the system of readjusting the boundaries of electoral 
districts.
<P>
	Our goal in supporting motion M-10 is, as you know, to 
respect the regional integrity of these communities without 
hampering the regional decentralization process currently 
taking place in Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3203"> 3203 </A></B>
<P>
	However, the Bloc Quebecois will only support this 
government motion on certain conditions.
<P>
	First, we must denounce, once again, the arbitrary and 
inconsistent new boundaries drawn up in recent years and, in 
this regard, we must also mention the importance of 
administrative divisions in Quebec.
<P>
	Not only are these administrative zones strategically 
important for Quebec but they are based on fundamental 
geographical, economic, industrial and cultural elements.
<P>
	As long as Quebec remains, in spite of itself, a member of the 
Canadian Confederation, the federal commissions responsible 
for readjusting electoral boundaries will have to consider 
regional municipalities, counties and administrative regions.
<P>
	As we said in a previous speech, our second reservation about 
motion M-10 is that the decentralization of decision-making 
powers should, in our opinion, be an essential element of 
regional policy in the year 2000.
<P>
	The Canadian policy advocated by a Liberal government big 
on centralization lacks a socio-economic development 
perspective.
<P>
	We see the decentralization of political and economic 
decision-making as essential to creating jobs in RCMs.
<P>
	In line with Minister Picotte's reform and the consolidation of 
regional development councils, the Bloc Quebecois has made a 
commitment to direct political and economic decision-making 
to the regions.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois proposes that the State of Quebec no 
longer act alone in planning coherent economic development. In 
our view, the general framework for this development must be 
redefined, starting with the regions. Decentralization of the 
bureaucratic monster which the central State has become 
requires Quebec's political sovereignty.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois wants to go beyond changes to the 
political structure. We recommend regional self-management 
based on fundamental democracy. We advocate the creation of 
highly decentralized and antibureaucratic organizations. In 
short, we reject the authoritarian social and economic 
management policies which are pursued by the unified political 
power representing central States and which are ruining the 
public finances of Canada and Quebec.
<P>
	A two-year moratorium, during which decentralization of the 
decision-making process will be stepped up under the Parti 
Quebecois in Quebec, will allow riding residents to concentrate 
more on ensuring regional development rather than on building 
a Canada that can never be.
<P>
	For all these reasons, the Bloc Quebecois recommends that 
the entire federal Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act be 
reformulated, and that the process be undertaken as soon as 
possible within the framework of the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs.
<P>
	We must take advantage of the two-year moratorium on the 
redistribution of electoral boundaries to weigh carefully all the 
implications of adjustments of this nature to ridings.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I stand here 
today as a very proud member of the House of Commons 
representing the province of British Columbia. The reason I say 
it that way is because with all due respect to my Liberal 
counterparts from our province, they have remained silent on 
this issue. It is an issue of great concern to the people of British 
Columbia.
<P>
	We received by fax a copy of a letter that our premier sent to 
the Prime Minister. I will read part of it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>I am appalled that your government, with the support of six B.C. Liberal MPs, 
has betrayed the best interests of British Columbia in introducing this measure 
with closure. Your actions will deny B.C. its fair representation in the House of 
Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He goes on to point out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As you know, with the defeat of the Charlottetown accord, B.C. lost gains it 
made in that agreement which would have given this province five more seats 
before the 2001 census. That was to build on scheduled redistribution for 1996 
when B.C.'s representation in the House of Commons was to increase by two 
seats. This was a clear recognition of B.C.'s severe under-representation in the 
House of Commons.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	At the risk of being branded one of those crazy BCers, here we 
go all over again, let me also state that I am a proud Canadian 
citizen. I stand for a united Canada as I believe the vast majority 
of people in B.C. do.
<P>
	However, why is it that every time we turn around in British 
Columbia measures are taken in this place, even when we have 
representatives on the government side, that we do not consider 
to be rational and fair representation? We feel we are almost 
being abandoned.
<P>
	The leader of the opposition, Mr. Gordon Campbell, also 
wrote to the Prime Minister. He states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Minister, the bill makes no sense.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He is referring to Bill C-18.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Parliament does not strengthen the country by disenfranchising its fastest 
growing region nor does Parliament strengthen its bond to the people it serves 
by further weakening the principle of one person, one vote.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	One of the interesting things I have found since coming to 
Ottawa is that the amount of news that flows in this direction 
into the awareness of people in central Canada about the 
concerns of the people of British Columbia seems to be 
minuscule. If I did not have my constituency office in Cranbrook 
constantly feeding me information from the western press I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3204"> 3204 </A></B>
<P>
would think that it did not even exist. For the interest of the 
House I might  mention that Mr. Mel Smith, former 
constitutional adviser to the province of British Columbia, in 
the lead paragraph in an article he has just written says: ``British 
Columbians of every political stripe should be up in arms over 
the current scheme by the government to subvert the most 
fundamental principle of democratic society, representation by 
population and in the process deprive British Columbia of seats 
it is entitled to in the next House of Commons''.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	What can we do to get proper representation for the province 
of British Columbia? We recognize that we do have one 
particular anomaly with respect to representation by population 
and that is Prince Edward Island where the average population 
per seat ranges between 30,000 and 34,000. So be it. It is a fact 
of history. It is an anomaly.
<P>
	What about the province of Ontario? Under distribution as we 
currently have it, seats range in population from 63,000 to 
209,000. I would suspect that the constituents that are 
represented by the member for Mississauga West must be 
wondering why the Liberal government in absolute union stood 
up en masse and said that was fine. For Mississauga West we can 
have 209,000 population versus 63,000 population. It is all 
right.
<P>
	It is fair and good to say we are going to redistribute the seats 
in Parliament. We are going to do things differently. We are 
going to go into the process. However someone has suggested 
that many of the processes in Ottawa resemble glacial time. An 
ice age will come and go. We are going to be fighting the next 
election based on 1981 census figures.
<P>
	What has happened in metropolitan Toronto? What has 
happened in Alberta? What has happened in Vancouver? In these 
areas we have had an absolute explosion of population and now 
these people are under-represented.
<P>
	Let me also state that another problem is one of geography. 
Coming from an area that is bounded by mountains I recognize 
the difficulty in representing the number of people that I 
represent versus the number of people that are represented in 
constituencies in greater Vancouver. Again we have anomalies 
or variances. It is something we will have to discuss when we are 
talking about geography because of travel and distances. As a 
consequence substantial dollars are spent. If I, as a member of 
Parliament, am going to be representing more people we are 
going to be into more costs.
<P>
	The Reform Party stands for representation by population in 
the lower House. We suggest that this motion is a tactic, it is a 
fait accompli because the Liberal government used closure to 
inflict on us these anomalies. Perhaps we even have to take a 
closer look at the other place. We are currently represented by 
people appointed there.
<P>
	Canadians should be aware of the fact that Premier Filmon, as 
I understand it, is presently taking a look at the possibility of 
putting a ballot forward at the next provincial election in 
Manitoba in the same way that the province of Alberta did 
concerning the election of a senator.
<P>
	I would suggest to all Canadians watching this broadcast that 
they give serious consideration to writing the premier and 
supporting him in the hope of getting proper representation 
within Canada. In the lower House we would have 
representation by population, if indeed we ever get around to it, 
and in the upper House we would have at least one more of the <I>E</I>s 
which would be an elected member in that Chamber.
<P>
	I listened with interest to the Secretary of State when he 
mentioned that the results of redistribution were published 
without input. Perhaps some people would find it amusing that 
he is bringing up the point just at a time when we will be having 
public input. At the time when ordinary Canadians were going to 
have the opportunity to have input to this most fundamental part 
of our democratic process, the Liberals shut down the process. 
That is rather interesting.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	However, to make something good of something bad, we 
recognize there is a strong desire on the part of all Canadians to 
see a cap on the number of members of Parliament. The 
secretary stated that earlier in the debate. He said that Canadians 
are tired of the continual increase. Canadians want to see a 
change.
<P>
	Therefore, I would like to move an amendment to the motion. 
I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting paragraph (a) and substituting the 
following:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``(a) a formula to cap or reduce the number of seats in the House of Commons:''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 
my address I shall focus on the aspect of the motion of whether 
the number of MPs should continually increase. In the course of 
this I shall include some thoughts on the geographical and 
electoral boundary concerns.
<P>
	In keeping with the concept of representation by population or 
each MP representing approximately an equal number of 
Canadians citizens, two factors influence this. One is the 
constant increase in the number of Canadians and the other 
would be the movement of the population within our borders.
<P>
	Two options present themselves as methods of achieving this 
representation by population, the first one being that we could 
establish the number of MPs we would have in the House and 
divide that number into the total number of Canadians to obtain 
the number of citizens that each MP would represent. This 
representation number becomes the variable that would change 
each time we address this process.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3205"> 3205 </A></B>
<P>
	The second option would be the reverse of the first. That 
would be to establish the number of Canadians that an MP would 
represent and divide that number into the total number of 
Canadians. This would make the number of MPs the variable 
that would change each time we reviewed and updated this 
process.
<P>
	Two points to note are that regardless of which option is 
employed the electoral boundaries of constituencies will 
change.  In both options the existing boundaries within our 
country do not influence the designating of federal electoral 
boundaries. It is strictly on head count.
<P>
<B>(1130) </B>
<P>
	Before moving on to the geographic concerns I wish to 
comment further on these two options. I favour the establishing 
of a given number of MPs, say 295, and increasing the number 
each represents as required.
<P>
	If we were to do the opposite and increase the number of MPs 
each time we would be creating problems that would repeat 
themselves each time we updated our electoral representation or 
legislation and we would look for solutions each time.
<P>
	The first problem that comes to mind is accommodation of the 
added MPs. A possible solution to this requires an expansion of 
this building or the room and that in turn would generate or 
create the problem of finding the dollars to pay for it. The 
expansion of this building or the room would not apply if we had 
a cap on the numbers of MPs and increased the numbers they 
represented each time.
<P>
	A second possible solution to increasing the number of MPs is 
to utilize the communication highway where we could all stay at 
home and chat with each other from there. The ramifications of 
this present a debate in itself and is best left for some other day. I 
cannot help but wonder that if this ever came to pass considering 
the size of our country the first obstacle that we would probably 
debate would be the start and finish times of MP duty times.
<P>
	A third possible solution to increasing the number of MPs, 
and this would be taken over using this approach over a long 
period of time, is that we could possibly end up with so many 
MPs that the solutions to address that issue at that time may be 
such things as shift work or breaking up into small groups of 
MPs and rotating one or two of us through the House Monday 
through Friday.
<P>
	To get back to the reality of now, we have 295 members and 
the House is full. There is probably not even enough room here 
now to suggest a renovation activity to provide the same amount 
of leg room for the MPs in the top three rows as in the bottom 
two rows. We are that full.
<P>
	If each member spoke for 20 minutes and then responded to 10 
minutes questions or comments we would need 147.5 hours of 
agenda time. Along with this we are in Ottawa approximately 26 
weeks of 52, or half a year, and if each of these weeks were 
allowed 25 hours of  agenda time, we would have a total 650 
hours. If we divided that by the number of MPs and each 
participated, each one of us would be able to speak 2.2 times a 
year.
<P>
	By increasing the number of MPs we would decrease the 
number of opportunities that each of us would have to 
participate in the debates in this House and other business. 
There is not time.
<P>
	Keeping the number of MPs in the House constant and varying 
the number that each represents can create some problems or 
concerns. The most notable would be the inequity in the number 
of square miles of each constituency. To achieve the numbers 
involved in the two options the densely populated areas would 
be geographically small and the less dense would be large to 
horrendously large.
<P>
	A possible solution to this and in keeping with representation 
by population is to address the process aspect of this procedure 
and adjust the MPs' constituency budgets to accommodate this. 
For example, in small geographic areas one constituency office 
is close enough to each constituent to allow them to visit their 
MP when he or she is in the area. In large geographic areas two 
or more offices may be necessary to achieve this same effect. 
Along with the budget adjustments to accommodate the extra 
offices we would probably have to look at travel expenses. This 
implies a cost consideration. A cost consideration would also be 
applicable if we increased the number of MPs. There may be 
other possible solutions within the process area to address this 
issue.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	Another possible concern in relation to keeping the number of 
MPs constant would be the ability of the MP to adequately 
represent the ever increasing numbers of citizens. I believe the 
solution to this concern lies within the realms of communicating 
and the availability of the communication vehicles to do so.
<P>
	To comment on the electoral boundaries for a moment, we 
seem to have restricted our approach to establishing federal 
electoral boundaries by attempting to work within some of the 
existing internal boundaries. We have three levels of 
government and all are elected by the people and each have a 
specific number of elected representatives. City and municipal 
governments do not divide their areas into boundaries. Their 
geographic areas are small enough not to.
<P>
	Provincial governments have larger areas and do divide them, 
not necessarily according to the city or municipal boundaries 
but according to population numbers.
<P>
	A possible approach to this on the federal scene is to consider 
the boundaries on the federal scene as those of the country and 
again the whole area would be divided according to population.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3206"> 3206 </A></B>
<P>
	In closing, capping the number of MPs in the House of 
Commons and achieving the concept of representation by 
population through the adjustment of the number of citizens 
each MP would represent and establishing electoral boundaries 
accordingly is the solution I favour.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
a few thoughts to add to this motion to refer the matter of 
redistribution to a committee of this House and on the 
amendment of the member for Kootenay East to look at capping 
the number of members of the House of Commons. I have seven 
short points to make on that, the perfect number for those in the 
House who would like to have something to count.
<P>
	First, we need to look at the cost considerations of increasing 
numbers of members in the House of Commons. The Canadian 
public is becoming increasingly critical of the cost of its 
government, the inefficiencies it perceives in the allocation of 
moneys that go to support government; the budgets, the support 
systems, the salary costs, the pension costs. All of the liabilities 
that we incur as a country because of increased representation 
should be a factor because they concern the taxpaying public.
<P>
	Second, and this has been mentioned, the physical limitations 
of the House of Commons are a consideration for us and another 
reason to support the amendment that has been brought forward 
to this motion.
<P>
	We have now a very full complement of seats in this House. 
Many members, especially those members considerably larger 
than I, have complained about the cramped space for the work of 
debates and participation in the House. It is very clear that 
adding more bodies and more physical demands on the space in 
the House is going to be very difficult to accommodate.
<P>
	Third, particularly in the system we have had to date there is a 
very limited role for many of our members of Parliament, 
particularly backbench members of the government. The 
decisions generally are made and taken by cabinet and those 
who advise cabinet. The purpose of the backbenchers in the 
House seems to be to support those decisions. Simply having 
more people standing up and voting for decisions that are taken 
by a small group does not seem to be a very needed addition to 
the way our system works at this time.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	Fourth, it is fair to say that most Canadians would not see an 
increase in the number of members of Parliament as being equal 
to better representation for them. I believe from talking to 
Canadians and from comments that many of us have heard 
across the country that most Canadians would argue that they are 
not as well represented today as they were 10 years ago, even 
though the number of seats has increased. It is not the number, 
the quantity of representation, it is the quality of representation 
that is important to Canadians. It is clear that it is the quality of 
representation that Canadians want to see addressed, not the 
quantity.
<P>
	Fifth, these points have been made and I think bear repeating. 
Canada is over represented as a population compared with other 
democracies. For example, in the United States members of 
Congress number about a hundred more than in Canada with 10 
times the population. They have only about 30 per cent more 
representation with 10 times the population.
<P>
	It is very clear that other democracies manage to give quality 
representation with far fewer representatives per component of 
the population. We need to look at that as well.
<P>
	Sixth, it should be emphasized that Canadians want fewer 
politicians. We do hear this over and over and this is not 
disputed. All members of the House when we discussed these 
issues agreed that the feedback they get from their constituents 
and from other people in Canada is that they do not want to see 
more politicians, they do not want to see more representatives, 
they do not want to see more MPs. They want to see the ones who 
are here be more effective, they want the system to be changed 
so that decisions are more representative of the judgment of 
Canadians. There is no cry for increased numbers of 
representatives.
<P>
	We should not forget who we are supposed to serve. Our 
decisions should be taken in a way that meets with the approval, 
that carries the judgment of the people who are paying the bill, 
the people who are asking for the service that we provide. It is 
very clear that Canadians do want fewer representatives rather 
than more.
<P>
	Seventh, when we talk about capping the number of MPs, how 
do we address the problem of regional representation? In my 
view it would be unwise to make regional representation too 
strong a feature in how we structure the way our representatives 
are chosen and the proportions from particular provinces or 
areas. It is clear that we do have some anomalies like Prince 
Edward Island, which has been mentioned, which perhaps need 
special consideration.
<P>
	In our view the principle of representation by population 
should be adhered to as closely as possible in the way we 
structure the choosing of our members of Parliament. Regional 
representation and the need for that element in our political 
system, in our law making bodies, should be addressed through 
changes to the Senate rather than through changes to the House 
of Commons to ensure that certain proportions are made and do 
not change for different regions or provinces.
<P>
	We have put forward as the Reform Party specific proposals 
for the reform of the other place in order to achieve those 
objectives.
<P>
	The bottom line today when we consider whether to support 
the amendments that have been proposed is whether we are 
responsive as members of Parliament to the clear wishes of our 
constituents and the citizens of this country, to the economic 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3207"> 3207 </A></B>
<P>
resources which they are able to provide for the operations of 
government, and to considerations of fairness and practicality.
<P>
	Canadians would welcome a commitment on the part of this 
House to limit the number of representatives they must support 
and instead work more on increasing the quality of 
representation rather than the quantity of representation.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	I urge members of the House to support the amendment that 
has been put forward and to instruct the committee of the House 
working on these issues on our behalf to factor into the 
proposals it brings back to us at the end of its deliberations a 
specific proposal to cap the number of members of Parliament 
and, if possible, to reduce it.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the remarks of the hon. member who just spoke were 
very sensible and well thought out. Her predecessor in the 
debate suggested that it might be worthwhile to say a word or 
two in support of the concept of reducing the number of 
politicians in the Canadian political system.
<P>
	We have 295 members of Parliament in the House. Some 
years ago we had a total of 181. When I was last a member there 
were 265. With due respect to everybody in the House, I do not 
believe the efficiency of a political body increases with 
increases in numbers of members.
<P>
	The member quite correctly, and with some precision, pointed 
out that we were overpoliticized compared to some other 
jurisdictions and that we had more politicians per capita than 
many others. As I heard her words I made a quick calculation on 
the back of an envelope and would like to suggest that the United 
States senate would need 1,500 members to have the same 
representation proportionate to population that we have in 
Canada with the House of Commons. I suggest the hon. lady is 
quite correct in saying that an attempt to increase the size of the 
House depending on a formula in relation to numbers of voters 
and representatives would ultimately destroy the efficiency and 
effectiveness of the political body.
<P>
	I suggest the United States senate with its 100 members is a 
body that works quite effectively. To have 1,500 members would 
create a body which would not work effectively. Therefore 
within those two parameters we can all determine where the 
appropriate level should be. The comments made are well 
worthy of careful thought.
<P>
	Canadians have legislatures with large numbers of people. 
Over 15 years the legislature of British Columbia increased 
from 55 seats to 75 seats. If we continue that rate of increase in 
the legislatures of the provinces, if we continue the rate of 
increase in the Parliament of Canada, the House of Commons of 
Canada, we will wind up with quite ineffective chambers in 
terms of rational, logical debate. That is one point.
<P>
	These chambers are designed for one person speaking at one 
time. The more people we squeeze into them, the more limits we 
need on what they can say and the more rules about time limits 
or their opportunity to represent their constituents. Those points 
must be taken into account as well.
<P>
	For example, with no disrespect, we are not many here today. 
It was possible with an uncrowded House for us to listen to each 
of the speakers. That happens when we are in smaller groups. We 
listen to one another. We tend to go through the logic and say: 
``Gee, that makes sense'' or ``Boy, that is dead wrong''. We tend 
to listen. How many people in the House today have not risen, 
made a speech and sat down afterward just a little irritated that 
everybody was doing something else, that it was simply a speech 
for <I>Hansard</I>, or that it was not part of the vital process of 
democracy?
<P>
	We must remember that as we constantly increase the size of 
the House the effectiveness of the body is less and less, and more 
and more we are simply speaking for the record, speaking for the 
newspapers or speaking for some other purpose than a true 
debate among members of the House.
<P>
	Again with no disrespect to this body I believe, looking at my 
experience in politics at both levels of government, that with 55 
members in the British Columbia legislature we spent a lot more 
time in debate thinking about what the other person was saying, 
listening to what the other person was saying, and adjusting our 
ideas in accordance with what the other person was saying. 
Without suggesting that the House of Commons should have 55 
seats, I simply say that smaller bodies tend to be more effective 
political organizations from that point of view. I was most struck 
by the words of the hon. member and the previous speaker from 
another party. I am quite willing to say that I am in complete 
agreement with much of what she said. The House is too big. My 
personal belief is that it would be more effective in the range 
between 220 and 260 seats rather than over 300. It will be over 
300 if we do not adopt the process of cutting it back.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	I supported the process of putting the whole business of the 
number of seats to a committee because I believed that the 
300-member point was a tripwire. If we cannot keep the House 
below 300 members we can kiss goodbye any real effort to cut 
the costs of government in Canada at the political level. If we 
cannot do something to cut back on the cost of government and 
at the same time to increase efficiency, why bother asking other 
elements of government such as the civil service to try it? We as 
politicians should think very closely about the importance of 
cutbacks on numbers.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3208"> 3208 </A></B>
<P>
	As we know this process is to send the whole issue of 
redistribution to a committee. That was proposed by the 
minister. That was spoken to very eloquently by the hon. 
parliamentary secretary and spoken to, I might add, in general 
terms very eloquently by members of the opposition.
<P>
	I am not a believer in curbing the committee with caps, 
restraints or limitations. I believe we should let the committee 
decide what is appropriate after it has heard from people on the 
issues involved. I trust the hon. member who has just spoken 
will be a member of the committee. Her views on the issue are 
very attractive to me. It may be that considerations will come 
forward that will modify her views or mine as the case may be. I 
do not believe we should be setting limits on the committee and 
attempting to determine the outcome of its deliberations before 
it actually meets to consider the issue of redistribution.
<P>
	I do not wish to take any more time, except to say that the 
concept of cutting back on the number of seats in the House of 
Commons or the concept of cutting back on the number of 
elected representatives in the provincial legislatures is 
extremely attractive. Only if we start making these bodies more 
effective can we make individual members more effective 
parliamentarians and representatives of their constituencies.
<P>
	Therefore I applaud the thrust of the argument of the previous 
two speakers. I am attracted to it. I am quite willing to say that 
while they may be on the other side of the House they have met a 
very responsive chord on the government benches, as indeed 
they know full well frequently happens. We wish to incorporate 
their views on the issue of redistribution and on the issue of how 
many seats there should be.
<P>
	My final point, again in agreement with the hon. member, is 
that when she stated there should be proper representation 
across the country based upon population she was dead right. We 
can make the odd exception. We have always made an exception 
for P.E.I., but that is the exception that should prove the rule. 
The rule is rep by pop. The general rule, given the limitations of 
large areas of the country with very few people and making 
allowances here and there for special circumstances, is rep by 
pop.
<P>
	Therefore I do not see the approach of turning over the 
boundary commission proposals to a committee of the House to 
be anything in the nature of taking something away from a 
province. For instance, my hon. colleague from Ontario is 
listening to me at the moment. I do not think our proposal is to 
take four seats away from Ontario which would otherwise occur. 
I do not think our proposal is to take two seats away from British 
Columbia. It is a question of saying that we have reached the 
point where the House will have over 300 seats and it is now 
time to do something about it.
<P>
	Mr. Pearson was probably right in the sixties, some 30 years 
ago, to set up this type of system. However it has ground on 
remorselessly giving the House more and more members and it 
is now time for us to call a halt to automatic mechanisms that 
simply churn out more expense for the public and perhaps 
reduce the efficiency of the House. That is why I am happy to 
support the government's approach in this regard and to 
commend hon. members on their speeches.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Silye (Calgary Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, I follow on the 
heels of the Minister of National Revenue who pointed out that 
there were some advantages in the proposals made by members 
of our party. I appreciate his candour, his openness and his 
willingness to enter into a spirit of non-partisanship on 
something as important as this matter.
<P>
	There is no question the cost of government is ever 
increasing. The only way we can put a halt to it is through 
attrition. We should not increase the size of the House. The 
committee should be given direction. All we are asking in our 
amendment is for the committee to be given enough direction or 
encouragement to consider the possible downsizing of the 
House of Commons and to consider the possible freezing or 
setting of the cap at 295 for the House of Commons, as we are 
presently designed now.
<P>
	All we are asking in our amendment is that these points be 
made to the committee for its consideration. If after due 
deliberation the committee comes back and says in the spirit and 
principle of rep by pop or in the spirit and principle of the act of 
Confederation that it must continue its present course, so be it.
<P>
	We happen to believe the committee should be given the 
opportunity, the authority and the right to come back to the 
House with a report reflecting and including representation by 
population and the fact, as the member for Calgary North 
pointed out, that increasing the size of the House does not 
necessarily mean it will perform any better.
<P>
	We have a government, a cabinet and what we call 
backbenchers. Backbenchers are usually assigned to various 
committees. They select the various chairmen of committees. 
Sometimes cabinet gives good leadership and cabinet ministers 
give those corresponding committees direction, responsibility 
and duties. However that is in the minority.
<P>
	In the majority of cases cabinet ministers give no direction to 
their subcommittees or their committees, give no follow up to 
those committees and give token appearances to the 
committees. Sooner or later during the course of the Parliament 
they lose interest and know they are there to vote on a partisan 
basis.
<P>
	In return for the support of the Minister of National Revenue 
on this issue I would commend about four or five cabinet 
ministers of the government who have given their various 
committees direction, who have given them  some authority to 
report back and get the feel and the will of the people. I believe 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3209"> 3209 </A></B>
<P>
the chairmen of these committees and the members of 
government on those committees feel like they are making a 
contribution.
<P>
	If that continues we can do some good for Canada and 
Canadians. However, if they do not do it, that is where I say 
increasing the size is just a waste of time and money. We have to 
reduce the cost of doing business in Parliament. We have to 
reduce the cost of doing business for government. We have to set 
the example.
<P>
	When the Minister of National Revenue proposed Bill C-2 he 
indicated that he wanted to amalgamate two deputy ministers 
into one. It was an effort to streamline and lower the cost of 
doing business yet increase the efficiency and the effectiveness 
of government. We will be watching to see if the new super 
deputy minister of national revenue, taxation, customs and 
excise lowers the cost of the department, improves the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the services within the 
department and achieves the aims and objectives of the bill. We 
will be watching. Hopefully that will come about.
<P>
	I would like to get back to representation by population. There 
are two ways to continue the principle of equal representation. 
We are not really on representation by population. We know that 
on the principle of what was guaranteed to Prince Edward Island 
in joining Confederation. It was guaranteed a minimum of four 
seats no matter what its population became.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	Therefore what we are trying to do is come as close to 
representation by population as possible and emulate that 
principle in theory. Right now there are two options available to 
us.
<P>
	The first option is to continue on the present course. Every 
eight years when there is a redistribution calculation we would 
look at the population shift and then increase the number of 
seats. That is representation by population and we would be 
giving everybody what they want. Consequently that is what 
increases the cost and size of government and we wish to 
diminish and reduce that.
<P>
	The second option is to stray away from that philosophy, that 
principle and that theory which is flawed. Let us try to improve 
and accept a new theory that would look at redistribution and the 
formula for both urban and rural areas.
<P>
	Whether the size of the House of Commons is the current 295 
or it goes back to 260 or in the range the Minister of National 
Revenue recommended of between 220 and 260, whatever that 
number becomes, the size would be capped. Then future 
redistributions and future principles of following equal 
representation or representation by population could be 
accommodated in both rural and urban areas by simply 
reallocating the ministers in those areas and changing the 
boundaries to  reflect the shift in population rather than adding 
the number of people.
<P>
	Let me repeat for the purposes of the committee and for the 
purposes of my contribution to this debate. I am suggesting if 
the size of the House of Commons were set at a fixed number we 
could still be a democratic institution and still respect 
redistribution on the basis of shifting the boundaries but not 
increasing the number of people. That is something I hope the 
committee looks at.
<P>
	The other point is the problem with the Senate which has to be 
addressed. We have to some day very soon look at this 
institution which can be elected, equal and effective. We can 
work together rather than always degrading that other House.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Is the House ready for the 
question?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Question.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The question is on the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. I had 
understood the amendment to read ``including the possibility of 
a formula or cap to reduce''. Are those words not in the 
amendment? That is what I had understood.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I thank the hon. member 
for Calgary North for her intervention. If she will give me a 
moment, I will consult with the table officers and do a 
verification of the amendment.
<P>
	The amendment was correct in its first form. The question is 
on the amendment. Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the 
amendment?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="CONTROLLEDDRUGSANDSUBSTANCESACT">CONTROLLED DRUGS AND SUBSTANCES ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed, from February 18, consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-7, an Act respecting the control of certain 
drugs, their precursors and other substances and to amend 
certain other Acts and repeal the Narcotic Control Act in 
consequence thereof, be read the second time and referred to a 
committee.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pierrette Venne (Saint-Hubert):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
Minister of Health tabled Bill C-7, an Act respecting the control 
of certain drugs, their precursors and other substances, but this 
legislation has nothing to do with public health.
<P>
	The government is not being honest in tabling a bill under 
such misleading pretence. This bill concerns criminal law and 
nothing else. In its present form, it should bear the signature of 
the Minister of Justice or the Solicitor General.
<P>
	Whichever way you look at it, it is hard to find in this muddled 
document anything but a new criminal law to control drugs. 
Therefore, for the purposes of this debate, I will assume that this 
legislation is nothing else than what it appears to be. Obviously, 
the government would want us to believe that this is a health bill, 
and for one reason only: Criminal laws have to be precise, clear 
and conclusive. They are passed by Parliament and leave very 
little leeway to cabinet regarding the definition of their scope. 
By making Bill C-7 look like an administrative measure, all the 
provisions allowing Cabinet to establish regulations become 
justified. This is perhaps the most comprehensive example of 
legislation by delegation.
<P>
<B>(1210) </B>
<P>
	There is no other reason why the government would claim that 
Bill C-7 is a public health measure. The pretence is simply too 
obvious. The Liberal government is trying to get full decision 
powers on the most important aspects of the legislation. It has 
neither the courage nor the honesty to tell Canadians that Bill 
C-7 is merely an attempt to fight drug trafficking. Why not be 
honest? Why is the government hiding its true motive? The 
government should admit that it is so suspicious of this House, 
that it tries to hide its real intentions. And those intentions are 
contained in the wording of the legislation.
<P>
	Police forces are currently enforcing two complementary 
acts: the Narcotic Control Act which will be repealed by the bill 
before the House and the Food and Drugs Act, which will be 
repealed in part. The government maintains that the new act will 
give more flexibility to police services, because provocation 
and undercover activities will be authorized under the new 
regulations.
<P>
	However, the explanatory notes of the bill are silent on the 
government's concerns regarding public health. The purpose of 
this legislation is obviously to control the movement of drugs 
and suppress trafficking. Why not clearly say so?
<P>
	This is nothing but a new Narcotic Control Act, framework 
legislation, unique in itself, criminal legislation which gives 
cabinet exceptional discretionary powers as to its scope and its 
implementation, not unlike the former War Measures Act. This 
is the context in which we have to consider Bill C-7.
<P>
	Having said so, I agree with the majority of Canadians that we 
have to provide police and judicial authorities with the tools 
they need to efficiently suppress drug trafficking. Therefore, I 
support the purpose of Bill C-7, to the extent that it tries to put a 
stop to the movement of drugs. From massive importing to 
individual possession, the legislative drafters covered all social 
problems associated with illegal drugs.
<P>
	On this particular topic, I want to say that I am very pleased 
with the way the various stages of trafficking are dealt with. The 
bill considers separately such issues as drug production, and 
importing and exporting, offenses which carry a maximum 
sentence of life imprisonment. The exemplary nature of such 
sentences and deterrence must continue to apply. Harsh 
sentences such as those will not shock honest citizens.
<P>
	Zero tolerance for illegal drugs means suppression by police 
and judicial authorities at all levels of distribution. So, I am 
pleased with the new classification provided in this bill. 
Offenses, like simple possession, trafficking, possession for 
purpose of trafficking, importing and exporting, production of 
substance, possession of property obtained by trafficking and 
laundering are now very well identified. Each category is treated 
according to the seriousness of the offence and carries 
proportionate sentences.
<P>
	I do have some reservations about the way possession of 
cannabis is handled, but that issue can be reviewed by the 
parliamentary committee, and I look forward to the testimony of 
experts in this field.
<P>
	This bill could meet with our approval if it were to lead to 
some true legislation, but unfortunately it is not the case. Bill 
C-7 is essentially the same as Bill C-85 which was brought in by 
the late Conservative government. The government party cannot 
claim to have created this initiative.
<P>
	It would be a mistake to try to make people believe that this is 
a new measure, inspired and motivated by recent circumstances 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3211"> 3211 </A></B>
<P>
and designed to give the police effective emergency powers of 
investigation on trans-border Indian reserves.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	This is misinformation. This piece of legislation has been on 
the back-burner since Bill C-85 died on the Order Paper in the 
last Parliament. It was revived by the Liberals who have just 
missed an opportunity to produce a bill that would be easy to 
read and to understand and that would respect the jurisdiction of 
the Confederated States, which are still called provinces.
<P>
	I am disappointed, because if the legislation is passed as it is, 
it may well miss the point, above all because it will be torn to 
shreds by the courts on the account of its lack of clarity and of its 
possible unconstitutionality.
<P>
	I am disappointed also because we are again faced with a 
botched and improvised measure. Indeed, if Bill C-7 were to be 
passed exactly as it is, it would not be understandable for most 
Canadians, who have no legal training and who would need 
whole legal essays to distinguish all its subtleties and references 
to other laws.
<P>
	Allow me to read two quotes taken from an outstanding study 
conducted by professors Usprich and Salomon, of the School of 
Law of the University of Western Ontario on the old Bill C-85, 
which I myself apply to the current bill. I think these comments 
are as valid for C-7 as they were for the old C-85, and I quote:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>It would not be exaggerated to say that the bill reads generally as if it had 
been drafted by people who are not familiar with criminal law and who have 
acquired their experience writing legal texts on income tax-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In general, the legislation is badly written and even if we disregard several 
blatant mistakes, it is uselessly complex and generally difficult to understand. 
We consider this bill to be a step backward.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And yet, if it were only for the inaccuracy of the text, it would 
still be possible to send the minister back to the drawing board, 
but there is more. The federal legislator uses a style that is 
confusing, complex and twisted to describe and define very 
simple cases of trafficking, production and possession of illegal 
substances.
<P>
	The bill often refers to other legislation for its interpretation 
and this makes for an obscure text with countless legal nuances 
and exceptions, a text so incomplete as to need Cabinet 
regulations before its final scope can be known.
<P>
	We all want the bill to achieve its underlying objectives but 
we denounce the insufficient means it proposes to fight drug 
traffickers, who will successfully challenge it in court at the first 
opportunity. This is an amateurish piece of legislation, Mr. 
Speaker, mere window-dressing.
<P>
	This bill should be sent back to the minister, not the Minister 
of Health, but the Minister of Justice, to be completely rewritten 
and brought back to the House as soon as possible. We will give 
our unconditional support to a complete, simple and effective 
bill in the same spirit, but not this one which was drafted by 
people who are completely out of touch with reality.
<P>
	We are told that this would be an improvement compared to 
the present legislation, and that the bill is needed to control 
illegal activities on the Mohawk reserves. Nothing is farther 
from the truth. I challenge anyone to find something in this bill 
that gives the police more effective power than the present 
legislation does.
<P>
	Finally, this bill is unacceptable because it is outright 
interference in provincial jurisdiction over civil law procedure 
and the administration of justice. In the disguise of a bill on 
public health, the government is actually trying to impose a real 
code of legal and administrative procedure. The administration 
of justice inside a province is its exclusive jurisdiction, as is 
public health, by the way.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Whether you approach the constitutional study of this bill 
from either of these aspects, namely public health or the 
administration of justice, the conclusion is the same: it is an 
unacceptable encroachment upon areas under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	In order to ensure compliance with the forthcoming 
regulations, the bill allows the Minister of Health to designate 
inspectors who have considerable powers. As long as these 
inspectors do nothing else but examine stocks of designated 
substances held by licence holders, there will not be any 
problems. I think that the minister responsible for enforcing the 
legislation must have the administrative means to fulfil his or 
her mandate. But the bill authorises these same federal 
inspectors to contravene any provincial legislation regarding 
the confidentiality of medical records.
<P>
	Quebec's privacy legislation, particularly with regard to 
access to medical records, serves as model. Through its Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms, its new Civil Code and its privacy 
legislation, Quebec has become a world leader in this area. In 
particular, medical records in Quebec are better protected than a 
fortress. Now, the Minister of Health introduces a bill that 
would authorize any federal inspector, whose qualifications 
could be inversely proportional to his or her partisan activities, 
to enter the place of business of a physician or a pharmacist, to 
demand access to records and computer data, to make copies of 
this information and to distribute it to all kinds of people within 
the federal government. We do not accept that.
<P>
	Nor do we accept that, in a much more insidious way, the 
legislation authorizes the cabinet to make compliance 
regulations that will manifestly go beyond the scope of the bill 
and that will constitute new attacks on provincial jurisdiction. 
The minister has done her homework poorly, and, moreover, she 
leaves it to Cabinet to finish the job. Clause 54 empowers 
Cabinet to make regulations on what the legislation does not 
cover. Not only does the legislation say nothing about important 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3212"> 3212 </A></B>
<P>
aspects of its implementation but we do not even know which 
minister will be responsible for it. This will be up to Cabinet to 
decide.
<P>
	Even the professional corporations that should be the first to 
be concerned by this new legislation do not know whether their 
members will be affected by the bill. Again, it will be up to 
Cabinet to decide whether pharmacists, veterinarians, doctors 
and dentists will have to get a licence to sell and distribute 
designated drugs. If this were not legislation in the field of 
criminal law, we might be willing to leave it to Cabinet to make 
regulations. As in the case of several other pieces of legislation, 
we would only have to define parameters in framework 
legislation and give Cabinet extensive regulatory powers. In 
administrative matters, there is no great risk in proceeding that 
way. To the extent that Cabinet does not go beyond the powers 
with which it has been entrusted by Parliament, the regulations 
are generally valid.
<P>
	It is quite another thing in criminal matters, for the citizen 
ought not to be forced to read every order in council to 
understand the content and the import of the bill. Yet with this 
legislation we are asked to give the cabinet the power to impose 
its will. Who can believe that we will accept, for instance, that 
Cabinet could use its regulatory powers to legislate on the 
conduct of members of the professions governed by the Quebec 
Professional Code? The activities of doctors, pharmacists, 
veterinarians and dentists in Quebec are exclusively regulated 
by legislation that controls the practice of their professions.
<P>
	In addition to being submitted to their organization's 
monitoring, professionals in Quebec are governed by the 
Professional Code. When the government proposes that the 
cabinet be given the authority to determine the conditions of 
practice of certain professions, it is asking us to make a clean 
sweep of provincial jurisdiction in that matter, to disregard the 
exclusive privileges of professional corporations and to grant 
itself supreme authority over the main fields of activity of 
pharmacists.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	We cannot tolerate that this government would take advantage 
of a piece of criminal legislation to give Cabinet regulatory 
powers that so blatantly intrude into provincial jurisdiction on 
professional practice.
<P>
	Here are two examples.
<P>
	When the bill, in the preamble to clause 54, entrusts to 
Cabinet the regulation of the medical use of drugs, it deals with 
medical practice and not drug control.
<P>
	When the bill gives to Cabinet all powers over the sale, supply 
and administration of drugs, it deals with the provision of 
pharmaceutical, dental or veterinary services.
<P>
	When the bill gives to Cabinet the power to deliver licences 
for the sale of controlled substances, its affects the provision of 
all pharmaceutical services.
<P>
	When the bill hands over to Cabinet the authority over the sale 
and storage of those substances, over professional qualifications 
of people authorized to sell them, over records those persons 
should keep, over the dealings of a professional corporation 
with its members, it is really a code of ethics and a whole set of 
regulations that the government is trying to impose to 
pharmacists.
<P>
	We could go on for hours about this bill, which ignores the 
fact that the Constitution of this country is based on a division of 
powers.
<P>
	Two recent initiatives confirm our misgivings.
<P>
	The bill has still not been passed and debate at second reading 
has yet to be completed and two ministers, with contempt for 
basic decency, announce enforcement regulations which show 
how much power Cabinet seeks.
<P>
	I said that this bill was incomplete. I now add that it is only a 
general and confusing preamble to a series of regulations that 
Cabinet will be empowered to adopt at its whim and for any 
reason.
<P>
	The Solicitor General announced, in a tendentious press 
release that the police would have a clear and definite legislative 
basis for engaging in clandestine activities.
<P>
	What the minister does not say is that this clear and definite 
legislative basis for new police powers will be in the regulations 
and not in the law.
<P>
	This technique could be called legislative trickery.
<P>
	It is a blatant lack of respect for Parliament. As if we could not 
legislate intelligently in this House as the cabinet can behind 
closed doors.
<P>
	And the Minister of Health announced through the media that 
growing cannabis could be allowed for commercial purposes.
<P>
	This government is trying to acquire full powers. It is 
presenting a bill only for the sake of appearances.
<P>
	It is not surprising that the Minister of Health, who is 
apparently sponsoring the bill, announces without batting an 
eyelash that she is already trying to amend the law without going 
through the House.
<P>
	That shows what little consideration this governement has for 
the elected members of this House.
<P>
	We will vote against this piece of legislation which is badly 
written and thrown together and cannot hide the ambitions of the 
government to regulate professions that fall under exclusive 
provincial jurisdiction and gives Cabinet unacceptable and 
excessive regulatory authority.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened 
to some of the speech of the hon. member opposite. Perhaps my 
reading of the bill is different than hers but my understanding of 
the bill is that it is basically a codification of regulations that 
currently exist under two other acts.
<P>
	I know that in the last Parliament when the Liberal Party was 
in opposition we fought very hard against government by 
regulation on many bills that were put before this place. We 
believe that when measures impact on the people of the country 
by way of regulation, wherever possible they should be codified. 
If flexibility is needed that is fine, but the place to debate major 
changes is certainly on the floor of the House of Commons. It is 
my understanding that we are not going in the direction of 
further regulation but we are going in the direction of 
codification of existing regulations under some acts.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	She spoke for a bit about the pharmaceutical industry. I can 
certainly tell her that when Bill C-91 hit the floor there was 
great debate on all sides about the impact of that bill on both 
sides of industry plus consumers in the health care sector of 
Canada. One of the major things that this side fought for, and we 
had a particular point of view on it, was that the regulations 
inherent in that piece of legislation had to at least go before a 
parliamentary committee to be debated.
<P>
	I do not know what the position of the members on her side 
was. I think they did support the bill but we did not. That was one 
of the reasons. We believe strongly that when we are dealing 
with things such as C-91 and indeed when we are dealing with 
enforcement under the Narcotics Control Act or the Food and 
Drug Act the place these regulatory changes should be debated 
is here on the floor of the House.
<P>
	I would like to get her comments because she did mention the 
pharmaceutical industry. I would like for her to sort of broaden 
that out because I did not quite buy her argument insofar as it 
related to the pharmaceutical industry in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Venne:</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all, we are talking about the 
regulations which cabinet makes from time to time, as I said in 
my speech. In fact, cabinet may propose regulations in the case 
of administrative laws but not in the case of criminal legislation. 
However, the present wording of the bill gives the government 
or cabinet the right to make criminal laws.
<P>
	We had a similar case in the debate on gun control legislation, 
and at the time it was said that the regulations would have to be 
tabled in the House 30 days before adoption and publication, 
during which time they could be discussed in the House. That is 
what we decided, and that is what will happen in the case of our 
gun control legislation.
<P>
	As for the second part of the hon. member's question in which 
he referred to the lack of response on the part of pharmacists and 
the general public, who do not see these things the way I do, I 
simply want to say there is no response at the present time 
because they do not feel concerned by this legislation. They are 
not mentioned in the bill. Why should they respond? The same 
applies to dentists and physicians. At the present time, no one is 
responding and no one is concerned by the bill. Why? Because 
for the time being, the individuals and professions that will be in 
this bill have not been identified.
<P>
	So this is one way to get legislation through Parliament 
without people realizing what is going on, until the regulations 
are tabled and people are told these apply to veterinarians, 
physicians and dentists, and then they will react, but it will be 
too late.
<P>
	That is why, as a member of the opposition, I see it as my duty 
to condemn these practices the government is trying to get 
through the House.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Margaret Bridgman (Surrey North):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to inform the House that the Reform Party members 
will be dividing their time.
<P>
	This bill deals with substances as listed in schedules I through 
IV and involves those substances that: ``when introduced into 
our bodies produce a stimulant, depressant and/or 
hallucinogenic effect''.
<P>
	I have some concerns regarding the clarity and the continuity 
of the intent in some areas of this bill. It is a large bill and to 
illustrate my point I will select a few sections to indicate this 
lack of clarity or continuity.
<P>
	Commencing with section 23 and a few thereafter, this section 
involves the disposing of controlled substances. The bill states, 
and I paraphrase, that any person may apply to the justice in 
writing and within 60 days of the seizure date of the substances 
for their return. If the justice is satisfied a person applying is the 
lawful owner or legally entitled to possession of the substance, 
and if the minister does not have reasonable grounds regarding 
the safety of the substance and the justice agrees that the 
substance need not be disposed of, then the substance will be 
returned to the legally recognized owner.
<P>
<B>(1235 ) </B>
<P>
	The minister can do this also in another situation and in that 
case the legal owner gets paid for the amount of the drugs. 
Considering this disposal when a legal owner is recognized, if 
the substance here is not required as evidence, the bill provides 
for the owner, if he or she wishes, to give consent to have the 
minister dispose of the substance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3214"> 3214 </A></B>
<P>
	On the other hand the bill does not appear to provide this 
option to the owner if the substance is required for evidence. He 
or she gets it back. This could be an oversight or it could be an 
intent.
<P>
	Other areas lacking clarity are sections 28 and 25. In section 
28: ``The minister may cause to be destroyed, on notification of 
the Attorney General, any illegally produced plant from which a 
substance under schedule I, II or III may be extracted''. The 
decision is made by the minister and the plant can be disposed of 
by informing the Attorney General before any controlled 
substance is produced from it.
<P>
	It is assumed that in this scenario the plant has been seen by 
the minister as a potential public health or a safety hazard. In 
section 25, if the minister has reasonable grounds to believe that 
the controlled substance constitutes a potential security or 
health and safety hazard, notice is given to the Attorney General 
again but at this point a justice is required to be satisfied with the 
minister's belief before the substance will be ordered forfeited 
to the crown for the minister to dispose of. In this case it appears 
that a justice is making the decision to have the drug disposed of.
<P>
	Here it appears that the minister has the authority to dispose 
of the plants before the components become controlled 
substances. Once they become controlled substances the 
agreement from a justice must also be obtained. This may be the 
intent and if so I recommend a little more clarity or rationale to 
eliminate the questioning of this concept.
<P>
	To leave the disposal section of the bill, I would like to look at 
the first few sections, specifically sections 2 and 3. These seem 
to allow for some substances not listed in the schedules to fall 
within the jurisdiction of the proposed act based on either their 
chemical composition or their effect on the human body or both.
<P>
	This could be the beginning of potential problems in that the 
medical practitioner or the pharmacist or some other medical 
person is left with the decision as to whether the particular 
substance not listed in the schedules could or would not be 
considered a controlled substance.
<P>
	Making this decision based on the chemical composition of 
the substance may be straightforward. Making the decision 
based on the effects on the human body is not. An example that 
comes to mind would be a substance that may on occasions in 
some people produce side effects that could be seen to fall 
within the parameters of the bill as stated now and may on the 
other hand not produce those side effects in other people.
<P>
	I assume the intent of these sections of the bill is to provide a 
control mechanism for those substances created between the 
updating of the schedules, that those substances that may indeed 
end up as being classified as controlled substances when the 
schedules are updated. In this regard, I recommend that 
mechanisms be built into the bill that allow for frequent 
updating of the schedules  without having to review or address 
the entire bill or act each time.
<P>
	One possible solution may be the removal of the schedules 
which list the substances by name, which are from the actual 
content of the bill and appended to the bill and yet have a 
detailed description of the types of substances that would be 
listed on the schedules. Have that within the bill.
<P>
	There are a couple of other aspects that I would like to address 
quickly. I am running short of time. One is the monitoring of 
prescription records and this is presently being done by 
Canada's bureau of dangerous drugs. I believe the data are 
submitted once every 60 days. The bill tends to suggest they 
would be submitted every 30 days.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	I would question or wonder about the feasibility of this as an 
increased workload for both those submitting the data and those 
receiving the data, and if indeed receiving the data more 
frequently would enhance the effectiveness of the monitoring 
of, and thus more control over, these adverse situations.
<P>
	The second clarification needed is in relation to criminal 
charges. Apparently the bill provides for criminal charges to be 
laid if a person is in possession of drugs that are in schedules I 
and II. If they are in possession of drugs that are in schedule III 
the intent for trafficking would have to be proven.
<P>
	In closing, I would have to oppose this bill based on lack of 
clarity in a number of areas.
<P>
	Also at this time I would like to propose an amendment to the 
motion. I move:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the motion be amended by deleting the words after the word ``that'' and 
substituting the following therefor:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>``Bill C-7, an act respecting the control of certain drugs, their precursors and other 
substances and to amend certain other acts and repeal the Narcotic Control Act in 
consequence thereof, be not now read a second time but that the order be discharged, 
the bill withdrawn and the subject matter be referred to the Standing Committee on 
Justice and Legal Affairs.''</BLOCKQUOTE>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The amendment is in 
order.
<P>
	Resuming debate, the hon. member for New 
Westminster-Burnaby.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul E. Forseth (New Westminster-Burnaby):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to respond to Bill C-7 
presented by the Minister of Health.
<P>
	This bill is a near duplicate of Bill C-85 from the 34th 
Parliament. From my counting it is 71 pages, a considerable 
piece of legislation. I understand that this bill, like all bills, is 
not the beginning of something. It is more correctly seen as the 
end product, the result of much deliberation, consultation and 
thousands of hours of work by many.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3215"> 3215 </A></B>
<P>
	This bill is a major realignment of drug control legislation, 
specifically an act respecting the control of certain drugs, their 
precursors and other substances, and to amend certain other acts 
and repeal the Narcotic Control Act. The first flag of concern is 
that this bill is presented by the Minister of Health. It amends 
the contents of the Criminal Code of which the Narcotic Control 
Act and federal drug act have traditionally been part. It is now 
seen as health legislation rather than behavioural control 
legislation that is commonly known as the criminal law.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	I am directly suggesting that there is joint responsibility 
between the Standing Committee on Health and the Standing 
Committee on Justice. When this bill gets to committee the 
significant and traditional Criminal Code and justice nature of 
the bill must not be forgotten.
<P>
	This begs the question: What is the government saying about 
the drug problem in Canada? What philosophical flavour made 
this bill be presented as health legislation? Certainly that should 
be a concern to the community.
<P>
	The assignment category for legislation into health sends a 
message to the country. I am not so sure I like that message. Is 
there a misguided softening on law and order with this 
government? Has the government given up on the aggressive 
police enforcement side of dealing with the drug problem? I 
hope not. Certainly I do not think it has the political mandate for 
that either.
<P>
	May this legislation receive the significance and priority that 
it deserves. For all its hoped for improvements let us hope that 
changes in the criminal law will not be weakened by Bill C-7's 
regulation to be seen merely as a health issue.
<P>
	The role of the federal government in combating drug abuse is 
long established. Within Canada the Narcotic Control Act, the 
Food and Drugs Act and the Criminal Code provide the basic 
legislative structure for the control of psychoactive substances, 
narcotic stimulants, depressants and hallucinogens.
<P>
	Enforcement of these federal statutes is the responsibility of 
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who work closely with 
customs authorities, provincial and municipal police forces to 
combat illicit drug activity.
<P>
	Health and Welfare Canada's bureau of dangerous drugs has a 
dual role in the implementation of the statutes. It provides 
administrative support to law enforcement agencies such as 
disposal of seized goods and assets, training assistance and 
scientific expertise. The bureau also administers the regulations 
covering the legitimate use of psychoactive substances for 
medical and scientific research purposes.
<P>
	These provide for distribution procedures, security measures, 
record keeping and prescribing practice among others. There 
must be a balance between control over drugs and their 
availability to meet legitimate medical and scientific needs.
<P>
	The health care community must also be accountable for its 
shared role in achieving this balance. Since practitioners, 
physicians, veterinarians, dentists and pharmacists are licensed 
by the provincial government where they practise, those 
governments are also responsible for ensuring that standards are 
met by health professionals under their jurisdiction.
<P>
	Close and ongoing liaison among federal and provincial 
authorities is the key to an effective drug control program. 
However it must be sustained by bold, clear law that actually 
works in the courtroom and does not become a retirement plan 
for lawyers.
<P>
	Drug control law must also send the right signals for general 
deterrence. It must work technically but it also must teach. It is 
symbolism and advance warning of what the community will 
tolerate.
<P>
	My reading of the community mood is that it is looking for 
political leadership and courage concerning our drug laws. The 
attitudes of zero tolerance are increasing as the community 
comes to comprehend the long term debilitating effects that 
illicit drug use has on society, especially among the young.
<P>
	Bill C-7 replaces a large part of the Criminal Code book 
which I have on my reference shelf, for the Narcotic Control Act 
and the Food and Drugs Act have traditionally been known as 
criminal legislation. Law enforcement agencies are involved. 
The courts regularly impose sentences on those duly charged 
under it, fined and given jail terms. This is the character and 
seriousness of the legislation.
<P>
	Drugs are also related to organized crime. Yet this bill to 
amend the Criminal Code is introduced by the Minister of 
Health. Health is an issue for sure but Bill C-7 is clearly 
criminal law in tradition and substance. Therefore when we push 
this bill on to the next stage, I ask the government to send it to 
the Standing Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, not the 
Standing Committee on Health.
<P>
	I want to talk for a moment about marijuana. A survey a few 
years ago revealed at that time that 4.5 million Canadians 15 
years old and over had tried some form of cannabis. The same 
survey showed that 1 in 15 Canadians used cannabis in the year 
of that survey and the numbers were rather astonishing. 
Approximately 700,000 Canadians have tried some form of 
cocaine. More than 800,000 have tried LSD, speed or heroin.
<P>
<B>(1250 ) </B>
<P>
	Since the drug problem seems to accelerate each year, there is 
no question that there needs to be a coherent, workable and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3216"> 3216 </A></B>
<P>
strong response by Parliament. We must give our front line 
people, who struggle valiantly to  protect the community, the 
tools and legal terms to do their job.
<P>
	I notice that in the first version of this bill, the Conservative 
one from the 34th Parliament, the amount of cannabis that is to 
be considered the demarcation line between schedules-serious 
consequences or not so serious consequences-in Bill C-85, 
schedule VI, it was one kilo of cannabis. That was the amount. 
Now in the same section of Bill C-7, that demarcation amount is 
raised to three kilos. What is the message here?
<P>
	Maybe there are some arguments, such as fewer cases leading 
to jail terms, a cost saving measure. Perhaps pressure has come 
from certain social groups who believe in using pot as their 
religion. Whatever the reckoning, it is quite a message to send to 
the community.
<P>
	What are the effects of the proposed legislation with reference 
to schedule VI? Those dealing in drugs could do so in shipments 
under three kilos. Should they get caught it would mean not as 
heavy a penalty as it would if they were caught with a quantity 
exceeding three kilos. This change might embolden what is 
happening on the street, especially in our high schools, and 
result in an increase in the drug trade. Traffickers will think that 
the law is getting soft.
<P>
	How much is three kilos? It is three bricks, three bundles, 
about 6.6 pounds. It is about the size and weight of my newborn 
son, 6.6 pounds. What will 6.6 pounds buy or bring the children 
of our nation? Three kilos or 6.6 pounds would make an awful 
lot of joints.
<P>
	As a criminal justice professional I have seen firsthand clients 
who have lost business careers because of closet marijuana 
habits. Years ago I saw a cabinet minister of the provincial 
government light up. How sad. I have dealt with sexual 
offenders on probation. Some of their excuses for molesting the 
children in their household was that they were high on cannabis.
<P>
	The car accidents, the industrial accidents, the misjudged 
business deals leading to bankruptcy and many needlessly 
unemployed, the loss of general social judgment, the loss of the 
desire to work, the loss of the desire for academic excellence, 
these I have observed firsthand as a probation officer, officer of 
the court and family court counsellor, the direct result of the 
relatively tolerant attitude toward marijuana use. There we have 
some of the underlying principles of Bill C-7. These are the 
flags of direction that the bill takes.
<P>
	In summary, first I say clearly that Bill C-7 is criminal law. 
Let us not slip it by as merely health legislation. Second, what a 
signal is sent by the threshold of three kilos for cannabis. This 
bill on that specific seems to go in the wrong direction.
<P>
	The government may try to send a signal that we now are a 
mature, sophisticated society and that we can handle drug use in 
a tolerant and enlightened way under the guise of health but the 
community knows otherwise. The school authorities in my 
riding are not looking for a loosening of drug enforcement. The 
local crown counsel is looking for clear, tough, workable 
legislation that holds up in the courtroom.
<P>
	My community wants legislation that gives clear authority to 
the duty constable when he pulls over a driver. It should give 
appropriate powers of search and seizure for drugs. I say it is not 
technically hard to do but it requires political will to send a clear 
signal which way we are going with this legislation. Let the 
community absorb what is being proposed. Let witnesses come 
forward. Let the people speak, not just the experts.
<P>
	I challenge the government to not only proceed with its top 
down attitude telling the community what is good for them but 
let the implications of this bill simmer in the community and 
then have the courage to adjust its efforts into what the 
community expects from its leaders.
<P>
	In closing, Bill C-7 is significant legislation. It is 71 pages 
worth. It remains to be seen what is the essential thrust, where it 
is going. I look forward to seeing it referred to the Standing 
Committee on Justice and give it the character and the intent that 
it deserves.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member made reference to marijuana and a particular 
threshold of three kilos without making reference to that as 
being simply a procedural matter in the act and having nothing 
to do with substance.
<P>
	The new legislation in dealing with cannabis, which is 
marijuana, puts the substance into the same schedule, schedule 
I, that opium, codeine, morphine, cocaine are in, some of the 
worst drugs that we have. Marijuana and its derivatives are in 
the same schedule where reference is made that marijuana, its 
preparations, derivatives and similar synthetic preparations are 
all included in schedule I.
<P>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	How can the hon. member indicate that this legislation is not 
legislation that adequately deals with marijuana when that 
substance is put into the same schedule as other drugs such as 
cocaine, codeine and opium?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Forseth:</B> I understand the point. There is a demarcation 
on schedule VI concerning the three kilo mark, over three kilos 
or under.
<P>
	I know the pressure of the court system in the province of 
British Columbia and elsewhere. If the charge is simple 
possession of marijuana or a small amount for trafficking, and if 
there is an option to proceed summarily they are going to chose 
that option. Raising the amount to three kilos is, I think, sending 
the wrong signal. The criminal law must act and be functional 
and stand up in the courtroom, but it also is an educated and 
symbolic role. I think the bill sends the wrong signal to the 
community.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think we 
may have had a problem with translation. I apologize for my 
lack of proficiency in the other official language but when the 
Bloc Quebecois member of the Official Opposition was 
speaking, the translation I believe was coming across that she 
was concerned about consultation and that pharmacists and 
other people in the industry should have more time for 
consultation.
<P>
	I was reading it through translation as pharmaceuticals and I 
could not quite figure it out. That is why I asked the question I 
did. If the hon. member is listening, we probably had a little 
problem either with translation or my understanding of what the 
translator said.
<P>
	I have listened with some interest to what has gone on this 
morning. We have had the two official parties in opposition, the 
Bloc Quebecois and the Reform Party, both speak on this 
legislation.
<P>
	I thought that seven or eight months into the mandate 
members opposite would have remembered what they said in the 
first few days of this House. I know that the Bloc Quebecois has 
a mandate, or so it sees it, in the people who elected them. I think 
the Bloc members will find out that the mandate is not quite 
what they thought it was, if ever there is a referendum in 
Quebec. However, they believe that they have a mandate, first 
and foremost, to see the separation of the province of Quebec. I 
may disagree with that but they were democratically elected and 
I am sure that when they debate issues such as this, they are 
trying their best to represent the interests of the people of 
Quebec.
<P>
	When we first came into this place there was a lot of talk that 
people were not going to become wildly partisan just for the 
sake of being wildly partisan, and that when good legislation 
came forward, members opposite, particularly in the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party, would do their best to support 
it.
<P>
	This place works on confrontation. It works on opposition. 
When legislation comes forward the role of the Official 
Opposition and other opposition parties is to oppose. But I 
thought that we had gone beyond that and that no longer was it 
opposition for the sake of opposition.
<P>
	This is one of the bills where the members opposite in the 
Reform Party and the Bloc could have shown that they really did 
want to make this a different Parliament, and that they really did 
want to co-operate to bring forward non-contentious 
legislation.
<P>
	I do not know where some of the members from the Bloc are 
coming from, but the people in my community spoke loud and 
clear prior to the last election. They said they wanted a 
government whose number one concern was the health and 
safety of the communities.
<P>
	The people in my community said it very loudly two years ago 
when I had to go to Portland Estates because we had a gang 
problem and people no longer felt safe in their communities. 
They did not want their politicians to get up here and dance on 
the head of a pin. They wanted real debate about reforming laws 
and striking the proper balances so that our criminal justice 
system reflected the reality and the needs of our communities.
<P>
<B>(1300 ) </B>
<P>
	There was a lot of talk about the Young Offenders Act. We 
heard how it had to be strengthened but at the same time we 
could not just punish; we had to try to reform. The emphasis had 
to be on rehabilitation not strictly punishment.
<P>
	There is no question a level of consultation is needed. But I 
would say to my colleagues opposite when dealing with this that 
this is an uncontentious bill. There may be a few items here and 
there they may wish to change or I may wish to change but surely 
we can get some agreement that this type of legislation is 
progressive.
<P>
	The legislation codifies some of the regulatory regimes 
dealing with the two acts in question. It makes it a little easier 
for our law enforcement officials and other people in the judicial 
system to actually enforce what it is we want. That is safer 
streets and harsher penalties for those who deal in death with 
narcotics. They do deal in death and narcotics destroy our 
communities.
<P>
	I thought we would have gotten a little agreement but perhaps 
they slide too easily into old patterns. This was quite interesting.
<P>
	The Reform Party more than the Bloc has indicated that only 
the Reform Party can talk about family values. I can say that I 
would get somewhat nauseous listening to some Reform 
members leading up to the election.
<P>
	Members of the Reform Party would condemn past and 
present members of this place as simply not being able to 
understand what the people in their communities wanted. They 
literally contributed a great deal to the feeling that this place and 
the people who practised the profession of politics somehow 
lived on the underbelly of life and that we simply looked after 
self interests and not the interests of the community.
<P>
	Reformers would always say that they were the law and order 
party: ``We are the only ones who can bring law and order 
back''. I remember debating with my Reform opponent in the 
election campaign. I can say that party would have locked 
everybody up and thrown away the key. That is what the Reform 
Party thought would save communities.
<P>
	I would have thought that when they got into this place they 
would have also listened to the other little piece of rhetoric they 
spiel out occasionally. That is that they are truly different and as 
Reformers they are the only ones who can reform the way 
Parliament works.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3218"> 3218 </A></B>
<P>
	Over the last few weeks we have seen their types of reforms. 
They give back cars but take 75 cents on the dollar from 
taxpayers to pay for their leader's car, haircuts, shoe shines, all 
the things they condemned us for. However I want to put that 
aside.
<P>
	The Reform Party has fallen into the old patterns they so 
easily condemned. I have not seen them come in and support a 
government motion, except for maybe on one or two occasions, 
but not many.
<P>
	This is a major piece of legislation. Surely to goodness there 
is some consensus that the government must move forward. It 
must simplify for law enforcement agencies and for the public 
the laws dealing with health and safety in our community. In this 
case it is Bill C-7 dealing with controlled substances.
<P>
	This bill was before the last Parliament but did not get through 
for whatever reasons. Our government is holding true to our 
promises in the red book of coming in with progressive 
legislation and the changes necessary to respond to what 
Canadians want. They want healthier, safer communities.
<P>
	Therefore we have come forward in the first few months of 
our mandate with a bill that was worked on in the previous 
Parliament. We did not think the bill was all bad so we have 
changed some of the things. We have modernized it again. We 
have tried to put some order into how we deal with some sections 
that without this bill are currently under the Food and Drug Act 
and the Narcotic Control Act.
<P>
	I cannot think of anything that should bring more easy support 
from the Reform Party and the Bloc Quebecois. If anybody out 
there is watching, the Reform Party is the one that said 
everybody had to vote their conscience in this place.
<P>
	I am not prone to attacking the opposition. I am getting a little 
fed up with their positions on things like this though. Every day 
they come into this place and they vote like robots when the 
government says it is coming in with a piece of legislation. They 
automatically all have. I cannot believe the Reform Party whip 
tells them how to vote because they told us during the campaign 
that was corrupt and bad. They must all be struck by some 
stardust in that each and every one of them every time a bill 
comes in finds it bad and they all vote the same way.
<P>
	I wonder how their constituents who are really concerned 
about law and order feel about the hoist motion. For those out 
there watching we debate legislation in this place. We try to 
make the regulatory and statutory environment society works in 
a little better. We constantly have to try to modernize our 
legislation because our own morality as a society changes with 
time. It is interesting.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	The hoist motion just proposed by the Reform Party in the 
amendment by the hon. member for Surrey North effectively 
says it does not want the House of Commons to deal with this 
issue. That is what a hoist motion does. The Reform Party came 
in with an amendment which, if passed, would hoist the whole 
issue of drugs, safe streets, crime as it relates to illegal and 
illicit drugs in our communities. We would not deal with it. That 
is what the effect of her amendment would be.
<P>
	If there are any Reform supporters left after the last few weeks 
of revelations about internal party conduct of that party, I think 
the hair on the back of their necks should be bristling. They sent 
their members here to show this place could work differently 
and that members should support good legislation when it came 
before the House. More important, they did not want us to get 
into these games that they used to criticize. Members of the 
Reform Party criticized the games of Parliament well, such as 
hoist motions.
<P>
	Now let us get real here with the Bloc Quebecois and also the 
Reform Party. Their mandate is to try to get some ink. They do 
not want the government portrayed in a favourable light because 
it is probably going to have some impact on their sagging 
popularity. I understand that. Opposition parties have to take 
that into account. I am a realist. We were in opposition and I 
know how the game is played. However, when we deal with 
these fundamental issues of safety and modernizing our 
legislation there should be some degree of consensus that we 
work together.
<P>
	There is a red herring out there. There might be a cod with it 
because we cannot seem to find any of them on the east coast. A 
red herring has been thrown out a couple of times and I am not 
about to let it go by.
<P>
	They are saying we cannot let this debate go on about the 
merits of the legislation, we have to talk about procedure. The 
real problem is that this stuff comes under the Criminal Code 
and should have been introduced by the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	When it comes to cleaning up the streets in Dartmouth, I do 
not care if it is the janitor who introduces the legislation as long 
as it gets thoroughly debated and the impact on my community 
is that it is safer. If the people in Backwater Gulch somewhere 
are having a problem with drugs in their community, I do not 
think they particularly care who puts the legislation forward. So 
let us clear that one off the agenda.
<P>
	If that is the biggest complaint they have maybe everybody in 
here will jump up and say they support the legislation. By the 
way, the Minister of Justice supports the legislation. Just 
because he did not move it does not mean he is opposed to it. 
Maybe that is what it was with Reform members and why they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3219"> 3219 </A></B>
<P>
could not support it. Maybe I have clarified it. Maybe they will 
support the legislation this afternoon.
<P>
	On committee referral, I know most members of the Reform 
Party with the exception of their House leader are new here. 
Most members of the Bloc Quebecois are new here. However, 
the reality is that committees basically are masters of their own 
destiny in this place. We do not have the legislative committees 
the Tories did. We want to make sure we are building up 
expertise in certain areas on committees by all members of the 
House.
<P>
	There is some agreement in this place that we have tried to do 
what we said we would during the campaign about making 
Parliament work better. We said we wanted the role of individual 
members to be heightened. We wanted to make sure they could 
provide input into the system.
<P>
	I am the committee chair on fisheries and oceans. The way I 
run my committee is with the co-operation of members opposite 
and my own side. That is different from what the Tories did. We 
actually try to drop our partisanship at the door and come up 
with better legislation, if that is what we are dealing with. When 
we did the cod adjustment package, the Atlantic groundfish 
adjustment, everybody on my side was happy with the report. 
We showed that this government is putting its money where its 
mouth is in allowing committees to have as broad a latitude as 
they think they need from maximum input by members.
<P>
	The second Reform Party red herring is that we have to get 
this over to the justice and legal affairs committee. Nonsense. If 
the Reform Party members in that committee are interested in 
trying to bring forward better legislation then they can ask the 
chair. When this legislation goes before that committee it can be 
put to a vote to have officials from the Department of Justice if 
that is who they want, or the janitor, appear before the 
committee. They can do whatever they want.
<P>
<B>(1310 ) </B>
<P>
	I want to strip away some of the nonsense that is being put 
here and to appeal particularly to the Reform Party. Start reading 
your own campaign material. You ran on law and order. You ran 
on trying to make sure this place ran better. You ran on trying to 
strip partisanship and gamesmanship from the House.
<P>
	On an issue that deals with law and order which cleaned up the 
streets in my area, you are doing everything that you criticized 
past members and parties of this place of doing. Wake up. Read 
the polling numbers. I want to tell you, some of the problems 
you guys have over there, Mr. Speaker, those individuals-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I guess I rose a little too 
quickly. I see the member recognized the Chair. I just did not 
want to be forgotten in this debate. If we get too personal with 
the ``you this'' or ``you that'' we could allow our debate and 
discussions in this Chamber to degenerate. Of course we are all 
committed to the most vibrant, animated and forthright 
discussions possible but please do not forget the Speaker.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for reminding me. I 
slipped. What I meant was ``they''.
<P>
	Let me put it this way, Mr. Speaker. Perhaps what those 
individuals on the other side should do is go back and read their 
campaign literature. They have slipped a few times. They have 
come to this place having raised themselves on a high holy 
pedestal. They have found it is a long fall when knocked off.
<P>
	Indeed their leader found that out a few days ago. I hope they 
recover. I hope they do find a way to contribute, and I mean this 
sincerely, to the debates in this House.
<P>
	They may laugh. I happen to have a great deal of respect for 
every member of this House no matter what their political 
affiliation, even if they are separatists. They have a right to have 
a say in this place. I am trying my best in this new Parliament to 
show we can work differently. I have dulled my tongue of its 
partisanship. However on an issue like this I am not prepared to 
because the public has to know what goes on here.
<P>
	I have a problem in my community up on Hester Street in the 
north end of Dartmouth. The prostitution problem is driving this 
neighbourhood into decline. It is an old residential 
neighbourhood. It is not downtown in an industrial or 
commercial area.
<P>
	The reality is the problem for the residents up in the north end 
on Hester Street and Albro Lake Road is not just prostitution but 
is drug related. In and around that area there were a number of 
known crack houses. These prostitutes are victims of the most 
despicable types of individuals when dealing with the pimps. 
Many or most of these young girls in the situation of prostitution 
have a drug problem. The pimps get them addicted to drugs.
<P>
	Drugs are far too easily available in every community, every 
junior and senior high school, even elementary schools, in this 
country. The reason we have the problem on Hester Street in the 
north end is because there were two crack houses nearby. The 
prostitutes who were addicted to crack were plying their trade 
primarily because they could make some money and get a hit of 
crack. The police have found the laws would not allow them to 
take the type of action necessary to clean up the streets. That is a 
problem.
<P>
	I will support any initiative this government or the opposition 
puts forward that would move in that direction. I know Bill C-7, 
which should not be a controversial bill, does all of those things. 
It moves in the right direction.
<P>
	It will not be the last time this government comes forward 
with amendments to the Criminal Code, to health and welfare 
legislation, the Food and Drug Act, or other acts. We will 
respond as necessary. We will take the steps we believe will lead 
to safer communities and will allow law enforcement officials 
and the judicial system to deal effectively with those seeking to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3220"> 3220 </A></B>
<P>
destroy our communities and rob many of our youth of their 
lives and if not their lives, their usefulness in life.
<P>
	This bill should be soundly debated in the House on the facts. 
The time to raise the concerns the Bloc Quebecois have had, and 
they are legitimate concerns I might say, about too much 
regulation without notification of this Parliament is when it gets 
to committee. We did that in opposition.
<P>
	Pharmacists and people who legitimately have to use 
controlled substances in their legal work should be heard from, 
but the place to do that is at committee.
<P>
	I ask members on all sides to see this piece of legislation for 
what it is. It is not a big piece of legislation. I think there should 
be unanimous consent on the intent of the legislation. Let us 
work if there is a problem through the committee structure to 
make it a better piece of legislation so that our streets are a little 
safer after it is passed.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the 
member has dulled his partisan tongue. If he had not dulled it I 
expect we might need an ambulance over here.
<P>
	I would like to ask the member, since he spoke so eloquently 
about non-partisan comments on this specific bill, would he 
reflect back to the 34th Parliament upon the comments made by 
the Liberal members of the committee when they were 
reviewing this bill. I am sure he will know about that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, I certainly do know about it. I 
want to say that the member is very fortunate, as are you, Mr. 
Speaker, to have lived through the last Parliament.
<P>
	In the last Parliament things did work differently here. I think 
one of the reasons that the Reform Party has been so successful 
across this country is that it was a negative response to the way 
things were done here. One of the reasons the Liberals so 
successful in the last campaign is that we recognized that the 
Canadian public no longer would allow Parliament to work 
basically by fiat, by a small number of individuals and 
mandarins to make all the decisions, that consultation was not 
real, that it was phoney, and that bad legislation and special 
interest legislation got passed.
<P>
	I think the member opposite and even you and I, Mr. Speaker, 
have benefited by the past government's excessive partisanship 
and lack of consultation when it came to legislative process. 
Some of us did try to make this a better place. I can say that in 
the last Parliament one of the few committees that did work 
effectively was the government ops committee led by Mr. 
Holtmann, who is no longer a member here, and John Rodriguez, 
a New Democrat who was the NDP critic. We worked together 
with the groups there to try to come up with better legislation. I 
think we were a bit of a model in the way we were trying to do 
things.
<P>
	The hon. member is right, there may have been some members 
in the past. We participated in the venue that was drawn for us by 
the government. We have drawn a different venue. We have put 
different rules forward. We allow members of this place to have 
their say.
<P>
	I would urge the member not to live in the past, to look at the 
future, to look at reality. He will see that there is plenty of 
opportunity without falling into old patterns to allow members 
of all sides to have their say when it comes to formulating 
legislation.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is interesting to see the member who just spoke try to 
do a psychological analysis of the opposition's intentions, in 
particular regarding Bill C-7. However, I would like to remind 
him that when the Liberals were in opposition, they did exactly 
what we are doing.
<P>
	As long as we think that a bill fails to reach its goal or is 
poorly written and is unclear and ambiguous, we will oppose it 
regardless of what the government says. I believe it is our 
responsibility, as the official opposition, to do so not only for 
Quebecers but for all Canadians. This bill is unclear and we 
oppose it in many respects. I will have later on the opportunity to 
dwell on a particular point.
<P>
	But I am concerned by some statements made by the 
government members opposite regarding this bill. On February 
15, the Sollicitor General of Canada stated to the press that it 
was important to amend the Narcotic Control Act as well as 
some parts of the Food and Drugs Act in order to be in a better 
position to fight the cocaine traffic organized by the Warriors on 
the aboriginal reserves.
<P>
	I would like to know if the member agrees with this statement 
and, if so, if it means that the present Narcotic Control Act does 
not provide any means to control that traffic? Does the member 
agree with this statement and, if so, could he explain why?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. MacDonald:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is the first time I have had an 
opportunity to respond to a question which is so specific that it 
deals with not just one region of Canada but actually with a very 
special people in Canada, the native community.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3221"> 3221 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1320 ) </B>
<P>
	The member does his side and his cause a great disservice, 
constantly focusing on problems that the native community or a 
native community or any minority community in Canada may 
have. If the member wishes to ask some questions dealing with 
the impact of this legislation across Canada, I would be pleased 
to answer. I am not prepared in any way, shape or form to allow 
the member opposite to put questions forward like we heard over 
and over again in question periods over the last two months in 
this place that deal specifically with the native community or 
any other community.
<P>
	This bill is not meant to just strike out at people who violate 
the law, the norms of society, when it comes to trafficking 
controlled substances. I do not really care if they are Gaelic, if 
they are Cape Bretoners, if they are from the province of 
Quebec, from the Gaspé or if they happen to be natives. The way 
this government operates is that it legislates for all Canadians 
without noting which region they live in or which ethnic group 
they come from.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur: </B>Mr. Speaker, the explanatory notes in Bill 
C-7 specify that the proposed enactment consolidates Canada's 
drug control policy to fulfill Canada's obligations under 
international conventions.
<P>
	That consolidation, which is no doubt necessary, brings about 
major consequences, the most important of which is the repeal 
of the Narcotic Control Act, as well as of Parts III and IV of the 
Food and Drugs Act.
<P>
	In the guise of that consolidation, the legal and statutory 
approach to a major problem is dramatically changed and this, 
without prior consultation. Yes, without consultation, and in a 
strange heavy context which raises concerns on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	As you did, Mr. Speaker, I heard the comments that were made 
to the media by the Solicitor General of Canada on February 15, 
as I mentioned earlier. If it is true that there is an emergency, as 
if the present Narcotic Control Act could not allow the RCMP to 
stop the lucrative traffic of cocaine and other hard drugs, there is 
a problem with the system.
<P>
	A country can have all the useful and necessary laws in some 
activity sector, but if the political will to enforce these laws in 
some areas of that country does not exist, they will be useless. 
So, we believe that it is necessary for Canada and for Quebec to 
have efficient and stringent legislation that responds to the 
present and imminent need to stop this plague. But, most of all, 
the police forces must feel that they have the support of those 
who will vote for that legislation.
<P>
	From this House, we must give a clear message to anyone 
engaged in that black market that the legislator is serious in his 
or her willingness to counter narcotics and all other drugs. In 
order to do so, we should step up our effort and enforce the 
present laws while waiting for the updating wished for by Bill 
C-7.
<P>
	In that regard, it might be useful to remind the Solicitor 
General of Canada of certain provisions of the existing Narcotic 
Control Act compared to provisions found in Bill C-7 dealing 
virtually with the same issue. If you read the bill, you will see 
that the legislator's intent was to criminalize the trafficking in 
designated substances as well as their import and export. 
However, the legislator does not criminalize trafficking since 
trafficking, and importing and exporting of narcotics are already 
considered a criminal activity under the existing Narcotic 
Control Act.
<P>
	I could mention a whole list of provisions contained in Bill 
C-7 that are identical or similar to those contained in the 
existing Narcotic Control Act, but since I do not have the time, I 
will simply mention to this House that there is already an act that 
can efficiently counter cocaine trafficking or trafficking in any 
other narcotic, provided it is enforced everywhere in Canada.
<P>
	As regards the statement of the Solicitor General of Canada 
who said that Bill C-7 would allow police forces to make sales 
under surveillance, which means that double agents could 
infiltrate smuggling networks and catch criminals by proposing 
deals, one can also question that novelty.
<P>
	When the Solicitor General made that statement, he was 
referring to clause 54(2) of Bill C-7.
<P>
	That provision reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(2) The Governor in Council, on the recommendation of the Solicitor General 
of Canada, may make regulations that pertain to investigations and other law 
enforcement activities conducted under this Act by a member of a police force 
and other persons acting under the direction and control of a member and, 
without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may make regulations: (b) 
exempting, on such terms and conditions as may be specified in the regulations, 
a member of a police force that has been designated pursuant to paragraph (a) 
and other persons acting under the direction and control of the member from the 
applications of this Act or the regulations;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	There is absolutely nothing new in this bill. Something 
similar exists in the current Narcotic Control Act. The 
investigative power of police officers already allows them to 
infiltrate a group that they are watching and further, section 18 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act already provides for 
that procedure.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3222"> 3222 </A></B>
<P>
	Then, why does the Solicitor General of Canada need the 
powers under clause 54(2) of Bill C-7 when the investigative 
power of police officers already provides for such measures?
<P>
	Furthermore, infiltration is aimed at gathering information on 
dealers or on trafficking.
<P>
	However, in the case quoted by the Solicitor General, the 
RCMP and the Sûreté du Québec-and I must emphasize that it 
is the Solicitor General of Canada who referred to the groups 
that I talked about earlier-mentioned that they were aware of 
the cocaine trafficking done by the Warriors.
<P>
	So, this bill does not set forth anything new, nor does it 
provide any additional powers. We have to admit that the 
Solicitor General could act immediately to put an end to 
trafficking everywhere in Canada. That statement makes us 
believe that the Solicitor General is behind the anticipated 
passage of Bill C-7 in order to gain time and delay any 
intervention in those territories.
<P>
	If the bill were so essentiel to the fight against drug 
trafficking in Canada, does it mean Canada never offered any 
resistance to drug dealers before the passage of the bill we are 
now studying? I hope this is only an extrapolation and that Bill 
C-7 is presented to this House with a view to modernizing a 
police procedure already in place and consolidating the 
Canadian drug control policy, as mentioned in the explanatory 
notes to the bill. However, one fact still remains: the 
government is not reaching its objective with this bill, it is 
presenting a faulty bill, one that is badly written, confused and 
difficult to enforce.
<P>
	That being said, Mr. Speaker, to convince you, I think it would 
be appropriate to stress one of the points raised on Friday, 
February 18, by the hon. member of the Bloc Quebecois for 
Portneuf when he discussed Bill C-7. You will remember he was 
explaining to the House the deficiencies of Bill C-7.
<P>
	After studying the bill, the Bloc Quebecois classified its 
deficiencies under four categories. I will review them briefly. 
First, the legitimate activities of doctors, pharmacists and 
veterinarians; were these people adequately protected by this 
bill? Second, the enormous powers given to inspectors 
designated by the minister; are they not of such nature as to 
allow, if not induce, mistakes which will unduly penalize health 
professionals and their patients?
<P>
	Third, how will the confidential nature of medical records be 
respected when the law allows just about anybody designated as 
an inspector by the minister to copy the files held by health care 
institutions and to seize all their computer files? The last 
question is why does this bill call criminal and throw in jail 
individuals who, in fact, are drug addicts in need of treatment?
<P>
	As the Official Opposition critic for the Solicitor General, I 
will deal mainly with the third question regarding the 
confidential nature of medical records.
<P>
	I do think that, should this bill be passed without amendment, 
it will jeopardize the confidential nature of medical records. 
Under the provisions of the bill, the lawmaker will make it 
harder for policemen to search the home of a known drug dealer 
than for an inspector appointed by the minister to carry out what 
would amount to a seizure in a hospital or at the corner 
drugstore.
<P>
	One has only to refer to Part IV of Bill C-7 to realize how 
far-reaching are the powers of an inspector designated by the 
minister to enforce the act.
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	Under clause 29 of the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>29.(1) The Minister may designate any person as an inspector for the 
purposes of this Act and the regulations.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The expression ``any person'' send shivers down my spine because this 
person is given a lot of power.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Under clause 30. (1) of the bill:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>30. (1) Subject to subsection (2), an inspector may, to ensure compliance with 
the regulations, at any reasonable time enter any place used for the purpose of 
conducting the business or professional practice of any person licensed or 
otherwise authorized under the regulations to deal in a controlled substance or a 
precursor and may for that purpose</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are dealing here with professionals, not smugglers or 
pushers, but real professionals who are licensed for this very 
purpose.
<P>
	This small paragraph therefore entitles anyone designated by 
the minister pursuant to clause 29 to enter at just about any 
time-clause 30 even specifies at any time of the day-a 
doctor's office, a pharmacy, a hospital, an LCSC, or the office of 
any other health professional who has obtained the required 
licence.
<P>
	What are the powers of an inspector doing an inspection? I 
will tell you. Among other things, he can:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) open and examine any receptacle or package-</BLOCKQUOTE>
examine anything found in a place that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) -is used or may be capable of being used for the production, 
preservation, packaging or storage of a controlled substance-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) examine any labels or advertising material or records, books, electronic 
data or other documents found in that place with respect to any controlled 
substance-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And the list goes on and on.
<P>
	The inspector can even:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>e</I>) reproduce any document from any electronic data referred to in paragraph 
(<I>c</I>) or cause it to be reproduced, in the form of a printout or other output;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3223"> 3223 </A></B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>h</I>) examine any substance found in that place and take, for the purpose of 
analysis, such samples thereof as are reasonably required;</BLOCKQUOTE>
	As we can see, Bill C-7 gives the inspector powers that even a 
peace officer does not have to fight the most serious threat of all, 
cocaine trafficking. Obviously, we are off the track!
<P>
	Even more disturbing, should Bill C-7 be passed as it is, the 
inspector can gather evidence which could be used against a 
pharmacist, a physician, a nurse or anyone else in criminal 
court, whereas normally any action likely to lead to a trial in 
criminal court cannot be undertaken without a warrant, except 
under very special circumstances provided for in the legislation.
<P>
	I was saying a moment ago that the law is a lot more 
demanding for police officers than for these inspectors, and to 
prove it, I will read to you clause 12, subclauses (1) and (7) of 
the bill.
<P>
	Under the title <I>Search, Seizure and Detention</I>, clause 12 says:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>12. (1) A justice who, on <I>ex parte</I> application, is satisfied by information on 
oath that there are reasonable grounds to believe that</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>a</I>) a controlled substance-,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>b</I>) any thing in which a controlled substance [-]is contained or concealed,</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>c</I>) offence-related property, or</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(<I>d</I>) any thing that will afford evidence in respect of an offence under this Act 
is in a place may, at any time, issue a warrant authorizing a peace officer, at any 
time, to search the place for any such controlled substance, precursor, property 
or thing and to seize it.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Subclause (7) provides that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(7) A peace officer may exercise any of the powers described in subsection 
(1) -without a warrant if the conditions for obtaining a warrant exist but by 
reason of exigent circumstances it would be impracticable to obtain one.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	These two subclauses of clause 12 clearly show that a police 
officer cannot act without a warrant, except under special 
circumstances.
<P>
	As for clause 30 of the bill, it provides that an inspector can 
act, visit, seize, etc., as indicated, at all times and without a 
warrant. Thus there is a clear difference between the two.
<P>
	The only time an inspector needs a warrant is when he wants 
to visit a dwelling, a private residence. It is normal to require a 
warrant in such a case. For the rest, there is a clear difference 
between a government inspector and a police officer doing his 
job, fighting against smugglers.
<P>
	I find the wording of clause 30 quite strange, especially when 
referring to superior court judgements on the importance of 
search warrants under the Canadian Charter of Rights.
<P>
	We must not forget that certain previous provisions of the 
Narcotic Control Act and the Food and Drugs Act authorized 
searches without a warrant anywhere but in a dwelling, when a 
peace officer had reasonable reasons to believe that narcotics 
were to be found there.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	There were no such open-ended authorizations in the defunct 
Bill C-85, a bill similar to the one before us today, because they 
had been ruled inoperative and contrary to section 8 of the 
Charter.
<P>
	Yet, subclause 12(7) would authorize, under exceptional 
circumstances, a peace officer to conduct a search without a 
warrant when the conditions for obtaining a warrant exist but it 
would be impracticable to obtain one. It could be that the time 
required to obtain a warrant would jeopardize the life or safety 
of a person or the very existence of capital evidence. Under the 
circumstances, a search without a warrant would be justified and 
could not be challenged under the Charter.
<P>
	To wrap up, I sincerely think that the legislator would be 
giving far too much power to the inspectors if clause 30 were to 
be passed as is, as it has no foundation in law.
<P>
	As the past gives us some indication of things to come, we 
know that it is not good to give this kind of discretionary powers 
to a person or group of persons without providing a restrictive 
framework, legally speaking. The War Measures Act is a good 
example of this. Never again must we relive such excesses.
<P>
	In no time, these superinspectors would be living in a glass 
bubble that would promote excesses.
<P>
	Furthermore, the powers of the inspector run counter to the 
provinces' jurisdiction. For example, Quebec has granted 
inspection powers to the Professional Corporation of Physicians 
of Quebec, as well as to the Quebec college of pharmacists and 
dentists. The corporation's or organization's inspector can show 
up, provided proper notice was given, at the office or place of 
business of doctors, dentists, pharmacists and others to ensure 
compliance with the principles of medical practice.
<P>
	The Government of Quebec also allows the corporation's 
trustee to examine the practice of any physician, dentist or other 
professional with respect to a complaint to the effect that he or 
she has prescribed a hazardous substance to a patient.
<P>
	It seems obvious to me that this part of the act once again 
enables the federal government to interfere in provincial areas 
of responsibility, which the Official Opposition considers both 
costly and unacceptable.
<P>
	In closing, I suggest the government go back to the drawing 
board and come up with a bill that would be much more in line 
with the realities of modern-day life, one on which everybody 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3224"> 3224 </A></B>
<P>
would have been consulted. I suggest that it holds consultations 
on this subject, as part of the multiple consultations it is 
carrying out these days. I think that consultation in that area 
would definitely be  in order, considering the implications for 
future generations.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in his speech the hon. member for Berthier-Montcalm said that 
Bill C-7 and the Narcotic Control Act currently in effect 
contained many similar provisions. Could he please give us a 
few examples?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellehumeur:</B> Mr. Speaker, yes, I could give a few 
examples. First I must point out, as I said in my speech earlier, 
that criminalization of drugs is nothing new as it was done in the 
Narcotic Control Act, but I will give you three examples.
<P>
	Clause 6(1) of Bill C-7 reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No person shall traffic in a substance included in Schedule I, II or III or in any 
substance represented or held out by that person to be such a substance.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Clause 4(1) of the current Narcotic Control Act says this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No person shall traffic in a narcotic or any substance represented or held out by 
the person to be a narcotic.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Another example, clause 7(1) of the bill before us provides 
that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Except as authorized under the regulations, no person shall import into 
Canada or export from Canada a substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV or 
V.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The current Narcotic Control Act says this: ``Except as 
authorized by this Act or the regulations, no person shall import 
into Canada or export from Canada any narcotic.''
<P>
	I could give you other examples. Clause 9(1) of Bill C-7 is the 
same as clause 9(1) of the Narcotic Control Act with regard to 
the commission in Canada of an offence.
<P>
	As I said earlier, I think the idea is to update the legislation; 
however, we want, through this House, to send the message that 
the law we will adopt on food and drugs will be enforced in 
every part of Canada. And I am saying that, at this time, the 
Narcotic Control Act is not being enforced everywhere in 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, thank you for allowing me the 
opportunity to speak to this bill.
<P>
	The problem of the use of illicit substances and addiction and 
those who profit from it troubles the nation, troubles my 
constituents and, speaking as one who is elected to represent 
those same constituents, troubles me.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	The use of illicit drugs has eaten away at the fabric of our 
society like a leprous plague. The illicit drug trade and those 
who live off its avails exact a heavy toll. They prey on that 
segment of our population that is most vulnerable, our youth, a 
prime target for those who deal in these drugs.
<P>
	Drugs destroy families, they destroy careers, they destroy 
futures. They also destroy young lives. Perhaps most 
reprehensibly of all, while doing so they put cash into the hands 
of criminals.
<P>
	In my practice as a physician I have personally witnessed 
many young people in families trapped in the cycle of drug 
dependency. I have worked with many of those families and 
young people to help them reclaim control of their lives. It is a 
difficult, frustrating and heart-rending struggle. I am therefore 
extremely sensitive to the consequences of drug dependence. It 
is not only a criminal issue, it is a health and social issue.
<P>
	Realizing the need for action and recognizing that a 
widespread problem such as this requires a broadly based 
solution, the federal government launched Canada's drug 
strategy in 1987.
<P>
	Canada's drug strategy is a comprehensive set of programs 
implemented with the collaboration of a multitude of partners 
and stakeholders. It was the first comprehensive step toward 
reducing the devastating and costly effects of drug and alcohol 
abuse to individuals, to families and to communities.
<P>
	Canada's drug strategy was designed to address drug abuse in 
a balanced and co-ordinated manner. Emphasis was not only put 
on treatment and rehabilitation but it also addressed education 
and prevention.
<P>
	Part of the strategy contains legislative components in the 
form of legislation intended to strip traffickers of their 
ill-gotten assets, legislation that recognizes the obligation of 
Canada as a signatory under three international conventions, 
and legislation that consolidates parts 3 and 4 of the Food and 
Drug Act and the Narcotic Control Act.
<P>
	All components of phase 1 of the drug strategy are now in 
place with the exception of the legislation implementing the 
convention. This controlled drugs and substances bill is the final 
component of our drug strategy.
<P>
	Canada's drug strategy is based on the recognition that we 
must maintain a balanced approach when dealing with substance 
abuse. Two hundred and seventy million dollars over five years 
have been dedicated to the reduction of use and to the reduction 
of supply.
<P>
	The strategy allocates 70 per cent of its funds to reduction 
among users. This covers treatment initiatives, rehabilitation, 
education and prevention. The other 30 per cent is dedicated to 
enforcement activity.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3225"> 3225 </A></B>
<P>
	Bill C-7 provides the necessary legislation to support the 
resources dedicated to enforcement. Bill C-7 is the third and 
final significant piece of legislation to ensure that the strategy 
succeeds. It must therefore be seen as part of the whole strategy 
and not in isolation.
<P>
	Within my department alone programs have shifted to focus 
on new target goals. The federal component of the strategy falls 
under the responsibility of many departments, health, justice, 
Solicitor General, finance, external affairs, and national 
defence.
<P>
	Canada's drug strategy secretariat is co-ordinating the 
promotion and evaluation of programs among these 
departments.
<P>
	The community support program allows community groups to 
develop solutions specific to their substance abuse problems 
and we also have programs to address the unique problems of 
our native peoples, especially solvent and inhalant abuse, and 
the department has also introduced the national native role 
model program.
<P>
	While the controlled drugs and substances bill constitutes a 
necessary tool to prevent diversion of drugs it also contains 
provisions to ensure that drugs intended for medical, industrial 
or research purposes are made available to those who need them.
<P>
	This bill would be beneficial to all Canadians in that it would 
provide them with additional protection against the serious 
consequences of drug diversion.
<P>
	Without such legislation drugs would be more subject to 
thefts and robberies. Drugs would be more easily accessible in 
the streets. People would be more vulnerable to the 
consequences of illicit drug supply.
<P>
	Contrary to some assumptions, this bill is not indifferent to 
treatment programs, especially for those who are drug 
dependent. As a physician I support the availability of help and 
appropriate tools for those who seek to get back to a normal life.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	My government is sensitive to the medical and social 
consequences of drug addiction. The department of health will 
continue to grant methadone authorization for the treatment of 
drug dependence. Methadone is a controlled drug and its use 
well recognized in the medical community.
<P>
	The methadone program has the full support of the 
government. This is an initiative directed at use reduction. It 
assists many opiate abusers to re-establish a constructive life by 
promoting rehabilitation, reducing health risks and costs to the 
community.
<P>
	The department of health will continue to encourage and 
make available methadone treatment for appropriate patients. 
Bill C-7 was criticized for not providing drug dependent 
persons who have committed criminal offences with access to 
treatment. My government is very supportive of rehabilitation.
<P>
	Although the bill does not provide for mandatory 
rehabilitation treatment, the courts have always taken into 
consideration as part of a sentence the rehabilitation aspect of 
persons convicted of drug crimes.
<P>
	The bill does not go against such a practice. It is commonly 
accepted as a criminal law notion. Rehabilitation has been 
identified by jurisprudence of the last decade as being an 
integral part of any sentence rendered in Canada.
<P>
	We must also take into consideration the necessity for patients 
first to be referred to qualified health care professionals so that 
sound assessment and appropriate treatment programs are 
available to meet their needs.
<P>
	Drug dependence is a complex health issue. It requires 
professional diagnostic treatment and rehabilitative 
interventions. Motivation on the part of the patient is a crucial 
element in the success of treatment. The bill itself cannot 
determine who is a good candidate for treatment and who is not. 
The courts have the opportunity and responsibility to exert 
discretion and to refer candidates for treatment to qualified 
health care professionals.
<P>
	However my government is supportive of all programs aimed 
at decreasing the dependency and disastrous consequences of 
illicit drug use.
<P>
	The department of health is responsible for the national AIDS 
program. A great deal of thought has therefore been given to the 
spread of AIDS through intravenous drug use. We are convinced 
that the strategies used to curb the spread of HIV among drug 
users will enhance our efforts to reduce drug use in Canada by 
linking drug users with health professionals and treatment 
programs.
<P>
	Needle exchange programs were used successfully by many 
communities to reduce the spread of HIV. Sections of the 
Criminal Code dealing with drug paraphernalia have 
specifically been excluded, such as medical devices such as 
needles, from the statutory definition of instrument for illicit 
drug use, thereby allowing for the distribution of sterile needles 
by health professionals to known drug users who are at risk of 
AIDS.
<P>
	It therefore follows that the critical path for a drug free future 
lies in prevention and rehabilitation, but we also have an 
escalating problem today that must be recognized and dealt with 
promptly. We must give law enforcement professionals the tools 
they need to deal effectively with those who continue to prey on 
the addicted and on the young would-be addicts.
<P>
	If we are serious about advancing the broader social goal of 
maintaining safe and peaceful communities, we must promote 
law enforcement now. The youth of Canada are of primary 
importance in my government's platform. They are the key to 
our country's future.
<P>
	My practice as a physician has put me in constant contact with 
our youth. I am also the mother of three sons. I understand the 
daily difficulties our young people face, their hopelessness and 
their vulnerability. This  makes them prime targets for those in 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3226"> 3226 </A></B>
<P>
the drug trade who prey on that vulnerability. It is in order to 
protect our youth that I support the bill.
<P>
	The controlled drugs and substances bill addresses the 
problem broadly. It broadens the scope of controlled substances 
with certain other provisions and consequently will make it 
more difficult to reach children. Drug dealing in and around 
schools, sales to minors and use of the services of a minor during 
a transaction will constitute an aggravated factor at the time of 
sentencing. This means that judges will have to justify their 
decisions for not imposing a jail sentence on a dealer.
<P>
	Right now as we debate the bill designer drugs have the 
identical basic properties of the more familiar substances such 
as stimulants, tranquillizers and pain killers. Only their 
chemical properties have been slightly altered. The result is that 
these substances are not covered by the existing legislation and 
can be sold with impunity. They cannot be subject for 
prosecution until they are included in the schedule of drugs. 
Under the bill law enforcement officials will no longer have to 
wait for these drugs to appear on a statutory schedule in order to 
stop criminals from selling them.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Then of course there is the problem of so-called precursors 
which are legal substances used in the manufacture of illicit 
substances. They can be obtained right now in large enough 
quantities through various legal means. My government is 
concerned about the current lack of legislation governing 
precursor chemicals. We are concerned that Canada may be a 
conduit for precursor chemicals. We have become a weak link in 
the chain of drug control among the signatories of the 
international conventions because many of these precursor 
substances are not yet controlled in our country.
<P>
	Lack of effective control over benzodiazepines is another 
issue of concern. There is more pressure than ever from our 
co-signature countries for Canada to bring on more effective 
legislation. The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act is the 
much needed legislation to respond to these issues.
<P>
	I would like to respond to the other criticisms raised by 
members of the opposition during recent debate of the bill with 
regard to its perceived impact on certain health care 
professionals.
<P>
	The absence of regulations for these groups was identified as 
a fundamental impediment to obtaining the full impact of the 
legislation. The activities of pharmacists, physicians, dentists 
and veterinarians are currently subject to regulations under the 
Narcotic Control Act and under parts III and IV of the Food and 
Drug Act. The regulations under the new legislation will not 
differ substantively from those that currently apply to 
prescribing activities under the existing legislation.
<P>
	One of the purposes of the regulation making power in the bill 
is to enable the government to respond quickly and 
appropriately to changing professional practices. Any 
substantive changes in regulations will only be made following 
full consultation with all affected professional parties, using a 
regulatory consultation process that has been used for years by 
the department of health.
<P>
	Both the Official Opposition and the Reform Party members 
suggested that there would be inconsistencies between various 
provisions of the bill and the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
particularly with regard to the powers of inspectors. We do not 
believe this is so. Inspections referred to in the bill are 
inspections conducted to determine whether regulated persons 
are complying with the requirements under which they must 
carry on their business or their professional duties.
<P>
	There are many acts, both federal and provincial, which 
confer broad powers of entry on inspectors in the interests of 
ensuring public health and safety. These are not criminal law 
provisions; they are really administrative provisions.
<P>
	For example, an inspector performing an administrative 
seizure under section 30 of the act would not be able to use the 
seized substances as evidence before the courts. Similar 
provisions have been in force in Canada under federal drug 
control legislation for over 80 years. They effectively establish 
a federal regulatory scheme that governs the distribution and use 
of schedule drugs in Canada in a manner that limits their 
diversion to the illicit market and consistent with Canada's 
international obligations under the United Nations drug control 
convention.
<P>
	I would also like to respond to the concerns raised by both 
opposition members of Parliament about the powers given to the 
minister. All hon. members should be aware that one of the 
ultimate goals of the department of health is to ensure the safety 
and to protect the health of all Canadians, and to reassure them 
that they are protected by giving Parliament the means to do so. 
To that effect the legislation must contain the appropriate 
prevention measures.
<P>
	For example, as a member of the opposition mentioned, the 
minister may make an interim order cancelling or suspending an 
authorization when the minister is of the opinion that as a result 
of a contravention of a designated regulation there is a 
substantial risk of immediate danger to the health or safety of 
any person. This has been going on for years. The legislation 
protects not only the population; it also protects the health 
professionals.
<P>
	Contravention of designated regulations gives rise to a 
hearing before an adjudicator. This is indicated in part IV of the 
bill. It may result in a ministerial order which should effectively 
prevent a recurrence. A person who is believed to have made a 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3227"> 3227 </A></B>
<P>
contravention is given the opportunity to set out a date of 
hearing and to make representation. This adjudication 
mechanism would  protect the rights of individuals, show 
respect and allow transparency.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	A breach of these designated regulations would not result in a 
criminal type penalty of fine or imprisonment. Administrative 
sanctions would be handed down by the minister and not by a 
criminal court.
<P>
	Another area of criticism relates to the impact of the bill on 
physician-patient and pharmacist-patient relationships and 
confidentiality. Both opposition members identified access to 
the confidential files of patients as an unacceptable interference 
in the private lives of honest Canadians, and I agree. However 
there is very little new in the bill that gives rights to the minister 
that have not been there before.
<P>
	For over 30 years under the narcotic control regulations the 
Minister of Health has had the legislative authority to require a 
practitioner to provide information concerning a patient treated 
with narcotics to the Bureau of Dangerous Drugs. This 
information could include the diagnosis, history or prescribing 
information relevant to the patient. This has been going on for 
years.
<P>
	We have now given inspectors the appropriate tools they need 
to ensure that health professionals comply with the regulations 
and to ensure that the public is protected from the hazardous 
consequences of drugs. The inspectors are also health 
professionals bound by rules of confidentiality. They are 
important resources for the department of health and for the 
Canadian population. They also ensure that the facilities used in 
the distribution of drugs are secure.
<P>
	Legitimate program activities required under the current and 
proposed legislation to protect public health and safety will 
ensure that patient confidentiality is fully maintained. Any 
information obtained is subject to the Privacy Act. This 
prohibits its use or disclosure by any official, except in 
accordance with that act. The Privacy Act ensures that all 
information collected by the federal government for program 
purposes is treated confidentially.
<P>
	Concerning so-called doctor shopping or double doctoring 
offences official opposition members cited evidence given by 
the Canadian Medical Association to the legislative committee 
which examined Bill C-85. They argued that Bill C-7 would be 
unsatisfactory to doctors. This criticism from the Canadian 
Medical Association was accepted by the committee and the 
provision in the bill was changed, in essence to revert to the 
existing section found in the Narcotic Control Act. As a result 
the revision now refers only to persons who receive 
prescriptions from doctors. The act of providing the prescription 
in this circumstance is not considered a trafficking offence.
<P>
	We understand the use of illicit substances is a complex 
problem and requires a multifaceted approach of prevention, 
treatment, rehabilitation, legislation and punishment. The 
complete Canada drug strategy addresses all these issues. Bill 
C-7 deals with the legislative components.
<P>
	We all understand the regulation of controlled substances is a 
complex matter which requires a carefully constructed legal 
basis in order to be effective, judicious and fair. I believe the bill 
is the most appropriate instrument for administering the laws 
and regulations we need. We are dealing with an aspect of 
societal problems which demands proper protection of the 
innocent, the inexperienced, the young and the vulnerable. It 
also demands forceful prosecution of the exploitative, the 
criminal and the ruthless.
<P>
	I believe the bill strikes just the right balance between these 
two requirements. While we continue to minimize harm through 
education and prevention and while we continue to show 
compassion for victims through treatment and rehabilitation, we 
must also strike at the criminal heart of the problem. In passing 
the bill we as parliamentarians would be making our 
contribution to the battle against drug abuse now and well into 
the future.

Canada's economy.

	While we are all interested in what is good for Canada, the 
role of Ontario is being overlooked. What is good for Canada is a 
healthy and growing Ontario economy.
<P>
	The red ink book made a major issue of infrastructure and

	Globally and nationally there is much talk about sustainable 
development, but a shared understanding of what it means does 
not exist. To some it is a phrase that suggests development can 
be sustained at any cost.
<P>
	In my opinion sustainable development will not work as a 
vision goal or a process unless it includes equity. Equity is 
served when people from different lands, the north, the south, 
and people from different classes in the same land are treated

recent increase in violent crimes has raised the concerns of 
people all across Ontario and all of Canada.
<P>
	As part of its efforts to reduce violence in Canadian 
communities, the government should without a doubt ban the 
importation of serial killer cards. These cards are a perverted 
twist on children's hockey cards. They feature psychopathic 
killers with a detailed description of the crimes they committed.
<P>
	The lives of the victims of violent crimes should be 
remembered, not the killers and their actions.
<P>
	This government is committed to measures to get at the root 
causes of violence and this should include the banning of these 
offensive cards that glorify murder and reduce victims to 
anonymous statistics.
<P>
	On behalf of the constituents of London-Middlesex in 
Ontario, I call on Parliament to amend the customs and tariffs 
legislation to ban the importation of serial killer cards, ensuring 
that they will not continue to be sold in Canada.

Quebec economy $30 billion and the Canadian economy $109

	This situation cannot go on any longer. The members of this

imposing its will on Ottawa on the issues of lower cigarette 
taxes, the establishment of the environmental secretariat in 
Montreal and the postponement of the federal-provincial 
conference on labour. Such allusions are out of place.
<P>
	I ask the government to act diligently to solve the manpower 
issue with Quebec and the provinces concerned. It is time to 
reduce overlap. Perhaps this obstinacy is due only to some 
over-centralizing officials. The government would show 
flexibility by understanding Quebec's traditional demands and 
adopting an updated federalism that is more acceptable to all 
provinces.
<P>
	Under the Constitution, we certainly agree that labour force 
training is an educational issue and education is within 
provincial jurisdiction: it is their responsibility and they would

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have 
obtained from a reliable source a working paper on a 
government strategy designed to massively privatize Transport 
Canada's services.
<P>
	This strategy, which was developed in secret, will not only 
have a disastrous impact on employment in that department by 
eliminating 15,000 positions: it will also have serious 
consequences on the economy as a whole, through an increase in 
transportation costs.
<P>
	This withdrawal by the government from its responsibilities 
in the field of transport illustrates the confusion of a federal 
system which is about to crumble.
<P>
	Moreover, the government's policy in the transport sector 
clearly shows that it is not serious about job creation. This 
hurried reform could result in a setback for Quebec and Canada, 
since the transport industry has always been an essential 
component of their economies.

	Much to the disappointment of millions of Canadians all they 
got was the same old thing.
<P>
	We have a government that announces with greatest fanfare a 
rehash of the Company of Young Canadians, basically 
Katimavik II; a great concept but are our youth willing to pay the 
bill on this borrowed money?
<P>
	Ministers go to Atlantic Canada to tell Canadians there are no 
bold new ideas, just the usual tired old programs through which 
borrowed money substitutes for innovative job creation 
initiatives.
<P>
	The experiments in judicial reform that have proved 
unsuccessful since their introduction in the 1960s and 1970s are 
another sign that creative solutions are not being found.

	I would remind the government that yesterday's answers will 
not work when applied to today's questions; old songs by new

<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="ACTIONPLANFORYOUNGPEOPLE">ACTION PLAN FOR YOUNG PEOPLE</A></H3>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Although several provinces were opposed, the federal 
government decided to go ahead and announce its youth strategy 
last Friday. The Quebec Minister of Education, who also chairs 
the Conference of Education Ministers, called this an example 
of unacceptable intrusion by Ottawa in the education sector and 
even considered challenging the government's decision before 
the Supreme Court.
<P>
	Does the Prime Minister realize that his strategy is not only an 
intrusion in an area under provincial jurisdiction but also that 
Quebec and several other provinces have agreed to oppose the 
government, since the strategy will create further costly and 
unnecessary administrative duplication and overlap, which 
means less value for money?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, no one questions the jurisdiction of Quebec and other 
provinces over education. Of the three programs announced last 
Friday, the first is a program to help students. Quebec opted out 
of this program in 1964.
<P>
	The second program, which targets young people, is not really 
about education but about promoting youth employment. The 
federal government had and still has a number of different 
programs in this area, like Katimavik, for instance, and we have 
made every effort to ensure that the federal program is 
complementary to the provincial program.
<P>
	The third component, the national apprenticeship program, 
helps young people make the transition from school to work, a 
problem that is both federal and provincial. Both governments 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3232"> 3232 </A></B>
<P>
are active in this area and should continue their programs, in 
order to help young people find jobs.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the problem is that the Quebec government does not 
share the federal government's views and intends to bring a 
formal challenge before the Supreme Court to protest this new 
intrusion by the federal government in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction.
<P>
	I want to ask the Prime Minister, and I hope he will answer 
himself this time around, since he made a commitment to 
effective management and reducing overlap, why he has 
reversed his policy by launching a federal offensive on 
education and manpower training which increases the overlap 
and duplication he wanted to get rid of?
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
</B><B>Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as I pointed out, this is not another intrusion in an area 
under provincial jurisdiction. Our programs are not like that. 
The two programs I mentioned, the youth program and the 
apprenticeship program, are about promoting youth 
employment and not about education, strictly speaking. 
Furthermore, they complement provincial programs.
<P>
	Constitutionally speaking, when a problem is national in 
scope, like the problem of funding jobs for youth, the federal 
government shares and will continue to share jurisdiction with 
the provinces in dealing with this kind of problem.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have just witnessed a blatant example of 
bureaucratic obtuseness.
<P>
	The fact is that the federal government will duplicate what is 
already being done and spend money unnecessarily, so that we 
can hardly expect a good return on this investment. I want to ask 
the Prime Minister whether he has now made it his policy to 
provoke court challenges on all fronts?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs said earlier, we 
have a national responsibility in the area of job creation, and it is 
one of this government's priorities to find ways to help youth 
find jobs.
<P>
	If the Leader of the Opposition spent any time reading the 
Liberal Party's platform in the red book, he would see that it is 
all there, and the people voted for this platform, and that is why 
we are governing the country today.
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TRANSFERPAYMENTS">TRANSFER PAYMENTS</A></H3>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Finance clearly stated his intention to 
make massive cuts in transfer payments to the provinces in his 
next budget. Failing agreement with the provinces, the Minister 
of Finance plans to impose his solution regarding the cuts to be 
made. The freeze in transfer payments is already saving Ottawa 
$1.5 billion over two years.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the Minister of Finance has given 
up on trimming federal operating expenditures and has chosen 
to reduce his deficit on the backs of the provinces, without any 
compensation, through a massive reduction in transfer 
payments for health and education?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, what I said is that the 
Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal intends to 
review all federal programs and that review is already under 
way. So we are certainly looking at our own spending.
<P>
	I would like to quote a document of which I am very fond, the 
budget: ``It is essential that social security reform leads to 
programs that are more affordable and work better for 
Canadians. For the federal government, transfers must be no 
higher after reform than they are now. We want this reform 
process to be a co-operative one. We are providing a two-year 
period of predictability and modest growth in social security 
transfers to provinces while reform goes on. As promised by the 
Prime Minister, we will build towards a five-year period of 
stability in transfers.''
<P>
	That is what I said in the budget, that is what I said yesterday, 
that is what I discussed with all provincial finance ministers: 
co-operation. They agreed on it in January.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
how does the Minister of Finance explain that for lack of money, 
he is cutting transfers to the provinces, but at the same time his 
government has chosen to intervene brazenly, to say the least, in 
fields of provincial jurisdiction like youth and training 
programs. Does he not agree that when you have no money, you 
should mind your own business?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec):</B> Mr. Speaker, the member refers to the 
fact that we are cutting-I cannot remember the expression that 
he used-our transfers to the provinces.
<P>
	In fact, in the month of January, we settled equalization 
payments on a basis that had been deferred for a number of years 
by the previous government. The payments were very generous 
to the seven provinces that were receiving them.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3233"> 3233 </A></B>
<P>
	At the same time we met with the provincial finance ministers 
and told them we would not decrease the payments for a two year 
moratorium. It is the first time that has been done in a long time. 
They are used to the previous government simply cutting at will.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	Then we said to the provinces that together, co-operatively, 
we would begin to reform the social programs that Canadians 
wanted reformed so that we could deliver the services more 
effectively and at less cost.

	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Canadians are now beginning to see some of the details of the 
government's legislative program and their initial reaction is 
disappointment, not enthusiasm.
<P>
	For example, when Canadians examine the human resources 
project announced last week to help unemployed youth, they 
find that 70 per cent of the funds are not for job creation at all 
and that most of the program is simply a rehash of old programs 
and Liberal ideas from the 1960s and 1970s.
<P>
	Does the government not have any bold new ideas for 
assisting young people, and if it does, what are they?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have a program to assist young people.
<P>
	Perhaps the hon. member does not agree with the idea that the 
federal government should spend money to help people, 
especially young people, but now I hear him say that we should 
spend money.
<P>
	I am very happy he might find better ways but I am delighted 
for the nation to hear the leader of the Reform Party tell us to 
spend more money on young people. I take notice of that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we are talking about allocating money that is ready to be spent. 
The Prime Minister's reply simply illustrates my point that there 
is nothing new or creative or bold being said.
<P>
	Real Reformers have been calling for a portion of federal 
educational transfers to be paid directly to young people through 
education and training vouchers and for immediate revamping 
of the students loan program to make repayments 
income-contingent.
<P>
	These are bold and new ideas for encouraging youth 
preparation for the new economy. Could the Prime Minister tell 
us why new ideas like these are not an integral part of the 
government's thinking or announcements on this subject.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is exactly what the Minister of Human Resources Development 
is doing at this time. He is talking with the provincial 
governments about it and he is exploring a lot of these ideas. 
Some provinces think we are moving too fast.
<P>
	The hon. leader of the Reform Party would move without 
talking to the provinces.
<P>
	We want to make some changes. We would like to have a 
better system. We know that it would be preferable not to do it 
unilaterally so we are having discussions at this time. There was 
supposed to be a meeting yesterday. The provinces were not 
ready. We have postponed the meeting in order to give them 
more time.
<P>
	We think it is the right thing to do. All the premiers are asking 
us to consult with them and it is something the hon. leader's own 
father used to ask of the federal government; that before moving 
we should consult with the provinces. We are consulting with 
them. We will see what they have to say and will advise the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Preston Manning (Calgary Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think we are living in the past. The government's lack of new 
and bold ideas is not only evident in this field but in agriculture, 
the approach to the fishery and most seriously in the defence of 
federalism itself.
<P>
	So far the government's only response to the threat of Quebec 
sovereignty is to promise a few more handouts like the 
headquarters of the Commission for Environmental 
Co-operation being put in Montreal. This is a tired, 
old-fashioned approach to winning support from Quebec voters 
by promising to pave roads and build buildings.
<P>
	I ask again, does the government have some bold new ideas 
for Quebecers and all Canadians, in particular with respect to 
the revitalization of federalism?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
think that the hon. member knows the policy of this government.
<P>
	The best way to convince the people of Quebec to remain in 
Canada is to have a good administration in Ottawa and have 
members of Parliament who show tolerance and not play on the 
prejudices of people.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The situation in 
Bosnia has seriously deteriorated. The UN has lost all control 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3234"> 3234 </A></B>
<P>
and authority in the Moslem enclave of Gorazde, which has 
fallen to the Bosnian Serbs. Ignoring UN ultimatums and 
systematically violating ceasefire agreements, the Bosnian Serb 
army relentlessly  pursues its attack on Gorazde despite that 
city's designation as a safe area by the UN.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Foreign Affairs bring us up to date on the 
situation currently prevailing in Gorazde and confirm that the 
Bosnian Serbs' sustained attack has put an end to the peace 
process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, at lunch time, the Minister of Defence and I spoke with 
the Vice-President of Bosnia, Mr. Ganic. We reviewed the 
situation and we certainly deplore the escalation that seems to 
have taken place around some safe areas or enclaves where the 
Moslem population is at the mercy of Serbian troops' artillery. 
We cannot, of course, remain insensitive to this situation. There 
will be discussions with the representatives of allied countries 
to find as quickly as possible a solution to this situation that 
seems to be getting worse.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, yesterday 
the UN asked NATO to stand ready to launch air strikes.
<P>
	Can the minister indicate if Canada is actively participating in 
the development of a strategy for the Western countries and the 
UN, in order to respond to the intractability of the Bosnian Serbs 
who chose to further their cause with weapons instead of 
negotiations?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, certainly, Canadian representatives at NATO and the 
UN consulted one another and are participating in meetings to 
develop a common strategy. A first meeting at the level of NATO 
ambassadors was held yesterday and another one will take place 
tomorrow to decide on a common position in response to the UN 
Secretary General's written request.
<P>
	We continue to think that negotiations are still the safest way 
to achieve lasting peace in the former Yugoslavia. We will not 
solve the problem by aggravating the military conflict. On the 
other hand, we are aware that we cannot remain indifferent to a 
handful of Serb fighters who ignore the ceasefires negotiated on 
all sides. We think that considerable efforts have been made by 
both the Croats and the Moslems, and it is now time for the 
Bosnian Serbs to come to the table and agree with the other 
parties on a peaceful solution to this conflict that has lasted for 
too long.

	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	I listened closely to the $1.9 billion fisheries announcement 
this morning. Could the Prime Minister tell the House why there 
was no economic diversification component to create real long 
term jobs in Atlantic Canada anywhere in the announcement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for his question on an important subject but he is wrong.
<P>
	Part of the package announced by the Minister of Fisheries 
and Oceans and the Minister of Human Resources Development 
has a component dealing with regional disparities and how we 
might be able to facilitate the private sector, particularly small 
and medium sized business, to take advantage of economic 
opportunities in that region.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Cummins (Delta):</B> Mr. Speaker, a careful reading 
of the package failed to reveal the items to which the minister is 
referring. In our view the package failed to address the critical 
issue of economic diversification in Atlantic Canada. Does the 
Prime Minister not realize that his actions speak louder than 
words?
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	The absence of the Minister of Industry at the announcement 
only creates the impression that the government considers 
Atlantic Canada, particularly Newfoundland, a region without 
economic hope. Why was the Minister of Industry not present at 
this announcement?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member makes 
reference to the fact that the Minister of Industry was not in 
attendance. The hon. member should also say that the Minister 
for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency was not in 
attendance either.
<P>
	I want to assure the hon. member that in view of the 
commitments the Prime Minister has made and we made during 
the election campaign, each and every member of this cabinet, 
each and every member of this caucus, and each and every 
member of this party are firmly committed to assisting those 
who are in need, whether they be in the Atlantic region, in 
Quebec, western Canada or Ontario, to try to provide some 
economic assistance where possible.

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, the youth 
program announced by the Minister of Human Resources 
Development a few days ago duplicates a number of programs 
that already exist in Quebec, including <I>Jeunes volontaires</I>, 
<I>Jeunes </I>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3235"> 3235 </A></B>
<P>
promoteurs, and <I>Chantiers Jeunesse</I>, plus all the training related 
to education.
<P>
	In fact, the federal strategy will merely add to the overlap and 
duplication which already cost $300 million annually in the case 
of Quebec alone.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does he realize 
that by doing this, he is not only failing to deliver on his promise 
to eliminate duplication but actually adding to it, and that a 
substantial share of the funds that should go to youth will be 
used to support the federal bureaucracy that will be needed to 
administer the program?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the federal government is at least as keen as any other 
government-and the Official Opposition-to eliminate 
duplication and overlap.
<P>
	In the youth sector we have had federal programs that helped 
young people and will continue to do so. I said earlier that we 
have made every effort to avoid any duplication of programs 
that already exist in Quebec, especially the <I>Jeunes volontaires</I>, 
when setting up programs in that province.
<P>
	It is also true that the youth unemployment problem is so 
serious that both governments must try to find appropriate 
solutions. They keep repeating that program overlap costs 
money. Of course it does, but probably not to that extent. Studies 
indicate that the costs of overlap is quite different from the 
figures that were mentioned. Of course, overlap can be reduced 
more readily in some areas than in others-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I am sorry to interrupt, but the hon. member for 
Roberval has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, once again, 
we have seen that the government, despite its concern for 
eliminating overlap, goes ahead and puts in a six-part program 
on top of what we already have in Quebec. I wonder where the 
Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs is at.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members: </B>Oh, oh.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gauthier (Roberval):</B> You had better listen, over there, 
since this is your business, and you voted for these policies, 
without considering the consequences. If $10,000 is to be spent 
on each of these young people, did the minister consider how 
much money should-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Questions and answers are something we all 
care about. I would therefore ask hon. members on both sides of 
the House to keep their voices down, when they ask questions as 
well as when they give answers.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I will simply repeat that the party currently in office is 
as intent as any other party on reducing overlap.
<P>
	As far as our youth program is concerned, we have carried out 
extensive consultations and it is clear that our program meets 
the current needs of young people. And we do not intend to give 
up our right to help Canadians in need. In the case in point, there 
are Canadians in need who are not getting help from any 
provincial program. This is an area of shared jurisdiction and we 
have programs to implement in that area.

	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to interrupt the theatre that is going on here to actually ask a 
question of the Minister for International Trade.
<P>
	First, I would like to take a little different tact and 
congratulate the Minister for International Trade on the 
successful signing of the GATT in Morocco. While in Morocco 
the minister said that he would not yield to pressure from the 
United States on the question of Canadian wheat exports.
<P>
	Is the minister willing to hold his ground until the world trade 
organization is up and running and let it decide that our wheat 
exports are not unfairly subsidized?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his kind comments.
<P>
	The situation with regard to wheat is that we have engaged in 
continuing discussions with the United States for some months, 
culminating in some meetings in Marrakech where we had 
hoped to resolve the issue. However the United States and 
Canadian positions remain far apart.
<P>
	It is open to Canada and to the United States to continue those 
negotiations or discussions if the United States chooses to 
pursue them. The United States has indicated that it had hoped to 
resolve the issue by Friday. We will have to see whether the 
decision of the United States by Friday is to proceed with 
discussions or to take some other action.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Charlie Penson (Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary question is for the same minister.
<P>
	Many concerned Canadian wheat farmers feel they are doing a 
good job, are being competitive and have adjusted to the new 
reality of free trade. Would the minister allay the fears of wheat 
farmers by saying that their interests will not be traded off to

protect supply  management in order to cut a deal with the 
United States in this area?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Roy MacLaren (Minister for International Trade):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, most emphatically, yes.
<P>
	Despite persistent United States efforts to link agricultural 
problems, there are agricultural differences between our two 
countries. We reject any such linkage. We shall deal with each 
issue on its merits. Certainly in the case of wheat we very much 
share the point of view just outlined by the member opposite.

	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Finance and Minister responsible 
for the Federal Office of Regional Development in Quebec.
<P>
	Yesterday, officials from Opération Dignité 2, an organization 
which promotes regional economic development, appealed to 
the government for help. They are asking the government to 
postpone the UI reform for one year, as it will severely affect 
regions with a high proportion of seasonal workers, in Quebec as 
well as in other provinces.
<P>
	Given the disastrous impact of this reform on the economy of 
predominantly rural regions, will the minister pledge to delay 
for one year the UI cuts announced in the budget, and actually do 
it?
<P>
<B>(1445) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, it is precisely because 
we are very much aware of the enormous problem which 
unemployment represents everywhere in Canada, and certainly 
in rural areas, that we want to proceed with a reform of the 
unemployment insurance program. We want to really lower UI 
contributions so that small businesses can hire new workers, 
protect the poor, including single-parent families, and have the 
money to educate and train the workers of the future.
<P>
	We made those decisions because we are keenly aware of the 
unemployment problem in Quebec and in rural Canada.
<P>
	<B>Mr. René Canuel (Matapédia-Matane):</B> My 
supplementary is for the Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional Development in 
Quebec.
<P>
	Is the minister prepared to come and sit down-and not 
merely go through the area like he did during the election 
campaign-with residents of the Gaspe Peninsula and Lower St. 
Lawrence region to find, with them and with provincial 
officials, ways to make better use of current income security 
funds and create real jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>In the context of the social security 
reform undertaken by my colleague, I will certainly do so. 
However, I will not be the only one; other ministers are willing 
to go too. Nevertheless, as I have already said, I can tell you 
unequivocally that I am quite prepared to go and meet your 
constituents this summer.

<P>
	The budget announcement that $100 million over the next two

Canadians is being well received, particularly in rural Canada. 
Reinstating RRAP will create jobs and improve living 
conditions for low income Canadians.

Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada

for his unexpected question.
<P>
	We have had numerous deliberations with the provincial 
governments across the country. A number of them have agreed 
with us that there is a necessity for cutting out duplication and 
overlap. However a number of them for a variety of reasons have 
not wanted to proceed with us. For instance, in the province of 
Ontario there has been no sharing of that common vision.
<P>
	Moneys under RRAP will be made available later this week. 
Applications can be processed in the coming weeks. I hope we

<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and

hon. member gets his information with regard to the context of 
guidelines which are to be released by the government.
<P>
	I want to assure him however that the Prime Minister made a

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is directed to the Minister of Public Works, and it is a 
real question.
<P>
	Strange things are happening in the Department of Public 
Works. In the procurement contract for flu vaccine purchased 
for the provinces, the minister, acting on his own initiative, split 
the contract equally between Connaught in Ontario and Bio Vac 
in Quebec. The minister says he found a Canadian solution to a 
Canadian problem. However, the contract share awarded to 
Connaught will be produced in the United States.
<P>
	Since BioVac is offering these vaccines at $1.70 per unit, why 
does the government insist on paying more-$1.85 per 
unit-with its decision to purchase part of these vaccines in the 
United States, so that Quebec loses 26 high tech jobs and an 
investment project worth $32 million will be cancelled?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question. Obviously the hon. member does not have all of 
the facts.
<P>
	The hon. member should be aware that in previous years the 
amount of the contract awarded to the company from the 
province of Quebec was approximately 38 per cent over a three 
year average.
<P>
	This year because of the representations made by the hon. 
member and her party, all of which we took into consideration, 
we were able to have an agreement in principle where both 
parties, Connaught industries from Ontario and BioVac from 
Quebec, would be able to split a contract on a 50:50 basis. Keep 
in mind that the Government of Canada purchased less than 1 
per cent of the vaccine and 99 per cent of that particular contract 
was purchased by the other provinces across this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, are we to 
conclude that the contract splitting was the result of pressure 
from ministers in Toronto, who prefer an approach that is more 
expensive and risky in terms of security and supply, to drum up 
business for a Toronto distributor, as opposed to awarding the 
whole contract to a Quebec manufacturer?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Dingwall (Minister of Public Works and 
Government Services and Minister for the Atlantic Canada 
Opportunities Agency):</B> Mr. Speaker, again I thank the hon. 
member for such a wonderful question.
<P>
	I informed the hon. member and this House that two years ago 
in the province of Quebec BioVac did not get 50 per cent of the 
contract; 87 per cent of the contract went to the province of 
Ontario.
<P>
	What we have provided under this particular regime is a 50:50 
splitting of the contract. One per cent of that contract is 
purchased by the Government of Canada; 99 per cent is 
purchased by all the other provinces. If that is not equity I am 
sure the hon. member might want to go back to math school.

	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Justice.
<P>
	In Edmonton on April 17 in the early hours of the morning a 
young couple, ages 36 and 37, with their two children, ages 9 
and 6, were wakened by a noise. The mother, thinking it was one 
of her children, went to investigate. Three young offenders had 
broken into their house. When she confronted them they 
promptly stabbed her to death.
<P>
	When is this minister going to act by sending a clear message 
to violent young offenders that the experiments of the seventies 
were a failure and they will be treated henceforth as the vicious 
criminals they are?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, we all read with shock and 
horror the facts of the case to which the hon. member has 
referred. I do 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3238"> 3238 </A></B>
<P>
not want to discuss that case  because at least two people have 
been taken into custody and that is a matter for the courts.
<P>
	Let me speak to the broader point the hon. member has raised 
not for the first time in this House. Let me say I have responded 
not for the first time in this House that this government, from its 
platform through to its present policy, has recognized the need 
for changes to the Young Offenders Act. A thorough review of 
the statute is needed to determine whether it continues to meet 
the needs of the Canadian public.
<P>
<B>(1455 ) </B>
<P>
	As I have told my hon. friend in the past we are going to 
introduce legislation in this House in June to make specific 
changes to the statute. At the same time we will turn the Young 
Offenders Act in its entirety over to the justice committee of 
which the hon. member is a member for a thorough review to 
ensure it meets the needs of juvenile justice in Canada.
<P>
	That is the same response I gave last time. I shall give that 
response the next time the hon. member asks the same question.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
unfortunately I will probably have to ask the same question 
about a new case. How many people have to die before this 
government will realize the legislation they have had in place 
for 16 years is useless? It is time to act.
<P>
	This Young Offenders Act is inherently flawed. Any amount 
of tinkering this government will do will not fix it. We need 
completely new legislation for young offenders.
<P>
	Will the minister replace this legislation? Will the minister 
scrap the act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have already said the 
justice committee will be asked to look at the act to determine 
whether it ought to be changed further, beyond the changes we 
are going to introduce in June.
<P>
	Let me add that it seems to me the hon. member is falling into 
the error of assuming the tragedies to which he refers, the crimes 
to which he makes reference in his questions, can be averted or 
overcome by the simple expedient of changing a piece of 
legislation. The difficulties and problems to which he refers run 
deeper than that.
<P>
	The approach this government is taking is not only to 
introduce changes to statutes as required, and that we shall do, 
but also to address the broader question of crime prevention in 
this country, also a priority for this government.

	<B>Mr. Tony Ianno (Trinity-Spadina):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Industry.
<P>
	As the Canadian telephone sales and telemarketing industry 
continues to grow, so has an increase in telephone sales fraud. 
Telephone sales fraud has become alarmingly commonplace 
with some studies estimating that it defrauds the public of up to 
$100 million. These fraudulent practices affect all Canadians 
but especially senior citizens.
<P>
	What is the minister prepared to do or doing at this time to 
protect Canadians from this telephone sales fraud?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member not only for his question but also for raising 
this issue in the House of Commons at this time.
<P>
	It is a very important concern not just of our department and 
of the Bureau of Competition Policy but it should be a matter of 
concern for all Canadians.
<P>
	As he mentions senior citizens particularly have been 
victimized by fraudulent telemarketing activities. For that 
reason the Bureau of Competition Policy which is responsible 
for enforcing laws respecting misleading advertising has 
included a flyer with the old age security cheques. This notice 
warns senior citizens of the danger of telephone fraud and of 
making the appropriate inquiries when telephone calls are 
received.
<P>
	Also the Bureau of Competition Policy in co-operation with 
the RCMP and provincial police forces will be increasing 
enforcement activities to see that the laws on the books are 
appropriately enforced.

catch-up wages and another $25 million in pay equalization

<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister

and the statements of the Prime Minister flow directly from the

budget were sufficient to bring us to the 3 per cent of GDP.
<P>
	As well the budget talked about the large reform that was 
going to be carried on by the Minister for Public Service 
Renewal looking at it program by program.

	That is the position of the government. It is very important to 
understand that it has not only been set out on countless

	The House resumed consideration of the motion, and of the 
amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened 
with great interest to the remarks the hon. member for 
Vancouver Centre made before Question Period. In her remarks, 
she repeatedly provided assurances to the effect that provisions 
not included in the legislation, which were to be covered by the 
regulation, would be appropriately covered. I am not quite sure 
that I am satisfied with that, but at least I had the pleasure of 
hearing her say that, in her mind, a solution may be found in 
precedents created in previous pieces of legislation.
<P>
<B>(1505) </B>
<P>
	More specifically, I would like the hon. member to assure me 
that one way or another, the courts can, while not being legally 
bound to do so, induce people charged with possession or use of 
narcotics to seek rehabilitation and detoxification therapy.
<P>
	At present, as we know, the law does not require a judge to 
deal with a youth, for example, in such a way as to get him or her 
rehabilitated or detoxified. It is left entirely to the discretion of 
the judge. Unfortunately, judges all too often put behind bars 
young offenders who really need treatment instead.
<P>
	Finally, is it not unfortunate that mistakes of youth cause 
young offenders, children, and teenagers to have criminal 
records following them for the rest of their lives, when it would 
be so much simpler to set them back on the straight and narrow 
by decriminalizing offenses which are, by and large, minor and 
fight the big-time drug lords instead.
<P>
	I will conclude on this note. In the hearings on Bill C-85, the 
ancestor of Bill C-7, members of the police forces themselves 
expressed concern about the fact that the bill did not deal with 
drug lords, but only small-time dealers.
<P>
	I would appreciate it if the hon. member could comment on 
this.

for his question.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3240"> 3240 </A></B>
<P>
	I listened when he spoke to the bill in the House. He made 
some very clear points which I tried to address in my speech 
today.
<P>
	For over a decade it has been almost a precedent within 
jurisprudence that it has been a notion of the law that people 
would be sent for rehabilitation.
<P>
	However, one of the key things about rehabilitation that we 
must remember is that you cannot force people to have 
treatment. They must be assessed first and that does not require 
a judge. All the judge needs to do is have the person assessed by 
a health professional who then decides whether the person is 
ready for rehabilitation or not.
<P>
	That has always been done in jurisprudence over the last 10 
years with regard to issues like this. I hope we will continue to 
do it because then the person would be assessed properly and 
treated if they so desire. As members well know, motivation and 
acceptance of addiction is an essential part of treatment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, I wonder if the 
parliamentary secretary could make a comparison between Bill 
C-85 and Bill C-7. Could she comment on how similar these 
two bills are?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Fry:</B> Madam Speaker, the two bills are similar in that 
they have the same principle. However since that last bill we 
have talked with people like the Canadian Medical Association 
and some of the groups who found some problems with some of 
the clauses in this bill. As a result, we have dealt with some of 
the issues, as I said in my speech, that the CMA had found 
difficulty with, especially with regard to things like what you 
use as drug paraphernalia and the difference between drug 
paraphernalia and what is an essential part of some of our 
preventive programs for HIV. For instance a needle is now 
considered to be accepted and will therefore not be included in 
drug paraphernalia but would be accepted as a prevention. Those 
kinds of things are now eliminated from the old bill.
<P>
<B>(1510) </B>
<P>
	Another thing that has been eliminated is the fact that 
physicians are not going to be considered to be traffickers if they 
are using a drug which they have been designated as being 
allowed to use if they are using it appropriately. Some of these 
things have been clarified in the bill. Therefore, some changes 
have been made in the bill to satisfy old questions that have been 
asked in the past.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, I listened with 
great interest before question period to the member for 
Dartmouth. I must compliment him. I believe the member is an 
accomplished orator and some of the words and phrases he used 
I found a little stinging. My ears are still stinging with the 
rebuke of the hon. member.
<P>
	I was particularly interested when he spoke of the partisan 
nature of the House, partisan in the sense that we should look at 
the intent and purpose of legislation and be able to look well 
beyond narrow party bounds.
<P>
	I found this fascinating in regard to this bill. I would like to 
state categorically that where Bill C-7 speaks of controlling 
drugs and substances it gets the wholehearted support of the 
Reform Party. For the member for Dartmouth, I cannot say that 
strongly enough.
<P>
	I want to go on from that statement but have it remembered 
through this discourse. Not so long ago Bill C-85 was in the 
House and the member and his colleagues were sitting on the 
other side. I would like hon. members to judge the partisanship 
that was registered about Bill C-85 at that time.
<P>
	The member said that the present bill is simply codifying 
regulations. What did the member and his colleagues say about 
it not yet a year ago? I have gone back to the committee minutes 
and have a few of them here.
<P>
	The member from Winnipeg, a colleague that I value, said the 
following: ``The subject has not been given any media attention 
yet. I understand it was given first reading almost a year ago in 
June 1992. To rush through it within a couple of months will not 
speak well of Parliament at the least''.
<P>
	The same member said: ``I do not want us to give any wrong 
impressions to the Canadian public about this very serious bill. 
It needs serious study''. That is not partisan apparently when 
spoken by member of the opposition who was a Liberal.
<P>
	I go on. This comment was not made by a Liberal but another 
member of the committee and in response to a specific question. 
``My understanding was that the bill would be passed to second 
reading on the understanding that we give it a thorough 
examination in committee. I agreed to that with one speaker and 
we agreed to that within our party. Then it gets into the 
committee and we are rushing through it to beat-'' and there 
the member used an unparliamentary word, ``-and for what, so 
Madam Sparrow can take on the Reform Party, is that it? I don't 
understand. We'd be nowhere?''.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	These comments go on, comments made by my colleagues on 
the other side of the House now. I cannot say this strongly 
enough. If the bill is flawed enough to cause them to create a 
great stir in committee, surely the bill is flawed enough today to 
listen to constructive-I say this loudly to the 
member-criticism of this bill.
<P>
	Maybe the member will look down at his feet and say 
constructive criticism cannot come from a member on this side. 
Surely it can come from a member on this side. It went on. 
Members spoke about really getting worried. Here is a commit-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3241"> 3241 </A></B>
<P>
tee with the government side trying to ram through the 
legislation. It even talked about putting closure on.
<P>
	This bill took months and months in the previous Parliament. 
Surely it should not hurt to take a few hours of debate in this 
House that would be listened to. I am almost at a loss of words to 
listen to how partisanship could only happen on this side of the 
House.
<P>
	I wanted to go over other comments made by people who 
appeared in front of the House. They were by S.J. Usprich and 
J.R.M. Solomon when reviewing this bill. These are not 
parliamentarians. They are individuals commenting on this bill. 
They said that this was a poorly drafted, intentionally over broad 
and vaguely worded piece of legislation. I agree.
<P>
	I wanted to talk about some things in this bill that are good. It 
is traditionally suitable to only complain. I wanted to say what 
things I agreed with from the specific aspects that I am going to 
talk about. These are the medical aspects.
<P>
	With the attempts to curb abuse of designer drugs and look 
alike drugs I agree. Stimulants, depressants, hallucinogenics, 
these drugs have proliferated in the laboratories of our country 
and our laws do not and have not kept up with those problems.
<P>
	There is legislation in this act to prevent double doctoring. 
There is a huge black market in prescription medications. One of 
the easiest things for people to do is shop from doctor to doctor, 
getting the same prescription filled over and over again. The 
only way we have of preventing that is for our pharmacists to 
have access to the computers and to be able to catch that.
<P>
	Double doctoring is a significant problem, an issue that I 
agree with fully. There are other things that would help this. 
Triplicate prescriptions will help. The use of computers at all 
pharmacies will also help but there are very specific provisions 
in this bill that are very vague and broad.
<P>
	I heard a member from the Bloc speak about the things that an 
individual could inspect as they came into the practitioner's 
office; for example, open and examine any receptacle or 
package, examine anything found in that place, examine any 
label, take records, books or other documents, seize and detain, 
reproduce any document.
<P>
	It was not so long ago that I had one of my colleagues say to 
me that patient confidentiality was being eroded in our country. 
Patient confidentiality is very important. Concerning the 
woman coming in to speak with her physician about sexual 
abuse when she was young, asking if these records are 
confidential, will anybody be able to look at them, the answer if 
this act is brought in will be no, your records are not 
confidential. That is a problem.
<P>
	I thought I would take a light hearted look at a bit of the 
bureaucratic mumbo-jumbo in this bill. We talk about 
bureaucratise. The governor in council may, by regulation, 
designate any regulation made under this act as a regulation. In 
other words, we can make regulations about regulations to 
regulate whatever we want, including regulations. That is 
nonsense.
<P>
	The act is also full of very specific definitions of the subjects 
and the substances covered in this bill and then goes on to say 
the governor in council may amend any of the schedules by 
adding to them or deleting from them any item or portion of an 
item. That does not fit with the exactitude that an act like this 
requires.
<P>
<B>(1520 ) </B>
<P>
	In our country I believe criminal justice needs a thorough 
review. This bill should be part of that review. Gun control 
issues need a thorough review. The Young Offenders Act needs a 
thorough review. Victims' impact statements need a thorough 
review. Let us listen to the Liberal members who sat on 
committee a year ago and said that this act needs a very thorough 
review before it goes to second reading.
<P>
	Whether or not the government is willing to take this to the 
justice committee or the health committee, I personally feel that 
it should be in the justice committee. I listened to the Solicitor 
General in this House agree to that. I also heard one of the justice 
committee members saying he felt that this should go to justice.
<P>
	I would ask the members to recollect again my comment that 
in terms of the criminal justice issue with this act we are in total 
agreement. The bill is poorly crafted, poorly worded and has 
flaws in it that are almost too great to address in committee. I 
would ask the government to review very carefully this aspect of 
this act and to put it to the justice committee as we suggested.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ron MacDonald (Dartmouth):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
glad I am still here because the hon. member raised a number of 
issues and I am pleased that he clarified his own position and I 
suspect of his party. I am not sure if he speaks for himself or his 
party on this issue.
<P>
	This bill was before the previous Parliament and Liberals had 
some difficulty with it. We believe there were some things that 
were flawed. The context in which the previous government 
pursued legislation was a closed shop. Conservative 
government members went in to the committee like lambs with 
rings in their noses and were led by the parliamentary 
secretaries at the time. Even the worst bill, even the most 
obviously flawed bill would not be changed once the minister 
rose in his or her place and tabled it in the House.
<P>
	We have given a commitment that we will not do that. We 
have seen this on a number of issues that committees have 
already started to examine. It was a different place and a 
different time and the government was committed when Bill 
C-85 was put in the last Parliament not to listen to any 
substantive suggestions for change in the bill. That was clear 
from the outset.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3242"> 3242 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe the member is sincere in what he said here today. 
This is second reading debate. This is where parties and 
individuals agree or disagree to approve the bill in its principle, 
in its direction. Then it goes on to committee where we then 
have report stage. I would urge the member opposite if he is 
trying to make this place work better that if he agrees in 
principle with the bill to vote in favour of the bill, refer it to the 
committee with the concerns he has, which are legitimate, about 
whether there are flaws that can be fixed, and work at the 
committee level.
<P>
	I can give a commitment from this side that our government is 
quite prepared to listen to any reasonable suggestions as to how 
legislation such as this can be made better. We are committed to 
making this Parliament and its committee system work.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hill (Macleod):</B> Madam Speaker, the rhetoric is great 
and I do hope the member is telling it exactly as it is. However, I 
feel and I sense that there is an ownership taken of a bill as soon 
as the member switched to the other side. I wish that were not the 
case. It does not seem fair to me that the bill can have changed so 
much in this short period of time.
<P>
	I read both of them, they are not significantly changed. My 
sincere hope would be that this is in fact the way this Parliament 
would work. I cannot say this any stronger than I have already. 
When it went to the committee stage when those members were 
in opposition there was a howl and a scream of it being rammed 
through. I am not at all comfortable as I sit over here to see that 
same process take place. I am speaking of this loudly and I will 
watch with great interest.
<P>
	I would also refer back to the member. If this is to be a 
co-operative Parliament would the member not look very 
carefully at the proposal to take this to justice? This is not, and I 
cannot say this strongly enough, a health bill. This is a justice 
bill.
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to comment on some of 
the things that the hon. member said.
<P>
	There are some differences in this bill. It is not the exact bill 
that was brought to the House last time around.
<P>
	The word ``provide'' now in definition is changed so that it 
specifically says traffic. That means that a physician or a 
pharmacist's providing a drug to a patient is no longer in danger 
of being considered trafficking. That was one of the very poor 
things in the last bill that had to be changed.
<P>
	There are a couple of other things. The fact that a patient goes 
to a physician or a pharmacist and takes away and possesses 
drugs also has been specifically defined in the bill so that we 
now know that is allowable and that is not considered to be a 
criminal offence.
<P>
	There is one other thing I want to say to the member. It has to 
do with the fact that he was talking about physician-patient 
confidentiality. There is a great misunderstanding out there in 
the real world about physician-patient confidentiality.
<P>
	What the member should know is that there is no such thing in 
reality; in no court or group or insurance company. In British 
Columbia, for instance, the insurance company of British 
Columbia that deals with traffic accidents can subpoena all of 
the clinical records of the patient regardless of whether they 
have to do with the accident. This is allowable and the physician 
and the patient have no recourse.
<P>
	There is a precedent already here that the information 
between a physician and a patient is not that privileged as one 
would expect. It is not like the information between a lawyer and 
a client. Lots of laws so far have allowed for ministers of health 
to look at records if they believe, and this is what this bill says, 
that the physician and the patient were in agreement to use drugs 
for purposes other than therapy and other than appropriate 
physician-patient use.
<P>
	This is going to be done by health professionals who are 
governed by the Privacy Act and by confidentiality so that no 
one should be able to see this but the particular minister and the 
particular inspector.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, it is a 
pleasure for me to be able to rise today and speak on Bill C-11. 
At the outset I would like to point out that I am certainly not 
opposed entirely to Bill C-ll. There are some very good things in 
it.
<P>
	I agree that we must educate the public as far as smoking 
hazards are concerned. I further agree that we should be placing 
an export tobacco tax on-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> I am sorry, is the hon. 
member aware that we are speaking on Bill C-7 right now? You 
are debating on Bill C-11.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Johnston:</B> I am on Bill C-11, Madam Speaker.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> We are not yet at Bill 
C-11. We are still debating on Bill C-7. Resuming debate, the 
hon. member for Saskatoon-Dundurn.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Madam 
Speaker, it is interesting to hear all the different members in the 
House speaking on this legislation. It is interesting to hear that 
there is consensus on many points and disagreement on some.
<P>
	Everyone, it appears, agrees that there is need for legislation 
for the control of drugs and that this be put into one statute. To 
date we have two statutes that govern this. It is important to have 
this in one statute; important for the public so that the public can 
from this point on refer to one statute and know what is allowed 
and what is not allowed and how the controls take effect.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3243"> 3243 </A></B>
<P>
	It is also important that our children be protected from the 
parasites of society. The legislation in question takes that into 
effect. We all have the goal of having legislation that will 
control what many people consider to be a profession, a 
profession at the price and at the cost of our young people in 
society. We cannot have young people destroyed. We must not 
allow it. Apart from educating the public we still need 
legislation controlling, as I have indicated, these parasites in 
society.
<P>
<B>(1530) </B>
<P>
	We cannot take legislation such as the legislation that has 
been proposed and rubber stamp it. Perhaps we have consensus 
on that as well. The legislation is so different. It is not just 
amending legislation but is new legislation which has been 
drafted, trying to foresee all the problems that may arise. By 
trying to foresee problems one tends either to overlook certain 
matters or give it too great a scope.
<P>
	We must be vigilant that we do not throw out human rights. 
When we are dealing with legislation such as this innocent 
people will also be involved. We must not trample on their 
rights. In enforcing rights against individuals who breach the 
law we sometimes come into contact with people who are 
innocent and their rights are trampled upon. We must look at the 
legislation in this light.
<P>
	In other words we generally have to balance the rights of the 
innocent people with the objectives of the statute itself. What 
better way to do this but in committee. It appears all people in 
the Chamber favour the legislation and its goals. We must be 
careful as we look at the legislation not to get to the stage where 
we in fact trample on the rights of individual people, innocent 
people.
<P>
	Let me just give an example in this respect. We must be 
careful with the definition of trafficking. I am not saying the 
definition in the statute is adequate or inadequate, but let us just 
take a look at it. The definition of trafficking deals with selling. 
Traffic means to sell, administer, provide, transport, send or 
deliver.
<P>
	Is that a definition we wish to have? Do we want people who 
simply send or deliver an item or provide an item to be 
trafficking? Then we have the definition of provide which 
means to give, transfer or otherwise provide in any manner. Do 
we want such a definition?
<P>
	The problems we run into with such a definition of provide is 
that we could have too many people covered. We could have 
innocent people covered. We could have people who simply give 
medication to others within a home, people who have a proper 
prescription to a controlled substance, being guilty of 
trafficking.
<P>
	Let me give an example. An individual, a spouse, may have a 
prescription for a controlled substance. The other spouse may be 
requested to fetch that particular item. By giving that substance 
to a child to bring to the other spouse the initial spouse is guilty 
of trafficking. We do not want that. We cannot have that. We 
must be vigilant  that innocent people are not covered by the 
legislation in this manner. In other words we have to balance 
here again. The balance requires that the innocent people be 
protected against the objectives of the statute.
<P>
	We must also look at the provisions of the statute in certain 
procedural matters where preliminary inquiries are taken away 
from certain individuals.
<P>
	The summary convictions portion of the statute is expanded 
thus eliminating preliminary inquiries. This may not be 
something suitable for the public. This may not be something we 
require or desire in the administration of justice. Depending on 
discussions in this area, discussions as to disclosure by the 
crown to the defence, this may be reasonable but it may not be 
reasonable. What better place to deal with it but in a committee.
<P>
	We have to look at what the controlled substances are. What 
are we looking at? Part of the definitions in the schedules refer 
to derivatives and similar synthetic preparations.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	One has to look at the objectives of the legislation again 
which are to prevent the designer drugs, slight alteration to 
drugs and in that way getting around the legislation. We also 
have to look at the innocent people who can possess these 
particular items and not know that it is an offence.
<P>
	Unless we have specific items indicated in the statute that we 
know are offences or not offences, it is difficult to function in 
society. We have to balance again. What better way to balance 
but to discuss it in committee. Let the committee take a look at it 
and thus be able to protect the innocent who may come into 
contact with the statute and also see to it that those who are 
trying to circumvent the legislation are duly dealt with.
<P>
	One area that may create some problems is the area of 
possessing property or proceeds of any property knowing that 
all or part was obtained or derived directly or indirectly. I look at 
this matter and I have problems. The problems that arise are that 
individuals may have property they received. Store owners may 
receive money from people who they believe may be selling 
drugs but also have legitimate jobs. Those store owners are not 
protected if they sell products to that individual. This particular 
legislation might be too broad.
<P>
	As well we have a problem with respect to legislation that 
deals with the Governor General being able to exempt police 
from the statute. Exempting police from the statute allows 
police in the investigation of offences under the statute to 
traffic. If police can traffic they can instigate offences. If they 
can instigate offences and if it is allowed we may have a problem 
in our criminal justice system with individuals who are too 
vigilant or too aggressive in attempting to protect society, and 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3244"> 3244 </A></B>
<P>
by trying to protect society may in fact be pulling innocent 
people into the web. I see that my time has run out.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Judy Bethel (Edmonton East):</B> Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to participate in the discussion of Bill C-7 today, the 
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. In the long term it will be 
one of the most important pieces of legislation considered by 
this assembly. Canada needs a comprehensive drug strategy and 
Bill C-7 provides it.
<P>
	If we talk with community leaders in any of our cities we will 
soon hear that our current laws are not effective in dealing with 
the drug problems they face. Police forces across the country 
have pointed out that new laws are needed to deal with the 
techniques now used by drug offenders.
<P>
	Neighbourhood groups are really frustrated because the law 
seems powerless to do anything even when they and the police 
know about drug dealings on their streets. Community workers 
who are trying to help young people choose a healthy lifestyle 
are discouraged because the law is not a partner in their cause. 
Often it is a detriment. Ineffective laws also bring disrespect for 
the law in general, and this is certainly true of current drug laws.
<P>
	For all these reasons I welcome and support Bill C-7. It 
provides important new tools for the police and communities to 
use in fighting the drug problem in the country. This law will 
make it easier for police to prosecute drug dealers and it 
provides stronger penalties. It will allow the courts to consider 
aggravating factors in sentencing such as the involvement of 
children and the sale of drugs in school yards.
<P>
	Bill C-7 is a comprehensive drug strategy and a major 
improvement from existing laws. There is, however, one aspect 
of the modern drug trade that is not covered. I would like to see 
the bill amended to close this loophole. I am talking about the 
use of fortified drug houses to avoid police prosecution. This is 
already a significant problem in Edmonton and many other 
cities. It will become an even greater problem as police forces 
begin to use other features of the new law.
<P>
	I will briefly describe the problems and propose possible 
amendments for consideration by the committee in its review of 
the legislation.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	The first fortified drug house in Edmonton was appropriately 
called the Fortress, and that is exactly what it was. The plan is 
simple. Drug dealers rent an old house and fortify it through the 
addition of cement walls, steel doors, false entrances, trap doors 
and other obstacles. This delays police entry long enough to 
destroy any evidence of drug trade. The element of surprise, an 
important element in effective enforcement, is gone. These 
houses also allow for the exchange of money and drugs through 
trap doors. There is no human contact between the dealer and the 
purchaser, eliminating other ways of catching dealers.
<P>
	Over the years the Edmonton police service employed a 
number of tactics against the Fortress with little success. An 
appeal was made to the absentee landlord but he did not care as 
long he got his rent. In fact he legally challenged any moves by 
the city to close the place down.
<P>
	The neighbourhood became very upset because the Fortress 
became a centre of undesirable activity. It ruined all their hard 
work to clean up their neighbourhood. Used syringes were 
discarded in nearby playgrounds where children could pick 
them up. Traffic noise and frequent street fights made the area 
unsafe. Older residents and families were forced to move away, 
adding to the cycle and the significant costs of inner city decay.
<P>
	In response to the community the Edmonton city council tried 
applying every possible law relating to property and land use but 
ran into legal barriers at every turn. The fact is that there is no 
legislation to deal with this situation effectively. Drug dealers 
know it and openly flaunt the law.
<P>
	I am told by the Edmonton police service there are now 12 
fortified drug houses in operation in our city; some are sporadic 
operations and some are permanent. All of them present a major 
cost to communities and lead to more disrespect for the law.
<P>
	In the United States the problem with fortified drug houses 
had to be dealt with through specific legislation. Some states 
like California have been successful. However we need to 
address this problem in Canada.
<P>
	In order to make Bill C-7 a truly comprehensive drug 
strategy, I am proposing that it be amended to deal with the 
problem of fortified drug houses. There are three possibilities 
for amending the legislation to cover fortified drug houses. One 
is to include real estate in the definition of offence related 
property. Bill C-7 allows for the confiscation of property used 
in drug trafficking, but the definition specifically excludes real 
estate. Removing this exemption would be one way of 
addressing the problem.
<P>
	A second approach is an amendment to create a new offence. 
The amendment would prohibit an owner, landlord or tenant 
from knowingly permitting a place to be used for the primary 
purpose of trafficking in illegal drugs. The Edmonton police 
service has drafted a proposed amendment which I will be 
pleased to provide the committee.
<P>
	A third option is to establish a mechanism by which drug 
houses could be confiscated by the crown under specific 
conditions. Again the Edmonton police service has provided 
some suggestions which I will provide in writing to the 
committee.
<P>
	Any of these amendments are consistent with the intent and 
the spirit of the legislation. They will address the significant 
problem of fortified drug houses which is not adequately 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3245"> 3245 </A></B>
<P>
covered at this time. If we do not address the problem now 
fortified houses will spread as the way to avoid prosecution 
under provisions of the act.
<P>
	This is an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss. Bill C-7 
is a comprehensive drug strategy. Let us cover all the loopholes 
and give communities the tools they need to deal with the 
problem that creates untold damage in human lives and safety in 
our communities.
<P>
	I urge my colleagues to support Bill C-7 and to support an 
amendment that will address the problem of fortified drug 
houses at the same time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Madam Speaker, I will 
be commenting on Bill C-7 in my capacity as Official 
Opposition health critic.
<P>
	The Minister of Health has introduced on behalf of the 
government Bill C-7, An Act respecting the control of certain 
drugs, their precursors and other substances.
<P>
	After reviewing this bill carefully and mindful of the 
seriousness of the health issues at stake here, I have to say that 
the bill misses the mark because of the underlying push to 
criminalize certain activities and that it is a failed attempt to 
modernize our approach to combatting this costly scourge on 
society.
<P>
<B>(1545) </B>
<P>
	At the outset, I wish to point out to this House that I, along 
with the Bloc Quebecois, support the move to criminalize the 
sale of illegal drugs. Adequate and effective measures and 
pertinent legislation are needed to control mood-altering 
substances. Not just any legislation, mind you and, from my 
perspective as health critic, especially not legislation that 
focuses only on the repressive aspects of the issue and 
overshadows basic public health considerations. Such 
considerations must be a key component of any legislation, 
initiative or regulation aimed at combatting drug abuse.
<P>
	In this respect, Bill C-7 needs to be radically amended. 
Although this bill was introduced by the Minister of Health, it 
does not contain any provisions designed to improve public 
health or the health of the many people who abuse drugs. In 
short, this bill proposes to fight one of society's ills through 
coercion and relentless legal efforts.
<P>
	In the next few minutes, I will show how illegal drug use is 
much more of a health problem than a crime problem.
<P>
	There are many reasons why a person turns to drugs. A person 
may be searching for a high or a feeling of euphoria or seeking 
temporary respite from the problems associated with depression 
or stress. Others who may find it difficult to keep up with the 
demands of our consumer-driven society see drugs as a way of 
overcoming fatigue or increasing their productivity. Teenagers 
in search of an identity often try drugs to defy established 
authority or simply to conform to standards of behaviour 
dictated by their environment. An unhealthy family 
environment and pervasive poverty, violence and despair are 
often a one-way ticket to drug abuse.
<P>
	The one common denominator in all of this is that drug 
abusers experienced health, emotional or social problems before 
they actually started using drugs. The criminal activity, that is 
obtaining and using the drugs, is secondary to their illness or 
social failure.
<P>
	Canada's Drug Strategy was adopted to spearhead the fight 
against drug abuse.
<P>
	A total budget of $270 million over five years has been 
earmarked for the CDS. This works out to an average annual 
budget of $54 million. So, to fight drugs, we will invest about 
$1.98 per person per year. Yet, according to the revenue 
department, drug trafficking in Canada generates some $4.6 
billion, which represents $168.52 per Canadian per year. If you 
invest $1.98 to fight an activity which generates $168.52, you 
are going to look like David against Goliath.
<P>
	In 1984, the Addiction Research Foundation estimated that 
drug use led to additional medical care totalling $2.728 billion, 
which is almost $100 per Canadian per year, while the monies 
allocated for treatment and rehabilitation only represent $0.75 
per person, or 38 per cent of the CDS budget, and the funds for 
education and prevention are equivalent to $0.63 per person per 
year, or 32 per cent of that same budget.
<P>
	Every year, reduced productivity linked to drug use costs each 
Quebecer and Canadian the equivalent of $37.54, while the costs 
of implementing the law amount to $31.10. These figures are 
self-explanatory.
<P>
<B>(1550) </B>
<P>
	The amount of money spent to fight drugs is nowhere near the 
health, social and economic costs generated by this plague, or 
the profits generated by this traffic.
<P>
	The bill which is before us has no long-term vision regarding 
the fight against drugs, which is something we had to include as 
parliamentarians. On the contrary, this legislation proposes or 
suggests old and archaic recipes as an easy way out.
<P>
	There is an explanation to that. By merely revamping the old 
Bill C-85 tabled by the previous government, this government is 
sending the message that initiative and new ideas are not its 
forte when dealing with such important issues.
<P>
	Personally, I deeply deplore the fact that a bill from the 
Department of Health gives so little consideration to its own 
field of responsibility, namely public health in Canada. Instead 
of seeking to treat and rehabilitate innocent victims, this 
legislation provides for criminalization and incarceration.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3246"> 3246 </A></B>
<P>
	What will our society, which claims to have the best health 
care program in the world, do to an innocent young person, who 
could be my child or yours and who is influenced by others into 
using soft drugs? Our society will give that young person a 
criminal record and give him a jail sentence. So much for our 
social ethic and our value system.
<P>
	Whereas enforcement measures must be maintained and even 
strengthened to fight drug traffickers-those merchants of 
dreams who make such fortunes-victims of these despicable 
people must be helped, and that means being lenient and 
offering education, prevention and rehabilitation programs, as 
well as health care.
<P>
	Is imprisonment an adequate solution, considering that 70 per 
cent of federal penitentiaries inmates use illicit drugs? Is 
making our laws more stringent a good idea, considering that 
numerous studies have repeatedly shown that fear of 
punishment or harshness is an insignificant deterrent among 
drug users?
<P>
	When comparing risks of punishment with risks to health for 
drug users, concerns for health clearly win out.
<P>
	I believe that Canadians are asking us to take effective drug 
control measures. To do so properly, we must reduce both the 
demand for and the supply of illicit drugs in a balanced way. A 
good approach will combine health, prevention and 
rehabilitation measures, and legal sanctions, too. Bill C-7, the 
amounts spent on the Canada Drug Strategy and their allocation 
do not effectively provide this balanced control.
<P>
	That is why we must reject Bill C-7, review the Canada Drug 
Strategy and use the results of recent research to update our 
approach. Above all, we must give priority to values and 
concepts that emphasize a better quality of life through better 
public health.
<P>
	You know, Madam Speaker, it is more mature to admit one's 
mistakes than to stubbornly repeat them. Therefore I call on the 
Hon. Minister of Health and the government to withdraw Bill 
C-7 and start all over. I assure them of my full co-operation in 
this.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the member for 
a very eloquent speech. She made some very strong points.
<P>
	However, the member should know that the drug strategy is 
also tied in with this bill and that 70 per cent of the money we 
now spend on looking at drugs is spent on the drug strategy 
which is the health component. It is the part that looks at 
prevention and ways of treating and rehabilitating people who 
are addicted.
<P>
	I agree with many of the things the hon. member said about 
public policy and understanding the root causes of addiction and 
of people using drugs.
<P>
<B>(1555 ) </B>
<P>
	One must also be aware of the number of people who prey on 
the vulnerable in our society. We have to find a way of dealing 
with the people who traffic in drugs, who prey on our young 
people and make them use drugs, knowing full well what they 
are doing by bringing them into an addiction that is very 
difficult for them to get out of.
<P>
	This bill is aimed at some of those people. I wondered if the 
hon. member felt that that was also needed as well as 
rehabilitation and treatment.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Picard:</B> Madam Speaker, I would like to say to the hon. 
member that I have no intention of not criminalizing drug 
traffickers; it was not what I meant. Where I do not agree with 
this bill is that the 500,000 young people arrested so far for 
possession of drugs were given criminal records, fines and jail 
sentences and are now being turned into users and criminals.
<P>
	What I ask from this bill is that this policy be reviewed to 
make it more helpful to young people, who are not criminals but 
users. We should bring in policies to encourage them to get 
treated for their addictions, to rehabilitate themselves and to 
become good citizens. I condemn Bill C-7 because it does not 
put forward such policies. What I find strange is that this bill 
comes from the Minister of Health and yet deals only with 
criminal offences.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill 
C-11, an act to amend the Excise Act, the Customs Act and the 
Tobacco Sales to Young Persons Act, be read the second time 
and referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Abbott (Kootenay East):</B> Madam Speaker, this is an 
excellent opportunity for me to develop an issue in this House. I 
attempted to do this when the government was talking about 
rolling back the taxes or in fact went ahead with the whole 
business of rolling back the taxes on cigarettes.
<P>
	Subsequent to that time it has been interesting to interview the 
interviewers, the people actually responsible for bringing the 
news to Canadians. Basically they have told me if you cannot 
say something and put your point over in 10 seconds it probably 
will not be news. It probably will not get on television. This is an 
opportunity then with a little bit more time than that to actually 
raise an issue I attempted to raise previously.
<P>
	My issue is that of corporate responsibility. It is the 
responsibility the cigarette manufacturers and distillers have to 
the people of Canada. I have some questions about the way in 
which they are carrying out their responsibility.
<P>
	During the time this whole issue was boiling another member 
of the House approached me with two empty Export A cigarette 
packages. Both of them had been purchased illegally. One was 
purchased three weeks prior to the government taking its action 
in bringing forward its measure on export taxes. The other was 
purchased one week before.
<P>
	Both packages appeared to me to be exactly the same, until I 
studied them a little more closely. The first package given to me 
had on it ``25 Class A Finest Canadian Filter Cigarettes'' and 
very proudly ``Product of Canada''. The package that was 
purchased one week later, approximately one week prior to the 
government announcing its export tax, had on it ``R.J. Reynolds 
Tobacco Co., Winston Salem, NC, Under Licence from 
R.J.R.-MacDonald, Inc., Canada''.
<P>
	It appears what was going on here was that the company 
expected there was going to be some form of export tax. Rather 
than manufacture the product in Canada and selling it to the U.S. 
where it would then be taken to a point where it could be brought 
back into Canada, the company's concern was why would it pay 
that export tax. It appears the company decided to manufacture 
the product, which appears for all purposes by its packaging to 
be exactly the same product, in Winston Salem, North Carolina 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3248"> 3248 </A></B>
<P>
thereby avoiding the action the government took about one week 
later.
<P>
	My point is Corporations in Canada should be responsible. 
Corporations in Canada should not do things that will feed into a 
situation such as we had prior to the government taking action.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	We had terror, particularly in the area where the majority of 
this product was coming through. We had fear and we had 
murders going on and it was all surrounding the whole issue of 
illegally smuggling cigarettes back into Canada.
<P>
	Yet I suggest with greatest respect that it appeared to me that 
none of these companies was taking any substantial action, they 
were not contributing to this problem of terror, this problem of 
fear, this problem of murder that was happening over these 
things.
<P>
	Furthermore, I found absolutely unfortunate the fact that at 
exactly the same time the taxes were rolled back on the 
cigarettes the distillers sent to all members of this Chamber a 
plastic 750 millilitre bottle explaining that 83 cents out of every 
dollar that is paid for that bottle one way or another go to taxes.
<P>
	It might be instructive, granted this is only by my personal 
recollection, to think for a second about how the taxes on 
cigarettes and the taxes on alcohol were raised to the level they 
were. As a youngster, as a young man and through my adult life I 
can recall many times that people were saying they could get 
away with adding more tax to cigarettes, adding more tax to 
alcohol because people want these products and therefore are 
going to pay it, therefore it is a good revenue source.
<P>
	Granted this is only by my personal recollection but I do not 
imagine too many of the members here or the Canadian public 
would contest that. It was something that happened.
<P>
	We do end up with the fact that on alcohol we have 83 cents 
out of every dollar going to the tax man. This obviously works 
against the corporate agenda. So it is that the Canadian public 
naturally becomes cynical. It says obviously that if things are 
working contrary to the corporate agenda what is going to 
happen is that companies are going to take whatever action 
required in order to protect their position.
<P>
	We have now discovered through a process of market studies 
and things of that nature that higher taxes do lead to lower 
consumption, particularly on the part of young people. I suggest 
it is the height of cynicism that it would appear as though these 
manufacturers were not only feeding the product into the system 
that included within itself the terror, the fear and the murder, 
they actually took action to try to get around the fact that this 
government, attempting to act responsibly on behalf of 
Canadian people, brought an export tax in as was assumed.
<P>
	If there is low public respect for politicians I suggest equally 
that in Canada on the part of many Canadians there is low public 
respect for corporations. I suggest to these and other 
corporations that maybe within the sound of my voice, within 
the sound of this speech, they examine their motives, take a look 
at the whole issue of corporate responsibility. Rather than trying 
to circumvent Canadian law, rather than trying to get around the 
well intentioned actions of this and other governments, they 
work with them and act in a socially responsible manner.
<P>
	If we do not have respect on the part of ordinary citizens for 
those corporations that put forward the capital to bring forward 
the jobs, if we do not have respect on the part of ordinary 
citizens toward politicians, the next step is not very far away and 
that step is one of anarchy. I would hate to see that happen in this 
nation.
<P>
<B>(1620 ) </B>
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to develop this story. As one 
postscript, however, I suggest this story which I have just 
narrated in this House was available to the Canadian news 
media. I went around to many reporters and attempted to sell 
this as something they could be bringing forward and none of 
them paid any attention. It has been suggested to me the reason 
for that is that it could not be explained in ten seconds on 
television. If our newscasting has reached that point then maybe 
the newscasters of today have to also be prepared to take a more 
responsible attitude, as I am suggesting.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Madam Speaker, after one 
false start maybe we will get right on with it this time.
<P>
	I appreciate the opportunity to speak to Bill C-11 and I will 
for the most part agree with the substance of Bill C-11. I do 
think that it is extremely important that we educate the public 
about the hazards of smoking and in that way I agree with the 
bill. I further agree that the export tax on tobacco products is a 
step in the right direction.
<P>
	However, it is the companion motion to Bill C-11 that I have 
difficulty with. I am going to speak along the same lines as my 
colleague.
<P>
	What particularly bothers me about relieving the taxation on 
cigarettes and tobacco is the fact that we on this side of the 
House are particularly in favour of stronger enforcement laws 
against smuggling.
<P>
	We have excellent police forces in Canada and we have laws 
that certainly cover the situation. Why is this so much different 
than any other lawbreaker would be? Let us take speeding for 
example. If we have a lot of non-compliance as far as the speed 
limits are concerned we never once consider abolishing the 
speed limits and allowing anyone to drive any speed they want. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3249"> 3249 </A></B>
<P>
In fact, we come up with some very ingenious methods, the 
latest of which is probably the photo radar. If you break the 
speed barrier you automatically have a picture of your licence  
plate taken and you get the bill in the mail. Of course you have 
no defence against that whatsoever.
<P>
	Here we have a method whereby we can deal directly with the 
problem rather than saying that we are going to change the rule 
so that we will not be troubled with having to catch these 
speeders anymore.
<P>
	When we reduce taxes on cigarettes it is a little like the gas 
war. When the guy across the street lowers his gasoline prices 
then that behooves me to lower my gasoline prices to stay 
competitive. It looks to me like we are actually getting into 
competition with these smugglers and in fact allowing them to 
set the government's agenda. I have a real problem with that.
<P>
	The other thing about this companion bill is that we have no 
idea how much money the government is foregoing as far as 
reducing the taxation on these cigarettes.
<P>
	We have heard over and over again that its policy is to broaden 
the tax base. By its own admission it would like to see the deficit 
reduced and that is either going to take reduced spending or 
increased taxation and the term the Liberals have come up with 
is broadening the tax base.
<P>
	Here we have a contradiction to that. We have a voluntary 
giving up of perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars. If taxes are 
reduced in this area it would naturally seem to follow that they 
will have to be increased in other areas in order to come up to 
roughly the same level. That is a question in my mind. Where is 
this foregone revenue going to come from? Obviously it will 
have to come from somewhere.
<P>
<B>(1625 ) </B>
<P>
	As has been mentioned, any time that governments consider 
raising the taxes on the so-called sins, alcohol and tobacco, the 
sin taxes, it is always debated in this House and in fact right 
across the provinces in the legislatures. Often times I am sure 
the debate would go along the lines that we can certainly raise 
these taxes because people should have to pay for their sins and 
not only is it a good revenue builder but it is a deterrent for 
people to actually partake in the so-called sins of alcohol and 
tobacco.
<P>
	We are doing two things by raising taxes on the so-called sins. 
That has always been the argument as well as the fact that we 
feel if you utilize tobacco and alcohol then the chances are you 
will need the health care system more than the average person, 
and so you should be paying your fair share in order to maintain 
the health care system.
<P>
	That this bill increases the age limit for the legal purchase of 
cigarettes it is commendable. At the same time the government 
is making the product more affordable to those people who do 
desire to smoke.
<P>
	Now that we are making it easier, or at least more affordable, 
to buy cigarettes are we in fact going against the argument that 
smokers should be paying a higher price for a health care system 
that would probably see more usage because of their habit? We 
are talking about a health care system that seems already to be 
overburdened.
<P>
	In my opinion there has been a very clear precedent set here. 
How does this government plan to answer the question that my 
colleague has raised as far as the Canadian distillers' request is 
concerned, as far as lowering the taxation? According to my 
figures, the taxation on a bottle of spirits is in the 87 per cent 
range. That means that out of the 13 per cent that is left the 
manufacturer must produce, bottle, advertise, label, ship and 
pay all its personnel costs and take its profit.
<P>
	What that also does is encourages a new generation of rum 
runners. It is a kind of revisitation of the 1920s. Certainly there 
is money to be made in the bootlegging of illegal alcohol.
<P>
	Is this a problem in Canada today? I certainly believe it is. 
According to statistics that I think all members of this House 
received we estimate 17 million cases of spirits sold in this 
country per year. Of those, 4 million cases of 12 bottles each are 
illegally smuggled into Canada.
<P>
	How do we arrive at the 4 million cases? It is through 
communication with the provincial liquor boards, the 
comparison of per capita sales in the United States, and 
discussion with Revenue Canada Customs and law enforcement 
agencies. Those figures are pretty reliable.
<P>
	When we have a problem like this the solution, in my opinion, 
is not a really simple one. A step in the right direction is a get 
tough attitude with the smugglers. I think we also have to really 
increase the profile of enforcement. We not only have to make 
enforcement more effective, it has to appear to be more 
effective. We also have to increase the penalties on smuggling. I 
equate it with upping the ante, particularly when it comes to 
smuggling cigarettes and alcohol for the purpose of trafficking.
<P>
	I think we could also add into that the smuggling of guns. 
Perhaps that is a subject for another day, and I hope to get an 
opportunity to speak on that at a later date.
<P>
	Another thing that is ultimately important and that this bill 
does address is that we ought to be educating the public about 
the potential health hazards of tobacco. If we agree with the 
government's policy on reducing taxes and it actually reduces 
the incentive to smuggle then we have to apply it to the alcohol 
smuggling problem as well.
<P>
<B></B>

<B><A NAME="3250"> 3250 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1630) </B>
<P>
	In conclusion, I believe that Bill C-11 has merit. In my 
opinion it would have been a better bill if it had the budget 
implications included in it. We are not sure just how many 
hundreds of millions of dollars the Canadian government has 
foregone in this instance and what the total cost of the program 
is.
<P>
	I find myself leaning toward supporting this bill but I would 
have been much happier to see the financial implications.

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should enter into an 
agreement with the province of Ontario to expand Ontario highway 16 south 
from Ottawa to highway 401 at Johnstown, into a four lane highway in order to 
ensure road safety and enhance travel in and out of the nation's capital.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak to this 
motion. I have been trying to move it along this far and get it 
discussed at this level ever since I have been in the House of 
Commons. I feel I have made one small gain on this.
<P>
	I want to give a short history and geography lesson for the 
people across Canada who may need some familiarizing with the 
location of this highway and hopefully elaborate sufficiently so 
that people will see that it does have a national interest.
<P>
	Highway 401 is the main east-west highway through south 
central Canada. If you have ever travelled through Ontario by 
motor car you have probably been on the 401. That is the main 
thoroughfare.
<P>
	The 401 passes about 80 kilometres south of metropolitan 
Ottawa, Ottawa-Hull. It is about 100 kilometres from where we 
are right now to highway 401, the main busy thoroughfare that 
passes through southern Ontario. The link to get to that highway, 
however, is highway 16. My hope would be to some day see it a 
four lane highway, a north-south link between this part of 
Canada and the 401 and the northern United States.
<P>
<B>(1635) </B>
<P>
	My riding is not very far away. It has two bridges coming in 
from northern New York. I would like to think that some of the 
people would be interested in the nation's capital. However 
when they look at a two lane road, having been accustomed to 
four lane roads, they would be more inclined to stay on the four 
lane highway and move out of this area either to Toronto or 
Montreal.
<P>
	I want to make it clear that the northern stretch of this 
highway, about 15 to 20 kilometres, is being constructed at this 
time into a four lane highway but the remaining 60 kilometres 
will be still only a two lane highway. There was pressure for the 
highway to be built to four lanes about 15 years ago and the 
layout is there for four lanes.
<P>
	They have expropriated almost all the land that would have to 
be expropriated. They have bypassed the towns and the villages. 
Very often those are points of great dispute when one is 
bypassing a community. That has all been done. The right of way 
is there for four lanes. It just needs the political will to move on 
with it.
<P>
	The only way you can get from the nation's largest centre, 
Toronto, to the nation's capital by a four lane highway is to go to 
Montreal. Then you can come back to Ottawa on a four lane 
highway. That lack of access to the nation's capital should be of 
national interest because of the ever increasing traffic flow on 
the existing road into the capital from the south. First and 
foremost is the safety aspect.
<P>
	In the seven year period from 1985 to 1992, there were 39 
deaths on that highway. There were 721 reported accidents and 
probably minor accidents that were not reported. Ninety per cent 
of the accidents occurred in the southern portion of the highway, 
in other words, the part that is not being constructed into four 
lanes, the part where there is no plan currently to improve the 
highway.
<P>
	The federal government has some responsibility because it is 
the road into the nation's capital. That is why I presented this 
motion. There is nothing novel about spending federal funds to 
construct highways. Indeed, we announced a great 
infrastructure plan not too long ago. A lot of federal government 
money has been spent on highways.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3251"> 3251 </A></B>
<P>
	I have a list here starting back in March 1993 during the 
previous government, I will admit, of federal funds going into 
the highways in Alberta, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and New 
Brunswick. There were no funds for Ontario. No arrangement 
was made for federal government funds to be spent on highways 
in Ontario. That is what I am asking for now. I am asking 
members to support the idea of a four lane highway into the 
nation's capital.
<P>
	I could support this motion with further documents if it were 
appropriate. I could table those with maps and so on. I have 
statistics showing the great increase in traffic flow that has 
occurred on that part of the highway since the first part was 
completed many years ago.
<P>
	We hear a lot about the information highway these days and I 
am sure it is very important to Canada. We hear a lot in eastern 
Ontario about Pearson airport. It is the busiest-the best some 
would say-and the largest in Canada. Its needs are very 
important and they have to be addressed. I am sure they will be 
addressed.
<P>
	We have not heard very much about access into the nation's 
capital by means of a four lane highway. A better access road 
linking the capital area with highway 401 would make the whole 
Ottawa area more accessible to all Canadians who travel by 
road. Just as important, as a citizen of eastern Ontario, it would 
make more accessible our biggest and best trading partner, the 
United States. It is less than 100 kilometres away but you cannot 
get to the United States on a four lane road from the nation's 
capital.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	The infrastructure program was announced with great 
enthusiastic support from all provinces. It was to create 
employment, give jobs to unemployed Canadians and stimulate 
the economy of the nation.
<P>
	It is estimated that the completion of the highway from 401 to 
the nation's capital would create over 12,000 person years of 
direct employment. It would create an awful lot of jobs for a few 
years while it is in the construction stage.
<P>
	The infrastructure program is to get our country and our 
communities ready for the time when the nation's economy is 
moving ahead and a good deal of what constitutes a moving 
economy I think in the minds of most Canadians moves by 
highway traffic.
<P>
	As far as I know the current provincial government in Ontario 
has never even considered completing the access road from the 
nation's capital to 401 except in the north end. Mr. Speaker, if 
you examine the political map of Ontario you will understand 
why that part is being done. The current Ontario government has 
one MPP from this part of eastern Ontario and she is from 
Ottawa. The highway is being built to four lane standards in this 
part of Ontario but as far as I can tell no plan has been made to 
extend it. The only part of the highway that is being done is 
adjacent to Ottawa and it is for a political reason.
<P>
	I know that the usual partnership arrangement with the three 
levels of government does not quite fit the infrastructure plan. 
The cost of one-third of the highway would be far too great for 
the small rural townships. Small rural townships in Ontario have 
never had to build major highways. They just do not have the tax 
base to do it.
<P>
	When I asked people to show an interest in my motion, a lot of 
people from outside the Ottawa area were interested in speaking 
to it. This suggests to me that fixing this highway has a broader 
appeal than just to selfish people like myself who live in eastern 
Ontario. It does have a national flavour to it.
<P>
	Also with reference to the infrastructure program, the time 
line would be far too restrictive. It could not be completed by 
1997. I cannot imagine it being done that quickly. However that 
is a minor thing. Apart from those variances the main criteria of 
the infrastructure program would be met and far exceeded in 
building highway 416; the creation of jobs-I have given the 
statistics on that one-and accessing eastern Ontario to markets 
both domestically and internationally.
<P>
	The priorities of the current provincial government have to be 
changed and that is the reason for my private member's motion. 
I think perhaps one-third federal funds; I am not suggesting the 
provincial government exceed the plan for more infrastructure 
funds. I am suggesting it arrange its priorities differently, 
one-third federal funds, two-thirds provincial funds. I am sure 
that would make a satisfactory arrangement and there would not 
be any more money spent. It would just be redirecting the 
money.
<P>
	The plans for the project have been in place for years. What 
we need now is the political will in the province to move on with 
this.
<P>
	Before its defeat three years ago, the previous Liberal 
government of Ontario had announced a plan. It said it would 
complete the project by 1999. I was there for the press 
announcement. The media were there and they said it was a long 
way into the future, 1999. I will tell you it would look pretty 
good to eastern Ontario right now if somebody said the highway 
would be completed by 1999. That date would look extremely 
good because it might still be possible, but do not hold your 
breath.
<P>
	Let me make it clear again, it is a rearranging of priorities that 
I am asking for in the infrastructure program, with the federal 
government's involvement being one-third. I am asking the 
provincial government to be a little flexible, rearrange its 
priorities and spend two-thirds on this much needed project. I 
know how important and how very much needed the 
infrastructure programs are to all communities, but we have 
infrastructure 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3252"> 3252 </A></B>
<P>
needs beyond those local levels. I think this one warrants being 
addressed as almost an emergency need.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	If the government of the province of Ontario misses this 
opportunity by not putting highway 416 on its priority list, we 
who live here and are interested in the economic development of 
eastern Ontario will have to wait once again to see even the start 
of a project which is already 20 years overdue. It has been 20 
years since the original plan was set and nothing has been acted 
upon since.
<P>
	I am asking in my motion for the two levels of government, 
the federal level and the provincial level, to get together to make 
the infrastructure program fit the needs of eastern Ontario and 
the capital region, the capital region of Canada being the fourth 
largest metropolitan area in Canada, by constructing a four-lane 
highway in order to ensure road safety and enhance travel in and 
out of the nation's capital. I am sorry it is not a votable motion, 
but I have sensed a great deal of support for it.
<P>

<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mrs. Maheu):</B> Pursuant to Standing 
Order 38, it is my duty to inform the House that the questions to 
be raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Mercier-Manpower Training; the hon. 
member for Bourassa-Immigration; the hon. member for 
Lévis-National Defence; the hon. member for 
Drummond-Tainted Blood Inquiry; the hon. member for 
Jonquière-Native Communities.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dick Harris (Prince George-Bulkley Valley):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I rise in the House today to speak to the motion. On its 
surface I cannot find the normal things wrong with it.
<P>
	The member for Leeds-Grenville clearly stated that he was 
not requesting additional federal government funds, which I 
appreciate. Certainly this side of the House looks for that in 
every motion. He talked about the safety concerns on the 
roadway. I appreciate the statistics that he presented in his 
background material have borne out the cause of concern.
<P>
	I am not going to take too long on this motion. If I have any 
concerns it would be whether changing the rules of the 
infrastructure program as laid out in the famous red book would 
set any kind of precedent we might regret later on down the line. 
The infrastructure program clearly calls for a sharing of 
one-third federal government, one-third municipal and 
one-third provincial.
<P>
	If we are to spend this credit card infrastructure program 
money anyway, I am wondering whether changing the rules to 
accommodate a need in the member's riding will set a precedent 
in the future throughout the life of the infrastructure program 
that we may have to address later. If we make an exception for 
one, we may find ourselves having to make exceptions for  
others. Even though this particular one might have justifiable 
merit in the minds of many, will the others who seek exceptions 
to the general rules of the infrastructure program have merit? 
Could they cause us any harm?
<P>
	The member has stated that he would like to see the provincial 
government pick up two-thirds of the cost. I have seen the 
reports on the financial position of the provincial government. I 
am wondering whether that is at all possible with the state of the 
finances of the province of Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	Clearly the premier of Ontario has stated on a number of 
occasions that they simply do not have enough money to go 
around. On one project, highway 407 I believe it is, they have 
sought financing from the private sector to help complete it. I 
am wondering whether it might be an idea for them to do that in 
this case.
<P>
	Does the provincial government have $300 and some million 
to invest in the project even if the rules were changed? My main 
concern is whether we are setting a precedent both on making 
the exception from the municipal contribution and on the 
extension of the time limit of the infrastructure program 
application to be completed. I am wondering whether the 
precedent may cause us a problem down the road on other 
applications.
<P>
	We are not being asked to spend any more federal money, any 
more federal funds than have already been allocated, the 
one-third sharing. Apart from those two points I do not have any 
opposition to the motion. Perhaps the member might be able to 
explain the two points.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Mercier (Blainville-Deux-Montagnes):</B> Madam 
Speaker, as my hon. colleague just noted, the motion calls on the 
federal government to enter into an agreement with Ontario to 
widen Highway 16 between Highway 401 and Ottawa.
<P>
	At present, Highway 16 links Ottawa to Highway 401, passing 
through the Brockville area. The stretch of highway in question 
is approximately 65 kilometres long. Traffic along this stretch 
of roadway is heavy, but not excessively so. I have been told that 
on average, between 15,000 and 30,000 vehicles travel this 
highway every day.
<P>
	The road is relatively straight and the danger lies in the fact 
that drivers frequently pull out to pass other vehicles.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3253"> 3253 </A></B>
<P>
	The posted speed limit on this highway varies between 50 and 
90 kilometres per hour. However, most traffic travels at a speed 
of 90 kilometres per hour. Improved highway control would no 
doubt enhance safety.
<P>
	I have also been told that the Government of Ontario is 
considering a project to expand this highway and that roughly 
$15 million has already been spent on a study of the proposed 
new route. It would seem, therefore, that Ontario has already 
given considerable thought to this project. As my hon. colleague 
noted, the timetable for completion would be rather long, 
perhaps as much as 20 years.
<P>
	Highway 16 runs through a portion of the riding of 
Leeds-Grenville, which obviously explains my hon. 
colleague's interest in the project. As he indicated, as far as the 
northern stretch of the highway is concerned, costs would be 
divided into two stages.
<P>
	According to the Ontario Ministry of Transport, construction 
costs would total $200 million, while the price tag for the 
remainder of the four-lane highway would be $180 million.
<P>
	I gather the federal government's assistance is being 
requested because there is no four-lane highway linking the 
Nation's Capital to the capital city of the largest province in 
Canada. A four-lane highway would cut 30 minutes off the 
travel time. However, Madam Speaker, if we go along with this 
reasoning, then the federal government should be entering into a 
similar agreement with Quebec to expand Highway 50 into a 
four-lane highway linking Ottawa to another provincial capital, 
namely Quebec City. A four-lane highway would knock not 30 
minutes, but 45 minutes off a five-hour trip. Ottawa would then 
be only four hours or so away from either Toronto or Quebec 
City.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	If the motion carries, I would also call upon the federal 
government to stop dragging its heels on participating in the 
extension of Highway 13 so that Mirabel and Dorval airports can 
finally be linked.
<P>
	All things considered, I question why Canadian taxpayers 
should have to pay for building four-lane highways in Ontario. 
Ontario should use the money from the infrastructure program if 
it wants federal funds to complete this project. My hon. 
colleague explained that he was not seeking additional funds, 
although this is not clear from his motion. I ask that the general 
rules of the infrastructure program be applied without exception 
and that no precedents which could be invoked later by other 
ridings be set.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. John O'Reilly (Victoria-Haliburton):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I thank the House for the opportunity to speak on 
Motion M-3 in the name of the member for Leeds-Grenville.
<P>
	The highway 16 connection of Ottawa to highway 401 has 
more to offer than just a few minutes off the drive. Making a 
two-lane highway into a four-lane highway would allow for a 
much safer route. There is only one nation's capital to deal with 
and the access is poor unless one lives in Montreal.
<P>
	Highway 7 on which I travel from Ottawa to the Tweed turnoff 
is a very popular route for large trucks to and from Toronto and 
Ottawa. That section of highway 7 is extremely overburdened 
because of the poor access from Ottawa to highway 401. This 
stretch of highway 7 is the most dangerous piece of two-way 
highway in Ontario. A better, safer route to our nation's capital 
is what we are asking for.
<P>
	My trip to the House includes highway 7 usually four times a 
week to and from my riding of Victoria-Haliburton which is 
four hours from Ottawa by car, the only way I have to get here. 
School buses, transport trucks, camper vans, motor homes, 
motorcycles, cars pulling trailers, walkers and bicyclists all use 
that stretch of highway 7 from Tweed to Ottawa. Completion of 
highway 16 would ensure less risk to the people on highway 7 
from Ottawa to the 401.
<P>
	Highway 37 is very busy. It runs from highway 7, down 
through the village of Tweed, to the top of Belleville to connect 
with the 401. We could ask Elmer Buchanan, the MPP for 
Hastings, about his unfortunate accident this past winter on 
highway 37 from which he is still recovering. I am sure the 
Ontario government would take that into consideration.
<P>
	My thrust is not immediate on highway 16. My thrust is on 
relieving the burden of the entrance to our nation's capital along 
highway 7. In conclusion I urge all members to support the bill.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Beryl Gaffney (Nepean):</B> Madam Speaker, this issue 
has been before the people of the nation's capital for a great 
number of years. The hon. member for Victoria-Haliburton, 
my colleague who just spoke on the issue, adequately explained 
or visually explained the problems people have in trying to get 
to the nation's capital. Whether they are coming to Ottawa on 
the present highway 16 or whether they are coming on Highway 
7, both roads are very dangerous.
<P>
	In 1988 we were talking about the free trade agreement in the 
House. It was the first bill I had to vote on having been elected in 
1988. Madam Speaker, you will remember you were newly 
elected at the same time. We sat in the House right up to 
December 23.
<P>
<B>(1700 ) </B>
<P>
	One issue I raised in my maiden speech in the House of 
Commons was with regard to the free trade agreement and 
particularly highway 416. I raised the importance to the nation's 
capital of having that four-lane link prepared and the effect it 
would have on the economy. It is the only four-lane link that 
would connect us to Toronto. It would be the only four-lane link 
that we had to connect us to New York State. Presently we have a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3254"> 3254 </A></B>
<P>
two-lane  highway connecting us to both Toronto and New York 
State.
<P>
	I refer to the comments of the member from the Bloc 
Quebecois who spoke earlier on why should we give it to 
Ontario when we should give the same thing to Quebec. I would 
like to correct the gentleman and advise him that federal moneys 
have gone into roadworks in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	We already have a four-lane link between the nation's capital 
to Montreal and right through to Quebec City. If my memory 
serves me correctly it goes right through to Rivière du Loup and 
the Gaspé peninsula. I have travelled that route on many 
occasions. Therefore the precedent has already been set.
<P>
	I am looking at transportation infrastructure agreements. In 
1993 the federal government put in a $10 million project in 
roadwork infrastructure in the Northwest Territories. In B.C. it 
put in $30 million; Saskatchewan, $35 million; Nova Scotia, 
$30 million; New Brunswick, $130 million. I could go on and on 
but there was not one penny that went into the province of 
Ontario.
<P>
	The province of Ontario has long been recognized as the 
engine of growth in this country. We who live in Ontario are very 
proud of that. We are very proud to help the provinces that do not 
have the financial resources we have had historically up until 
this point in time, to sustain not only ourselves in this province 
but also the people in the other provinces. We have been pleased 
to do that.
<P>
	However the province of Ontario today is going through very 
tough economic times. We no longer have the manufacturing 
base we had before. We have lost hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
Whether it is the result of the free trade agreement I think the 
jury is still out on that. We need to do things that are going to 
increase economic growth. We need to do this not only in all of 
Ontario but we need to do it specifically here in the nation's 
capital.
<P>
	Why should we put federal money into a roadway coming into 
the nation's capital? For goodness sakes, it is the nation's 
capital. The eyes of the country are on this capital city. We talk 
about our Canadian dollar and how it flips up and down. Is it any 
wonder it flips up and down when we cannot even put a 
four-lane highway into the nation's capital? It is absolutely 
disgraceful.
<P>
	The argument of the gentleman from the Bloc Quebecois does 
not wash with me and it does not wash with the majority of 
Canadians.
<P>
	The improvements to this highway are long overdue when one 
considers the increase in traffic over the 25 years plus that I 
certainly have been a resident of the Ottawa-Carleton region. 
We have seen the traffic patterns increase. As a result of this 
heavy traffic we see the accidents have increased in this area.
<P>
	There is the commercial business, the recreation business, the 
tourist traffic. This morning my colleague from 
Leeds-Grenville and I were at a meeting. We met with the 
tourism industry from eastern Ontario. What is happening to the 
tourism industry? What is happening to the tourism industry in 
the nation's capital? Do members know how many dollars from 
the tourism industry support governments, support the federal 
government, support the provincial government?
<P>
	It is very shortsighted on our part not to recognize the 
economic importance we as a nation as a whole would realize 
from such a structure being expanded. The construction of 
highway 416 to a four-lane highway is precisely the kind of 
infrastructure we as the government are talking about. It is 
something that is needed in the province of Ontario.
<P>
	It would provide jobs and would improve jobs, which would 
contribute to the productivity and competitiveness of area 
employers. The four-lane link is vital to the continued growth of 
eastern Ontario.
<P>
	I cannot be dramatic enough in speaking to my colleague's 
motion. Our future in eastern Ontario depends upon it.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	Even setting that aside, set aside eastern Ontario and think of 
the nation's capital. You people from Quebec, think of your 
capital city, Quebec City. How many times in the province of 
Quebec have you heard Quebecers say: ``Oh, Quebec City gets 
everything. We don't get anything in Montreal. We don't get 
anything in Hull''. At that point in time you have a federal 
government which has been especially kind to you, which has 
helped with bridges, which has helped with roads and which has 
helped with the infrastructure in the province of Quebec.
<P>
	I say the same thing to Toronto, to Queen's Park. Look at all of 
the beautiful roads in Toronto. I do not want to crap all over Bob 
Rae and what he is doing. My colleagues would like me to, but 
for goodness sake, Queen's Park is not any different from 
Quebec City where they think of their own and they want to 
make sure that the capital of their province is well looked after.
<P>
	Would you not agree with me that Quebec City is probably 
better looked after in terms of infrastructure as compared to 
Montreal? Would you not agree with me on that? Or Ottawa?
<P>
	This is the seat of our Canadian Parliament. It is the seat of all 
our national institutions. Our museums, our arts centres, our 
galleries, everything that is national in scope is here in this 
region. Maybe we should do as Washington does. Maybe we 
should make this little precinct around the nation's capital, on 
both sides of the river. Make this a separate little province or a 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3255"> 3255 </A></B>
<P>
regional area or territory that could receive these special dollars 
to ensure it is an area we can be proud of.
<P>
	People come here from all over the world. My God, heaven 
forbid if they are driving from Toronto and they have to come in 
on the two-lane highway. They cannot believe they are on the 
road to the nation's capital.
<P>
	I believe my time is almost up. I have gone on in trying to 
impress upon this House the importance of this issue to me, to 
the nation and to the capital. All of us in this House should be 
very concerned. I hope all members will support my colleague 
from Leeds-Grenville on this issue.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pat O'Brien (London-Middlesex):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to have the opportunity today to second and to speak 
to this motion which calls for the government to enter into an 
agreement with the province of Ontario to expand highway 16 
into a four-lane highway.
<P>
	This motion placed by my esteemed colleague from 
Leeds-Grenville is meant to help increase road safety and to 
improve travel in and out of the nation's capital.
<P>
	Unfortunately this motion has been prompted by a series of 
tragic accidents, including the death of one young woman from 
the member's own riding. I compliment him on his attempt to 
alleviate any future tragedies that may occur on this 40 
kilometre stretch of highway which connects Ottawa to the 401.
<P>
	I too would like to encourage both the federal government and 
the province of Ontario to consider committing funds for the 
national infrastructure program to improve and expand highway 
16. Money spent on such highway projects is money well spent 
and therefore I am pleased to support and to second this motion.
<P>
	Many would think that such a motion does not directly affect 
my riding of London-Middlesex. However numerous students 
from London-Middlesex have left their homes to attend 
university in the Ottawa area. Many of these people drive home 
to visit their families for holidays via the 401. Obviously 
Londoners are among many thousands of Canadians who yearly 
come to the nation's capital to see the Parliament Buildings and 
the other beautiful sites of this city.
<P>
	When taking highway 16 to the 401 people are faced with a 
busy exit out of Ottawa as they begin their six to seven hour 
drive home in good weather. On a return trip after this drive they 
are faced with driving on a busy highway that is used by all kinds 
of vehicles from tractor trailers, to vans, to mobile homes and 
motorcycles. By this time it is usually dark, which only adds to 
the dangers.
<P>
	If you are like me, Madam Speaker, you worry about the 
safety of your children on the road. For many parents in my 
riding that last stretch of highway 16 is extremely nerve racking. 
Even the most experienced drivers are faced with the 
unnecessary risks of this particular road.
<P>
	Tourists also use this road when visiting the nation's capital. 
Since 1985 over 700 accidents have occurred. Canadians from 
every province and territory use this road. The roadways to and 
from our nation's capital should be a source of pride to 
Canadians and not a constant worry.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	This motion was put forward by my colleague primarily for 
safety reasons. I live in a region that is served by a major 
highway, the 401, as my colleague mentioned earlier. We have 
all seen far too many people lose their lives on that dangerous 
highway as well. As traffic has increased over the past decade so 
too have terrible accidents. For this reason alone both the 
federal and provincial governments would be wise to seriously 
consider this motion.
<P>
	As a member of this government I am proud we have made a 
strong commitment to the funding of Canada's transportation 
infrastructure. Safety is and should be the primary reason for the 
expansion of highway 16, yet there is another vital reason for 
completing this important project: economics.
<P>
	Several of the members from the national capital region have 
said in this House over the past several years that expanding 
companies in the region such as the high tech industries are 
faced with insurmountable transit problems when dealing with 
markets beyond the region. I hear the very same concerns 
expressed by businesses in my own riding of 
London-Middlesex.
<P>
	This is truly a national issue. Improving the roadways in 
southwestern Ontario and across our country is very important 
to people in all parts of Canada. Time and time again 
constituents tell me of the need for better links with other 
regions so that small business and other vital sectors are able to 
benefit from access to other markets.
<P>
	Good road systems open up new markets for existing small 
and medium sized businesses, which in turn creates jobs for 
people in all parts of Canada. In my riding, industry is steadily 
expanding. Commercial markets are facing increased 
challenges in dealing with markets beyond our region.
<P>
	In speaking to this motion every one of us could easily draw a 
parallel to our own particular ridings. As my colleague from 
London East well knows, a number of surveys have shown time 
and again that transportation problems are at the top of the list of 
concerns of the people of the city of London. National surveys 
indicate the very same concern.
<P>
	It would be extremely shortsighted and parochial of anyone in 
this House not to look at this motion with a view to supporting it. 
Surely it is a national issue when it concerns the nation's capital. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3256"> 3256 </A></B>
<P>
It is a great pleasure for me to support the motion and I ask all 
members in the House to do the same.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Madam Speaker, I too am 
pleased to congratulate my colleague from Leeds-Grenville 
and to speak in support of his motion.
<P>
	I do not know if the infrastructure program is the best or only 
way to fund the improvements to highway 416 which have been 
needed for so long. However I do know that I recently saw a list 
of announcements for funding of major transportation projects. 
There was not one for eastern Ontario.
<P>
	There was funding for the Go transit system in Toronto. 
Supposedly it was a railway project but really it is an urban 
transit development that is of assistance to the local community 
in the metro Toronto region. In this region of eastern Ontario and 
the nation's capital, we have not had that kind of co-operative 
approach to meeting our transportation needs.
<P>
	I do not think I need to tell anybody in this House that 
government is undergoing a major transformation. That has 
meant the economy of this region, our nation's capital, is 
undergoing a major transformation.
<P>
	It is a challenge to our regional economy which started back in 
the mid-seventies with the decentralization of a number of 
government operations and the removal of 15,000 jobs from the 
downtown area to across the river to Hull. Personally, that is 
something I support because I support the idea of an integrated 
national capital covering both sides of our river.
<P>
	I also support very much the idea of getting services to 
Canadians out in the communities and getting a federal presence 
across this country from coast to coast to coast. Anything that 
builds national unity is important to all of us in this House and to 
all Canadians.
<P>
	Our community was presented with a major challenge back 
then, nearly two decades ago now. We were suddenly left with 
close to one million square feet of empty office space in 
downtown Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	The local business community working together with our 
board of trade, our Economic Development Corporation, our 
businesses individually, building owners and managers, rose to 
that challenge and addressed the issue of diversifying our 
economy.
<P>
	We are now facing another major change in our major 
employer. I do not think it is a surprise to anybody in this House 
that we are looking at a major rethink of what the role of 
government is, how much service to the public we can afford, 
what has to be done by government and what should be done in 
other ways, what is the proper role of the federal government 
and the provincial governments.
<P>
	Again, for my community in this region of eastern Ontario 
that is going to mean another major change to our economy. The 
work that our business community in co-operation with our 
public and municipal politicians particularly and the federal and 
provincial politicians over the years has done to diversify our 
economic base is a foundation on which we can face further 
changes.
<P>
	If the federal government as the major employer in this region 
is going to have a significant impact on the community like 
other major employers in other regions then there is also an 
obligation to work in partnership with the community to help the 
adjustment. We are doing that with National Defence, for 
instance. Where we are closing bases across Canada we are 
setting up processes to work with the local communities to 
readjust their economies.
<P>
	We need to look as well at how we co-operate with the 
community in the nation's capital toward supporting that 
community's efforts to diversify its economy.
<P>
	Transportation is key to that. We cannot have a healthy 
economy if we cannot get our goods to market, if we cannot get 
to our customers and if we cannot get our customers here.
<P>
	We have had a long battle about adequate air transportation 
out of Ottawa, links to our markets and to the United States and 
so on. However, road transportation is also important.
<P>
	We have heard described the situation of highway 16 as a 
funny little dumb-bell that has a magnificent expanse wonderful 
interchange with the Queensway through this region on one end 
and then it sort of dwindles off into a windy, curvey little road 
that, as people have said, is dangerous.
<P>
	Most important, it is of tremendous cost to people who want 
to do business with this region, who want to do business out of 
this region. It is a major inhibitor to the development of our high 
technology sector which is one of the strongest in the country. 
That is an issue not only for this region but for the nation.
<P>
	This is one of the hubs of the future of high technology in 
Canada and without that critical mass in locations like the 
nation's capital, like my city of Ottawa, like the member for 
Nepean's community of Nepean and throughout this region, 
high technology in the nation is not going to flourish. We happen 
to have built the beginning of that critical mass here. It is in the 
national interest for that to flourish. Again, the transportation 
link is important.
<P>
	Others have spoken very eloquently of the importance of 
tourism, our second biggest industry in this region. You cannot 
visit it if you cannot drive to it or if you cannot get to it. I believe 
that we have a responsibility to build a sense across this nation 
that our capital is something that all Canadians should be proud 
of. We seem to have done just the opposite of what most nations 
have done and developed our nation's capital as a place to be 
avoided, shunned and criticized.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3257"> 3257 </A></B>
<P>
	I think part of building a nation is building pride in your 
nation's capital and part of that is the sense that many people in 
other countries have that one thing you want to do as a citizen 
during the course of your life is visit the heart of your nation, 
your nation's capital.
<P>
<B>(1720 ) </B>
<P>
	We do not have that sense as Canadians. I am not going to 
blame it on the poor condition of highway 16 from the American 
border and from the great metropolis of Toronto to the nation's 
capital. If we do want to build that sense of pride in the nation, 
pride in our fellow citizens, pride in our nation's capital, then we 
have to make it possible for people to get here.
<P>
	Let me conclude by saying that this project for a long time has 
had the full support of our business community, the 
Ottawa-Carleton Board of Trade, our Economic Development 
Corporation, all municipalities in this region. It is just another 
link not only for Ottawa, not only for the communities 
surrounding Ottawa, but also from our neighbours in Quebec to 
southern Ontario and beyond.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, the federal government is an 
important employer in this region. It accounts for about 20 per 
cent of the jobs in our region. A fairly good job has been done of 
spreading about 70 per cent of the public service jobs across this 
country and I as a Canadian am proud of that.
<P>
	Nonetheless, the public is still an important employer and I 
believe there is an obligation for our government as it is making 
changes in the local economy to consider all its decisions that 
impact on us and to work with us as it does with other 
communities across Canada in a period of economic adjustment. 
Transportation, a good road link into the capital, is important to 
do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gurbax Singh Malhi (Bramalea-Gore-Malton):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am rising in the House today to support a 
motion proposed by my hon. colleague from Leeds-Grenville.
<P>
	Motion M-3 moves that, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should enter into an agreement with the province of 
Ontario to expand Ontario highway 16 south from Ottawa to 
highway 401 at Johnstown into a four lane highway in order to 
ensure road safety and enhance travel in and out of the nation's 
capital.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament from the greater Toronto area I 
feel that it is in the best interests of my constituents that I rise to 
support this motion today. Countless travellers from my 
constituency of Bramalea-Gore-Malton and other areas 
around Toronto visit Ottawa on a regular basis. Naturally they 
take highway 401.
<P>
	On highway 401 they can travel in relative safety at their own 
pace. Passing lanes provide the option of travelling at different 
speeds. Motorists are not subject to the distraction of someone 
riding their bumper, nor do they feel the frustration of driving 
behind someone whose car is incapable of keeping up with the 
flow of traffic.
<P>
	The multi-lane design of highway 401 ensures a relaxed 
frame of mind which seems to me is conducive to driving.
<P>
	All of this is lost, however, when they turn on to highway 16 to 
get to Ottawa; gone are the passing lanes, gone is the option of 
travelling at their own pace, gone is the relaxed atmosphere in 
which to drive.
<P>
	Numerous accidents occur on highway 16 every weekend. 
Frustrated drivers take risks they normally would not have to 
take. In the period from 1985 to 1992, 39 deaths have occurred 
on the road as well as 721 reported accidents with countless 
injuries.
<P>
	This is the main route for motorists travelling to Ottawa from 
western Ontario. Thousands of tourists come from across 
Ontario every year to see this beautiful city and its wonderful 
sites, Parliament Hill included.
<P>
	An overcrowded, single lane highway does not give a 
favourable first impression of the city. This is clearly a well 
travelled route. We owe it to all visitors to provide them with a 
safe and sensible route to their nation's capital.
<P>
	There has been support of this expansion since the road was 
built almost 15 years ago. Now it is time to act.
<P>
	As most of my honourable colleagues know, the federal 
government in co-operation with provincial and municipal 
governments has recently launched the two-year, $6 billion 
Canada infrastructure works program. The program reaffirms 
our commitment to get Canadians back to work by creating 
50,000 to 65,000 direct jobs and represents a significant long 
term investment in Canada's economic competitiveness.  It also 
represents an important step forward in intergovernmental 
co-operation for the benefit of Canadians. Ontario has 
committed $722 million to date toward the project.
<P>
<B>(1725) </B>
<P>
	Good infrastructure is vital to a good quality of life. It helps 
keep our environment clean and makes our cities liveable. Good 
roads and transportation services reduce costs, reduce expensive 
tie-ups and minimize wear and tear on vehicles. Cities that work 
are central to the health of the economy.
<P>
	At present the only way many of our industries can transport 
their products into and out of the nation's capital using a four 
lane highway is to go to Montreal first. This option is clearly 
ridiculous. One of our government's goals is to make it easier 
for small and medium sized businesses to succeed. As most 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3258"> 3258 </A></B>
<P>
small and medium sized business do not have access to air  
transport, roadways are their greatest allies. Let us give them a 
hand.
<P>
	To summarize, I support the motion initiated by the member 
for Leeds-Grenville: ``That, in the opinion of this House, the 
government should enter into an agreement with the province of 
Ontario to expand Ontario highway 16, south from Ottawa to 
highway 401 at Johnstown, into a four lane highway in order to 
ensure road safety and enhance travel in and out of the nation's 
capital''.
<P>
	This is the main thoroughfare for many visitors to Ottawa. 
During a seven year period, from 1985 to 1992, 721 accidents 
have occurred on this stretch of road, causing 39 deaths and 
countless injuries. Highway 16 is also an important economic 
lifeline for Ottawa. In a time when the government is committed 
to rebuilding and reinforcing this nation's infrastructure, 
highway 16 must not be overlooked.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> There being no further members rising for 
debate and the motion not being designated as a votable item, 
the time provided for the consideration of Private Members' 
Business has now expired and the order is dropped from the 
Order Paper, pursuant to Standing Order 96(1).

Quebec and English the predominant language of the other provinces, and that 
federal government services should be available to official language minorities 
in their own language in any part of the country where there is demonstrable local 
public demand;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) continue to facilitate the use of English or French in the debates and other 
proceedings of Parliament, in the records and journals of Parliament, in federal 
courts, and as the languages of federal legislation; and</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">ADJOURNMENT PROCEEDINGS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	A motion to adjourn the House under Standing Order 38 
deemed to have been moved.
<P>
<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="MANPOWERTRAINING">MANPOWER TRAINING</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Madam Speaker, on 
April 14, I put a question to the Prime Minister and reminded 
him that the Premier of Quebec said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Job training is, according to Quebec's traditional position, a basic issue of 
respect for our jurisdiction over what affects us directly.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And I asked him:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Given these statements...does the Prime Minister still think that Quebec's 
demands are mere whims?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Madam Speaker, the Quebec National Assembly voted 
unanimously in favour of the following resolution:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That the Quebec National Assembly ask Mr. Jean Chrétien and the federal 
Liberal government to abide by the unanimous consensus of all parties in 
Quebec on the need for Quebec to exercise exclusively its jurisdiction over 
manpower training.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Madam Speaker, considering the current situation, this 
unanimous resolution demonstrates the very serious concern of 
all Quebec's elected representatives for the manpower training 
issue.
<P>
	There is more, however. Since then, we have heard statements 
from other important sources in Quebec. This morning I read in 
the Quebec media that the Forum pour l'emploi is opposed to 
Ottawa's centralist policies. Who does the Forum pour l'emploi 
represent? The Forum includes central labour organizations, as 
one would expect, but it also includes Quebec employer 
associations. It includes representatives of regional 
organizations, the Mouvement Desjardins, and just about any 
organization that is connected with job issues.
<P>
	Finally, Claude Masson, a respected editorial writer in 
Quebec, who seldom shares the views of the Official 
Opposition, made some comments in <I>La Presse</I> which I would 
like to read to the Prime Minister before he answers my 
question. Mr. Masson said, in referring to manpower training:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If governments,as they keep repeating <I>ad nauseam</I>, really want to serve the 
public and at the same time substantially reduce public spending, it makes good 
sense to have only one government in charge of manpower training, and the 
government that is closest to the workers, the unemployed and people on welfare 
and knows best what they need and what it can offer them is the provincial 
government, in this case the Government of Quebec. This is not a matter of 
ideology but of common sense, not a constitutional choice but a practical and 
realistic one.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Madam Speaker, does the Prime Minister realize that by 
reviving disputes between Quebec City and Ottawa on an issue 
that is the subject of unanimous agreement in Quebec, he not 
only gives his centralizing vision precedence over the interests 
of the unemployed but also clearly shows to all 
Quebecers-federalists and others-that the only federalism 
possible for them is one of confrontation and scorn for their 
people?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurizio Bevilacqua (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Human Resources Development):</B> Madam 
Speaker, clearly the federal government has exclusive 
jurisdiction over unemployment insurance. Much of what we do 
in the labour market area is based on that responsibility: for 
example, employment services, counselling, training and labour 
mobility programs.
<P>
	Specifically our employment services and the programs and 
services flowing from these are adjuncts to the UI program. 
They go hand in hand with UI to reduce costs primarily by 
getting claimants off UI as quickly as possible and keeping them 
off UI as long as possible.
<P>
	Continued federal intervention in this area is a legitimate 
exercise of jurisdiction. Virtually every jurisdiction in the world 
which has an unemployment insurance program has associated 
with it an unemployment service as well as other active 
programming to help the unemployed return to gainful 
employment quickly. Federal interventions in the labour market 
help people avoid claiming UI either in the short term or the long 
term and reduce the costs of UI by shortening the duration of 
claims either in the short term or the long term. This applies 
regardless of

	Nevertheless all government have agreed that we need to find

	The federal government is actively pursuing agreements to 
achieve this end even while the reform of social security is under 
way. Any major changes in labour market roles and 
responsibilities of governments will be based on the outcome of 
the comprehensive social security review.

	<B>Mr. Osvaldo Nunez (Bourassa):</B> Madam Speaker, on January 
26 and March 10, I put questions in this House to the Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration concerning the plight of 
approximately 50 Salvadorian refugees in Montreal who are 
facing the threat of deportation to their native country. Despite 
my pressing the point, no action has been taken and the problem 
remains unresolved to this day.
<P>
	Yet, my request that this group of individuals be granted 
permanent resident status on humanitarian grounds was and 
remains extremely legitimate. If these individuals were forced 
to return to their country of origin, their safety and their lives 
would be placed in danger.
<P>
	Moreover, on December 19, 1993, the minister's colleague, 
the Minister of Foreign Affairs, recognized himself that 
political violence was again on this rise in El Salvador. Several 
reports by the human rights commission of this country, by the 
UN and by Amnesty International have all reached the same 
dramatic and incontrovertible conclusion: El Salvador's death 
squads are still active.
<P>
	I myself travelled to that country and stayed there from March 
15 to 22 last as part of a Canadian mission to observe elections 
that were taking place. My colleagues and I saw that life in that 
country had by no means returned to normal. During the election 
campaign, over 30 people were murdered.
<P>
	Moreover, we saw firsthand that the peace agreements 
concluded under the auspices of the UN had been violated and 
that numerous election irregularities had occurred.
<P>
	On March 10, I urged the minister to take the time to meet this 
group of Salvadorian refugees to learn firsthand how grave the 
situation had become. This group had taken the time to travel to 
Ottawa from Montreal. Despite giving the minister prior 
notification, he steadfastly refused to meet the Salvadorians.
<P>
	I am asking the minister again today to grant permanent 
resident status to these 50 refugees living under the threat of 
deportation. I also want to take this opportunity to call to his 
attention the apparently forgotten case of another young 
Salvadorian refugee, Mr. Mauricio Flores Romero, who took 
refuge five months ago in the basement of a Calgary church 
where he has been living ever since under far from auspicious 
conditions.
<P>
	I visited this young man last February. Every member of his 
family, except for him, has been granted refugee status. I was 
deeply touched by this meeting. His application is very 
legitimate. Once again, I ask the government to have some 
compassion for this claimant.
<P>
<B>(1840) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Madam Speaker, officials with 
the Department of Citizenship and Immigration met with 
representatives of the Centre de Développement Salvadorien to 
discuss this issue on three separate occasions: January 31, 
February 15 and March 3.
<P>
	As a result of these meetings we made two commitments to 
the organization and to the Salvadoran community in Canada. 
First, all Salvadorans facing removal from Canada would have 
their cases reviewed to ensure they would not be at risk if 
returned to El Salvador. Second, officials who conduct these 
reviews would be in possession of the most recent, up to date 
information on country conditions and political events in El 
Salvador. We have delivered on these commitments.
<P>
	All unsuccessful refugee claimants from El Salvador facing 
removal from Canada benefit from an extra review in addition to 
the current post claim determination review. Each case is 
reviewed to ensure that they will not be at risk if returned to El 
Salvador. In addition, we have ensured that officials are kept 
informed of the country conditions through reports and bulletins 
of human rights organizations, the United Nations observer 
mission in El Salvador, and information from our 
representatives in Central America.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	We must not lose sight of the fact that the fundamental issue 
here is refugee protection, not immigration. At some point, we 
have to accept the decisions handed down in the course of this 
process. Our refugee determination system is recognized as one 
of the fairest and most generous in the world.

	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Madam Speaker, on March 18, I 
asked the Deputy Prime Minister if she could promise on behalf 
of the government to implement the recommendation of Canada 
21 Council, a committee charged with reviewing Canada's 
defence policy that recommends building in Canada three 
support ships for humanitarian aid and peacekeeping. I also 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3266"> 3266 </A></B>
<P>
asked the Deputy Prime Minister if she could promise to give the 
MIL Davie shipyards the mandate to develop the ``smart'' ship, 
which could effectively support Canada's peacekeeping efforts.
<P>
	Unfortunately for the thousands of MIL Davie workers 
threatened with job loss who need a little hope, we only had a 
vague answer like ``we are looking into it''. That is tragic, but it 
is always the same answer with this government. We ask 
questions, but they go unanswered. When we get answers, for 
example in the case of the Magdalen Islands ferry, we are 
promised an answer in two months, but the time goes by and still 
no answer. I hope that in the ``smart'' ship case, the government 
will be diligent for once.
<P>
	You should know that the Canadian navy's AOR-type supply 
and logistical support ships are coming to the end of their life. 
Moreover, these three ships are not equipped for humanitarian 
support and peace missions. For example, Canada must now rent 
foreign ships to transport the vehicles, equipment and supplies 
needed to support our troops overseas. It usually takes several 
weeks before these ships are available to begin to take on the 
materiel our soldiers need.
<P>
	The MIL Davie shipyard already has a solution for this 
problem with its project for a versatile strategic transport and 
supply ship, known as the ``smart'' ship. For peacekeeping 
operations, a single ``smart'' ship can carry a mechanized 
battalion group including 70 armored troop carriers, 21 tanks, 
96 trucks, 8 M-109 armored self-propelled howitzers, 50 jeeps 
and 50 trailers, together with 300 tonnes of munitions and the 
fuel required for the vehicles.
<P>
	In another configuration, a single ``smart'' ship can provide 
the support needed for airborne operations with 600 infantry 
soldiers and 24 transport helicopters that can be used for refugee 
evacuation in particular. With a different configuration, the 
``smart'' ship can transport everything required to operate an air 
base for 24 CF-18s, which would have been very useful for our 
forces during the gulf war, for example.
<P>
<B>(1845) </B>
<P>
	In the event of a natural disaster, the ``smart'' ship can be 
quickly modified to transport a range of vehicles such as 
ambulances, trucks, materials, construction equipment, water 
tanks, fuel and bridge-building equipment. Up to 192 containers 
can fit on the main deck and be loaded with food, clothing, tents 
and other supplies. These ships would have been very useful in 
Somalia or when Hurricane Andrew hit Florida a few years ago.
<P>
	In case of a spill at sea, the ``smart'' ship can carry small 
clean-up boats to do the job. It can also carry clean-up 
equipment such as chemical dispersants and material to contain 
and absorb the spill. Its huge storage tanks can also be used to 
hold the recovered hydrocarbons. It can accommodate a 
600-person clean-up  crew and be used as a command, control 
and communication ship.
<P>
	I hope that this time, faced with these facts, the federal 
government will stop dragging its feet when we propose a 
project that meets the new realities of today's world. Above all, 
do not give us answers like the one from the Minister of 
Transport in a letter sent a few weeks ago to the City of Lévis, 
talking about a business plan that had already been filed a year 
ago.
<P>
	So we hope that the person representing the minister today 
will be able to give us a clearer and more definite answer.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Fred Mifflin (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
National Defence and Minister of Veterans Affairs):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I appreciate the hon. member's question and the 
interest of where he is coming from.
<P>
	He is out to get support for the hundreds of workers in his 
riding. As somebody who has over 6,000 fishermen and plant 
workers unemployed, and it looks like they will be for the next 
five years, I can certainly identify with the thrust of his 
question.
<P>
	I responded to the first part of his question the day he asked it 
in March. What gave rise to his question was one of the 
recommendations made by the Canada 21 report. The Canada 21 
Council submitted a very thought provoking report which is still 
being reported on in the media and is among the first of many 
submissions the government hopes to receive over the course of 
the defence policy review.
<P>
	The hon. member's question concerned the recommendation 
that the planned acquisition of three submarines be cancelled 
and replaced by the purchase of three peacekeeping support 
multi-role replenishment ships, that he so adequately describes, 
from domestic shipyards. His proposal of course is to give MIL 
Davie a mandate to develop these ships.
<P>
	The Canada 21 recommendation is a very complex one. The 
report is complex, and this particular recommendation prompts 
questions abut the need for peacekeeping and more specifically 
the future of Canada's defence policy.
<P>
	As I stand here this evening the special joint committee is 
meeting in an adjacent room. They are addressing the future of 
Canada's defence policy and precisely this kind of question.
<P>
	As the Prime Minister suggested and indeed stated in 
November when speaking of the defence review it is on the basis 
of the conclusion of such a review that the government will best 
determine the long term requirements, including equipment, for 
our forces.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3267"> 3267 </A></B>
<P>
	There are some recommendations in the report that simply 
must await the outcome of the policy review and this is one of 
them.
<P>
	Certain things about the report are of a different nature. For 
example the government was in total agreement that a defence 
policy review was necessary and indeed had embarked on it 
before the recommendation was made. There are some other 
recommendations, for example in the case of the defence 
infrastructure and the reduction of the headquarters staffs where 
the government is in basic agreement with the council and has 
already taken action.
<P>
	The response to the hon. member is that I can understand 
where his suggestion is coming from, but he will have to wait 
until the defence policy review is completed by the end of this 
year. I would say there will be decisions forthcoming in the new 
year after the review.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="TAINTEDBLOODINQUIRY">TAINTED BLOOD INQUIRY</A></H4>
	<B>Mrs. Pauline Picard (Drummond):</B> Madam Speaker, I have 
spoken in this House many times to express my growing concern 
about the lack of financial resources needed by the commission 
of inquiry on tainted blood for Mr. Justice Krever to get to the 
bottom of this outright scandal.
<P>
	Judge Krever himself told the daily <I>La Presse</I> on November 
24, 1993, that the funds granted to the commission and to the 
Canadian Hemophilia Society were clearly insufficient and that 
it would be difficult to show what really happened in this tainted 
blood affair.
<P>
	The time has come to give more money to this commission 
and the Canadian Hemophilia Society.
<P>
<B>(1850) </B>
<P>
	But every time I spoke in this House to ask the minister to act 
or to grant the funds essential to the proper operation of this 
commission, she always repeated the same thing, that the 
request was being considered by Treasury Board and a decision 
would be made as soon as possible.
<P>
	How can the minister justify the government's slowness to 
allocate more funds? What are the minister's intentions on this? 
These questions are unanswered.
<P>
	The minister should realize sooner or later that her inaction 
has and will have a major impact on the work of this commission 
and its findings. For example, the Canadian Hemophilia 
Society, the only real defender of the victims of the scandal, is 
now financially unable to send one of its members to follow all 
the proceedings of the commission of inquiry.
<P>
	Who is in a better position than a member of the Canadian 
Hemophilia Society, which knows every aspect of this affair, to 
follow it up and properly inform the lawyers on location? 
However, the inaction of the minister and her government does 
not allow it and deprives the least fortunate victims of an 
opportunity to defend themselves in the same way as those who 
hold economic and political power.
<P>
	The democratic principle whereby all are equal before the law 
is being violated, this time with the consent of the minister and 
her government. Even worse, neither the minister nor the Prime 
Minister have seen fit to act on the many distress signals from 
the Canadian Hemophilia Society.
<P>
	Do the government and the health minister really care about 
their citizens' welfare? Indeed, do they have something to hide 
about this shameful saga, one unworthy of a modern society? 
Why are the minister and her department systematically 
obstructing the repeated requests of the Canadian Hemophilia 
Society and thus making any openness in this case impossible?
<P>
	Need I remind you that lack of openness will leave a bitter 
memory for all the victims of tainted blood and their families. 
These victims are entitled to know the circumstances 
surrounding this scandal and this is the government's and the 
minister's responsibility. No one has a right to hide the truth and 
to silence anyone who could clear up this horrible nightmare.
<P>
	It would be in the minister's interest to speak out clearly and 
as soon as possible on granting additional funds for the inquiry 
on tainted blood and for the Canadian Hemophilia Society, as 
requested by Mr. Justice Krever, so that justice can be done.
<P>
	My question is simple: what is the minister waiting for to act?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Hedy Fry (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health):</B> Madam Speaker, the hon. member is the health critic 
for the opposition and therefore she is aware of the complexity 
of the issues surrounding the blood inquiry by Justice Krever.
<P>
	She is also aware that it was the federal government and the 
Ministry of Health that has with the provincial governments put 
forward the money initially and has helped and assisted in every 
way for the Krever commission to occur.
<P>
	Therefore, we are very supportive. We are anxious and we are 
willing to find out what the commission has to say.
<P>
	The commission has been meeting in many cities across the 
country and is still doing so. It is getting very valuable 
information. Therefore, at this time the commission is not in any 
way impaired due to lack of funds or due to lack of resources. 
While we are speaking now officials from the Ministry of Health 
are discussing what to do for future funding.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3268"> 3268 </A></B>

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="NATIVECOMMUNITIES">NATIVE COMMUNITIES</A></H4>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Madam Speaker, on March 
18, after the tabling of the annual report of the Canadian Human 
Rights Commissioner Mr. Max Yalden, I put a question to the 
Deputy Prime Minister, whose reply was unsatisfactory.
<P>
<B>(1855) </B>
<P>
	In his report, the Human Rights Commissioner was very 
critical of the way native people were treated by the Government 
of Canada under the Indian Act.
<P>
	I do not think one has to be an expert on Amerindian issues to 
realize that aboriginal people in Canada often suffer job 
discrimination, that they live in a state of forced dependency on 
the federal government as a result of the Indian Act and face a 
number of social problems that merely reinforce the prejudice 
against native people. We do not need learned studies to realize 
that significant changes are urgently needed to improve their 
living conditions.
<P>
	In response to my question in about the strategy and concrete 
measures the government had in mind to correct a situation that 
was both deplorable and well known, the Deputy Prime Minister 
merely replied that her government was negotiating agreements 
with aboriginal peoples aimed at granting them a form of 
self-government, and that as a result of this process the 
department of Indian affairs could ultimately disappear.
<P>
	Aboriginal nations, Quebecers and Canadians expect more 
specific answers from the government when discussing issues 
that are so important to the future of these communities. 
Although it has plans to conclude an agreement with aboriginal 
peoples involving their inherent right to self-government, the 
Government of Canada, through its minister of Indian affairs, is 
dragging its feet, avoids answering the questions and refuses to 
be specific about the form aboriginal governments will take.
<P>
	Will these governments be constituted along ethnic lines? 
Will they have specific and exclusive territories? Will they have 
legal and fiscal powers? Will they be able to sign agreements 
with other governments? There is complete confusion and 
uncertainty about these issues which are extremely important to 
the country, and that is because the government just keeps 
repeating that negotiations are under way with various 
aboriginal nations.
<P>
	We want to be informed about the negotiating process. We 
want to know about the Government of Canada's definition of 
native self-government.
<P>
	Finally, considering the recommendations of the Human 
Rights Commissioner who indicated in his report that the Indian 
Act encourages the dependency and  marginalization of 
aboriginal peoples, could the Minister tell the House what 
specific measures he has in mind to put an end to the social and 
economic problems created by this paternalistic legislation?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Iyerak Anawak (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development):</B>
<P>
	<I>[Editor's Note: Member spoke in Inuktitut.]</I>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to respond to the question raised by the hon. 
member for Jonquière on March 18. The answer to his question 
about the federal government's strategy for implementing the 
recommendations made in the Human Rights Commission's 
report can be found in the red book, otherwise known as 
``Creating Opportunity: the Liberal Plan for Canada''.
<P>
	He has to understand that it took many years to get to the stage 
where we are now starting to discuss self-government issues 
with the aboriginal groups of Canada. It is going to take some 
time to get agreement from the different aboriginal groups 
whether they are Indian, Inuit or Métis. He has to understand it 
is going to take some time. It took us an awful lot of time to get 
to the stage of what he calls complete confusion. It is going to 
take a while to try to sort out that confusion. I ask the hon. 
member to be patient and assure him that we are working on 
those things.
<P>
	The federal government's red book has identified many of the 
same issues as those outlined in the commission's report: the 
aboriginal right to self-government, land claims, the Indian Act 
and aboriginal justice. These are priority areas which the federal 
government has dedicated itself to working on in partnership 
with aboriginal people. Together we must find solutions that 
will lead to improvement in the economic and social conditions 
in First Nations communities.
<P>
	The federal government is acting on the premise that the 
inherent right to self-government is an existing right in the 
Constitution. The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, as I said earlier, has initiated a discussion process 
with aboriginal leaders and leaders of the provincial and 
territorial governments.
<P>
	Following these discussions the federal government intends 
to translate its policy intent into concrete action. When 
aboriginal people assume more control over their own lives, we 
will be in a much better position to make the kind of changes that 
will work best in our communities.
