	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to thank in particular the hon. member for 
Mission-Coquitlam for allowing me to step in before 
continuing with her motion.
<P>
	It is certainly with a heavy heart that I rise in the House today 
on behalf of Revenue Canada and the government to express my 
deepest sympathies for the families of the two customs officers 
who died in a tragic accident over the weekend in New 
Brunswick.
<P>
	The two officers killed were Inspector David Moore and 
Superintendent Jim Finnamore, both of Perth-Andover.
<P>
	They were swept to their deaths Saturday night by a sudden 
rise in the flood swollen waters of the Aroostook River.
<P>
	I want to stress that they died not because of carelessness, 
error or mistake. They died by reason of their high concern for 
the safety of other customs officers under their command.
<P>
	Briefly, the facts as far as they are now known are as follows. 
The customs office at Tinker's Road, which is some 15 
kilometres from the Perth-Andover office, was threatened by 
rising flood waters on Saturday evening. Although the two men 
had spoken to the customs inspectors who were on duty at 
Tinker's Road and had been told that the situation was 
satisfactory, Mr. Moore and Mr. Finnamore decided to check the 
situation personally. I want to stress that is the type of men they 
were, dedicated professionals determined to do everything in 
their power to ensure the safety of their staff.
<P>
	A short distance from the Tinker's Road office they met an 
RCMP officer and several provincial government employees 
who were monitoring the rising flood waters.  The customs 
officers were in fact joined by an RCMP officer for the 
remainder of the short trip.
<P>
	Once they arrived at Tinker's Road office, Mr. Moore and Mr. 
Finnamore met with the two customs inspectors who were 
working there. After reviewing the situation the four men agreed 
that there was no immediate danger of flooding at that particular 
customs post. The two men then left with the RCMP and started 
back on the road to Perth-Andover, the same road they had 
travelled less than a half hour before. It was at this point that 
tragedy struck.
<P>
<B>(1105) </B>
<P>
	An ice build-up on the river suddenly released and a torrent of 
water swept over the river bank and the adjacent roadway just as 
the vehicle of the three men was traversing a low point in the 
road. The vehicle was swept to the side of the road, nose down in 
the ditch, and was almost totally submerged. All three men were 
successful in climbing on to the roof of the vehicle. The two 
customs officers tried to reach land while the RCMP officer 
stayed with the vehicle. Tragically, they failed to reach the 
shore.
<P>
	Shortly after a search was launched for the missing three men. 
The RCMP officer was located and taken to hospital at midnight. 
The search continued in the darkness for a further three hours 
without success.
<P>
	Yesterday morning at daybreak the search resumed. The body 
of Mr. Moore was found first and the body of Mr. Finnamore was 
recovered shortly after.
<P>
	Coping with such a loss is always difficult, but it is so much 
more difficult when the loss is sudden as a result of a series of 
events that cannot be explained.
<P>
	David Moore is survived by his wife Kelly. James Finnamore 
is survived by his wife Frances and their three children, Tamara, 
Brent and Peter.
<P>
	Yesterday I spoke with both widows to express my most 
profound sympathy for their loss and to tell them that the 
department will do all that it can to support them and to help 
them through this very difficult time.
<P>

<P>

<P>
	David Moore worked for the department for six years and 
James Finnamore was an employee of Revenue Canada for 
almost 18 years. We have lost two fine men, highly professional 
public servants, dedicated to their work and to the people of 
Canada. They will be missed dearly at home. They will be 
missed by those with whom they worked, who are both their 
colleagues and their friends.
<P>
	I know all members of this House will wish to join with me 
after the statements of other party representatives to stand for a 
few moments to reflect on this tragic event and to remember 
these two fine individuals who died in service of this country.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, very briefly 
and on a serious note, the members of the Bloc Quebecois agree 
fully with the comments of the hon. Minister of Revenue. We 
wish to convey our deepest sympathies to the families and 
friends of Mr. David Moore and Mr. Jim Finnamore.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I join with members of the government as expressed by 
the minister and my Bloc colleagues in expressing the grief and 
sympathy of Reform members in the tragic deaths of Inspector 
David Moore and Superintendent Jim Finnamore.
<P>
	I grew up beside the South Saskatchewan River and know first 
hand the beauty, the benefits and also the danger associated with 
our waterways. In fact, I remember as a young boy when my 
father lost an employee to the river. We sense the shock and pain 
and sorrow those involved in this situation are experiencing.
<P>
	I have also visited the Perth-Andover area and I can envision 
the landscape and the beauty of the Saint John River valley and 
the rolling hills in western New Brunswick. I have met with 
some people in that region and I am sure they share in the grief 
caused by this accident. I am also confident that the community 
is rising to the situation and will give comfort and support to 
Kelly Moore and to Frances, Tamara, Brent and Peter 
Finnamore, as well as to other loved ones.
<P>
	With my colleagues I express appreciation for the lives of Jim 
Finnamore and David Moore and our sympathy and prayers go 
out to their families and other loved ones.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would ask that we rise and have a 
moment's silence.

	<B>Mrs. Daphne Jennings (Mission-Coquitlam)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of the this House, the government should permit members 
of the House of Commons to fully represent their constituents' views on the 
government's legislative program and spending plans by adopting the position 
that the defeat of any government measure, including a spending measure, shall 
not automatically mean the defeat of the government unless followed by the 
adoption of a formal motion.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, in the time available to me today I 
would like to explain my motion so that members of this House 
will clearly know what they are being asked to vote on.
<P>
	As this is a votable motion, declared so by the procedure and 
House affairs committee, it will be the first time, at least as far 
as I can determine, that members will have the opportunity to 
express themselves on the issues of confidence and flowing 
from that the issue of freer voting in the House.
<P>
	I would also like to address the history of voting in this House, 
a history which has been characterized by political party 
discipline or voting along party lines. I will refer to the 
experience in other jurisdictions such as Great Britain where 
there has been a noticeable relaxation of the party whip.
<P>
	My research indicates that in Australia and New Zealand, 
while party discipline is somewhat less than in Canada but more 
than in Great Britain, there are clear avenues for backbenchers, 
private members, to influence the policies of their party.
<P>
	I will conclude by dealing with the criticisms of allowing 
freer voting by members of the House of Commons. I must 
admit that I am surprised there are any criticisms because of the 
support this issue has received in the last two Parliaments. When 
I first spoke on this subject on January 21, the hon. member for 
Broadview-Greenwood took issue with my arguments and 
more recently at a meeting of the House of Commons committee 
on procedure and House affairs I was amazed by the arguments 
raised by members opposite.
<P>
	I believe it is necessary that these be addressed, fears put to 
bed so that all members of the House may join together to 
support this motion. The motion refers actually to three matters: 
relaxation of the confidence convention, freer voting and 
representation of constituents' interests.
<P>
	By relaxing the confidence convention I mean that only votes 
that are explicitly labelled as confidence votes when lost by the 
government bring about the government's resignation. There is 
a myth that has been spread about this place for many years that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3129"> 3129 </A></B>
<P>
the  government cannot lose votes. If it does it must resign, 
either forcing an election or putting the Governor General into 
the position of calling on someone else to see if she or he can 
form a government.
<P>
	Intellectually, we all know this is nonsense. Yet it is the 
practice followed in this House, and my motion would narrowly 
define the confidence convention. The result of a narrow 
definition of this convention should be that members, especially 
government backbench members, should feel freed from the 
strictures of party discipline to occasionally vote against the 
party line.
<P>
	In fact, the beneficial effect of this motion applies to all 
members, both government and opposition. Government 
members would feel free to vote against the party line because 
losing an occasional vote will not mean the defeat of the 
government. Once this type of thinking is understood by the 
party leadership, those voting against the party line should also 
not be subject to retribution or punishment. At the same time we 
in opposition should feel free to vote with the government 
members from time to time. The government cannot always be 
wrong, even this government. It is incumbent on us in 
opposition to recognize this fact and from time to time vote with 
the government even though our party leadership may try to 
convince us otherwise. I also want to make it clear that I am 
speaking about freer voting and not the declaration of free votes 
which is done under the direction of party leadership.
<P>
<B>(1115) </B>
<P>
	Finally, why or when would the break come with party 
discipline? My motion reads that it would be done ``to fully 
represent their constituents' views''. This is one example of 
when it may be done but there are others. However, I want to 
deal with the issue of representing constituents' views because 
there seems to be a lack of understanding of the position of the 
Reform Party on this matter. Let me be very clear.
<P>
	Unlike some elections in the past, the 1993 election was 
significant in that the three recognized parties that are now in 
the House set out for Canadians platforms which to a great 
extent detailed how the parties would deal with the major issues 
as these issues presented themselves in the fall of 1993.
<P>
	They were what Canadians voted for when they voted on 
October 25, 1993. To a great extent, we believe that when an 
issue arises which was in the party platform then the member is 
obligated to vote the party line. I could argue that the Liberal red 
book may be long on theory and grandiose but very short on 
implementation plans and there is room for departure from the 
party line. However, I am not here to discuss Liberal Party 
policies.
<P>
	My main point is that issues will come along which are new, 
issues which are not found or addressed in party platforms. Two 
such issues come quickly to mind; cigarette smuggling and 
constituency boundary redistribution. On these issues and issues 
like them  members should feel less inclined to blindly support 
the party line.
<P>
	As well as breaking with their party to represent constituents' 
views, members could also be representing their own views 
based on common sense logic which the individual member may 
bring to the issue in question.
<P>
	There is a feeling that if members are suddenly freed from 
party discipline there will be chaos with complete 
unpredictability in the system. Members will be voting every 
which way and Parliament will become unworkable and the 
country ungovernable.
<P>
	This is not where this motion leads at all. It simply recognizes 
that on occasion members without fear of retribution from party 
leadership may vote against the party line. The government will 
not fall. The sun will still rise in the east and I believe the 
interests of Canadians will be better served by their elected 
representatives. Is that not what we are all here to do, serve the 
Canadian public to the best of our abilities?
<P>
	Enough about the content of my motion. Now I would like to 
deal with the history of this matter, a history which began long 
before most of us got here. It began with a feeling of 
dissatisfaction among the Canadian people which was detected 
by the Canadian Study of Parliamentary Group in a Gallup poll it 
commissioned in 1983.
<P>
	A question was asked as to how MPs should behave when 
voting. The response was that 49.5 per cent felt members should 
vote according to their own judgment. By way of contrast the 
view that the member should vote as the party wishes received 
very little support. The national average in the survey favouring 
the MP as party loyalists was only 7.9 per cent.
<P>
	The frustration with MPs following the party line which the 
public expressed in this survey found its way into the 1985 
report of the special committee on Reform of the House of 
Commons. This committee believed that ``the purpose of reform 
of the House of Commons in 1985 is to restore to private 
members an effective legislative function, to give them a 
meaningful role in the formation of public policy''. One of the 
main methods by which this goal was to be accomplished was by 
attitudinal change. This would result in a relaxation of the 
confidence convention, allowing members to occasionally vote 
against the party line without fear of bringing down the 
government or retribution by the party leadership.
<P>
	The report of the McGrath committee was quite clear on the 
subject of the confidence convention and freer votes. The 
committee stated that ``once elected, members of Parliament are 
legally and constitutionally entitled to act independently''. In 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3130"> 3130 </A></B>
<P>
the House they can speak and vote as they like. ``If they choose 
to deviate from the party line they are free to do so provided they 
accept the political risks''.
<P>
<B>(1120 ) </B>
<P>
	It was these political risks that the McGrath committee 
through its recommendations was trying to minimize. The 
committee went on to describe the ideal situation. ``Rigid 
discipline is hardly compatible with a philosophy of a 
democratic political party, and reasonable latitude consistent 
with loyalty to the party should be permitted the individual 
members of any party''.
<P>
	This was the middle ground which the committee sought and 
it is the middle ground that the motion before the House today 
seeks to establish: loyalty to a political party, but not blind 
loyalty, loyalty combined with the latitude to vote against the 
party line on occasion.
<P>
	The McGrath committee offered five observations on the 
confidence convention and this is one of them.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>In a Parliament with a government in command of the majority the matter of 
confidence has really been settled by the electorate. Short of a reversal of 
allegiance or some major cataclysmic political event the question of confidence 
is really a fait accompli. The government and other parties should therefore have 
the wisdom to permit members to decide many matters in their own deliberative 
judgment. Overuse of party whips and of confidence motions devalues both these 
important institutions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	We are fortunate in this Parliament to have two members of 
that committee still with us, the hon. member for Winnipeg 
Transcona, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is my hope 
that both will find time to speak on the motion before it comes to 
a vote.
<P>
	More recently in April 1993 the House management 
committee recommended:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Members of Parliament should be made more aware of a confidence 
convention and the observations of the special committee on Reform of the 
House of Commons. With few exceptions, motions proposed by the government 
should be considered as motions of confidence only when clearly identified as 
such by the government.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	However, the committee which was made up of many 
members who are still in this Parliament, such as the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Leader of the Government in the 
House of Commons, the Minister of Health and the hon. member 
for Saint-Léonard were realistic in its prediction of the effect of 
this recommendation. It stated:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Canadian parliamentary system does have extremely strong party 
discipline, one that is perhaps stronger than in many other systems. The 
committee endorses the idea of freeing up voting in the House but we hesitate to 
create unreasonably high expectations. It is not a procedural issue. Ultimately it 
is up to the individual members and Parliament.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Why did these groups of members of this place in previous 
Parliaments feel relaxation of the confidence convention and 
freer voting were so important? I believe that these members 
properly read the mood of the Canadian public.
<P>
	With the advent of the information age, the public is better 
informed about political institutions. The work of the members 
of these institutions, and as a result the  public, is less willing to 
follow without questioning the lead of elected representatives. 
They expect their representatives to be well informed and 
represent the best interests of their constituents. This well 
informed public does not respond to leadership the way it used 
to. The actions of Canadians in the referendum on the 
Charlottetown accord is ample evidence of their refusal to be 
blindly led.
<P>
	The public also expects its elected representatives not to be 
blindly led. As well the public feels disenfranchised when 
members are forced by the threat of dire consequences to a 
member's political future to vote in a fashion which is perceived 
by the public to not represent the public interest. Lack of 
independence in voting is equated with lack of influence in the 
policy making process. Those involved in the political process 
make the argument that the influence of the private member is 
exercised in caucus or in private meetings with ministers. For 
the public this is not good enough any more.
<P>
	The public wants to feel that its views are taken into 
consideration more than just every four or five years at general 
elections. The public also wants to see a public demonstration 
that its views are being heard and acted on. This public 
demonstration most often occurs in the act of voting by an MP.
<P>
	This exercise of independence by members of the House of 
Commons has occurred to a great extent in Great Britain and 
their system of responsible government has survived. In the 
period between April 1972 and April 1979 there were 65 defeats 
of the government in Great Britain. These defeats were 
important because they helped destroy the myth that had arisen 
to the effect that any government defeat endangered its 
continuance in office.
<P>
	They were also important in that they influenced the 
behaviour of subsequent members of Parliament by established 
a precedent. MPs from all parties became less willing to accept 
party dictates on matters of policy and voting. Those who defied 
the party whips discovered they could do so with little negative 
sanction and were encouraged to do so more often. Others were 
influenced in turn by their example.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	In Canada our experience with cross voting is more limited 
but in the sixties and seventies we did have experience with 
governments losing votes and not resigning.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3131"> 3131 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore I believe I have established that a relaxation of the 
confidence convention and freer voting has been the subject of 
study and positive recommendations of at least two 
parliamentary committees, many members of which are still 
sitting in the House today. As well we know of at least one other 
jurisdiction where what would be the results of my motion has 
been put into action with no dire consequences. Responsible 
government still prevails, political parties still exist-they 
have not been deemed obsolete-and most important of all, the 
public through its members in the House of Commons has some 
real influence over the policy making process.
<P>
	I would like to address some of the criticisms that have been 
levied against relaxation of the confidence convention and freer 
voting in the House. It is argued that freer voting would have a 
negative effect on the future well-being of political parties. 
Political parties are vitally important to the system, especially at 
election time, for the development of policy and the support the 
leader can give individual candidates. Also between elections 
political parties can give tax receipts for contributions.
<P>
	I cannot stress it enough; freer voting will not have a negative 
effect on either the continuance of political parties, nor on their 
ability to meld together various divergent viewpoints. Freer 
voting does not mean that on every issue members will be voting 
in unpredictable ways. As I stated in the beginning of my 
speech, on issues where the party platform is clear, members 
would be expected to support the party. It is in those other areas 
outside the platform where I believe freer voting should be 
allowed.
<P>
	It is also argued that the government will be criticized for 
bringing legislation forward and then telling members that 
defeat of the measure will not be deemed to be a vote of 
non-confidence in the government. It will be argued that the 
government is wasting House time with proposed legislation 
that it does not care about.
<P>
	I believe that instead of being criticized for such an attitude 
the government will be praised for allowing all elected members 
to take part in the policy influencing process. Too often 
governments have taken the House of Commons for granted, 
paying lip service to obtain support on critical votes and lapsing 
back into a dictatorial demeanour.
<P>
	Another argument presented against freer voting is that if 
dissent is allowed the government will not be able to make tough 
decisions because members will duck making unpopular but 
necessary decisions. While the possibility of dissent may make 
it tougher for political parties to take potentially unpopular 
stands, it also presents a challenge, a challenge to inform the 
public of the necessity of an unpopular decision. It may also 
force political parties when they are developing an election 
platform to be as forward thinking as possible so most issues are 
covered in the party platform and there are no surprises for the 
public after the election.
<P>
	Another point often made is that there are plenty of other 
avenues open to a member to show his or her displeasure with 
party leadership than voting against the party line in the House 
of Commons. While at first glance this may seem to be true, 
there are in reality few effective means available to members to 
express dissent.
<P>
	For example, a private member's bill takes a very long time to 
become law under the best of circumstances. Question period, 
because the list is controlled by the party leadership, is a 
difficult time for a dissident government backbencher. Such a 
member may get to ask one tough question and that is it.
<P>
	The criticisms regarding the relaxation of confidence 
convention and freer votes are simply not valid. What is valid is 
the need for the political courage necessary to start freer voting. 
Leadership on this issue must come from the government. Once 
this has been shown, opposition parties must agree to allow 
dissent so that all members are free to express views which may 
differ from those of their political party leadership. This will 
require a change in attitude and political courage. However if 
this results in more members playing a vital role in the 
influencing of public policy then dissent will have been worth 
the time spent to reduce party discipline.
<P>
	I look forward to the debate on this motion and I urge all 
members to support it as it will send a clear message to 
Canadians that we are not afraid of the party leadership 
punishing us for exercising independent thoughts and actions, as 
has been done in the past. We want to play a meaningful role in 
influencing the formation of public policy which addresses the 
needs of all Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Colleagues, because of the statements 
earlier, the private member's debate will last until 12.08 p.m.
<P>
	I would ask all members to please refer to people who are still 
in this House by the names of their constituencies or titles rather 
than by their proper names.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
after hearing the thoughtful address by the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, I was unfortunately reminded of a recent 
movie entitled ``Back to the Future''.
<P>
	The ideas of the Reform Party on the Constitution seem sadly 
out of date, as if they had been reading pre-1914 textbooks. 
Without any derogatory reference to the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam, I would rather have heard the other 
Jennings invoked. I refer to the Jennings whom you know, Mr. 
Speaker, and I know and who taught briefly at the University of 
British 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3132"> 3132 </A></B>
<P>
Columbia before going on to greater fame in other arenas, Sir 
Ivor Jennings.
<P>
	It is a fact that by the 1920s and the 1930s it had been 
recognized generally throughout the former British Empire and 
the British Commonwealth that the defeat of a government on a 
measure does not automatically warrant its resignation. It 
requires a qualitative judgment.
<P>
	Indeed, to speed matters up I would remind the House that in 
the spring of 1968 when the government of the day, the Pearson 
government, was defeated by accident-the failure of some 
members to return in time from other places-it was not felt 
necessary for the government to resign.
<P>
	I appeared on nation-wide television with the then NDP 
leader and others and we concluded that the precedents that 
Canada accepted at that stage did not require an automatic 
resignation.
<P>
	In the 1979 episode when Prime Minister Clark was defeated, 
as it was said, by bad counting, his whip had failed I think to 
count up the numbers in government and opposition, Mr. Clark 
concluded that perhaps he should resign. He went to 
Government House. It is believed that the Governor General 
tried to suggest to him that the precedents did not require that 
particular course of action.
<P>
	As we know, Mr. Clark's request for dissolution was not 
granted immediately. The Governor General suggested he return 
to Parliament and he phoned him later.
<P>
	I am simply saying that the issue of confidence is not 
interpreted today in 19th century terms. It is a matter for a 
qualitative judgment. Here again I regret that the Reform Party 
has not paid enough attention to Canadian parliamentary 
practice.
<P>
	The Prime Minister rightly reminded us in an address to the 
House of Commons on January 20 that the House is not a group 
of independents who have been elected on their own. We are 
dealing with a team. Law-making today is a sophisticated 
process of give and take, of exchange and discussion. It is a 
dialectical process of law in the making.
<P>
	To cite only my own experience in the brief time that I have 
been a member, I receive the views of my constituents as a 
member. I communicate them to the members of my provincial 
group. We meet once a week. We meet also once a week in a 
regional caucus with members from all four western provinces. 
We meet again in a national caucus and we discuss. There is a 
give and take. There are the all-party committees. That is the 
reality of law in the making today, that members do not have to 
participate by simply voting yes and no. If they do that they are 
voting after the event.
<P>
	The dynamic process of law-making today requires 
contributions, give and take discussion while measures are 
evolving. That is how one influences the law. I think that is how 
we have to undertake to interpret our role as members in a 
modern contemporary sense.
<P>
	It is to say that constitutional law is in full evolution. There is 
a danger with the best of intentions that the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam has of attempting to legislate 
constitutional conventions. The life of constitutional 
conventions has not been logic. It has not been legislation. It has 
been experience. It is this and error testing process. The 
interesting thing about law making today is that all parties 
participate in the all-party committees. To cite only the two to 
which I belong, the members of the Reform Party have 
contributed significantly and constructively. I have welcomed 
that. I have seen the changes in measures that might otherwise 
have been drafted or put forward differently, and that is to be 
welcomed.
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
	It is not a matter of saying that members do not represent their 
constituents or do not fully represent their constituents' views. 
Any member who does not do this has been neglecting his or her 
function today as a member to consult regularly with the 
constituents, to bring it back to the provincial caucus, to speak 
out in the regional caucus, to speak out in the national caucus, 
and to discuss it in the all-party committees.
<P>
	That is the life of Parliament today. That is the reality of law 
making. It is not the way it was in 1914. It is not the way it was 
before the other Jennings wrote his beautiful works. These 
works have been studied in Canada and they are part of our 
practice.
<P>
	I would welcome the Reform Party joining with us in moving 
forward into the future and recognizing the changes that have 
been made and not trying to legislate and therefore stultify and I 
think arrest a process already in creative evolution today.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer):</B> Mr. Speaker, I feel that the private 
member's bill before us today could be one of the most 
important that we will have in this 35th Parliament.
<P>
	I think that all of us recognize that there is something wrong 
with this place and that is the reason we have to re-examine the 
very structure of the way it operates.
<P>
	First, we have to look at what people are saying. I believe that 
to simply put our heads in the sand and not listen is a disservice 
to those people. People have lost confidence in this place. They 
believe that they send their MPs and they get gobbled up down 
here. Sometimes we have referred to that as Ottawa fever or 
whatever we want to call it. It leads to a situation where we have 
messages being taken from Ottawa to the constituency with the 
reverse seldom ever occurring.
<P>
	I think that the election results probably were a good 
indication of where that sort of thing occurred.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3133"> 3133 </A></B>
<P>
	What about the MPs themselves? They come here and they 
follow the party line. There is little free thinking. Attendance 
drops off. Mr. Fisher, in speaking to our caucus prior to us 
coming here, put it very well when he said that most or a lot of 
MPs become good constituency people. Really that is giving 
them the benefit of the doubt that in fact they must be working in 
their constituency because they are certainly not working here.
<P>
	We have to try and find the answer. Some say it is in 
committee work. For others, it is that they had better toe the 
party line or be kicked out. Freer votes, I believe, are a solution 
to at least part of this problem. This was recognized in the throne 
speech in 1991. It was said that freer votes were definitely a way 
to make this better.
<P>
	The famous red book in 1993 suggested that MPs should be 
given a freer vote and count for more in committees and in the 
House. So it goes. Freer votes have been dealt with by many, 
many people but have not been instituted as yet.
<P>
	Why have we come to this conclusion? Why do we feel this 
way? Maybe we can examine a little deeper some of the reasons. 
The first one might be in committee work itself. It is said, as I 
have said, that you can make a difference in committee work and 
that it does not have to be just that old party follow the line sort 
of thing.
<P>
<B>(1140 ) </B>
<P>
	I have seen discussions occur in committee work. In our 
committee we had a two-day seminar where we looked at the 
areas of interest to our committee. Members got a feel for where 
the members of Parliament on that committee really were at.
<P>
	When it comes right down to it, it seems that we will go back 
to the organizational phases of the committee. Here we should 
have looked at things like merit. We should have looked at 
where they were from in the country and whether there was fair 
regional representation. We found that the party whip or his 
assistant came along and made the decision that Bloc members 
should be the vice-chair of every committee.
<P>
	It did not matter whether we had representation from all parts 
of Canada or not. We have been looking at the estimates. The 
party position seems to come through loud and clear. I suppose 
when we do our reports, again we will have a party position or 
that of the chairman, vice-chairman and so on because of the 
majority situation.
<P>
	Opposition members will be left to do little else than submit a 
minority report and one does not really know whether anyone 
looks at it or not. What does that do? It makes one wonder why 
one really works so hard on committees. Let us look at the 
House.
<P>
	In the House we sit and listen. I know that members are aware 
of the excellent ideas, the good research and the good speeches 
that are given here by all parties. Does it really matter because 
we always come back to voting the party line? I suppose the best 
example that was  brought out to me was when I moved an 
amendment to a motion to exclude the Senate from joint 
standing committees.
<P>
	I felt that was something the electorate was saying about the 
other place. Most MPs feel that way about the other place. Again 
we voted the party line. Again we could not have a free vote. We 
could not say what we or the people of Canada thought. Instead, 
we thought about the spin doctors of party politics.
<P>
	How can we develop a national pride and trust in politicians if 
we are always going by party line? How should we decide a 
vote? How should it really go on any bill? We should listen to the 
speeches. As I have mentioned, the quality is certainly there. In 
committees we should go into the depth of the issues, look at the 
details, the facts and the solutions. All members should then be 
made aware of what occurred. That would be how they get their 
information.
<P>
	We must get the constituents involved. We must have town 
hall meetings from day one. We should have phone blitzes, TV 
shows and householders that are not simply political 
propaganda or what MPs feel is good material. It should really 
count for something. We should really be trying to inform the 
electorate.
<P>
	I am really impressed with how the general public 
communicates with its members of Parliament. Those people 
have given some thought. They expect their member to vote 
their will, not simply the party line of thinking. Members can 
see why many politicians and many members of the public have 
lost faith in the system we have here.
<P>
	The procedures of Parliament as I would see them then would 
result in a bill being introduced. It could be stated up front 
whether it is a confidence motion. The committees would report 
in detail on the bill. The members would speak and other 
members would come to listen. It would count for something. 
The members' speeches would have some meaning.
<P>
	Members must have the opportunity to communicate with 
their constituents. Finally, when the vote occurred it could be 
passed, modified or defeated. That would not change or put any 
aspersions on the present government. In order to make this 
happen, we must re-educate a number of people.
<P>
<B>(1145 ) </B>
<P>
	We must re-educate members of the media. They cannot look 
on every defeat of a bill as being a defeat of the government. 
They must see the positive side of having all of that extra input.
<P>
	The government must not think of things as being a defeat or a 
win or a lose situation. The opposition of course must not take 
advantage of the situation where a bill is defeated and hold that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3134"> 3134 </A></B>
<P>
over the government. Instead it must be looked on as a 
constructive measure for the good of the country.
<P>
	The public must realize the MPs they elect really do have a 
say in what happens. Then they will be more careful in their 
selection of their MPs. They will make sure it is someone they 
can trust to represent them and not just the party position.
<P>
	Freer votes will mean that MPs will express the views of their 
constituents better. It will take government right back to the 
people. Some of executive power will be moved out of cabinet 
hands to the true representatives in the House. It will allow for a 
much greater accountability of MPs because members will not 
point to a party line when voting against the wishes of their 
constituents. MPs should always be responsible to the wishes of 
their constituents.
<P>
	We have greatly underestimated the ability of the electorate to 
get involved, become informed and thus participate in direct 
democracy. The more complex form of representative 
government got us into the $500 billion deficit and other serious 
problems we now have. Let us let freer direct democracy get us 
out of those problems.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stan Keyes (Hamilton West):</B> Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the House for giving me the opportunity to speak to 
motion M-89 of the hon. member for Mission-Coquitlam. 
Right off the top I want to say I do not accept the position of the 
hon. member's party on confidence.
<P>
	I would like to address the three points put forward by the hon. 
member, the first being relaxing the confidence convention, the 
second being history, and the third being the aspects of freer 
voting.
<P>
	The first concerns relaxing the confidence convention. If 
there is one conclusion that can be drawn from 300 years of 
political thought it is that there is not one correct interpretation 
of confidence. Reform's view is that confidence need only be 
expressed in formal votes. I think this is a mistake in the thought 
process.
<P>
	To quote the hon. member's remark to ``feel free to vote with 
the government members from time to time'', I assume she was 
speaking of the opposition. I asked the table clerk to provide me 
with the number of votes we have had since the beginning of this 
35th Parliament. We have had 31 votes and not once from day 
one has anyone from that hon. member's party broken ranks.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keyes:</B> And some of them applaud. Well, congratulations 
to that party and the solidarity it shows behind its ideology and 
its ideas about how this country should act and look.
<P>
	On the position of history, like my colleagues in this House I 
am privileged to serve my constituents. I am privileged to serve 
the constituents of Hamilton West. They know Stan Keyes. They 
know what he stands for. They know what he has no tolerance 
for. They know his deeply held beliefs, his deeply held 
convictions.
<P>
<B>(1150 ) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member opposite is sadly mistaken if she thinks I or 
anyone else on this side of the House can be blindly led. If I 
supported a government objective that went against any of my 
well known principles I would be laughed out of this office, out 
of this House, out of this job. I remind the member for 
Mission-Coquitlam that I was re-elected.
<P>
	The third point was the issue of freer voting. Since the 
opening of the 35th Parliament Reform MPs have repeatedly 
called upon the government to accept the doctrine that ``the 
government not consider the defeat of a government motion 
including a spending measure to constitute an expression of 
non-confidence in the government, unless it is immediately 
followed by the passage of a formal non-confidence motion''.
<P>
	This is directly related to the Reform Party's desire to see 
increased direct democracy within the Canadian federal system. 
Reform has long argued that direct democracy is manifested 
through citizens initiatives, binding referenda, a recall 
mechanism and free votes in the House of Commons. Let us look 
at that for a second.
<P>
	This weekend the hon. member's party, the third party of this 
House, tried a little experiment in direct democracy. According 
to an Ottawa newspaper: ``Reform leader Preston Manning 
learned democracy does not always go as planned when a 
majority of people watching a televised town hall meeting last 
night voted in favour of allowing doctor assisted suicides. To 
quote Mr. Manning, care has to be exercised in making a 
simplistic interpretation of the results''.
<P>
	Well what about the simplistic, shallow, minimal amount of 
time presented by both sides of that argument. It is very easy to 
get on national television to present arguments pro and con on 
any matter and then ask everyone on the basis of those 
arguments to phone in, if they can afford to have a touchtone 
phone and there are many Canadians who cannot. That process 
shuts out how many Canadians who either cannot afford to have 
a phone or have a dial phone so they cannot participate in that 
party's direct democracy. Then a decision is made based on 
those arguments by dialling whatever number for whatever 
decision a person wants to make, yes or no, right or wrong, pro 
or con.
<P>
	How does one prevent the process of stacking in such a 
process? We know what stacking is. Some of us here in this 
House went through the abortion debate. Stacking means the 
ability of one organization to overcome the organization 
through organization. It is the ability to put the process together 
better than the other guy because maybe they have more money 
than the other guy. This is where the faultlines and cracks are in 
this party's ideas.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3135"> 3135 </A></B>
<P>
	Is the decision that will be made by the caller on the particular 
weekend based on all the facts presented to them? Or has that 
decision been made as a result of what could be a very moving, a 
very powerful statement made by one individual over another?
<P>
	We have heard some of the debate in this House. Some of the 
members have the most powerful arguments, the most powerful 
delivery. If we get into a passionate subject where life or death is 
involved we know what kind of arguments can be put forward. 
Because one is presented more passionately than the other, does 
that make that argument the right one and there can be no other 
conclusion but to vote for that particular person's point of view? 
``I will not even hear the other side. That guy was so good I am 
voting yes'', or ``I am voting no''. It is a dangerous policy.
<P>
<B>(1155 ) </B>
<P>
	To secure freer votes Reform would release the government 
from demonstrating that it retains the confidence of the House 
except for those occasions when the House is asked to express 
itself on a formal confidence motion. Members in turn would be 
able to vote as they choose on any given issue secure in the 
knowledge they would not be subject to party discipline.
<P>
	According to Reform these two practices would allow 
members to better represent their constituents, particularly 
when issues arise where constituents clearly indicate they do not 
support the member's party's position on that issue.
<P>
	In the leader of the Reform Party's point of view when 
confronted with such a situation that member's choice is clear: 
``If push comes to shove in my view'', says Mr. Manning, ``the 
will of the constituents will prevail over my personal view or my 
party's view''. Mr. Manning however then goes on to say: ``I am 
not talking about turning members into a voting machine where 
all they do is go home on the weekend, count noses and come 
back here and stick up their hands. The relationship between a 
member and his constituents has to be one of dialogue''.
<P>
	Both the Prime Minister and our government House leader 
have indicated the government's desire to see more free votes in 
the House. What we have not done is to accept the Reform's 
interpretation of free votes. While not rejecting Reform's view 
completely, the Prime Minister and government House leader 
both have argued there are valid and longstanding reasons for 
the government to approach confidence from a more 
comprehensive perspective.
<P>
	The Prime Minister for example has referred to the mandate 
given the House in the recent election: ``This House is not a 
group of independents who have been elected on their own. We 
too are members of a party and we had a program. It is the red 
book and it will be implemented''.
<P>
	That is what we stand for here as a group. It is not the 
individual vote; it is the collective. It is the understanding of 
what we believe to be in the best interests of our  constituents, of 
our riding, of our province, of our country. That is what we are 
doing here.
<P>
	This motion cannot be allowed to undermine that Canadian 
democratic process. I am sure the people who elected me would 
not approve.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
when talking about freer votes in this debate it is important to 
keep in mind the fact that when the pendulum swings it does not 
always have to swing to either extreme.
<P>
	What we are looking for in this Parliament and the single 
factor that would probably distinguish this Parliament thus far 
from the last Parliament, is that there is a great deal more 
balance. The government has gone out of its way to try to 
provide that balance and provide input in government from 
opposition and from the Liberal backbenches as well.
<P>
	I am reminded particularly of the opening days of this session. 
So many of us were brand new to this House. We were very 
nervous about what we were doing, myself included. We had the 
opportunity to engage in a couple of very important debates over 
quite a few days. It gave us the sense of belonging and 
participating and an opportunity to actually do something.
<P>
	Here we are with this notion of freer votes. Before we talk 
about the mechanics of exactly what free votes or freer votes 
are, we should look at a couple of things. One would be our 
party's history in this House.
<P>
	As the hon. member who spoke to this motion just a moment 
ago so rightly pointed out, it is somewhat paradoxical that we 
are talking about the need for freer votes yet since we have been 
in this House all of us have voted together.
<P>
	Basically all of us voted together from all parties. That has to 
be because we were all elected on the particular platforms with 
the particular ideology we were promoting. It is only reasonable 
to assume we would follow through as our ideology was 
presented in Parliament and vote according to however it was we 
said we would when we were elected.
<P>
<B>(1200 ) </B>
<P>
	It is interesting also, in conversation with others who have 
been in this House much longer than I, that very often a vote 
when in opposition is opposed. The role of opposition is to 
oppose the government, to be a check and balance to 
government to try and ensure that government thinks through all 
of its policies.
<P>
	This government has a very substantial majority and that 
substantial majority flows through to the committees. The 
essence of this place is that we as members of Parliament have 
the ability to try, as others have said before, to influence the way 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3136"> 3136 </A></B>
<P>
government would think about its agenda. However, the reality 
is that the government agenda is the agenda that will come 
through this House.
<P>
	What we are talking about is not to change things 100 per cent, 
but merely to create the atmosphere in which members feel free 
to exercise their own independent best judgment, not just in the 
House but in committee. Even more important is before it gets to 
committee, when it is still a germ of an idea in someone's head, 
when the formulation of policy is put together, before we get all 
the political capital organized in a particular mode of action so 
that if that course of action is changed in any way it becomes a 
vote of confidence in the government or in the person who 
initiated the action.
<P>
	That is what has us in this position today as a nation. It does 
not matter whether all of us are 100 per cent right all of the time, 
because we are not. That is the beauty of this place. There are 
295 members here and the collective judgment and wisdom of 
all of us here today is infinitely better than the individual 
wisdom of the smartest and most intelligent among us.
<P>
	We find ourselves in a situation in which in this Parliament or 
in business if the leader happens to come up with an idea or says 
something that seemed like a good idea at the time we all scurry 
about trying to justify whatever the leadership or the leader or a 
particular person might have said, even if it is a slip of the 
tongue. God help us, we cannot in any way endanger this person 
by saying that if this person is not 100 per cent right all the time 
then perhaps this person does not have the ability to lead.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that is true of any particular party. That is 
just as true in our party. We have to be careful and we have to 
guard against that. This is human nature. It happens in business, 
it happens in politics and it happens everywhere.
<P>
	The real job of all of us is to question and to say to the 
leadership: ``Do you really think that is what we should be 
doing? I know we started out on this and perhaps the bill is in 
second reading already, but do you not think it might be a good 
idea if we changed it?''. I guess that is what we want, the 
flexibility, the wisdom and the freedom to change and learn as 
we go along.
<P>
	Our experience here has been kind of fun because we have 
been talking about freer votes and when the votes come up 
members opposite watch to see who among us is going to be the 
first not to vote along the party line. We are looking forward to 
being the first not to vote along the party line because we know 
that sooner or later we are going to have to otherwise certain 
members are never going to give us peace. We are going to do it 
sooner or later somehow.
<P>
	However, the reality is that we have to follow the principles 
that got us elected in the first place. We gain from experience. I 
am gaining from experience as we go along. I am certainly not 
shy to admit the fact that many of the preconceived ideas that I 
had about how this place worked I have changed since I arrived 
here. I see how this place works and I am learning every day, as 
we all are.
<P>
<B>(1205 ) </B>
<P>
	I would like to conclude my comments by quoting someone I 
think is of particular value to this House and whom we might all 
keep in mind as we go into the future. There are two people 
whose names are brought up many times in this House. One is 
the famous Edmund Burke. In Edmund Burke's letter to the 
electors of Bristol he pretty much debunks the whole notion of 
representative democracy. He was in support of delegate 
democracy through which once every election the electors 
decide who they are going to vote for and they vote for that 
person and for better or worse that person ends up in Parliament 
and they get their next crack at him four years hence.
<P>
	Members opposite would know that this famous letter to the 
electors of Bristol was written in 1776 or thereabouts and had to 
do with the treatment of the British patriots, the sailors who 
were called pirates. They were captured, taken to England and 
held there for three years, given a fair trial and hanged. He did 
not think that was a good idea and said so. His electors thought it 
was a good idea and they said so. He wrote the letter to the 
electors of Bristol saying: ``You not only have my body, you 
have my mind. If you do not like what I am doing turf me at the 
end of my term''.
<P>
	Interestingly, they did turf him at the end of that term and he 
went on to be re-elected in a rotten borough.
<P>
	The other person, a contemporary of his, was Thomas Paine. 
Thomas Paine was the adviser to Thomas Jefferson and helped 
to frame the famous Declaration of Independence. He wrote in 
his work <I>The Rights of Man</I> that the greatest tyranny of all is the 
tyranny of the presumption of ruling beyond the grave, and that 
each generation has the right and the responsibility to govern for 
its times and should not bind any future generation to its 
decisions any more than this generation should be bound by 
decisions made by past generations.
<P>
	I would ask that as this debate unfolds we consider that our 
generation and this Parliament are setting the foundation upon 
which future parliaments will base decisions. If we can relax the 
rules of discipline it would be for the benefit of all Parliament 
and all parliamentarians and we need not be concerned about 
going all in one direction or another.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I have two minutes so I shall try to be very effective.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3137"> 3137 </A></B>
<P>
	I believe that the motion is well intentioned but it does 
contain a number of flaws. As a result of that I cannot possibly 
support it.
<P>
	Let me raise a few of those points because this does raise some 
very important questions. For example, in one of the comments 
there was a statement that the government's agenda is coming 
through. Of course the government's agenda is coming through. 
It must, it has a majority, it has a moral responsibility for 
making absolutely sure that what it says it will do and the way it 
interprets that will be carried out.
<P>
	There is a suggestion that direct democracy is important and I 
think most of us would agree that it is. We must make awfully 
certain that direct democracy does not replace the judgments 
that we have to make as duly elected members of Parliament.
<P>
	One can see the danger. For example, the opposition party that 
brought forward this motion had direct involvement recently, 
last night, on direct democracy. The leader said that perhaps he 
would support this and needs to check this out to make sure it is 
not flawed. That is another flaw.
<P>
	The other thing is when we start changing something like a 
budget we know that if we change one part there are 
repercussions for other parts. We simply cannot unravel one 
little part without considering the implications for the other.
<P>
	I may have time for a final point. I am a little worried that this 
could lead to ransom by a minority group.
<P>

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan)</B> moved:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) amend the Official Languages Act to reflect the philosophy of ``territorial 
bilingualism'', which holds that French should be the predominant language of 
Quebec and English the predominant language of the other provinces, and that 
federal government services should be available to official language minorities in 
their own language in any part of the country where there is demonstrable local 
public demand;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) continue to facilitate the use of English or French in the debates and other 
proceedings of Parliament, in the records and journals of Parliament, in federal 
courts, and as the languages of federal legislation; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) refrain from expending monies on those aspects of language which fall under the 
sole jurisdiction of the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	He said: Mr. Speaker, in making this motion, before we get 
started I would really like to get the attention of everyone whose 
minds are already made up.
<P>
	There will be a lot of automation out there saying if a 
Reformer is getting up and talking on the Official Languages 
Act it has to be bad. The Official Languages Act is not working 
well. Whether one favours it and carte blanche says it has to be 
good or whether one says maybe it really should be changed, 
please give a listen to what we are going to say here. Do not 
prejudge it. Let us go along with the lines of what is good for 
Canada and what is good for Canadians.
<P>
	My basic premise here today is that the Official Languages 
Act has not been working well. It is divisive for us as a country 
and it is too expensive. It is not just this member for 
Nanaimo-Cowichan saying so, each and every commissioner 
has had problems with it. So has the Royal Commission on 
Bilingualism and Biculturalism. So have people across the 
country. So has the Bloc Quebecois and so have les gens de 
Québec, ainsi que les gens de la Colombie-Britannique. We 
have all had problems with it. What are we going to do about it?
<P>
	Listen to the debate this afternoon and as you are doing so I 
ask you to please put your own minds in gear and ask how we can 
do it better.
<P>
	Let us go back in history and I hope to paint you the picture-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Would the hon. member please put his 
comments to the Chair. Please try not to use the word ``you''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will try mightily to do that.
<P>
	Let us collectively look at history and ask how we can 
improve things. In 1608 New France was founded by 
Champlain. In 1752 Acadia was conquered by the British and 
therein was the first and most horrid example of linguistic 
intolerance. As soon as the Brits conquered Acadia they kicked 
out all the Acadians. They said: ``We do not need your language. 
We do not need you-out''. That is the worse case we have had. 
Maybe in one sense historically we have improved things, at 
least from that point.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	In 1759 New France was conquered. By the standards of that 
day, the Brits really made some improvement. They said: ``Fine, 
there will be a tolerance not only of the French language but of 
the religion''. Let us remember in historical perspective that 
religion has been part of the language equation.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3138"> 3138 </A></B>
<P>
	Moving on to 1774, we had the Quebec Act which confirmed 
the rights of French-speaking people and catholics. In 1791 we 
had the constitutional act which created a legislature for Lower 
Canada. Because French became the language of legislation, 
francophones essentially became politically active for the first 
time.
<P>
	Between 1820 and 1840 we started to have problems again. 
The rapidly rising English-speaking minority worried the 
French dominated assembly in Lower Canada. As a result, they 
adopted a series of intolerant laws regarding the districts and the 
eastern townships, denied them representation and invoked a 
head tax on immigrants from Britain.
<P>
	Between 1837 and 1838 we had real problems, including a bit 
of open rebellion and almost warfare. It is important to note that 
from 1840 to 1880, as the proportion of English speaking and 
French speaking people balanced, people felt a little more 
secure. Things quietened down nicely in those 40 years up to 
1880.
<P>
	It allowed the British North America Act to be passed in 1867. 
So quiet were things that the BNA Act was hardly mentioned at 
all. People were comfortable with it. It did of course guarantee 
in section 133 that both languages would be used in Parliament, 
the Quebec legislature and in laws.
<P>
	I am trying to paint a picture of the see-saw of what has been 
happening in Canada and the emotions that went with it. From 
1880 to 1920, the proportion of French speaking people in 
Canada and catholics-we might as well put in-started to rise 
thus sparking fears in English Canada and among the protestants 
that their status would be reduced to a minority position.
<P>
	As a result, one province after another adopted laws that were 
restrictive of the educational rights of francophones and 
catholics; New Brunswick in 1871, P.E.I. in 1874, Manitoba in 
1890 and again in 1916 and Ontario in 1912. Here we can speak 
with shame. Regulation 17 in 1912 was the most restrictive 
educational law in Canadian history. It made it unlawful for any 
francophone child to be educated in his own language beyond 
grade three. That is bad news but it illustrates that pendulum 
swing.
<P>
	Where were we after that? From 1920 to 1960, once again that 
stability was achieved. There was stability in the language 
environment. What did we see in Quebec in 1963? We saw rising 
nationalism. All right? There is going to be a reaction to that. 
Lester Pearson therefore established the royal commission on 
bilingualism, the B and B commission. It filed six volumes up 
until the year 1971.
<P>
	That commission endorsed territorial bilingualism which I 
will address in detail in a few minutes. Territorial bilingualism 
is really a compromise between the territorial principle and the 
personality principle. Incidentally the findings of that 
commission were essentially compatible with Reform 
principles as we espouse them officially today.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	The spirit of thought of that commission is in this quote: ``A 
bilingual country is not one where all inhabitants necessarily 
have to speak two languages. Rather it is a country where all 
principal public and private institutions must provide service in 
two languages to citizens, the majority of whom may very well 
be unilingual''. Think on that. It is not bad.
<P>
	In 1969 the first Official Languages Act was passed. That is 
what we are critiquing today. Twenty-five years later there is 
unhappiness with it.
<P>
	This Official Languages Act favours the personality principle 
in which individual minority language rights are to be extended 
as widely as is politically feasible with the result that onerous 
obligation to respect these rights are placed on the majority 
populations and, of course, particularly on taxpayers.
<P>
	It is clear that in passing that act Pierre Trudeau did what he 
believed to be a just and generous gesture. He repeatedly states 
that the law's goals of justice and national unity are inseparable. 
One can understand that. But Trudeau's technocratic view of 
society is also built into the act, one of its key features being the 
creation of a supreme language bureaucrat, the Commissioner of 
Official Languages. That was 1969.
<P>
	In 1972 Quebec, fearful that its French language was in 
decline, said it had better pass a law. That was bill 22, the 
Official Language Act for Quebec.
<P>
	In 1977 the Levesque government passed bill 101. These are 
now getting to be famous or infamous in this country, bill 22 and 
bill 101.
<P>
	We go from there to 1982. This is a very important date as well 
in that the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms gave 
recourse to those offended by bill 22 and bill 101 and allowed 
them to appeal the injustice, shall we call it that, of the Quebec 
legislation.
<P>
	In 1988, finally the Mulroney government rescinded the old 
Official Languages Act and introduced a new one, the current 
one, which somewhat extends the scope of official bilingualism 
and in fact perhaps to too great a degree.
<P>
	I would like now to define territorial bilingualism because 
this is really what we are talking about here. It is a compromise 
position between the legitimate desires and concerns of 
linguistic minorities and the legitimate concerns of linguistic 
majorities. It is one of four distinct and clearly articulated 
philosophies designed to bring justice to the matter of language 
policy.
<P>
	These policies are, first, the personality principle. This is 
really the one championed by Pierre Trudeau. He believed that 
the key to a just system is that all individuals wherever they 
might be located in the country have the right to communicate 
and receive services from the government in their preferred 
official language. That is what we are trying to put in place in 
Canada today. We say it is not working and cannot be afforded.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3139"> 3139 </A></B>
<P>
	The next principle is the territorial principle which should not 
be confused with territorial bilingualism which we will come to.
<P>
	The territorial principle holds that language rights should be 
territorial and non-portable in nature. In the case of Canada it 
means that everyone living in Quebec should be expected to live 
and work in French and everyone in the other nine provinces 
should be expected to live and work in English.
<P>
<B>(1225 ) </B>
<P>
	This principle has been successfully implemented in 
Switzerland but it will not work in Canada because our minority 
populations in Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario are so much 
larger than in Switzerland.
<P>
	Next we hit territorial bilingualism, not the territorial 
principle but territorial bilingualism. As I said, it was first 
proposed by the royal commission on B and B, since adopted by 
the Reform Party. It is essentially a compromise between the 
extremes of territorial and personality principles.
<P>
	Under this model, language rights and minority language 
services would be extended only to those minorities large 
enough to survive over the long term. Smaller minorities would 
not receive full rights on the basis that the burden imposed on 
the majority population, which has to foot the bill for all of this, 
outweighs the benefit being received by the minority.
<P>
	This model has been successfully employed in Finland in 
dealing with its Swedish-speaking minority. If practised in 
Canada the model would extend full minority language rights to 
the large francophone communities in eastern and northeastern 
Ontario, to the Acadians of New Brunswick, as well as to the 
anglophone community of west end Montreal. The rest of the 
country would be unilingual.
<P>
	The fourth principle or style of language policy is what we 
might call asymmetrical bilingualism advocated by the Bloc 
Quebecois which calls for full and generous language rights to 
be extended to francophones living outside Quebec and very few 
rights to be extended to anglophones living inside Quebec.
<P>
	The logic of this asymmetry is that French is in danger of 
extinction in Canada and can only survive on an equal footing 
with English if it receives preferential legal treatment. Most 
English Canadians find it unbelievable that someone would 
actually advocate such a position. Nonetheless, it is genuinely 
believed by many to be the only true and just language policy.
<P>
	There we are. We have a situation that has hurt Canada and 
that we must collectively address. I leave it to this House to 
listen closely to the ensuing speakers. Be critical of yourselves, 
be critical of us, but at the same time be positive. What can we 
do to be just and furnish proper services to everyone across the 
country where the numbers warrant? Where numbers warrant is 
a little buzz phrase that is fought with difficulty. I think on that  
one we have to get down to brass tacks and put numbers on it and 
say: ``This is where the numbers warrant and this is what we can 
afford or we cannot afford''.
<P>
	We must address all those points. I would ask the House to 
think in positive terms as we go through the speeches that 
follow. We must think about our history which I have gone to 
some length to expand. It really has been a back and a forth. One 
group gets stronger and the other group gets afraid and starts 
putting in restrictive legislation. This is not good news. Let us 
try and balance it out and be together.
<P>
	That is all, Mr. Speaker. I would ask everyone, you and others, 
to consider seriously the adoption of this motion to amend the 
official languages to reflect the philosophy of territorial 
bilingualism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, thank you for this opportunity to comment on this 
motion. I have met the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan 
and I have always found him to be a reasonable person, that is 
until today.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	Today, I find the hon. member for Nanaimo-Cowichan to be 
far from reasonable. I feel great disdain for someone who seems 
to want to destroy our country, or distort its long history.
<P>
	As a fourth generation Franco-Ontarian and as a member of a 
minority, I find the Reform member's comments abhorrent. To 
him, language is a financial question, or at least that is what he 
claims. He seems to be suggesting that majority groups should 
trample on minorities. He speaks of the French language in 
Quebec and of the English language everywhere else.
<P>
	What can francophones outside Quebec aspire to? How can 
they live in our country, a country that Mr. Ringma, or his 
parents, probably adopted some time ago? How can they live 
here? How should I respond to a Reform member's surreptitious 
attack on my language, considering that the Bellemare family 
has been in this country since the 17th or 18th century and that 
my ancestors fought first for France, and later for Great Britain, 
and defended Canadian institutions of British origin? 
French-speaking Canadians fought in both world wars. They 
fought against the United States to protect their country. We 
want to be a part of Canada, but the Reform member feels that 
we are not entitled to belong, unless we agree to be assimilated 
and become, as in my case, an anglophone.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3140"> 3140 </A></B>
<P>
	The hon. member spoke of generosity. Does he really 
understand the meaning of the word? Does he really know what 
he is talking about when he speaks of education within and 
outside Quebec? Does he truly understand this country? He 
compares Canada to Switzerland and Belgium. Again, does he 
really understand our country?
<P>
	Since I will be speaking on this issue a little later, I will 
conclude by saying that the Reform member should not have 
worn a dark suit to address this House today, but rather a white 
sheet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find that really sad. It is damn 
sad. Right at the beginning, I tried to explain it to people, but 
they have to listen. I said what we are proposing. Obviously, 
some members did not listen at all and then they attack me, 
saying that I want to destroy Canada. That is an insult. I must 
also say that it is awful, what they are saying to the effect that I 
am attacking the French language. That is false.
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	I challenge you, Mr. Speaker, and those who did not hear what 
I said to find those words. When you read <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow, or 
even the blues this afternoon, you will see that we are making an 
effort to keep Canada united, to preserve the rights of 
francophones and the rights of anglophones in Quebec. We want 
everyone to keep their rights, but we do not want it to cost us too 
much.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean Landry (Lotbinière):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to 
ask a question. How do members of the Reform Party explain the 
economic decline of francophones outside Quebec and what 
policy do they propose to reduce the gap?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is very hard for me to explain 
why francophones' standard of living is falling; I am not an 
economist and I do not know the reason. It is all a question of 
money.
<P>
	Perhaps it is because our economy is in decline and in a very 
precarious situation now. Foreign governments look at the 
situation in Canada and think that there is probably a problem 
between Quebec and the rest of Canada. Also, Quebec is 
considered to be too hard on anglophones. A lot of money is 
going out now, the economy is suffering and Quebec too, I 
suppose.
<P>
	That is all I can give as an explanation for that question.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened very closely to the hon. member and I am 
afraid what he proposed is not very clear.
<P>
	If I understand correctly he rejected a territorial language 
policy which would have all of Quebec French and the rest of the 
provinces all English. He seemed to propose a territorial 
bilingualism in which he said he would accept the extension of 
the provisions of the Official Languages Act to the minorities in 
eastern and  northern Ontario, into northeastern New Brunswick 
and into the west island of Montreal and that there would be 
unilingualism for the rest of the country.
<P>
	If I understood him correctly, he was rejecting official 
bilingualism for any part of the west, including Manitoba. He 
was rejecting it for the eastern townships where I lived as a child 
in Sherbrooke and have roots. He was rejecting it for the Gaspé. 
He was rejecting it for the Outaouais, Aylmer and Papineau 
county and so on. Is this what I understand?
<P>
	If that is what he is proposing, it is not as bad as the 
territorialism which would have all the provinces English 
except Quebec, but it approaches that. I want to be absolutely 
clear in what he is proposing. ``Where numbers warrant'' seem 
to be exceptionally large ``warrants'', leaving out francophone 
minorities in different parts of the country and anglophone 
minorities in Quebec where they have had long historical roots. I 
think particularly of the Gaspé and the eastern townships.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to address the 
question which is a very legitimate one.
<P>
	The examples I used were just that. They were examples and 
were not meant to throw away the St. Boniface area of Winnipeg 
or the Gaspé or Aylmer or anything of the sort. It was illustrative 
of the sort of the territorial bilingualism that we should discuss 
in detail.
<P>
	The critical matter, and the hon. member mentioned it, is the 
phrase ``where numbers warrant''. That is what is in the act 
today and that is the matter that is giving us such problems. For 
example we could adopt the policy of the Canadian Association 
of Municipalities which puts a number on it. It says either 10 per 
cent or 5 per cent and one can go from there. If the phrase 
``where numbers warrant'' is inadequate, let us put numbers on 
it and let us collectively agree where we will provide minority 
language rights.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, just as the importance of official languages is being 
questioned in this House, I am happy to have this opportunity to 
clear up some misunderstandings and set the record straight. 
Official languages issues have always been sensitive. They 
arouse passion, give rise to rumours and myths and are very 
seldom approached in a rational manner. Today I would like to 
set the record straight on official languages and contribute a few 
thoughts to the debate.
<P>
	If I may, I would like to start by giving some historical 
background in order to establish the basic principles behind the 
Canadian policy on official languages. Official languages in 
Canada are rooted in both the past and the present. Since French 
and English have been evolving side by side for several 
centuries, the Official Languages Act and the policy underlying 
it do not in themselves  represent a new concept, but show the 
high 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3141"> 3141 </A></B>
<P>
regard in which the Fathers of Confederation held the notion of 
association.
<P>
	In fact, the foundation of the official languages concept dates 
back to the birth of this country. In 1867, considering this notion 
as essential to the survival of Confederation, our forefathers 
passed the Constitution Act whose Section 133 recognizes 
everyone's right to use French or English in the debates, acts, 
records and journals of the Parliament of Canada and the 
legislature of Quebec, as well as before any Canadian or Quebec 
court.
<P>
	I should point out that the current policy on official languages 
is based on this legislative framework.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Provision for the payment of a bonus to candidates who could 
write in both of Canada's official languages was first made in 
the act amending the Civil Service Act in 1888. This 
bilingualism bonus, which is still paid today to employees 
whose position requires knowledge of both official languages, is 
received by only 30 per cent of public servants. Most employees 
of the public service are not bilingual and do not automatically 
have to become so to have access to other jobs, contrary to 
popular belief.
<P>
	By the end of the 1800s the key federal institutions gradually 
began to reflect the linguistic duality of the country. In the 
provinces however the situation was quite different, particularly 
where education was concerned. Although the language 
question initially was not particularly controversial, the open 
mindedness displayed by the federal public service toward the 
official languages does not seem to have extended to the 
provinces.
<P>
	The politicians of the day did not show the same wisdom as 
the Fathers of Confederation and did not respect the spirit of 
Confederation in language and education, a situation that the 
minority French speaking communities would denounce and 
would later try to remedy.
<P>
	In 1927-I mention this in passing-the first bilingual 
postage stamps were issued to mark the 60th anniversary of 
Confederation and this practice would subsequently become 
standard.
<P>
<B>(1245 ) </B>
<P>
	The federal government translation bureau was established in 
1934 and was to change the face of the Public Service of Canada. 
However, official acceptance of the general principle that every 
citizen should have the right to receive federal services in the 
language of his or her choice and that the federal public service 
should reflect the makeup of Canadian society came only in the 
1960s with the Heeney report and the report of the Royal 
Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism 
was a turning point for official languages.  It noted that Canada 
was undergoing the most severe crisis in its history. So, it 
recommended among other things that governments contribute 
to the development of official languages minority groups and 
that the civil service be bilingual with regard to both provision 
of services and language of work.
<P>
	Following up on the royal commission's recommendations, 
the government of the day adopted the Official Languages Act in 
1969, thereby making French and English the official languages 
of Canada.
<P>
	I would like to stress one point at this time, especially after 
hearing remarks made by our colleagues from the Reform Party.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	This act did not seek to make all Canadians bilingual. Its main 
objective was to establish the equality of status of English and 
French in the public service. It provided for the delivery of 
services in both languages so that the government could better 
understand and be better understood by the public. Whatever 
may be said, this is still the case today. No one wants to force 
any member of the public to speak both English and French.
<P>
	The progress made possible by the passage of the Official 
Languages Act did not come without some difficulties along the 
way, but it proved to be very positive. Francophones have been 
the first to benefit from the act. It declared that the official 
languages, French and English, are the very essence of our 
identity as Canadians and that it is important to promote their 
development in all the provinces and territories of the country. 
This to my mind represents unprecedented progress.
<P>
	After its adoption in 1969 the Official Languages Act 
gathered ground in the provinces. That same year New 
Brunswick declared itself officially bilingual in a unanimous 
resolution. We are now at the 25th anniversary.
<P>
	A few years later other provinces followed suit. They relaxed 
their legislation and gave back to French speaking Canadians 
the right to education in their language, something that had been 
prohibited at the turn of the century as I mentioned earlier, 
notably in Manitoba.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	During the seventies, Canadians showed a growing desire to 
live in an open and tolerant society, a society concerned with 
allowing individuals to live in their own culture and language. 
Young people, for instance, proved to be increasingly interested 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3142"> 3142 </A></B>
<P>
in second language training, which they considered as 
expanding their personal and cultural horizons.
<P>
	This wind of change blowing across the country made it 
possible to take the promotion of official languages a step 
further. So, in 1982, the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms enshrined the official status of the French and English 
languages in the Constitution. Section 23 recognized the right to 
receive primary and secondary school instruction in the 
language of the minority where-as pointed out 
earlier-numbers warranted. To this day, this represents one of 
the most valuable gains made by linguistic communities which 
perceive education as the best way to ensure their development.
<P>
	The purpose of that section was to redress historical injustices 
French-speaking minorities had suffered in certain provinces.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Following the promulgation of the charter however many 
questions were raised. What was meant by ``where the numbers 
warrant?'' Did it mean that official language communities had 
the right to manage their own schools? What was the actual 
scope of section 23? French speaking parents turned to the 
courts to find the answers to their questions. From then on the 
management of schools became their rallying cry.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	In the wake of the charter the federal government decided to 
update the Official Languages Act in 1988. It conferred on the 
secretary of state the mandate to foster the development and 
vitality of minority official languages communities and to 
promote the use of French and English in Canadian society. This 
mandate is now my responsibility as Minister of Canadian 
Heritage.
<P>
	During the same period the decision by the Supreme Court 
confirmed the right of francophones to manage their own 
schools. Yet despite the clear decision of the Supreme Court the 
constant pressure of French speaking communities and the 
repeated offers of support by the federal government, several 
provinces were slow to take action to respect their constitutional 
obligations.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	In order to foster dialogue and encourage provinces, which 
assume responsibility for education, to do something regarding 
the teaching of the French language, the federal government 
adopted concrete measures to support the implementation of 
school management and post-secondary education in French.
<P>
	This initiative resulted, among other things, in the 
implementation of several management projects across the 
country, as well as in the setting up of the community college 
network, something which was long-awaited by Ontario 
francophones.
<P>
	Moreover, in spite of the fact that we are going through a 
difficult economic period, the Canadian government has 
decided to spare school management from the recent budget cuts 
so that, at last, school boards can get down to business.
<P>
	We hope that the management of French-language schools by 
francophones will soon become a reality and we are working 
hard to that end.
<P>
	We made significant progress regarding the promotion, 
spreading and teaching official languages, and this includes the 
legal recognition of their status.
<P>
	This is not the time to back off, because there is still a lot to 
do. Minorities are always vulnerable, but minorities speaking 
one of the official languages within each province make an 
essential contribution to our identity and our national unity, and 
they deserve the government's support.
<P>
	The Department of Canadian Heritage subsidizes 350 groups 
which work to promote official language communities in our 
country. These groups provide direct support to the 
communities and form dynamic organizations within our 
society.
<P>
	In co-operation with the federal government, these groups are 
active in almost every field, including literacy, the economy 
and, of course, education.
<P>
	Under co-operation agreements signed with each province 
and each territory, the federal government also helps these 
jurisdictions to provide education in the language of their 
minority.
<P>
	This co-operation translates, for example, into the 
construction of new educational institutions for francophones, 
such as the Cité collégiale, in Ottawa, and the École de droit at 
l'Université de Moncton, as well as the development of new 
teaching programs in French and the setting up of independent 
school boards.
<P>
	It must be pointed out that, without the federal government's 
support in the field of education, provinces would have to 
absorb all the costs related to such initiatives.
<P>
	Moreover, federal funding helps over 2.7 million students 
learn French or English as a second language, including 300,000 
students enrolled in French immersion.
<P>
	Surveys even show that three out of four Canadians want their 
children to learn French or English as a second language.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Why do so many Canadian parents and children want to learn 
the second language while here we are discussing the relevance 
of promoting official languages in the country? They do so 
because they see a definite advantage to be gained. During a 
period of economic change countries simply cannot isolate 
themselves and linguistic duality is an undeniable strength.

<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	Having worked in the world of diplomacy and international 
relations I can assure you that questioning the whole official 
languages policy amounts to ignorance of today's world. 
Markets are joining together to form large economic units that 
will in the future set the rules of the game. Developments in 
information technology such as satellite rebroadcasting have 
radically altered the concept of space and time.
<P>
	The success of our country is closely linked to our ability to 
communicate in the languages and appreciate the cultures of 
other people. In a world where an estimated 6,000 languages are 
spoken in some 200 countries, Canada is not alone in having 
more than one official language. Having two world-class 
official languages can only be of net advantage to us because no 
fewer than 25 of those countries have French as an official 
language and 33 English.
<P>
	Apart from being personally enriching, knowing both official 
languages makes our country better able to build up commercial 
relations with various countries. It is no surprise that our main 
competitors such as Japan and Europe are attaching increasing 
importance to teaching second languages in their schools. They 
are making the change to a modern world. Should we not?
<P>
	The official languages question however is not solely 
confined to financial aspects. Linguistic duality is one of our 
fundamental characteristics as a society, as attested by our 
common history. Seeing that about 96 per cent of the population 
has French or English as its first language, no one can deny the 
coexistence of the two main languages in this country.
<P>
	At a time when spending is being cut some ask whether we 
should not simply abolish the official languages policy. Others 
persist in bringing up the cost of the official languages policy 
and do not pay attention to its true value.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	For my part, I am quite convinced that, more than ever, we 
must promote the use and promotion of both official languages 
and make sure that they are taught throughout Canada. The key 
to the development of any minority community, and our country 
as a whole, is education. All the efforts, energy and time spent 
by francophones to take control of their own schools must come 
to fruition.
<P>
	Through special measures regarding management and 
post-secondary education, we have made progress on issues of 
priority concern to francophones, and we intend to continue in 
that direction. We will work towards fostering the economic 
development of francophone communities, which will require 
the participation of other departments and agencies.
<P>
	I intend to call upon my colleagues to promote both official 
languages, which is part of my mandate as Minister of Canadian 
Heritage. We must renew our  partnership with official 
languages communities and revamp our approach. Finally, I am 
looking into exploring new and fairly novel avenues which 
would give these communities almost unlimited opportunities, 
not only internally, but also internationally; I am thinking, in 
particular, about the information highway and the whole field of 
telecommunications.
<P>
	Why not use the information highway to offer and diversify 
education services to francophones in remote areas? Could we 
not take advantage of this new technology to set up a 
French-language network for francophones, thus giving them 
their own electronic space? Those are questions I intend to 
explore with my colleagues and associates. I want to look at the 
future, and at how the official languages can contribute to the 
full development of Canada. But I am already convinced that 
having two official languages is an undeniable asset for our 
culture and our presence on the world scene.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre de Savoye (Portneuf):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party has put a motion before the House today, and for the 
benefit of our listeners, I would like to start by reading the 
motion and then comment on a number of aspects I feel are 
particularly important and which I think each and every one of 
us should give some serious thought. The motion reads as 
follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should:</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(a) amend the Official Languages Act to reflect the philosophy of ``territorial 
bilingualism'', which holds that French should be the predominant language of 
Quebec and English the predominant language of the other provinces, and that 
federal government services should be available to official language minorities in 
their own language in any part of the country where there is demonstrable local 
public demand;</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(b) continue to facilitate the use of English or French in the debates and other 
proceedings of Parliament, in the records and journals of Parliament, in federal 
courts, and as the languages of federal legislation; and</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(c) refrain from spending monies on those aspects of language which fall under the 
sole jurisdiction of the provinces.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Mr. Speaker, when this motion was presented by the Reform 
Party, the mover of the motion said, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-the Official Languages Act is not working well.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I agree with what he said. In fact, I believe the Commissioner 
of Official Languages himself pointed out that the legislation 
was not as effective as one would expect it to be.
<P>
	The hon. member for the Reform Party went on to say that this 
act-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3144"> 3144 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-is divisive and too expensive.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Well, we in Quebec do not feel that this act is particularly 
divisive or that it creates dissent. It is too bad the hon. member 
for the Reform Party seems to think there is a measure of dissent 
and divisiveness, and I suppose that later on he could perhaps 
explain how he arrived at this perception. He also said the 
Official Languages Act was too expensive.
<P>
	According to the Commissioner of Official Languages, this 
legislation costs 0.3 per cent of total federal spending. If less 
than one-third of 1 per cent is too expensive, how low must we 
go to meet the criteria of the hon. member for the Reform Party?
<P>
	At this point, I would also like to set the record straight on 
something that was said by the previous speaker. He referred to 
the ``asymmetrical bilingualism advocated by the Bloc 
Quebecois''. The position of the Bloc Quebecois is clear: 
bilingualism must be the rule in all federal institutions. There 
are also a number of obligations in this respect that must be met 
at the provincial level. However, neither the Bloc Quebecois nor 
any other party can influence the will of the provinces.
<P>
	Incidentally, I would like to draw your attention to the fact 
that today, New Brunswick is celebrating 25 years as a bilingual 
province.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> That's right!
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Thank you.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
	For all this bilingualism enjoyed in this country since 1969 
and all the goodwill in that respect, we must nevertheless realize 
-as the Commissioner of Official Languages indicated- that 
access to federal services in French has not always been 
satisfactory. Francophones outside Quebec should be able to 
receive services in their language not only from federal agencies 
but also from provincial ones. And that is where the shoe 
pinches.
<P>
	Let me quote Mr. Jean Dufresne who said, in an article 
published in <I>Le Journal de Montréal</I>: ``Mr. Goldbloom, who 
speaks his mind but at the same time shows a moderation fitting 
a man whose mastery of French I can only envy, acknowledges 
that federal services in French have deteriorated so much that, in 
certain regions, francophones do not even bother to complain 
any more. In British Columbia and the Prairies, for example, the 
number of complaints dropped by half last year. Mr. Goldbloom 
attributes this drop to the clients' frustration with the little 
progress made by various institutions.'' And he concluded by 
saying: ``Overall, not a very positive report.''
<P>
	I might add that problems exist not only in British Columbia 
and the Prairies. Last Sunday, in my riding, I met with Mr. 
Duval, from Cap-Santé, who showed me a  number of things, 
including UI cheque stubs. On these stubs, you can read:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-UI benefit statement, date 3003, 1994 from federal tax, 
Quebec tax, et cetera. It is all in English. This is in Cap-Santé 
for Mr. Duval.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Something is seriously wrong. The figures relating to 
bilingualism in the Public Service certainly make you wonder. 
Take the number of bilingual positions in Quebec for example. 
Excluding the National Capital Region, there are 15,500 
bilingual positions in the province, as compared to 39,500 in the 
National Capital Region and 8,800 in the rest of Canada. You 
will tell me that this is in line with the relative numbers of 
francophones and anglophones across Canada. That fact of the 
matter is that it is not.
<P>
	You see, with 900,000 anglophones in Quebec and, excluding 
the National Capital, there are 15,500 bilingual positions in the 
province. On the other hand, 968,000 francophones are living 
outside Quebec, that is to say 68,000 more than anglophones 
living in Quebec, and to serve all of them, there are only 8,800 
bilingual positions, that is a bit more than half the number found 
in Quebec. In other words, this means that francophones outside 
Quebec are entitled to only 57 per cent of the level of service 
provided to anglophones in Quebec. And I am not making this 
up. I am just quoting figures from the Commissioner of Official 
Languages' annual report.
<P>
	I would also like to mention this other finding by the 
commissioner. In Foreign Affairs, 44 per cent of francophones 
report using English as their written language of work and, 
according to 85 per cent of the sample of employees interviewed 
by the commissioner, meetings are held only or mostly in 
English. Bilingualism is not very well, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	In fact, given the figures I just gave you, we can see that the 
government's efforts to conceive and carry out bilingualism 
programs only work in Quebec. Simply put, we can see that a 
vast majority of bilingual positions in Canada are located in 
Quebec and the National Capital Region. Quebec and the 
National Capital Region account for 55,000 bilingual positions, 
compared with 8,800 in the rest of the country. Quebec is where 
bilingualism can be found.
<P>
	I would now like to move on to education.
<P>
	Education, as everyone knows, is a provincial jurisdiction 
and, although the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
provides for certain obligations with respect to minority 
language rights, we must realize that some provinces still lag 
behind.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3145"> 3145 </A></B>
<P>
	It is worth mentioning that these rights were made clearer by 
two Supreme Court decisions in 1990 and 1993. But these rights 
have been in the Charter for ten years now, and the provinces 
should have delivered the goods ten years ago.
<P>
	Nevertheless, francophones outside Quebec had to fight to 
have their rights recognized and we know that, at least in 
Ontario, the situation is still not settled or even very clear at this 
time.
<P>
	As for the three provinces that legislated in this field more 
recently-namely Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta-, I 
hope that, if it took them ten years to come up with a law in line 
with the Charter, it will not take another ten years for reality to 
reflect the spirit of the new legislation.
<P>
	A word on Ontario. The President of the French-Canadian 
Association of Ontario, Jean Tanguay, recently said that the 
Commissioner's report did not reflect the fact that his 
community is in a state of crisis. He went on to say that, 
unfortunately, the Government of Ontario continues to 
deliberately defy the law in matters of school management.
<P>
	The Liberal member for Ottawa-Vanier said essentially the 
same thing on the TVA network on March 23: ``We asked to 
manage our own schools because it goes hand in hand with 
normal management. We still do not have it in Ontario, in spite 
of continuously asking for it for 30 years.''
<P>
	Bilingualism in Canada is not well, not because of the law or 
the Charter but because there is resistance somewhere.
<P>
	I would like to point something out to the Reform speaker 
who, as he admitted himself, was unable to come up with a 
satisfactory answer to a question he was asked earlier about the 
wage gap between francophones and anglophones.
<P>
	We know that the income gap between francophones and 
anglophones keeps growing outside Quebec, while it has 
declined considerably in Quebec. So why is there a gap and why 
does it keep growing outside Quebec?
<P>
	Well, here is the answer. We can observe that it is partly due to 
the fact that francophone minorities do not control the 
management of their primary and secondary schools, because 
we know that education is one of the most important things for 
success in life. If our francophone minorities outside Quebec 
cannot have access to education in their mother tongue, they 
automatically lose the equal opportunity that their 
English-speaking fellow citizens have.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	The gap is not small. In 1977, it was 4.4 per cent in favour of 
anglophones. Not only did it not stay the same but it grew to 10.3 
per cent in 1992; that is a tragedy.
<P>
	I would also like to talk about a statement that the Hon. Prime 
Minister made in this House last week. Speaking of Quebec 
sovereigntists, our Prime Minister  said: ``When they have 
achieved their objective of separation, a million francophones 
will probably lose their language.'' That was a regrettable 
statement. Francophones do not have rights because Quebec 
exists. Francophones outside Quebec have rights that belong to 
them, irrespective of Quebec. These people, these 
French-speaking citizens, have their own culture that belongs to 
them and in no way depends on whether Quebec exists as a 
sovereign state or not. However, I see that some people are not 
able to appreciate the rights of these minorities.
<P>
	Believe me, Quebecers are very strong defenders of French 
culture in all of North America and especially in Canada from 
coast to coast and in all the provinces where these communities 
are established and have grown and developed over the years. 
They deserve to be supported by this government; more than 
deserve it, they are entitled to it.
<P>
	I will say that the sovereignist forces in Quebec have already 
announced a generous policy with respect to the anglophone 
minority. I also consider it unfortunate that the Commissioner of 
Official Languages believes that English Canada would 
eliminate the rights of French Canadians outside Quebec if 
Quebec became sovereign.
<P>
	At this time, you will understand that it is all the more 
important for Quebec to unconditionally support all the 
francophone minorities in the rest of Canada if the federal 
government abdicates its duty in this area.
<P>
	To conclude, I have a few questions for the Reform Party. If 
the present bilingualism policy were abolished, as the Reform 
Party proposes, what policies would that party propose so that 
francophones outside Quebec could enjoy the same rights, 
privileges, guarantees and respect that anglophones in Quebec 
have? Would they be in favour of francophones outside Quebec 
managing their own schools? What do they propose as an 
alternative to respect and support for francophone organizations 
outside Quebec if the government did not spend money on 
aspects of language policy that are within exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction?
<P>
	I have stated some facts, I have raised some issues, I believe 
that if the Reform Party wants to follow through to the end, it 
must do more than propose a notice of motion, it must propose a 
solution that respects all linguistic minorities in Canada, be they 
French or English.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, sometimes I find it hard to keep calm when I hear some 
of the comments being made across the floor.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3146"> 3146 </A></B>
<P>
	First of all, the hon. member claimed that, according to the 
report of the Commissioner of Official Languages, the Official 
Languages Act was not working. Nothing could be further from 
the truth.
<P>
	I am sure all Canadians watching the House of Commons on 
television today know the Commissioner of Official Languages 
is an ombudsman. It is his role to point out any shortcomings, 
which there always will be, in any society. It is his role to 
identify them. Not in order to condemn this government or the 
previous government or anyone at all, but to improve the 
system.
<P>
	Similarly, the hon. member opposite raises questions during 
Question Period not, I hope, to say that the people sitting on 
these benches are a terrible bunch, but to improve the system 
and make this Parliament more effective. Well, the 
Commissioner of Official Languages does the same thing, to 
improve the act and not to condemn it.
<P>
	Second, I wish the hon. member opposite would explain his 
calculations. First of all, he chose to discount public servants 
working in the National Capital Region as far as minority 
language services are concerned. Does he not know that in 
addition to the national role played by public servants in the 
National Capital area, these people also administer regional 
programs? For instance, half of all francophones in Ontario, 
perhaps as many as 150,000, live within a radius of about 100 
kilometres of this city outside Quebec. They are not served by 
regional offices in other locations, they are served by offices 
here in Ottawa. When the hon. member artificially excludes 
people who work in Ottawa, does he realize that he is skewing 
the figures?
<P>
	Finally, with respect to the future of francophones outside 
Quebec, one does not have to be a lawyer from Baie-Comeau to 
realize that there is more to this than protecting the rights of 
francophones, important though this may be. What has kept us 
alive as a group in this country is critical mass. I am a 
Franco-Ontarian, and personally I believe that in my country, 
Quebec has played a major role in helping my language survive. 
We must be realistic and look at the facts.
<P>
	The United States has no Quebec with its critical mass. Did 
the francophones there survive? No. The French fact is mere 
nostalgia in Louisiana and nothing at all in the rest of the United 
States, although originally there were more francophones in the 
United States than in Canada. Why? Because they did not have 
the critical mass or percentage. And that is what the Prime 
Minister means when he says that the francophones in Quebec 
are important to the survival of us all in Canada. Francophones 
in Quebec have helped to differentiate us from the Americans. 
We owe them that. We are a different country largely because of 
them. And anyone who says that we can take this out of Canada 
and everything will remain the same is wrong. Never mind about 
being politically correct. The truth is right there.
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will respond to this. First, I 
respect the cultural solidarity mentioned by the hon. member. 
However, I do not have much respect for his mathematical 
skills.
<P>
	Let us take his first argument. Indeed, Quebec is certainly, for 
French-speakers outside its borders, an important focal point, 
and it will continue to be unless the Government of Canada tries 
to enforce a violent opposition to it, which I doubt.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	Now, for the mathematical part. The National Capital Region 
is not only the Ottawa side, it also includes, whether you like it 
or not, the other side of the river, that is Hull and Gatineau. You 
know that, Mr. Speaker, I am sure. When the hon. member says 
that bilingual public servants in the National Capital area serve a 
Franco-Ontarian population, I expect they also serve a Quebec 
population. Otherwise, this would be tantamount to abuse.
<P>
	This aside, when I compared Quebec with the rest of Canada, I 
took care to say, and I repeat, that I was excluding the National 
Capital area, both from Quebec and from the rest of Canada. I 
am therefore comparing apples with apples and oranges with 
oranges. However, the hon. member may find it to his advantage 
to skew reality. As he said, let us leave political correctness 
aside and let us show things as they are. We give 57 per cent 
more service to English-speaking persons in Quebec, than 
French-speaking persons receive in the rest of Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ian McClelland (Edmonton Southwest):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened with great interest to the member for Portneuf who is 
always able to put his thoughts together and present them in such 
an engaging way.
<P>
	Does the member for Portneuf think there is even a prayer of a 
chance that the French fact will be able to survive outside 
Quebec even to the degree that it does today if Quebec were to 
decide to separate. Why would the rest of Canada treat the 
French minority outside Quebec any differently from any other 
linguistic minority? Why should it treat it any differently in the 
absence of Quebec?
<P>
	I would also ask the member for Portneuf to comment on the 
fact that we feel we have an obligation to represent and to be 
considerate of the French language minorities particularly in the 
west. The reality of the situation is that the French language 
minority in my city is the third, fourth or fifth language. It 
comes after Ukrainian and now Chinese. How should these 
minorities be treated vis-à-vis English and vis-à-vis French?
<P>
	The hon. member also mentioned the disparity in incomes and 
that the income of French speaking Canadians in Quebec has 
gone up over the last few years relative to French speaking 
Canadians outside Quebec. I wonder if that could not be in part 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3147"> 3147 </A></B>
<P>
because of the rise of  the entrepreneurial class within Quebec 
and the outflow migration from Quebec of anglophones.
<P>
	As a final parting shot, I would like to mention the irony of 
getting a lesson in minority language rights for the rest of 
Canada from the perception of the rest of Canada having been a 
witness to Quebec Bill 101 knowing the rancour and disbelief 
generated in the rest of Canada by Bill 101. There is some irony 
to now be getting this lesson in understanding.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before recognizing the hon. member 
for Portneuf, I have to tell him that he will have as much time as 
the hon. member for Edmonton Southwest used.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. de Savoye:</B> I am surprised at being asked how we think 
this or that could work. We are not the ones putting forward a 
motion. The Reform Party is putting forward a motion. They 
should tell us how things would work for the French speaking 
communities outside Quebec.
<P>
<B>(1330 ) </B>
<P>
	How will the Reform Party ensure that these French 
communities evolve and the French speaking people get good 
jobs and good salaries? They are the ones who should be 
supplying those answers.
<P>
	What we are saying is that Quebec, as a sovereign state, will 
continue and enhance its effort to support all French speaking 
communities from coast to coast. That has been pledged over 
and over again. I am not going to explain why I believe these 
people will make it. They have done so against tremendous odds 
up to now. Hopefully if the laws of the country continue to 
support bilingualism and if-this is the second if-they are 
implemented correctly, which they are not at the time, then these 
communities will be able to sustain themselves.
<P>
	However, I am asking the question again. It is not for me to 
answer those questions. The Reformers are putting forward a 
motion. Let them support how it will work in the real world for 
the French speaking communities from coast to coast or do they 
want them to be eradicated?
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, before I start 
my speech I would like to make a comment to answer the final 
remarks of the previous speaker who talked about when Quebec 
is a sovereign state it will look after its language policy from 
coast to coast.
<P>
	We understand that if Quebec ever becomes a sovereign 
nation it will not have to worry about coast to coast because the 
small shore of the St. Lawrence will be the only coast that it has.
<P>
	The motion put forward today shows that the Reform Party 
has concern as a federalist party for Quebec, for French and for 
our language policy from shore to shore, and let it always be 
from shore to shore.
<P>
	The Official Languages Act is designed to ensure that the 
people of the province of Quebec and French speaking people 
from elsewhere in Canada have the opportunity to be able to 
participate and enjoy the benefits of this country using their own 
language. That is why we want to discuss it today because 
unfortunately the language act is not working.
<P>
	In 1968 the then Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, mentioned in 
the throne speech the need to create some linguistic justice in the 
country and to forestall what was perceived to be Quebec 
separatism. In his speech, Mr. Trudeau said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You will-be asked to consider measures relating to-citizenship, to national 
symbols, to cultural agencies-Some of these proposals involve the righting of 
wrongs and others the opening of opportunities long denied. Together they 
exemplify the essential connection between justice and national unity.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Unfortunately he did not adopt the recommendations of the 
language commission that had reported up to that point in 
introducing territorial bilingualism. He introduced a personal 
bilingualism. As I mentioned, it was to forestall Quebec 
separatism that was seen to be rising again. Little did he think, 
back in 1968, as he sat in that seat over there that after 25 years 
the present Prime Minister would be looking across the floor at 
54 MPs who are committed to taking Quebec out of this country. 
Unfortunately it demonstrates that the Official Languages Act 
has not worked.
<P>
	We need change to ensure that they stay in this country, that 
they do not pack their bags and leave as the 52 people in this 
House wish to do.
<P>
	Language fractures a country. In a multicultural, 
multi-language situation, it is perhaps the most divisive thing 
that we have to deal with, not only in this country but we see it 
around the world. A large part of the tensions in Yugoslavia 
today are racial, ethnic and language oriented. The divisions in 
the Soviet Union are degenerating into nationalism and cultural 
ethnic groups and language again. Around the world language is 
a problem.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	However, we thought that we were mature enough to work 
together and achieve some sort of harmony. We thought we 
could work together and overcome our difficulties. However, 
the unfortunate thing is we cannot legislate morality and we 
cannot legislate the way people think.
<P>
	Therefore, if we are to have harmony in language let us 
recognize that the road ahead will be difficult. We have to work 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3148"> 3148 </A></B>
<P>
together to bring about acceptance of the need and the 
recognition that Canadians speak more than one language.
<P>
	The French and the English go back a long way to 1608 when 
Samuel de Champlain first landed in this country. At times the 
French language dominated and the English language has 
dominated at times. It has see-sawed back and forth and through 
the accidents of history the English language now dominates. 
However, we recognize the rights of the French speaking people 
in this land. We want them to be recognized. We want to ensure 
that they have a place in Canada.
<P>
	We want to ensure that the Official Languages Act is changed 
so that when we have another election there will no longer be 54 
people sitting in the House who are dedicated to breaking up the 
country. We want 295 people in this House who are committed to 
working together and staying together.
<P>
	The Reform Party has addressed the problem and it has said, 
let us go back to the commission that was formed in the 1960s 
which reported that we should have territorial bilingualism. 
Obviously the personal style of bilingualism does not work 
which is why we have these 54 people here today.
<P>
	Let us recognize that we should change the system in order for 
it to work better. We want the French to speak in their own 
language, we want the English to speak in their own language. 
We do not want to shove another language down people's throats 
if they do not want it. That is what generates the backlash.
<P>
	We should also try and defuse language as an issue. From 
1867 to 1969 there were virtually no language laws in this 
country. We have to get back to the recognition that the fewer 
laws we have in this field the better and the more harmony and 
desire we have to make it work the better. That is why as 
Reformers we propose that language become a provincial issue 
rather than a federal one. Let each province decide which 
language is going to be spoken in the province, bearing in mind 
that each must account and accommodate the language where 
population warrants, that it be French, English or both.
<P>
	That is why we put this motion today, to elevate the need to 
talk about this before the 54 Bloc Quebecois get their agenda on 
track and march right out of here.
<P>
	If the 54 Bloc Quebecois members take Quebec out of this 
country they have left behind the thousands of French speaking 
Canadians in the rest of the provinces. They will be left hanging 
high and dry with absolutely no support. They will be alienated 
from the people in Quebec. The Bloc will be doing these people 
a great disservice. That is why I say to these people, work toward 
making federalism work rather than packing a bag and leaving.
<P>
	We have invested a great deal of money over the years. Even 
Mr. Spicer, the first language commissioner said that perhaps we 
should add it all up and find out how much we are talking about 
and what it costs us. He said:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>But surely there is merit in keeping more meaningful accounts. Without them, those 
dealing language reform will have to continue waffling under the recurring question of  
costs-hearing but being unable to contradict convincingly such deliciously polemical 
estimates-as ``three billion dollars a year for bilingualism.'' It would seem more 
sensible to pull the whole lot of linguistic items together, specify the purpose of each, 
tote up the terrifying sum, add on ten per cent for indirect or integrated costs, then 
publish and defend the thing as a high but necessary price for being Canadian.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1340) </B>
<P>
	That was Mr. Spicer, the first Commissioner of Official 
Languages quite some number of years ago. Today we have all 
kinds of numbers being thrown out. How much does it cost, $2 
billion, $4 billion? We do not know.
<P>
	We do know we pay $50 million a year as a bonus to people 
who speak two languages in the federal civil service whether 
that is required of their job or not. We know that we spend 
hundreds of millions of dollars on other aspects, translation, 
bilingual commissions; $200 million for education. The cost 
adds up, but how much? We do not know.
<P>
	Mr. Spicer said quite some number of years ago: ``Let us add 
it up. Let us find how much. Tell Canadians what it costs us and 
let that be the price for keeping this country together''.
<P>
	As I have said many times, the Reform Party wants Canada to 
stay together. We want a language policy that will bind us 
together in unity and understanding. The official language 
policy as it currently stands will not work and must be changed. 
That is why we brought the item to the forefront today.
<P>
	Let us sit down and develop a new structure. Let us not adopt 
the attitude of the Bloc Quebecois and say: ``That's it. If you 
can't tolerate it, go''. Let us tell the Bloc Quebecois not to be 
selfish and walk out on this great experiment that has been 
Canada.
<P>
	We have said to the Leader of the Opposition, and we have 
said to other members of the Bloc Quebecois: ``Let us sit down 
and define a new federalism''. They said: ``No. If a question is to 
be put on a ballot on a referendum in Quebec it will be a choice 
of what we have today or separatism''. They have said that they 
are not interested in sitting down and making this experiment 
called Canada work. That is tremendously unfortunate for the 
27.5 million Canadians-that includes French 
Canadians-right across this land and the French Canadians in 
the province of Quebec who want to be in Canada, who want this 
country to stay together.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3149"> 3149 </A></B>
<P>
	That is why it is vitally important that we sit down and 
develop a brand new act so that after the next election a majority 
government of Reformers will be running the country and no 
Bloc Quebecois.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Bryden (Hamilton-Wentworth):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to thank my colleague for his comments.
<P>
	He will agree that when we have these debates we must be 
very careful that what we say is founded in truth and reasoned 
analysis and not in rhetoric.
<P>
	He said several times in his remarks that the presence of the 
Bloc is due to Canada's official languages policy. I submit to 
him that the presence of the Bloc is actually due, as is the 
presence of the Reform Party, to the failure of the previous 
Conservative government to retain the confidence of the people. 
It has nothing whatsoever to do with the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	I would further say that he and a previous speaker have made 
several references to language as a cause of dissension and some 
unfortunate incidents in the past. A specific reference was made 
for example to the Acadian expulsion.
<P>
	I submit that the expulsion of the Acadians had nothing to do 
with language. It was a case in the 18th century of what is today 
known as ethnic cleansing. The Acadians were removed not 
because they spoke French but because they were of a different 
religion and because they were an economic and a military 
liability in Nova Scotia at that time.
<P>
	I would further say that if he looks back in the past at the type 
of impartiality that the Reform Party prides itself in he will 
discover that the history of English people has shown a 
tremendous tolerance for French. Throughout the middle ages 
and throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries and even the 
19th century most of the upper classes, shall we say, and the well 
educated people in England and the British possessions spoke 
French regularly. Indeed, this tolerance for the other language 
existed into the 19th century. He is blaming language for 
something for which language is not responsible. Language is 
basically a form of communication. The better we understand 
one another's language the better we can understand one another 
and the better we can overcome the type of tribalism that may be 
characteristic of the type of principles that the Bloc stands for. 
The Bloc represents the same type of people that I belong to, 
other Canadians.
<P>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	The language enables us to reach out to one another. I think we 
Canadians have to do everything in our power to make sure that 
as many Canadians have the opportunity to speak both 
languages as we possibly can.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, in some ways I think the hon. 
member should have been over on this side writing Reform 
speeches because we agree with some parts of what he says.
<P>
	There is no question in my mind that the language policy of 
Canada today has in some way created the fact that we have 54 
people sitting there today.
<P>
	In 1968, as I said, there were divisions in this country. There 
was a desire to achieve linguistic justice in this country. Mr. 
Trudeau, the Prime Minister at that time, addressed it by 
introducing a languages act. He went against the 
recommendations of the commission that said ``territorial 
bilingualism'' and introduced the concept of ``personal 
bilingualism''. If Mr. Trudeau thought he had separatism in 
1968, he had no idea what separatism would mean in 1994 in this 
very House.
<P>
	The hon. member also talked about how the English language 
tolerates French and other languages from around the world. I 
think that is true. We as Reformers and as English speaking 
Canadians are bending over backward to try and do what we can 
to ensure that this country is good for everybody, coast to coast. 
We only ask that we get the same kind of recognition as 
Canadians from the people in Quebec who feel that because they 
have been slighted in some small way that they should pack their 
bags and leave, which will be the destruction of their own 
economy and perhaps the destruction of the Canadian economy 
as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Morris Bodnar (Saskatoon-Dundurn):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the hon. member mentioned that the Bloc does not want to make 
this experiment called Canada work. I wonder in light of some of 
the comments of the Reform member using such terms as 
``dominance of English in this country'' and ``Quebec with only 
a shore along the St. Lawrence'' whether that is an attempt to 
hasten the separation of Quebec from Canada rather than trying 
to heal any wounds and whether that is the goal of the Reform 
Party, to hasten Quebec leaving this country rather than trying to 
live in a country that compromises and has two official 
languages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, the facts speak for themselves. 
Seventy-five per cent of Canadians are English speaking and 25 
per cent of Canadians are French speaking. In our neighbouring 
country to the south there are 250 million people who speak 
English. If the province of Quebec goes alone and forms a 
separate country it is going to be a French speaking island in the 
sea of English speaking North America. It is going to be lost in a 
big sea with no friends. No anglophone group will be there to 
help it. If its language and economy are to be preserved, it would 
be far better off in a larger group such as Canada than by itself. If 
it sets out on its own and feels it is going to preserve French with 
no friends whatsoever, it is going to be totally dominated by the 
cultural impact of the rest of North America.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3150"> 3150 </A></B>
<P>
	With regard to the hon. member's other point about the 
shoreline of the north shore of the St. Lawrence, it is a fact that 
that is what Quebec would have. It is far better to recognize the 
facts and call them for what they are than to pussyfoot around 
and let the people of Quebec or the 54 MPs from Quebec who 
advocate separation push the Liberals around.
<P>
<B>(1350 ) </B>
<P>
	They have been pushed around for so long that we have found 
ourselves in the situation where our country is at risk. Let us 
recognize the problem, deal with it aggressively and solve it 
once and for all.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I did not intervene immediately for a very good reason; 
I wanted to hear the comments from both sides on the speech the 
Reform Party member just made. I think members interpret in 
various ways and disparage the reason why there are 54 
members of the Bloc Quebecois in this House. I believe that 
some members live in a hothouse, totally disconnected from 
reality.
<P>
	I would like to ask the Reform Party, and particularly the 
member who just spoke, where they were at the time of the 
Meech Lake Agreement and of the Charlottetown Agreement, 
when English Canada twice said no to Quebec. Where were they 
then? Maybe they will understand the reason for the Bloc 
Quebecois being present in this House, they will understand why 
54 out of 75 members are here to defend Quebec's interests, to 
advocate and promote Quebec sovereignty.
<P>
	Since we are drifting slightly away from the Reform Party's 
motion on bilingualism, it is easy to present various ideas and 
explanations, but in the member's speech, I never understood, I 
never saw any concrete measures-we are talking here about 
Quebec separating from Canada and I think both sides are 
speaking as if it were a fact, as if Quebec were separated 
already; but what are you going to do with the francophones? I 
understand the Reform Party members when they say that they 
will welcome everybody and treat all minorities very well. But 
they never made any concrete suggestions. What exact measures 
will the Reform Party put into place for francophones outside 
Quebec when Quebec becomes sovereign?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Williams:</B> Mr. Speaker, the question deserves one 
answer. We are working very hard to keep Quebec in Canada. We 
are proposing a new way of handling the official languages in 
this country. That will ensure that there is French available for 
Canadians coast to coast for the people who wish to speak in the 
French language.
<P>
	That can be done best by ensuring that everybody, including 
the 54 Bloc Quebecois MPs who want to work for the benefit of 
their constituents, has an opportunity to work and communicate 
in the language of their choice in this great country called 
Canada.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time is up for questions and 
comments. Resuming debate. I believe the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage intends to divide 
her time.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, the Reform 
Party has put before the House today a motion asking the 
government to amend the Official Languages Act so that French 
can be the predominant language in Quebec and English the 
predominant language in the rest of the country. Reformers also 
want federal services to be available in the official language of 
the minority where there is significant demand.
<P>
	Obviously, the motion was drafted by someone who does not 
understand the Official Languages Act very well or by someone 
who wants to give a distorted image of the letter and the spirit of 
the Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Who could deny within the Reform Party or elsewhere that 
French is the predominant language of Quebec? Who could deny 
that English is the predominant language of British Columbia, 
Alberta, Ontario or Newfoundland?
<P>
	Not only does the Official Languages Act do nothing to 
change that, it recognizes it. It recognizes it by ensuring that 
official language minorities have access to federal government 
services where there is significant demand. This is much of what 
the motion asks and it is what the act already does. What is new? 
Perhaps it is only a new attempt to foster resentment and 
discontent among Canadians.
<P>
	I would advise the hon. members of the Reform Party to get 
better acquainted with the official languages policy if they are 
interested in meaningful debate based on facts, not simply 
rumours or misconceptions. Perhaps they might read the 
brochure ``Myths and Realities'' to see whether they are on the 
side of myths or realities. Maybe then they will stop fighting 
windmills and join with the government in tackling the real 
problems of this country.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The position taken by the Reform Party on the issue of official 
languages more than proves they do not understand a thing about 
government policy. It shows that they do not understand what 
Canadian identity is all about. We know that the members of the 
Bloc Quebecois want to break up Canada and ensure Quebec's 
separation. That is very clear. The Bloc deals with its own 
contradictions as it sees fit, but its basic option is without any 
ambiguity whatsoever.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3151"> 3151 </A></B>
<P>
	Unknowingly, the Reform Party is also proposing the 
break-up of Canada. They want to break up Canada by attacking 
our Canadian values and the major policies, such as official 
languages and multiculturalism, which unite our country.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Like sorcerers' apprentices our opposing friends would like to 
throw away long held policies and workable solutions with total 
disregard for the dire consequences which would fall upon 
Canadian unity and Canadian identity.
<P>
	Our task as parliamentarians is to reinforce unity, not 
uniformity. Our mission is to contribute a sense of a country 
which respects the many ways of being a Canadian.
<P>
	Language and culture are sensitive issues in any society. They 
touch the very essence of how people define themselves and 
their place in society.
<P>
	Public debates do not always honour the facts.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The Canadian people want policies that reflect such Canadian 
values as dialogue, understanding, equity and mutual respect for 
policies based on a definition of citizenship which includes 
rights as well as responsibilities, for policies which urge all 
Canadians to take their place in a pluralistic Canadian society.
<P>
	However, do not attach too much value to labels like 
multiculturalism, pluralism, diversity, bilingualism, linguistic 
duality, official languages that go beyond minorities or to 
semantics on which people do not necessarily agree. These 
terms have one thing in common: they all refer to solutions 
made in Canada. Canadians have tried to develop policies that 
would reflect the various aspects of their society and the 
challenges they face.
<P>
	These very Canadian policies have been used and are still 
used as models elsewhere, but they were made here, in Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The raison d'être for our official languages policy is clear. 
The presence of two significant language communities is one of 
Canada's defining features. Ninety-eight point eight per cent of 
Canadians speak either English or French and these are the 
principal languages used by Canadians in their daily lives.
<P>
	The official use of both English and French within the 
institutions of the government has roots which even predate 
Confederation. It is hard to look at Canada without seeing the 
importance of these two languages within Canadian society.
<P>
	Approximately one-quarter of Canadians have French as their 
first official language and three-quarters have English. A 
majority of both language groups are unilingual. Seven per cent 
or over 1.5 million Canadians live in provinces where their first 
official language is in the minority.
<P>
	The value of languages is made clear in public opinion 
surveys which show that three out of every four parents want 
their children to learn the second official language.
<P>
	This has resulted in large numbers of parents enrolling their 
children in French immersion programs.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> The hon. member still has approximately four 
minutes. The hon. member will be given the floor when the 
debate resumes.
<P>
	It being two o'clock, pursuant to Standing Order 30(5), the 
House will now proceed to Statements by Members pursuant to 
Standing Order 31.

	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today at noon debate began on a motion to amend the Official 
Languages Act.
<P>
	The motion put forward by the Reform Party would not 
eliminate bilingualism or the Official Languages Act but would 
make implementation of the act more practical and cost 
effective.
<P>
	We realize this issue is a sacred cow for the Liberals as they 
are the authors of the act. However, we call on the government to 
set its prejudices aside and listen to the points we make in an 
objective and fair manner.
<P>
	The Prime Minister often states in this House that Reform is 
against official bilingualism and wants to eliminate it. This is 
simply not true. We are merely against the implementation at 
any cost attitude of the current and former governments.

	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Everyone was relieved to learn of the release of the 16 
Canadian peacekeepers who had been taken hostage last 
Thursday by Serb forces near Visoko in Bosnia.
<P>
	However, this news was tempered by the simultaneous 
announcement that Serb tanks were advancing on Gorazde and 
that the shellings of the Muslim enclave were intensifying.
<P>
	Has the minister obtained sufficient assurances that Canadian 
peacekeepers in Bosnia are safe, in particular their colleagues 
who relieved them at the checkpoint in Visoko where the 
hostage-taking incident occurred last Thursday?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I know that all members of this House were extremely 
happy to hear the wonderful news over the weekend that, 
following negotiations, the Canadian soldiers were finally 
freed.
<P>
	I can tell the hon. Leader of the Opposition that Canadian 
soldiers and those from other countries serving under the UN 
flag face difficult situations while on duty, particularly when the 
warring factions do not respect the peace agreements that have 
been negotiated.
<P>
	May I remind this House that in several regions of the former 
Yugoslavia, peace agreements have been brokered and UN 
peacekeepers are maintaining peace and order. Unfortunately, 
agreements are being violated in certain regions and problems 
have arisen. That is why we are stepping up our efforts to secure 
peace among all factions throughout the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, can the minister give us a status report on the situation 
in Gorazde where Serb shellings have intensified and Serb tanks 
have rolled into the city? Can he tell us if the UN has finally been 
guaranteed the safety of the helicopters used to evacuate the 
wounded?
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the situation is changing by the hour. According to the 
latest information we received, an agreement in principle had 
apparently been reached with the Bosnian Serbs and relative 
peace was to return to that part of the country.
<P>
	I cannot tell you what the situation is at this precise moment. 
Intensive negotiations are continuing. However, I can tell the 
House that the United Nations Security Council will be meeting 
this afternoon to discuss the situation and that this morning, 
NATO ambassadors were briefed on the situation in Bosnia.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	Obviously, our goal is to get all warring factions to come to an 
agreement and to accept a peace plan for all of the territories of 
the former Yugoslavia.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lucien Bouchard (Leader of the Opposition):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, does the minister not recognize that the advance of 
Serb tanks on Gorazde and the violation of the ceasefire by Serb 
artillery forces could jeopardize the peace process?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. André Ouellet (Minister of Foreign Affairs):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is no doubt that we have seen very risky 
operations on the part of the Bosnian Serbs. There is a genuine 
effort involving the participation and the co-operation of the 
Croatians, of the Muslims, in order to make some progress 
toward peace.
<P>
	Representations have been made at the highest levels with the 
involvement of the Russian representative, the American 
representative and also obviously the representative of the 
United Nations.
<P>
	We are doing our utmost to convince the Serbs it is in their 
own interests to be part of these peace negotiations. We hope 
they will understand it is in the interest of everybody, including 
themselves, to come to the table and negotiate a total peace 
settlement for the entire ex-Yugoslavia.

on the Ginn Publishing deal, this time implicating the current 
Minister of Finance.

authorized the sale of Ginn Publishing. The minister, through 
his Nellmart Ltd. holding, owns three cinemas in Vancouver and 
leases them to Famous Players, a Canadian subsidiary of 
Paramount Communications.
<P>
	Does the Minister of Finance confirm that he participated in 
the meeting over this deal with his colleagues from Heritage and 
Industry on February 16, two days before the government 
authorized the sale of Ginn Publishing to Paramount, even

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am sure all Canadians want their government to 
create a heritage all Canadians, especially young people and 
future generations, can be proud of. But the Liberal 
governments, past and present, have been leaving a heritage of 
debt, taxes and joblessness.
<P>
<B>(1425 ) </B>
<P>
	The best job creation program for Canada's young people 
would be a program of deficit reduction which would boost 
investor and consumer confidence in the Canadian economy and 
lead to lower taxes.
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Why is the government creating more debt to buy 
mere temporary employment for a handful of people at $10,000 
per temporary job instead of encouraging the creation of real 
jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, on Friday we made the 
announcement of the different initiatives.
<P>
	When I left the meeting I was approached by a number of 
young people who are involved in a street kids organization in 
Ottawa. They asked me whether I would be prepared to meet 
with them because our announcement gave them some sense of 
hope that somebody does care about them and is interested in 
trying to help them get back into the labour market.
<P>
	What we are trying to say to the hon. member is that maybe he 
should try to have some of that same sense of caring for a 
number of young people in society. They have had a tough time 
being out of the labour market for years. Now they want to get 
back in and this is a government that wants to help them do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, there is nothing more disillusioning to young people 
than false hopes.
<P>
	There is nothing wrong with leaf raking and sign painting but 
these youth corps jobs are very short term. The debt the 
government is creating is very long term as is the tax burden and 
unemployment that young people will inherit from this Liberal 
government. This phoney job corps reflects a 1970s mentality. I 
expected disco music to be playing here in the House.
<P>
	Can the Minister of Human Resources Development tell us if 
any permanent jobs ever were created by the 1970s make work 
projects? Can he tell us how many permanent jobs have been 
destroyed by the high taxes and high interest rates driven by a 
quarter century of Liberal and Tory deficits?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member speaks about 
programs that reflect a 1970s mentality. I would say the hon. 
member's question reflects a 19th century mentality.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is really disappointing not to get any answer to a 
question at all when we are looking after the benefit of young 
Canadians and trying to create an atmosphere of hope for them.
<P>
	I note the minister has been handing out some very nice youth 
corps T-shirts and caps made out of canvas, suede and leather. 
How much did these things cost? How many youth were 
employed, if any, to make these souvenirs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, it is quite true we want young 
people working in this national youth corps to be identified with 
Canada.
<P>
	They are providing a service to the community. They are 
working on behalf of Canadians helping to clean up the 
environment, to work with inner city children, to develop a 
number of 
<P>

projects that will be of enormous service and contribution to this

	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Faced with the amount of criticism of both the federal 
government's intentions for the reform of social programs and 
its way of proceeding, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development had to cancel the federal-provincial conference 
that was to take place this very day in Ottawa. Furthermore, the 
impasse between Quebec and Ottawa on labour force training 
continues.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm that it is because other provinces 
besides Quebec were strongly opposed to the government's 
policies and procedure that he had to cancel the 
federal-provincial conference at the last minute, something rare 
if not unique, without first advising the Prime Minister?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is unaware of 
some recent history.
<P>
	To begin with all the first ministers and the Prime Minister 
agreed in a meeting in late December that there must be a social 
policy review. Since that time we have had two very important 
rounds of meetings with ministers of all provincial 
governments. We held them last January and last March. 
Substantial areas of agreement were reached.
<P>
	The reason we did not proceed with the meeting today is that 
some provinces wanted more time. It seems only reasonable and 
logical that in an important, complex process like this if some of 
the parties want more time that we as a government that looks 
toward co-operation would give them more time.
<P>
<B>(1430) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
supplementary is for the Minister of Human Resources 
Development. Given the gap that he is trying to hide between the 
positions of his government, of certain provinces and of Quebec, 
does the Minister, following the cancellation-and it is quite 
something to cancel a federal-provincial conference at the last 
minute; conference goers have seldom seen that 
happen-promise to review his proposed reform of social 
programs to make this reform meet the traditional aspirations 
and demands of Quebec?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, this hon. member should take a 
look at a few books dealing with federal-provincial relations 
over the last 120 years. If she thinks this is a great change in 
precedent, I would suggest that it is quite the opposite. Any 
federal-provincial meetings must contain a number of 
adaptations.
<P>
	By the way, this is not a cancellation, simply a postponement. 
We have asked our officials to sit down and look at certain areas 
where they want more time, where we can share more 
information and that is all.
<P>
	I suggest to the hon. member that her party's attempts to 
create some great alarmist crisis out of this event is simply one 
more effort by them to try to undermine federalism in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Hear, hear.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question 
is for the Minister of Human Resources Development.
<P>
	Last week several ministers and provincial counterparts 
complained that the minister has no interest in genuine 
consultation as far as social reforms are concerned. They 
suggested that the minister is trying to ram through his own 
ideas rather than looking for fresh input.
<P>
	Does this minister already have a specific proposal in mind to 
present to the provinces? If so, why is he pretending to seek 
input through consultation?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would be very interested in 
receiving, and I ask the hon. member to table, exactly what 
provincial ministers he is quoting. When I received calls from 
provincial ministers and spoke to them on Friday, no one said we 
were trying to ram something through.
<P>
	If the hon. member is going to make charges of that kind, 
putting words in the mouths of provincial ministers, he owes it 
to the House to table those reports.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dale Johnston (Wetaskiwin):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
supplementary question.
<P>
	Is this minister truly committed to working with the 
provincial ministers on social reform or is this consultation 
process just a sham?

	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, after being 
told last Friday that Quebec's refusal to take part in the 
federal-provincial conference on social programs reform was 
one of the main reasons that had prompted the Minister of 
Human Resources Development to cancel the conference, the 
minister went ahead and announced his own youth program.
<P>
	Does the minister recognize that his six-point strategy is the 
work of civil servants working in isolation here, in Ottawa, 
without regard for provincial areas of responsibility, the 
consensus in Quebec on the matter and the waste of public 
money due to extensive duplication at present?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification): </B>Mr. Speaker, what the hon. member said is 
incorrect. A meeting was held about a month ago, at which time 
we discussed all of these youth initiatives with the provincial 
ministers. A consultation process was also established at that 
time. So, what the hon. member is saying is wrong and I ask him 
to apologize.
<P>
<B>(1435) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval):</B> Mr. Speaker, before 
introducing several new youth programs, would the minister not 
agree to say that Quebec already administers several programs 
in that particular area, including the Volunteer Youth Action 
Program? Did the minister make a point, before taking such 
actions, of calculating the exact cost of the overlap he is creating 
with his new program?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Lloyd Axworthy (Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification):</B> Mr. Speaker, there are over 400,000 young 
people in this country without employment.
<P>
	It would seem to me that any effort, whether it is by local 
governments, provincial governments or the federal 
government to help those people should be welcomed, not 
attacked.
<P>
	We have talked to the provinces. We have worked out ways in 
which we would work in co-operation to make sure there is no 
overlap. The program we produced on Friday is a national 
program that affects Canadians from one part of the country to 
the other. It allows young people to travel from one part of the 
country to the other to see what a great country we really have.
<P>
	That is why it is so different from programs offered 
exclusively by provinces. It a national program with national 
objectives with a national perspective in mind.
<P>
	If the hon. member was not representing the kind of party and 
ideology that he is, he would be one of the first to applaud our 
attempts to work with the provinces to help young people.

Mr. Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	The Prime Minister in his concern for public safety must be 
aware that there are approximately 1,000 criminals facing 
deportation currently free on the streets of Toronto. Not only 
that but there are another 400 prisoners about to be released who 
have deportation warrants pending against them.
<P>
	People in Toronto and across the country are upset and 
concerned about safety in their streets. What is the Prime 
Minister going to do to ensure that these criminals are deported 
immediately upon their release from prison?
<P>
	<B>Ms. Mary Clancy (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration):</B> Mr. Speaker, first of all the 
reports are incorrect.
<P>
	There are not 400 prisoners currently. There are 200. They are 
in the prisons and in the jails at this time serving out their 
sentences. At the end of the service of their sentences due 
process and the immigration department will ensure that they 
are returned to their countries of origin.
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
I have a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	One of the reasons for this backlog in deportations is the 
shortage of deportation officers. I understand there are about 
24,000 deportation orders across the country that are unable to 
be acted upon.
<P>
	Can the Prime Minister or the parliamentary secretary for 
immigration explain why the immigration minister is not 
reducing government red tape but instead is laying off a third of 
the front line deportation officers in Toronto?

Canada's unemployment rate is higher than that of most

primarily due to a reduction in the number of people looking for 
work, and not to job-creating activities?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt, and 
we have said so ourselves, that the real reason for the lower 
unemployment rate is a reduction in the number of job 
applications.
<P>
	However, it must be pointed out that, for the most recent 
month, we created 48,000 jobs, and a total of 114,000 over the 
last two months, which is almost a record for the last five or six 
years. Consequently, the government is very proud of its 
performance. However, the hon. member is absolutely right 
regarding the enormous cost of unemployment.
<P>
<B>(1440) </B>
<P>
	In fact, this is one of the reasons why, unlike the Reform 
Party, we believe that, to lower the deficit, we must not only 
make cuts, but also stimulate employment. This is the best 
approach to a more reasonable deficit and a more adequate 
financial situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Laurent Lavigne (Beauharnois-Salaberry):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, when does the minister intend to put forward a true 
job-creating strategy? Does he realize that, by not lowering UI 
contributions to $3 now, he delays for one year the 40,000 jobs 
which he planned to create in 1995 with this budget measure?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Paul Martin (Minister of Finance and Minister 
responsible for the Federal Office of Regional 
Development-Quebec): </B>Mr. Speaker, I should point out, and 
this is why our approach is a well-balanced one, that the deficit 
must be lowered to stimulate employment and to foster 
economic stability in our country.
<P>
	We would love to lower UI contributions now, but we need 
money to do that and we need the UI reform which will be 
proposed by my colleague, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development.
<P>
	When you look at the budget initiatives regarding 
apprenticeship programs, if you co-operated with us, instead of 
stubbornly objecting to the measures put forward by my 
colleague to help young people and to train older workers, we 
could create many more jobs.

<P>
	Young women are smoking at a much higher rate than are

the news that U.S. tobacco companies are adding some 600

hazardous to human health.

cigarette manufacturers make the public aware of all such

<P>
	<B>Hon. Diane Marleau (Minister of Health):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
hon. member raises an issue of concern to all Canadians.
<P>
	All Canadians have a right to know what is included in the 
tobacco products they smoke, what goes into their lungs and 
what goes into the atmosphere around them.
<P>
	I am determined to bring all pressures to bear on Canadian 
companies to also disclose the list of ingredients which are 
included in their tobacco products. If they do not then Canadians 
can take it for granted that the 599 ingredients listed in the U.S. 
are perhaps those that are included in Canadian cigarettes.

<P>
	We are still trying to find out the true cost of the official 
languages program in Canada. For example, the commissioner 
states that the armed forces spent $35 million on bilingualism 
last fiscal year. The department gives the cost as $47 million but 
adds that the cost may actually be much higher.

	Will the minister admit that his government does not know the 
real cost of bilingualism and will he establish an accurate 
system to determine the total cost?

<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
merely responding. My initial question was to the comments 
made by the minister last week that they do not really know the 
true cost. I am wondering how we are going to determine that.
<P>
	The first Commissioner of Official Languages, Keith Spicer, 
said in 1975: ``It would seem more sensible to pull the whole lot 
of linguistic items together, tote up the terrifying sum, then 
publish and defend the thing''.

have to wait another two decades before we see Mr. Spicer's

cost was. If the hon. member wants a breakdown I will give the 
cost. The exact breakdown is $297 million for services, $292 
million for the promotion of languages and $12 million for the

which would obviously have a negative impact on their personal

<P>
	It was less than six months ago that the Tory patronage train 
was permanently derailed by the people of Canada. It now 
appears that the Liberal government has launched its own gravy 
train. Three passengers were picked up last week: a Liberal 
campaign manager, a minister's official agent and an 
unsuccessful Liberal candidate.
<P>
	The Liberal red ink book promised to end the Tory practice of 
choosing political friends for appointments. Can the Prime 
Minister explain for the people of Canada why he has broken 
this promise?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, a 
lot of appointments were made last Friday. Some of them were 
Liberals. We named a Lieutenant Governor who had been a 
member of the assembly in Saskatchewan for many years and 
who is the first farmer to be appointed Lieutenant Governor in 
almost 50 years.
<P>
	We named a woman who, yes, ran for the Liberal Party. She is 
a lawyer. She has been appointed to the port authority of Quebec 
City where she lives. She is a very competent woman. I will not 
apologize for that.
<P>
	According to Mr. Gallup, 55 per cent of the people are Liberal 
these days. Should we disqualify 55 per cent of the Canadian 
population from serving the Canadian government?

<P>
	If the Prime Minister is serious about ending the political

transparent and available for public scrutiny?

the chief justice of Ontario. Nobody got up to congratulate me

<P>
	A few weeks ago he made a statement in regard to human 
rights and trade that quite frankly disturbed a lot of Canadians. 
In a statement he made in a scrum he seemed to imply that 
Canada's policy varies according to the country being dealt 
with. If we are dealing with China, we are just too small to have 
any influence. But if it is Haiti or Somalia then our principles are 
not be the same. In other words, name me your country and I will 
name you my principles.
<P>
	The Prime Minister knows that Canada's policy approach 
goes back 30 years to the days of the Right Hon. John 
Diefenbaker and that every government has subsequently 
adopted the same approach.

Canada's policy now?

	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
we have a policy of protecting human rights and we raise that 
question with every country when it is involved.
<P>
	In the question the hon. member referred to, I answered that 
when there is an international boycott we participate in the 
international boycott. When there is no international boycott 
and we have trade relations we have to maintain those trade 
relations. That is exactly what I tried to explain. If the member 
did not understand, that is what I said.
<P>
	We are not happy with the level of human rights in China and 
we protest. We always mention them. However, we want to do 
business with China.
<P>
	In my view it is very important that we do business with these 
countries because not only will it have an economic benefit, but 
the more open a country like that becomes the greater is the 
chance that eventually human rights will be respected.
<P>
	The hon. member referred to Haiti or Somalia. When there 
was an international boycott, Canada was there trying to help 
while still respecting the boycott. We did that and we were the

money on the policy of bilingualism in this country. I do not 
share their views at all, but I nevertheless see it as my 
democratic duty to inform the House of the views of my 
constituents.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> That kind of petition has been criticized 
before. If he agrees, let him table them, but if he does not agree, 
then he should not. He is under no obligation to do so under the 
Standing Orders. This is just more hypocrisy.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. The 
Standing Orders make it very clear that if a member does not 
agree with the substance of a petition, the member does not have 
to table it. We are either for or  against a petition. In the latter 
case, we either return the petitions or ask a member who agrees 
with the content to table them. We do not say: I am tabling the 
petition but I do not agree with it. Let him stand up and be 
counted. Either he agrees or he does not.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> To be fair to everyone concerned, one 
more last round. The hon. member for Simcoe North.
<P>
	<B>Mr. DeVillers:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course I am against this 
petition, but-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Plamondon:</B> Do not table it!

	<B>Mr. Jim Jordan (Leeds-Grenville):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have a 
petition which I am pleased to present and support.
<P>
	It has to do with calling for a ban on the sale of killer cards, as 
they are referred to, collector cards in Canada. The cards, as 
most people know by now because there have been several other 
petitions presented, feature the killer and a description of the 
acts of the killer. I find it very repulsive but I think it is an 
attempt to glamorize this repulsiveness and idealize it in the 
minds of young people.
<P>
	I am sure the killers, if they are in prison, must be flattered to 
think that somebody was interested in their endeavours. I do not 
know how in a civilized nation we can have this. It is an attempt 
to desensitize this thing. I am very much against it and I am 
pleading with the government to put in place legislation that 
would prevent the display, the sale or the exchange of killer 
cards in this country.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Fillion:</B> Mr. Speaker, on a point of order. This concerns 
the last member who spoke. I have the following question for the 
Chair: regarding the point of order raised earlier when the 
petition was tabled, is the Chair prepared to examine the 
Standing Orders and, for the benefit of members who are new 
and not fully acquainted with the Standing Orders of this House, 
possibly take the time to look into this matter and tell us whether 
the hon. member who tabled the petition acted according to the

Perhaps the Chair could take this under advisement.

thought and get back to the House as soon as possible.

	The House resumed consideration of the motion.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I believe the hon. Parliamentary 
Secretary to the Minister of Canadian Heritage has four minutes 
speaking time remaining.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, large numbers 
of parents have been enrolling their children in French 
immersion programs. Enrolment increased at a phenomenal rate 
over the past decade. Significant increases have also been seen 
in other French second language program schools outside 
Quebec and English second language programs in Quebec.
<P>
	The most recent census shows that as a consequence of these 
programs the level of bilingualism in the 15 to 25-year group 
has risen from 16 per cent to 23 per cent in only 10 years.
<P>
<B>(1515 ) </B>
<P>
	The value of our official languages is also reflected in the 
desire of our English and French speaking minority 
communities to have access to quality public education in their 
language as a key to retaining their vitality. The Government of 
Canada has assisted and continues to assist in the development 
of the minority official language education system across 
Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canadian identity is a reflection of who we are. It must 
therefore accommodate native people, linguistic duality as well 
as the multicultural nature of our society and our regional 
diversity. It is important for Canada to reflect all its citizens. 
The notion of ``belonging'' applies not only to those who had the 
good fortune to be born in this land, but also to those for whom 
Canada is a country of adoption.
<P>
	Our concept of citizenship must also include the values we 
share and those we would like to be associated with. Equality 
and respect for diversity form an integral part of our shared 
vision of Canada and the vital elements of our identity.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The public debate has often been so focused on what divides 
us that it often overlooks the things we have in common, 
including our grassroots civic commitments to building our 
communities. This active concept of citizenship encompasses 
not only a legal status but rather our active commitment to the 
fundamental values we share which give us pride in our 
citizenship.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	How do we go about edifying a common vision of Canadian 
identity? In my mind, this cannot be done in isolation. Existing 
tensions can only be overcome if all Canadians have an adequate 
knowledge and understanding of the fundamental realities of 
their country and aspirations of the communities that make it up.
<P>
	It is not by accident that language and culture are recurrent 
themes in Canadian society. No parliamentarian or government 
can afford to overlook these issues. They must be addressed 
openly, transparently. There are certainly adjustments to be 
made to the application of the official languages policy and 
there is still room for improvement, as the Commissioner of 
Official Languages pointed out last week.
<P>
	Public debate should focus on these improvements. It should 
deal with hard facts, and not myths, misconceptions and 
exaggerations. The hon. member's motion is based on such 
misconceptions and exaggerations.
<P>
	I am pleased to have had this opportunity to take part in this 
debate and to show the importance of our official languages 
policy for Canadian identity. And I have no doubt that, put 
before the facts, this House will reject the proposal before us 
today.

<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada):</B> Mr. Speaker, I was anxious to participate 
today as the minister with legislative responsibility for the 
Official Languages Act and to debate the motion to amend that 
act as moved by the hon. member opposite.
<P>
	The Official Languages Act is no ordinary statute. It 
embodies protections that are enshrined in the supreme law of 
our land. It strikes a balance between high principle on the one 
hand and on the other, its pragmatic application. It belongs as 
the Federal Court of Appeal has said to that privileged category 
of quasi-constitutional legislation that reflects certain basic 
goals of our society. In short, the Official Languages Act 
reflects both the Constitution of the country and the social and 
political compromise out of which it arose.
<P>
	We would do well to give due consideration in this debate to 
the fundamental nature of the statute, to the fact that Parliament 
has already devoted considerable attention to ensuring that it is 
modern, forward looking and adaptable and that it meets the 
changing needs of Canadians in a changing time. Amendments 
that could disturb the equilibrium achieved by the legislation 
between respect for constitutional principles and their 
reasonable interpretation, amendments which could be tested in 
the courts, should not be undertaken lightly.
<P>
<B>(1520) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The original Official Languages Act passed in 1969 was 
extensively targeted for reform and renewal during the mid 
1980s, a process which resulted in Parliament adopting the new 
Official Languages Act in 1988.
<P>
	Our party which, while in office, introduced the first Official 
Languages Act fully supported the 1988 reforms.
<P>
	The aims of this reform were fourfold.
<P>
	Firstly, to ensure that the provisions of the act were consistent 
with the language rights guaranteed in sections 16 to 20 of the 
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
<P>
	Secondly, to put in place a more flexible legislative 
framework for applying constitutional provisions in a fair, 
reasonable and practical manner with a view to developing 
policies and related programs.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	As my hon. predecessor the then Minister of Justice asserted 
in this House upon moving the 1988 act for second reading, 
reform of the official languages policy had to be undertaken. 
Parliament had a duty to bring the provisions of the Official 
Languages Act of 1969 into line with the Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.
<P>
	As the present Minister of Justice and therefore in a sense as 
the legal custodian of the Official Languages Act, I believe it is 
incumbent upon me to review with hon. members of this House 
some of the guiding  principles of the legislation to the extent 
that they relate to the motion before the House today.
<P>
	The approach of the Official Languages Act is essentially one 
of institutional bilingualism. It is a functional approach. It 
requires government bodies to organize themselves so as to have 
the capacity to provide services in either official language to the 
extent necessary to serve the public or to allow public servants 
to work in the official language of their choice in accordance 
with the act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The first three parts of the act flow directly from 
constitutional requirements which Parliament and the Canadian 
courts have upheld since Confederation.
<P>
	The Supreme Court of Canada held that the aim of the 
legislation's provisions was to guarantee ``equal access for 
francophones and anglophones to legislative bodies, the law and 
the courts''.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I can therefore only welcome that portion of the opposition 
motion that would have the House resolve that the government 
should continue to facilitate the use of English or French in 
parliamentary and judicial proceedings as well as the use of both 
languages as the languages of federal legislation.
<P>
	The Department of Justice has particular responsibilities in 
ensuring the drafting quality of legislative texts that must be 
equally authoritative in both official languages. It must ensure 
that representations made before federal courts on my behalf as 
Attorney General of Canada are done in the official language 
chosen by the non-governmental party.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Part IV of the Official Languages Act pertains to the 
constitutional right of Canadians to communicate with and 
receive services from federal institutions in the official 
language of their choice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Section 20 of the charter clearly provides that any member of 
the public in Canada personally has the right to services in 
English or in French from any head or central office of an 
institution of the Parliament or Government of Canada.
<P>
	Section 20 also provides that the public has this right with 
respect to any other federal office where either there is a 
significant demand for communications and services from that 
office in that language, or if due to the nature of the office it is 
reasonable that communications and services are available in 
both languages.
<P>
	Simply put, all of us as Canadians, indeed all members of the 
public in this country have the constitutional right to deal with 
their national government in the official language of their 
choice. This includes departmental headquarters and at those 
other offices across the country where it is reasonable due to the 
nature of the office or where a significant demand exists.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3167"> 3167 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1525 ) </B>
<P>
	I emphasize this is not just a minority language right. Whether 
they are part of the English speaking majority outside of 
Quebec, the French speaking majority within Quebec, the 
French speaking communities outside Quebec, or the English 
speaking communities within Quebec, all Canadians have these 
entitlements. These basic rights are reflected in the 
corresponding institutional obligations set out in the Official 
Languages Act and the regulations on services to the public.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The new act and its regulations respecting services to the 
public take an office-by-office approach which is both 
consistent with the requirements of the Constitution and more 
flexible and effective, the aim being to ensure the provision of 
services in both languages where numbers warrant.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The motion to amend the Official Languages Act would limit 
the circumstances where federal services should be available to 
official language minorities in their own language to situations 
where there is a demonstrable local demand. The act's criteria 
and the regulations thereunder are already largely directed to 
meeting local needs, although the burden is not placed on 
minority members of the public to demonstrate demand.
<P>
	A significant concentration of the minority language 
population in terms of numbers and proportion is sufficient in 
most circumstances to warrant the provision of federal services 
under the act in both languages. It avoids the administrative 
costs of actually having to measure demand at each office. This 
also helps to put to rest a longstanding difficulty in living up to 
the promise of the act. In the past demand from minority 
communities was often stifled because there were no bilingual 
services and there were no bilingual services because there was 
little manifested demand.
<P>
	This brings me to comment on that portion of the opposition 
motion that would amend the act to reflect the philosophy of 
territorial bilingualism. If this notion of territorial bilingualism 
is meant to reflect the predominance of French in Quebec and 
English elsewhere, then I would respectfully reply that the act 
already reflects this predominance to an appropriate degree.
<P>
	If however what is sought is territorial unilingualism whereby 
English and French are not only the predominant but the 
exclusive languages for all intents and purposes, I would have to 
say this would contravene not only the basic principles upon 
which the act was built but also the Canadian reality.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I have already said that with respect to federal services made 
available to members of the public, the principle of bilingual 
services was not absolute and that availability varied according 
to demographic and other factors. With  respect to internal 
services made available to federal employees and the language 
in which public servants perform their job, under section 16 of 
the Charter, the two official languages are guaranteed equality 
of status ``as to their use'' in federal institutions. This great 
principle of equality is reflected in the duties and functions of 
federal institutions set out in Part V of the act.
<P>
	In the National Capital Region and in certain designated 
regions, particularly in the Montreal area and in New 
Brunswick, federal institutions must ensure that their work 
environments are conducive to the use of both official 
languages.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Outside the prescribed regions the duty of federal institutions 
is essentially one of preserving fair practices as respects the 
minority language.
<P>
	In conclusion, I respectfully submit that the Official 
Languages Act is a worthy and reliable instrument for the 
protection and the advancement of Canada's linguistic duality. 
Amendments that go to the principles of the legislation and 
which may impinge upon its constitutional underpinnings would 
serve no useful purpose and would likely deflect our energies 
from the real issues of the day.
<P>
	The administration of the Official Languages Act is required 
by the legislation to be reviewed on a permanent and ongoing 
basis by a committee of Parliament. It is at that level we should 
be working to ensure that the implementation of the principles 
of the act is in accordance with the best practices.
<P>
	I therefore encourage the House not to support this motion. I 
thank hon. members for their attention.
<P>
<B>(1530 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wonder if the Minister of Justice would agree that the current 
Official Languages Act plus the Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
adequately protect the rights of all minority language groups in 
the country. If so, how is it that we have the situation still en 
route in Quebec in which Bill 22, Bill 101 and Bill 178 together 
combine to make for injustice, which the United Nations has 
ruled on, against the country and against the province of 
Quebec? We still have not solved this problem with the existing 
legislation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, in defence of the statute in its present 
form I referred to the compromise, social and political, out of 
which the statute arose. I think that in this country, with respect 
to this act as with so much else, what is required is a constant 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3168"> 3168 </A></B>
<P>
monitoring of that compromise to ensure that it meets society's 
needs while still reflecting our underlying principles.
<P>
	In dealing directly with the question I have been asked, I 
cannot speak for the legislatures of specific provinces which 
have seen things differently and seen fit to enact their own laws 
from time to time about language. I can say that as a national 
government and a confederation we defend this statute as 
reflecting principles of nationhood.
<P>
	Yes, it is a compromise and yes, it is imperfect. At least to the 
present it is the best instrument that has been devised to reflect 
the linguistic duality of the country and the need which grows 
out of fairness to provide services where they are required in 
both languages to Canadians.
<P>
	My response is perhaps not as direct as I would like to my hon. 
friend's question. I cannot speak for the legislature of Quebec or 
what may have motivated it from time to time in passing 
language laws of its own. I can simply say that from the federal 
perspective the Official Languages Act in its present form 
reflects the way this government sees the two languages in this 
country.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ringma:</B> Mr. Speaker, what I was really trying to get at is 
perhaps an admission on the part of the federal government, 
represented by the hon. Minister of Justice, that Canada has in 
effect been derelict in its duty in the case of Gordon McIntyre 
whose case was presented to the U.N. The Government of 
Canada has not fulfilled its obligation in being critical of the 
laws of the province of Quebec in this regard vis-à-vis the 
United Nations ruling.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Rock:</B> Mr. Speaker, I disagree. I think that the federal 
government has met whatever obligations it faces in that regard. 
Certainly the position of the federal government was 
communicated to the United Nations committee that considered 
the matter and I am sure our position was taken into account.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Werner Schmidt (Okanagan Centre):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Whip of the Reform Party I wish to advise the 
House that pursuant to Standing Order 43(2), our speakers on 
this motion will be dividing their time.
<P>
	As a preamble to my formal remarks I wish to recognize that 
whenever we want to introduce change, whether it is legislative, 
whether it is organizational change, whatever it might be, there 
needs to be first of all the acceptance of the recognition that 
something needs to be changed. There needs to be some 
ownership and some admission that everything is not as perhaps 
it ought to be.
<P>
	My purpose this afternoon is to show that the federal language 
policy has failed in its primary objective which was and is to 
unify Canada. I submit it is doing the very opposite.
<P>
<B>(1535) </B>
<P>
	How does it do this? I will approach the answer from two 
perspectives. First, the federal language policy is unjust. 
Second, it is impossible or almost impossible to implement the 
provisions of the language policy.
<P>
	On what grounds to I believe that the federal language policy 
is unjust? Justice is a word we use to describe  doing what is 
right and fair. It describes the interaction of rights and 
obligations. A right is the legitimate expectation that one will be 
treated in a certain manner by other persons and institutions. An 
obligation is the duty of an individual or institution to treat 
another individual or institution in the expected manner.
<P>
	Canada's language policy has not been guided by such a 
concept of justice. Instead it is the result of the strong 
dominating the weak, depending on where one lives in Canada. 
The concept that justice is nothing more than the personal 
interest of the powerful was successfully refuted many years ago 
by Plato.
<P>
	It was Prime Ministers Pearson and Trudeau who had the great 
idea of bringing Canada long needed justice. Trudeau spoke 
often and eloquently about the just society. Simultaneously, 
with bringing about a just society these two Prime Ministers 
wanted to bring about national unity. They chose language 
policy as the vehicle to achieve it.
<P>
	From the beginning, however, whenever the principle of 
justice clashed with the principle of unity justice was sacrificed. 
Thus the federal government took a contradictory stand. It 
subsidized French-speaking minorities outside Quebec and 
English-speaking minorities in Quebec. At the same time it was 
trapped into silently aiding an enforced French only 
unilingualism in Quebec.
<P>
	Such a self-contradictory stand is unjust and in the long run 
destructive to national unity. Thus the federal government's 
policy has become inconsistent, confused and generally 
counterproductive.
<P>
	Add to the injustice of this policy the perpetuation of 
ignorance among Canadians about the federal policy and we 
have the consequences of ignorance. When people are kept in 
ignorance about government policies that affect them there is 
great potential for breeding suspicion, resentment, prejudice 
and ultimately hatred.
<P>
	Some of these attitudes are beginning to surface. If we want to 
unite Canada, we must have a language policy that is just and we 
must tell Canadians what it is.
<P>
	Even the bilingual and bicultural commission understood 
justice in terms of the rights for the language minorities. It 
wanted a policy that was essentially utilitarian, the greatest 
good for the greatest number of people. It rejected the notion 
that every Canadian had the duty to become bilingual. The B and 
B commission report states a bilingual country is not one where 
all inhabitants necessarily have to speak two languages. Rather, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3169"> 3169 </A></B>
<P>
it is a country where the principal public and private institutions 
must provide services in two languages to citizens, the vast 
majority of whom may very well be unilingual.
<P>
	In contrast to that fair and just position, federal language 
policy is now more in line with asymmetrical bilingualism. In 
practical terms, every day operational terms, that means protect 
French everywhere in Canada, especially in communities where 
there are few francophones, but do not extend the same rights to 
the English in Quebec.
<P>
	This policy results in contradictory explanations of the 
federal language policy. In Quebec the policy is explained 
asymmetrically. In the rest of Canada it is explained from a 
utilitarian perspective.
<P>
	The most disturbing aspect of all of this is that there is no 
single comprehensive vision of Canada and its linguistic 
identity. To achieve that requires a just language policy. Let us 
remember that only with a government that is just will we have a 
stable country.
<P>
	I move to my second aspect of the federal language policy. I 
submit that the present language policy is difficult if not 
impossible to implement.
<P>
<B>(1540 ) </B>
<P>
	I wish to direct my attention particularly and the attention of 
this House to the third goal found in the 1988 Official Languages 
Act. The goals are that the proportion of French speakers and 
English speakers in the public service reflects Canada's 
linguistic make-up. This proportionate level of representation 
is to be achieved in the overall composition of the public service 
and at all levels of seniority and all fields of operation without 
infringing on the merit principle, hiring and promotion.
<P>
	The hon. Minister of Justice talked a few minutes ago about 
the pragmatic application of that particular act. I suggest that in 
order for us to meet that goal it is impossible to hire on the basis 
of merit alone and that in some cases people will be hired on the 
basis of language alone.
<P>
	Most recently the hon. Minister of National Defence on 
February 25, 1994 gave an even better illustration of how 
difficult it is to administer this act: ``I want to tell the member 
that by 1997 anybody aspiring to the lieutenant-colonel rank of 
the military will have to be bilingual. That means we are putting 
on notice anglophones who want to be generals or chiefs of staff 
that they have to be totally and absolutely bilingual''.
<P>
	There are two problems. First, are anglophones the only ones 
who are being put on notice or are francophones being put on 
notice as well, or is this another example of asymmetrical 
bilingualism?
<P>
	Second, can anyone ever claim to be perfectly bilingual?
<P>
	After all is said and done regarding these things, the real issue 
for me is that I want Canada to be united, a country in which we 
can work together and respect one another in either of the two 
official languages without forcing each other to become 
individually bilingual.
<P>
	Our country is bigger than any one of us individually. It is 
bigger than any one province or territory. It is only as we 
preserve justice for all that we will have a stable country. If we 
become greedy for power, for the power of self-serving, for 
special treatment, in this case because of language, we will tear 
this country apart.
<P>
	Let us create a just language policy. Such a policy will 
combine common sense with reality. It will be affordable and 
make Canada an example of what a country can and should be.
<P>
	That is the purpose of this motion. That is what we are 
debating. We hope the House will see it that way as well.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I listened attentively to the member 
of the Reform Party.
<P>
	I have a short preamble to my question. If one were taking a 
drive through the province of Quebec right now and turned on 
the radio it would not matter what station, one could hear Anne 
Murray, Gordon Lightfoot, not just francophone recording 
artists, Canadian anglophone recording artists.
<P>
	When driving outside Quebec, in any other part of Canada 
where there are another 1,400 or 1,500 radio stations, one cannot 
hear francophone recording artists.
<P>
	Because these are Canadian airwaves, not French or English 
airwaves, does the member not think that as a measure of 
fairness it would be a good idea to have Canadian recording 
artists heard on all radio stations in Canada?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, the answer to that is yes, of 
course. The answer also is one can hear French recording artists 
in Kelowna, Vernon and Armstrong. These are little cities in 
British Columbia. One can hear them in Alberta, Saskatchewan 
and Manitoba.
<P>
	I would encourage the hon. member to drive through those 
provinces and to tune in to those radio stations because this does 
occur.
<P>
<B>(1545 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I listened to the hon. member give his speech. He said 
that the present law was unjust because in part it was 
asymmetrical with respect to the anglophones in Quebec. He 
said that the provisions of the federal Official Languages Act 
did not protect the anglophones of Quebec as they did the 
francophones outside Quebec.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3170"> 3170 </A></B>
<P>
	I am an anglophone from Quebec. I know of no provision that 
applies in a lesser way to the anglophones of Quebec than it does 
with the francophones outside Quebec. I was surprised to hear 
him say that.
<P>
	Our problem in Quebec as anglophones has not been with the 
federal law. The federal law has protected our rights and 
enhanced those rights. Our problems have been with Quebec 
Bill 101, Bill 178, Bill 22 and others, not with the federal law.
<P>
	I would like him to tell the House where the federal law 
provides lesser rights to the anglophones in Quebec than to the 
francophones outside Quebec. I doubt that he can provide the 
House with that information.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, the point clearly is the difficulty 
with Bill 101.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> That is not a federal law.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> That is correct. The fact of the matter is that the 
infringement on the constitutional rights of Canadians by the 
provincial law is not being enforced by the Canadian 
government. That is where the problem lies.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Louis Plamondon (Richelieu):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would just 
ask the members if they would accept reciprocity, that is, 
Quebec anglophones would be treated exactly as francophones 
throughout Canada. Use the rights of anglophones in Quebec as 
a basis. I am sure that if francophones outside Quebec received 
25 per cent of what Quebec's anglophone minority gets, they 
would be very happy.
<P>
	Would the ideal not be to have a kind of reciprocity? That is 
what I ask the hon. member, with respect for his opinion. Any 
right taken from Quebec's anglophones would be taken from 
francophones, but any right given to Quebec's anglophones 
would be given to francophones in the rest of Canada as well. 
Would he agree to that?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Schmidt:</B> Mr. Speaker, that question is not answered 
easily. It takes time. It is a difficult question and a good 
question.
<P>
	Reciprocity assumes that equality applies and that this is done 
logically. The point remains that the Court of Appeal in Ontario 
indicated that where numbers warrant, 12 people would 
constitute such a group. The Court of Appeal also said the only 
way the French language rights could be preserved in the 
educational system was by having separate French school 
boards.
<P>
	If reciprocity means that in every community even where 
there might be five or ten people there would be a school board, 
we would end up with a proliferation of school boards which 
would add tremendous costs. This is only one example. There 
are many others. There are trustees to be paid, superintendents 
to be paid, other administrative and professional staff, support 
and so on.
<P>
	Therefore reciprocity is not an easy question to address 
directly. In principle I would agree.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time is up for questions and 
comments.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jim Gouk (Kootenay West-Revelstoke):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
our motion today deals with facts.
<P>
	The fact is that the Official Languages Act is a total failure. It 
is divisive. It is so overwhelmingly expensive it would even be 
impractical in a booming economy with an overflowing 
treasury, neither of which we currently enjoy.
<P>
	One of the most curious aspects of the act is that no one asked 
for it. Quebec did not ask for it. Most certainly neither did the 
rest of Canada.
<P>
	Quebec wanted the French language in its own province and 
we agree with that. It wanted access in French to key federal 
institutions such as Parliament and the Supreme Court and we 
agree with that. It expects federal services in French. We agree 
with that where there is sufficient demand to warrant cost 
effective provision of that service.
<P>
<B>(1550 ) </B>
<P>
	Given that the majority of the people in Quebec are not 
concerned about it and even a larger majority of Canadians in 
the rest of Canada are not in favour of continuing with it, why 
are we spending so much money to maintain a program that does 
not work, that we cannot afford and that no one wants?
<P>
	One theory generally follows the concept of Newton's first 
law of physics that an object in motion will remain in motion 
unless acted upon by an external force. In other words, the status 
quo reigns supreme.
<P>
	In actual fact, given that the program is in fact flourishing it 
appears many are operating under their own special agendas 
without concern for the fact that the time for this program to end 
has long since past.
<P>
	I would like to focus today on one particular aspect of the 
bilingual implementation program. The area I am personally 
concerned about is the introduction of bilingual services to the 
air traffic control system. These implementation programs are 
horrendously expensive and at times compromise the safety of 
the Canadian traveller.
<P>
	Air traffic control primarily uses two types of services: tower 
control, which controls the movement of traffic on and in the 
immediate proximity to the airport; and radar control, which 
controls aircraft flying by use of aircraft instruments within a 
defined area of airspace.
<P>
	The Official Languages Act imposes a duty on all federal 
institutions to ensure that the public can obtain all services 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3171"> 3171 </A></B>
<P>
available from federal offices or facilities within the national 
capital region in either official language.
<P>
	In keeping with that, Ottawa tower became fully bilingual 16 
hours a day as of June 1990 and 24 hours a day as of March 1991. 
The cost of this was and still is outrageous. The staffing of 
Ottawa tower calls for 17 controllers but at present there are 
only 9 controllers available for duty. Part of the problem is that 
all positions are designated as bilingual imperative. This means 
a controller must be fully bilingual to even apply for the 
position.
<P>
	I for one have no problem with the concept of providing 
bilingual service where demand is sufficient to warrant cost 
effective language services. I already mentioned this at the 
beginning of my talk. Just how much demand constitutes 
sufficient is a questionable point and well worth examining 
here.
<P>
	Before I begin to discuss the need in the tower I would like to 
add that the full bilingual service is in place at Ottawa tower. It 
is now in the process of being implemented in Ottawa terminal.
<P>
	Let us look at how one might determine what demands are and 
how much service is needed to satisfy those demands, if in fact 
they are in need of being satisfied.
<P>
	Simulations were run on equipment then located at the 
research and development department in Hull. Operating from a 
single bilingual position, traffic that included 30 per cent French 
speaking pilots was handled acceptably. This establishes a rate 
at which we can then look at staffing plans if it can be 
determined that the demand exists. What of the demand? 
Controllers at Ottawa tower record each contact requesting 
service in French. The optimum amount of requests they receive 
is 2 per cent, one-fifteenth of the amount that has been 
demonstrated can be handled safely from a single position.
<P>
	A little side note on that 2 per cent figure, these figures 
include Air Canada pilots who can obviously speak and operate 
in English. It includes an airline whose next stop after Ottawa is 
Boston. It includes pilots from Transport Canada who fly all 
over this country.
<P>
	I suggest there is no justification at all for bilingual air traffic 
control services in the Ottawa area. If there is, it should only be 
in that single position originally envisioned which could 
demonstrably control not only that amount of traffic but a 
tremendous and unexpected amount of growth in the future.
<P>
	The cost of this bilingual service is just one of the concerns of 
this program, but it certainly is a significant one. At present the 
combined cost of the overstaffing needed to implement the 
bilingual program in Ottawa terminal plus a shortage of three 
bilingual controllers from the tower who are now on training for 
the terminal to staff the new bilingual positions is almost $1 
million per year. There are English speaking tower controllers in 
Ottawa who can relieve this cost but they are not allowed to 
control in the tower because they do not speak French. These 
costs are only the tip of the iceberg.
<P>
	At the beginning I also mentioned the concern about safety. 
The source of this concern is the way the English speaking 
controllers are being dealt with during this highly questionable 
implementation of bilingual services. Incumbent rights are 
being ignored. Original implementation plans are being 
scrapped. Controllers' futures are up in the air, no pun intended.
<P>
<B>(1555) </B>
<P>
	I fly a lot, as do most of the members in this House. I would 
not want to have open heart surgery from a doctor whose face I 
had just slapped the night before. Why then are we doing the 
same thing to the people whose hands we place our lives in every 
time we take to the skies?
<P>
	This is but one small example of the problem caused by the 
Official Languages Act. However it is a very important example 
of the extent to which this is getting out of hand.
<P>
	The time to end the problem is now. It is time that we became 
the external force that will put an end to the motion of a program 
that has never worked in the interests of anyone.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mac Harb (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister for 
International Trade):</B> Mr. Speaker, for a moment I did not 
know where I was, until the member had concluded his remarks.
<P>
	I want to correct the record. This capital city has already 
declared itself bilingual. In excess of 30 per cent of the people in 
this city speak both official languages. There are over 1.1 
million people who live in the national capital region and use the 
international airport. I would say that over 55 per cent of those 
people speak French and English.
<P>
	Is the hon. member trying to tell me that if I were a 
francophone living on the Quebec side and I used the 
international airport that I should not be entitled to speak to 
somebody in French?
<P>
	On the other side there is a correction to the hon. member's 
comments. The Ottawa international airport not only serves 
other municipalities across Canada and the United States but it 
also serves some places in Europe. It is an international airport.
<P>
	It is our intention to enhance the bilingual services at the 
Ottawa international airport. My hope is that we will reach a 
point where every airport in Canada will have the same 
flexibility and the same kind of services that are now provided at 
the Ottawa international airport.
<P>
	I was not born a French or English Canadian. I came to this 
country a few years ago. I look at it as an enrichment and an 
honour for me to be able to speak French, English, Arabic and a 
little bit of Italian. I am working on my Chinese.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3172"> 3172 </A></B>
<P>
	If anything we should be moving toward trilingualism in 
Canada and not just bilingualism. The whole world is moving 
toward not just one or two but three languages. The hon. member 
should travel to Europe to see that. In Europe the vast majority 
of people speak at least two languages.
<P>
	Is the hon. member suggesting we should deny the majority of 
the people who live in the national capital region the right to 
services in French as well as the right of other people in the 
national capital region to services in English?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> After that counter speech I am not quite sure 
where to begin.
<P>
	First, does the hon. member who posed that convoluted 
question think that 55 per cent of the French speaking people 
who live in the national capital region go up to the cockpit while 
they are on some flight, use the radio and handle the aircraft 
control procedures for the pilot?
<P>
	The two per cent is documented. It is the optimum figure in 
terms of the French language used in the national capital region.
<P>
	I would love to compare passports with the hon. member. I 
suggest that I travel at least as much as he does and probably 
quite a bit more. English is the international language of 
aviation.
<P>
	I have no problem with the idea of using French in Quebec 
because that is the language there. I would even go along with 
providing the service here. However, we are going so far beyond 
the amount necessary to provide the service to those who require 
it that it is absolutely ridiculous.
<P>
	When the member talks of implementing this right across 
Canada it is no wonder the budget is so totally out of control.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to point out there is some inconsistency in 
what the hon. member has said. He started out by saying that one 
of the problems with the official languages legislation is that it 
is divisive. I suggest that if there is a divisive element in this it is 
the putting forward of some of these bizarre notions as fact.
<P>
<B>(1600) </B>
<P>
	Twice categorically the member said that nobody in this 
country wants this. I do, so he is wrong. A lot of people do. 
Come visit New Brunswick and see how many people are lined 
up to get into immersion and programs like that. The suggestion 
that it is a failure disregards reality. Reality has it that in 25 short 
years in the context of the history of a country that large 
numbers of people are becoming conversant in a second 
language who would not have that opportunity outside of the 
official languages policy.
<P>
	The suggestion has been made repeatedly that somehow this 
legislation forces people to become bilingual when in fact it has 
exactly the reverse effect of  allowing people not to become 
bilingual and get services from their government.
<P>
	If you speak French in Saskatchewan you do not have to be 
able to speak English to get services from your government. If 
you speak French in Fredericton, New Brunswick, you do not 
have to be able to speak English to get services from the 
government. That is what is provided, not the requirement to 
become bilingual but the opportunity not to be.
<P>
	Finally, I would suggest that the cost argument that is put and 
is put often is very divisive in this debate. Consider the numbers 
of people who are being served by the provisions in this 
legislation relative to cost. I think of my province of New 
Brunswick and the numbers of people who get service. There are 
250,000 Acadians who are being served by the federal 
government in their first language. Much of it is enhanced by 
this legislation. The cost relative to the numbers of people is not 
excessive at all. It is a divisive argument. It is an unfounded 
argument and I would ask the member to respond.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gouk:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member does not like my use of 
the word divisive but found many uses for it himself.
<P>
	Yes I said that no one wants it and the member challenged 
that. I suppose he is right. There is absolutely nothing I can think 
of where there is absolute unanimity all across the line.
<P>
	I would point out to the member that the last survey I saw 
suggested that 63 per cent of all those surveyed in Quebec did 
not agree with the national bilingual program and there was a 
higher percentage than that in the rest of Canada.
<P>
	The hon. member suggest that because many people take 
French language training that they are in favour of this. I have 
taken Spanish and I have taken Portuguese and I am not in 
favour of Canada implementing bilingualism in Spanish and 
Portuguese either. Therefore, his argument does not hold much 
water.
<P>
	With regard to the fact that no one is forced to take bilingual 
training because of the provisions of the bilingual service, tell 
that to the controllers at the Ottawa terminal.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Marlene Catterall (Parliamentary Secretary to 
President of the Treasury Board):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be 
dividing my time with the member for Carleton-Gloucester.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am glad to speak on behalf of the President of the Treasury 
Board in this debate-
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3173"> 3173 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
-and to be able to express the point of view of the Government 
of Canada, the government of all Canadians, on the motion by 
the member for Nanaimo-Cowichan on official languages in 
federal institutions.
<P>
	First I would like to express some amazement with respect to 
the position taken by the hon. member on this motion, an 
amazement that I am sure is shared by many members of this 
House and many Canadians.
<P>
	The motion seems to display a perhaps deliberate 
misunderstanding of the very purpose and spirit of the Official 
Languages Act and its regulations. It seems to be challenging 
the very make-up of Canada's approach to language rights and, 
indeed, one of the founding principles of this nation.
<P>
	The main purpose of the Official Languages Act, to make it 
clear to members opposite, is to guarantee the equality of status 
of French and English Canadians in the use of the two official 
languages in federal institutions.
<P>
<B>(1605 ) </B>
<P>
	The act rests on the principle of institutional bilingualism, the 
principle that federal institutions must be able to serve 
Canadians and to communicate with them in the official 
language of the choice of the citizen. In fact, the act forces 
neither English speaking Canadians to speak French nor French 
speaking Canadians to speak English. Rather it is offices of 
federal institutions that must be bilingual in localities where 
demand is sufficient for services to be in both official languages.
<P>
	These are important distinctions for anyone wanting to 
address the issue of official languages in this country and 
specifically the Official Languages Act.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Institutional bilingualism does not mean that all employees of 
federal institutions must be bilingual, but that federal 
institutions are responsible for bilingualism. It is up to them to 
take all necessary measures to ensure that, wherever required by 
law, members of the public can be served and receive the 
information they need in the official language of their choice.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Institutional bilingualism means as well that Canadians of 
both linguistic communities may obtain employment and have a 
career in the federal public service in the official language of 
their choice. They may do so while remaining unilingual if that 
is their choice.
<P>
	These are the principles that underlie the official languages 
program in federal institutions. These principles are simple and 
fair. They are a reflection of the rights conferred upon 
Canadians by our constitution. They lie at the very heart of our 
identity and our cultural heritage. They embody the very 
essence of Canadian linguistic duality, one of the fundamental 
characteristics of this country.
<P>
	These principles guarantee Canadians, whether English or 
French speaking, the right to receive federal services and 
information in the language of their choice.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	These principles give federal employees the right to work in 
the official language of their choice, in circumstances and 
regions specified in the legislation. They also give Canadians of 
both linguistic communities equal opportunities for 
employment and promotion in federal institutions.
<P>
	These basic principles are an integral part of the laws of this 
country. And federal institutions must see to it that Canadians 
can exercise these rights.
<P>
	The official languages regulations on communicating with 
and providing services to the public enforce specific provisions 
of the Official Languages Act.
<P>
	These regulations define the circumstances in which federal 
institutions must serve the public in both official languages. It 
may be because there is sufficient demand for their services or 
because of the very nature of the services provided.
<P>
	The official languages program is the instrument through 
which federal institutions implement the official languages 
legislation.
<P>
	In short, these are the basic principles underlying this 
program. I would now like to explain why, in my opinion, these 
principles are valid.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	In my view the Canadian approach to language rights has two 
fundamental characteristics. It is both reasonable and just. It is 
reasonable because it gives Canadians the right to receive 
federal services in the language of their choice but, at the same 
time, limits the scope of these rights notably by defining 
significant demand. It is just because it gives Canadians open 
and easy access to the services of their government in both 
official languages enabling the vast majority of Canadians to 
receive services in the official language of their choice.
<P>
<B>(1610 ) </B>
<P>
	What is also remarkable about the Canadian approach is the 
sense of fairness and balance. In fact, that is why there is not one 
and only one definition of significant demand for services.
<P>
	The variations that the regulations in the legislation allow 
may be based on the importance of the service to be provided, 
for instance, where health and security are involved. Obviously, 
any Canadian has to be able to understand the service they are 
being provided and to communicate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3174"> 3174 </A></B>
<P>
	When it is a matter of such issues as transportation in which 
any Canadian may be involved at any time, of course they have 
to be entitled to the services of their government in the official 
language of their choice.
<P>
	I want to conclude very briefly by saying that we could have 
taken a different approach and as some would have it, we could 
have applied a simple rule that is based purely on mathematics. 
We chose not to do that. We chose to do it based on need and 
importance of the service.
<P>
	We have decided to remain true to the principle of fairness, to 
rules that make it possible to meet the needs I mentioned earlier 
and the legislation was intended to meet. That is simply for 
Canadians to have accesses to the services provided by their 
country's institutions.
<P>
	We want Canadians to be able to work together in the official 
language of their choice in the same institutions within bilingual 
regions as provided for in the act. The government has made a 
commitment to the equitable participation of Canadians of both 
linguistic communities in federal institutions. It is committed to 
ensuring that federal institutions reflect the presence of English 
speaking and French speaking Canadians, taking into account 
their mandate and their locations.
<P>
	The Canadian approach whether it deals with service to the 
public, language of work, or equitable participation reflects the 
choices made since the beginning of the history of this country. I 
remember a time in this city when if one was a francophone one 
was unlikely to get hired by one's own government and if one 
did get hired one certainly did not get promoted. As one who 
believes in equity in employment, I would not tolerate that 
situation again in my community or in my country.
<P>
	I also want to refer to the phrase territorial bilingualism. In 
my view we have had far too much of territoriality in this 
country in recent years. We have had far too much of pitting one 
person against another, of looking at every public policy issue 
from a selfish point of view. It is time to start realizing that our 
different communities have to work together toward common 
goals and common purposes. That is what makes Canada unique, 
a country respectful of our differences and proud of what we 
have in common.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated hearing the hon. member's comments. I 
have a couple of questions for her.
<P>
	First, I would like a response to the fact that in a community in 
my constituency, Kindersley, members who receive cable 
television are not able to understand much of the proceedings 
because they do not get services in the language that they all 
understand but in the language of the floor.
<P>
	If one is bilingual that is well and good. However the 
members in my riding who receive this do not even know what 
the Official Opposition is saying. In fact, we are  not even 
getting service in our part of the country that we can understand.
<P>
	The other thing is that for environmental consideration I have 
suggested and I expect others have as well that considerable 
savings could be made if we provided publications in language 
of choice rather than having every publication bilingual where 
one receives both languages. This uses twice the paper and it is 
twice the cost to put these documents together.
<P>
	I know most Canadians would prefer these documents in one 
language or the other because they only use one. I would like to 
have the hon. member's response in the way of environmental 
and fiscal responsibility as to providing services in the language 
that is required, not in both languages.
<P>
<B>(1615 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Catterall:</B> Mr. Speaker, my first comment is that we 
could save an awful lot of money if we simply closed down the 
Government of Canada and ceased completely to provide 
services to Canadians.
<P>
	We could save an awful lot of money if we ceased having a 
national postal service, if we ceased having a national 
transportation system. However, certain prices go with the very 
nature of the country, its diversity and its size, and as a famous 
Canadian said before me, I for one pay those prices gladly.
<P>
	Naturally we are always interested in ways of reducing the 
cost of implementing any government program or policy. In fact 
the cost of providing official languages has dropped 
significantly in the last couple of years. I would be pleased to 
give consideration to the comments of the hon. member and to 
discuss them with the minister.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Eugène Bellemare (Carleton-Gloucester):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it may be difficult for Reform Party members who can 
function in English every day to imagine how French Canadians 
who do not always have the opportunity to do so in French feel.
<P>
	In Canada, it is hard to imagine that our children, whether 
they are French or English-speaking, cannot receive an 
education in their mother tongue, or have no choice but to 
participate in socio-cultural activities, or rely on essential 
services and vocational training, in a language which is not their 
own. Yet, for more than 1.6 million Canadians, which includes 
francophones outside Quebec as well as English-speaking 
Quebecers, being able to use their mother tongue is something 
they cannot always take for granted.
<P>
	The French and English languages are integral parts of the 
Canadian identity. Language is a vital component of what it 
means to be a Canadian, and has been since the very beginning. 
The fact is that close to 99 per cent of Canada's residents speak 
either French or English. However, close to two million 
Canadians live in provinces and territories where their mother 
tongue is the minority language. This linguistic duality is 
therefore  a basic social reality in our country, and Canadians are 
proud of 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3175"> 3175 </A></B>
<P>
that reality which distinguishes us from other nations such as the 
United States.
<P>
	This is why francophone communities, of which I am a 
member, want their children to be able to preserve their 
language in a primarily English-speaking environment. This is 
also why anglophones in Quebec are concerned by their 
decreasing numbers and the need to preserve their social, 
cultural and educational institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are real concerns in the daily lives of many Canadians 
who are members of linguistic minorities. This is the reason why 
the federal government works with community groups to 
support their efforts to turn things around and to help them take 
charge of the development and future of their communities.
<P>
	It would be hard to imagine promoting the use of English and 
French across Canada without strongly supporting their every 
day use in a community context.
<P>
	It is through education that the federal government has mostly 
contributed to the development of the minority communities 
while respecting the fact that matters concerning education are 
under provincial jurisdiction.
<P>
	When Canada adopted the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms in 1982 it took a stand in favour of the rights of 
minorities, including linguistic rights. Section 23 of the charter 
guarantees minority official language communities not only the 
right to education in their language but also the right to manage 
their own institutions.
<P>
	These rights have been clarified by two decisions of the 
Supreme Court of Canada, the Mahé decision and the reference 
on education rights of Manitoba in March 1993.
<P>
	As citizens of Canada we must respect those rights. That is 
why the federal, provincial and territorial governments are 
co-operating to provide opportunities for English speaking 
Canadians in Quebec and French speaking Canadians outside 
Quebec to be educated in their own language and for all 
Canadians to learn English or French as a second official 
language.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Moreover, the federal government recently extended the 
scope of its action to support minority language education.
<P>
<B>(1620) </B>
<P>
	Indeed, the government adopted special measures to help 
some provinces set up structures which will allow a minority to 
manage its schools, as provided by section 23 of the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and facilitate access, for 
francophones outside Quebec, to post-secondary education in 
French.
<P>
	This support will help provide young people who belong to 
linguistic minorities and who are tomorrow's adults an equal 
opportunity to participate actively in our country's development 
and prosperity.
<P>
	In my province, for example, these special measures by the 
federal government allowed for the setting up of a network 
comprising three French-language colleges, including the Cité 
collégiale, here in Ottawa, which is already a resounding 
success.
<P>
	The Franco-Ontarian community has been working 
relentlessly for years to ensure the creation of colleges in certain 
regions and the success of the Cité collégiale confirms the real 
need for such institutions.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The importance of minority language education to minority 
language communities is obvious. As the B and B commission 
pointed out, the absence of adequate education prevented these 
minority communities from contributing fully to Canadian 
society. Only now are we beginning to reverse the impact of 
these previous deficiencies.
<P>
	I belong to the French speaking minority community and I am 
proud of my origins. Like me, almost 978,000 people living 
outside Quebec have French as a mother tongue. Furthermore, 
some 665,000 persons living in Quebec have English as their 
mother tongue. This is an important segment of the Canadian 
population. In fact these minority communities are more 
numerous than the population of several provinces.
<P>
	Our official language minority communities are spread out 
across the country. As a fourth generation Franco-Ontarian, I 
am proud to state that half a million francophones live in 
Ontario alone. The Acadians form one-third of the population of 
New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province. 
The largest provincial minority of all is the English speaking 
community in Quebec.
<P>
	Numerous or not, concentrated or scattered, those 
communities are important contributors to Canadian society.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	The motion before us proposes territorial bilingualism, which 
is described by Reform Party members as territorial 
unilingualism, as a new linguistic arrangement in Canada. The 
Reform Party proposes a form of ethnic cleansing. This 
territorial solution, which exists in some European countries, 
may seem attractive at first glance. However, on closer 
examination, we see that it does not reflect the regional and 
demographic realities of Canada.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3176"> 3176 </A></B>
<P>
	For example, unlike Switzerland and Belgium, where 
linguistic groups live in well-defined areas, the two Canadian 
linguistic communities are present right across the country.
<P>
	Canada has a real interest in ensuring that official language 
minorities participate fully in the social and economic life of our 
society.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	The Liberal Party has contributed more than any other party in 
the House toward building a united Canada, a country united in 
its cultural and linguistic diversity. We will continue to work 
toward that goal. Our vision of our country is one wherein all 
francophones and anglophones are first class Canadian citizens 
regardless of where they live in Canada.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Canada has been thriving thanks to the co-operation 
displayed by the two major linguistic families, and it will 
continue to thrive in unity and prosperity, as long as we will be 
wise enough to protect what unites us and courageous enough to 
eliminate what could divide us.

[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the comments of the hon. member for 
Carleton-Gloucester. It is good to hear that he has settled 
down, at least I sense that his speech came from his heart.
<P>
	I would just like to present a few statistics from the 1991 
census for the member and ask for a response to a question.
<P>
	My riding is quite different from his riding. Perhaps in his 
riding official bilingualism, as we practise it and it is legislated, 
fits. However, Kindersley-Lloydminster has a population of 
63,871 people. English is spoken by 61,325 and French by 35. 
Then there are some non-official languages, such as Chinese, 
130; Spanish, 40; German, the largest after English 1,130.
<P>
<B>(1625) </B>
<P>
	Another interesting statistic is English only: English as the 
only spoken language 61,645; French as the only language is 
zero according to this census.
<P>
	I want to turn back a few pages to another riding in the 
province of Quebec, the riding of Saint-Maurice, which is 
represented by the Prime Minister. There are some very 
interesting statistics: the total population is 75,185; English is 
the home language if 555 residents; French 73,370. There are 
very few non-official languages, 10 Spanish, 60 German and a 
few others. Those able to communicate only in English is 45 
people; those able to communicate in French only is 61,405 
people.
<P>
	Carleton-Gloucester is not actually representative of all of 
Canada. In Kindersley-Lloydminster because of lack of 
funding, school are being closed, education services are being 
restricted. Several hospitals in my constituency have been 
closed for lack of funds.
<P>
	I wonder if the hon. member understands the feelings of 
people who see services that are very important to them close 
down partly because of services provided to people of which 
there is not one person in my constituency. No one in my 
constituency relies on services in one of the official languages. 
To the north of me are the native people who were here before 
the anglophones and francophones but they have no official 
status whatsoever.
<P>
	It all seems very unfair and just does not seem relevant to a 
Canada which is about to go into the 21st century. That is why 
we need to move forward. I would like to see the minister get in 
step with that and prepare Canada for the next century, not 
looking back to the 19th century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I find the comments made by 
the member for Kindersley-Lloydminster and House leader for 
the Reform Party to be insensitive. He gave us statistics and said 
that in his riding, unlike mine, there are very few francophones. 
Is the member trying to tell Canada
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	French is not wanted in Kindersley-Lloydminster, or if you 
are French, we do not care about you and do not dare ask a 
question en français, especially to your federal government 
since that is where the services are. I wonder if that is really his 
attitude, his attitude of caring for Canada, his attitude of 
wanting to provide for minorities.
<P>
	I find his attitude similar to those of all the other Reform Party 
members who spoke earlier. He asked me: ``Does he understand 
the feelings of the people?''. Does he really understand what 
prejudice means? It is one thing to practise it, but it is another to 
receive it.
<P>
	I will tell a little story. I remember getting my first job in this 
city as a student. I got to work as a summer student, 16 years of 
age, and I had forgotten my lunch. I lived downtown. I wanted to 
call my mom because I knew she would take the bus and deliver 
the lunch. I asked permission of the secretary of the office if I 
could call my mother. She said yes.
<P>
	I called my mom and I said to her: ``Mom do not bring my 
lunch. I forgot it. It is my fault. I will go and get it. I have my 
bike. Do not worry''. At that very moment the superintendent of 
that division of the federal government grabbed me by the arm 
and said: ``Young fellow, if I hear you speaking in French once 
more in this office you will be fired''.
<P>
	I wonder if your party is really thinking of what you are 
saying. I wonder if your party is really thinking of what you are 
telling French Canadians. I think all of you are a bunch of bigots.

	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Having heard the story that the 
member just recounted, I wonder if he was carried away in the 
heat of the moment and if he would not agree to withdraw that 
word as being one that does not help the atmosphere of the 
House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> I am sorry, Mr. Speaker, I did not have my 
hearing aid on.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I repeat what I said. I appreciate the 
story just related by the hon. member, but I wonder if he is 
prepared to withdraw the word ``bigot''?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I did not accuse Reform Party 
members of being bigots.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It was a thought and perhaps my tongue projected my feeling. 
I truly feel that because of the manner in which they act. One 
always judges someone according to his acts. I really feel that.
<P>
	Because it is unparliamentary I will withdraw this French 
word ``bigot'' because they find it extremely offensive. I am not 
sure if it is because it is a French word or the definition or that 
they are uncomfortable with the definition.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would like to thank the hon. member 
for withdrawing that word.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Hugh Hanrahan (Edmonton-Strathcona):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I would like to begin by expressing my anger in regard 
to the term ethnic cleansing in terms of linguistic ethnic 
cleansing used by the hon. member.
<P>
	I have been accused because I am a Reformer of supporting 
such atrociousness. We do not support that. I would like to go on 
the record as being an Albertan who has a daughter in grade 
eight. She has been in French immersion since day one of her 
education. We are proud as a family that this is an opportunity 
that she has as a Canadian.
<P>
	I would also point out that it costs the taxpayer of Alberta an 
extra $450 per student to be educated in French. I believe that 
extra amount should be paid by the individual who is receiving 
the benefit, the student involved or the parents.
<P>
	I would like to ask the hon. member for his comments on that 
situation.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, the member from the Reform 
Party takes great objection to my comment about ethnic 
cleansing. I remind him that the member for St. Albert, a 
Reform Party member, is the one who brought up that topic a 
while ago when he said that the problems around this world are 
ethnic in origin. He made references to activities across the 
ocean that are occurring right now.
<P>
	If the problems are of ethnic origin, if he and his party want to 
create a Quebec français and an English Canada, is that not the 
member's definition of ethnic cleansing? If it is not, what 
exactly is it?
<P>
	As far as paying to go to school, is the member suggesting that 
only those who can afford an education have a right to that 
education?
<P>
<B>(1635 ) </B>
<P>
	They give us an example that there is a school closing here 
and there and a hospital closing somewhere. It is certainly not 
Klein's fault. Whose fault is it? Is it the fault of minority 
language?
<P>
	Are the school closings in Alberta and B.C. caused by the 
province of Quebec, caused by Saskatchewan, caused by 
everyone but them? No, it is always a question of over spending.
<P>
	What they would like to do to this country is take the key and 
lock it and every time they come up with whatever topic, helping 
the poor, assisting the minority groups, respecting official 
languages, respecting their country, all they want to do is shut 
down this country, shut down the government and go back home. 
That is all they want to do.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I would be very grateful if we could 
avoid using terms such as were used by both speakers just now. 
As you know, a word to be unparliamentary has to be disruptive. 
The word used by the hon. member did not seem to be disruptive 
with the Reform Party members but I would ask members, 
particularly given what is going on in the rest of the world, if we 
might try to avoid words which are so loaded with emotion and 
strong feelings that they do nothing to create good will and what 
I think Canadians would want us to do in this House.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> I would just like to 
ask a question of the member. I guess we do not all realize that 
we are all trying to arrive at a better solution for Canada. I guess 
that is not accepted and I do not know what I can do to put the 
concerns of the hon. member to rest on some of these things.
<P>
	Just as an example of a policy gone too far, I have an 
electrician in my riding who tried to get a copy from 
Employment Canada of the major contractors and locations of 
the major projects in British Columbia. This document is 
available and was submitted to the employment office in British 
Columbia. It is a catalogue, something like a Simpsons-Sears 
catalogue, and it is a significant document with hundreds and 
hundreds of locations, jobs and so on.
<P>
	When he found out about this he went to the employment 
office and asked if he could have a copy of that so he could get on 
with his job search. He has been out of work for several months. 
He was told, although the document was brandished across the 
desk, that until it was translated into both official languages he 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3178"> 3178 </A></B>
<P>
was not  allowed to have it so that he could get on with his job 
search.
<P>
	He sits, as I speak, at home waiting for the translation. It will 
take several weeks, in which case he sits there, and he has been 
on my doorstep as well, asking why can he not get that when in 
my riding I think there are 40 unilingual French people.
<P>
	I realize we can provide the service to them but for the 70,000 
people, a good number of whom are looking for jobs, they want 
to have access to that document.
<P>
	It seems that it is a good idea sometimes, a good concept, but 
it is pushed so far, pushed to such an extreme that this person sits 
on the unemployment roles waiting for access to this document.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bellemare:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am sure that the Reform Party 
member made a slip of the tongue when he referred to the 
Simpson Sears catalogue, because I am convinced that Alberta 
is living with its times and that Albertans know that, for at least 
20 years now, it has only been Sears.
<P>
	I also want to illustrate another mistake made by the member, 
who just found out, talking to someone from Alberta, about the 
difficulties Canadians can experience when they contact federal 
offices. He said that the person could not get a document in 
English because the French version had not yet been published.
<P>
<B>(1640) </B>
<P>
	I apologize to him, but the federal government often 
experiences problems. Particularly in the last eight years. The 
federal government's policy is to publish in both official 
languages in order to serve all Canadians. If he knows someone 
in his region who worked for the federal government and who 
had a document in English only, then that person also had a 
French version, because both are always published at the same 
time. Documents are only distributed once they have been 
prepared in both languages, so that people who request a copy 
can get it either in English or in French.
<P>
	The hon. member forgot to mention the case of the 
francophone waiting in line at the manpower office. When his 
turn finally came after a close to two-hour wait-and I am 
relating situations which I witnessed or which were reported to 
me-the francophone was told: Sorry, I do not speak French but 
we do have a bilingual person working here and would you go 
back to the end of the line, which means another wait of 45 
minutes or more, so that maybe that particular officer will be 
available when your turn comes again.
<P>
	Yes, it is hard to serve people in both languages, but what we 
are trying to do in Canada is create an atmosphere that makes us 
proud to be Canadians, that makes us feel good to be Canadians. 
It is because of attitudes such as yours that many Quebecers got 
fed up and sent us grumblers like Bloc Quebecois members.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I was faced with two choices. Either I refrained from 
saying anything at all, or I spoke from the heart. I have chosen 
the latter course of action.
<P>
	What I have heard since the start of this debate convinces me 
more than ever that Quebec is doing the right thing. It is clear 
that Quebec has made the right choice to embark on its march to 
independence.
<P>
	I realize that the junior member from thirty-five kilometres 
away will try to cut in, but since I have listened carefully almost 
all day to the speeches of the other members, I would ask them to 
extend the same courtesy to me and to refrain from commenting 
while I am speaking. I will be happy to field questions and 
comments later.
<P>
	Canada's official languages are guaranteed under the 
Constitution. Education rights are also guaranteed under the 
Constitution. That is all well and good, but what about our 
francophone minorities outside Quebec? They are having 
trouble getting schools-
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, would it possible for you to ask that members 
refrain from making comments while I have the floor?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> If the members opposite could be quiet 
for a few minutes, other members could also be heard.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> I recently 
completed a trip across Canada. I visited all of the provincial 
capitals, with the exception of Charlottetown. I met with 
francophone minorities outside Quebec. I heard some amazing 
stories.
<P>
	A resident of British Columbia was told that there were no 
bilingual stenographers in all of Canada, whereas there are at 
least 17 bilingual court stenographers in Montreal alone. A 
person was asked if he would agree to a preliminary hearing in 
English and was promised that the transcripts would be 
translated into French afterward. That person was later told that 
the $20,000 cost of translating the transcripts was too high. 
When the time came for that person to go to trial, he was told 
that since his preliminary hearing had been in English, then 
surely he was also capable of understanding trial proceedings 
conducted in English.
<P>
<B>(1645) </B>
<P>
	In my office, I got a lot of information and press clippings 
intended to show me how well French is doing outside Quebec. I 
picked up only four before leaving my office this morning.
<P>
	In Ontario, for the school census, they are unfortunately 
unable to correct the form, which says that the photocopiers 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3179"> 3179 </A></B>
<P>
cannot print on both sides. That is the reason which the ministry 
gave to Ontario's francophones.
<P>
	In 1994, a key year for Franco-Ontarians, the Auditor General 
of that province criticized the Ministry of Education for not 
providing francophones with good services and he says that the 
services given to francophones are inferior. Our friend from 
Carleton-Gloucester is quoted here: ``Deploring the lack of 
bilingual judges, six-year wait for civil cases in Ontario, 
backlog of 1400 trials''.
<P>
	The gem is Mr. Vastel's article, where it mentions that 
someone is looking for ``sewers, preferably bilingual''. Let me 
explain. In Kingston, the city where they want to relocate the 
military college because it is bilingual, the Employment Centre 
has an advertisement for a ``sewer''; let me spell it out in case I 
do not pronounce it correctly, so that there is no ambiguity. It 
should be translated in French as ``couseur'' or ``couseuse'', but 
the advertisement says ``égout''-quite a different sewer!
<P>
	Another situation. I just heard someone from Saskatoon ask 
the Minister of Heritage a question. There is an advertisement in 
the Saskatoon Employment Centre for a ``cook for menu in 
family style restaurant'', which was translated ``faire cuire de 
menus dans famille coiffée de restaurant''. Those are a few 
gems.
<P>
	To get back to something more serious, although we need to 
laugh a little, we will talk about bonuses. I admit that 
bilingualism is costly. We talked about bilingualism bonuses, 
for example. Do you know that such bonuses have existed since 
1888? In 1888, bilingualism bonuses were established. They 
were $50 for any francophone civil servant who could take 
English dictation or for any anglophone civil servant who could 
take French dictation. So Canada has always wanted to 
recognize bilingualism with a bonus. In reality, in constant 
dollars, $800 is not much compared to the $50 offered in 1888 
just for writing a dictation. Now they are given a bonus to be 
operational, so that they can respond and give service. I do not 
think that $800 is a lot.
<P>
	If you want to make cuts in bilingualism, I do not think that is 
the place to do it. Training is where the cuts should be made. If 
you need to be bilingual for a position, you should be bilingual 
before you are hired and not have someone take courses and 
more courses and still more courses, which is very expensive. 
Why take a public servant from his office and send him for three 
months of immersion somewhere, the Château Frontenac, 
perhaps, for the Christmas holidays, or maybe Toronto, if he is 
French-speaking.
<P>
<B>(1650) </B>
<P>
	I find it inconceivable that, 25 years after the passage of the 
Official Languages Act, we continue to send unilingual public 
servants on language training at public expense. If bilingualism 
is a condition of employment, then they should be bilingual at 
the time they are hired. I am not talking about refresher or 
upgrading courses, which are relatively inexpensive. But to pay 
for the basic language training of unilingual civil servants is too  
expensive. We could easily save close to $96 million a year, if 
you count the training costs plus the program administration 
costs. That is no paltry amount.
<P>
	I would like to call imagination into play. In a draft article 
which was sent to me, Professor Bouvier calls it the ignorance 
bonus versus the bilingualism bonus. The latter, the bonus paid 
to those bilingual civil servants who fulfil their duties 
satisfactorily, should remain. As for the other one, the ignorance 
bonus, we could do away with it.
<P>
	According to an article published in <I>The Ottawa Citizen</I>, the 
report just produced by Mr. Goldbloom must be seen as 
conveying a double message, both a judgment and a warning. 
Why a warning? Year after year, we are reminded in that report 
about all that is going well and all that is going wrong in Canada. 
Let us face it, it is not a bed of roses for francophones outside 
Quebec.
<P>
	When you think about ways of preserving your language, it is 
important to know that you can get served in your own language. 
I can remember back in my youth, when we went out shopping. 
We could safely go to Dupuis Frères knowing that we would be 
served in French. But beyond Saint-Laurent Street, you were 
sure to have to ask to be served in French because it was not 
automatic; they would answer you in English. We had to besiege 
Sainte-Catherine Street to get the restaurants to translate their 
menus. Is it through these little day-to-day battles that Quebec 
was able to assert its French and French-speaking colour more 
and more.
<P>
	I listened carefully to the hon. member for Nanaimo who 
spoke first, I think, on behalf of the Reform Party, as he 
enumerated all the milestones, but I could not help but notice 
that he had major memory blanks. He systematically failed to 
mention any legislation passed in Quebec that favoured 
anglophones. He only talked about those that anglophones had 
trouble with, like Bill 101 and Bill 178 on signs for example. 
When I travelled in Canada, I saw unilingual signs everywhere 
except in airports.
<P>
	I drove to Calgary to visit the Dinosaur Museum-the real 
ones- and along the way I encountered no road sign that bore 
anything beside directions in English, not even international 
symbols. The same thing last week in Newfoundland, I saw 
nothing but English all over the place. So, when they come and 
tell us that there were trials and cases were taken all the way to 
the United Nations because poor little English Canadians were 
treated badly in Quebec, give me a break. People should come 
and see for themselves that it is possible to live both in French 
and in English in Quebec. In fact, it is the only place where it is 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3180"> 3180 </A></B>
<P>
possible. It is not possible to live in both official languages 
anywhere in Canada except in Quebec.
<P>
	I am talking about entire provinces. Of course, in Northern 
Ontario there are towns that are 100 per cent French-speaking. 
That is true, there are some in Northern Ontario.
<P>
<B>(1655) </B>
<P>
	There are towns in New Brunswick where people can live in 
French even when surrounded by English. But there are others in 
the Prairies, in Western Canada, in the Maritimes, and if their 
numbers do not warrant it, they may obtain nothing. We read in 
the newspapers about what happened in Kingston; they may be 
up to 4,999, but there is still one missing; I may move there to 
bring that number to 5,000 so they can receive services in 
French.
<P>
	What seems extremely important to me is to stop dreaming 
and realize that Canada is an English-speaking country. When 
one lives abroad-I lived in Portugal for ten months and 
whenever I said e esto Canadense, everyone would speak to me 
in English. Nobody thought that I could be francophone. And as 
I spoke French, they said, ``Ah, there is some French there.''
<P>
	In every embassy except in Paris, we are addressed in English. 
Let us stop putting our heads in the sand. Canada is an 
English-speaking country. Why did the Trudeau government 
pass a law in 1969? To stop the rise of nationalism in Quebec. 
That is why Mr. Trudeau drafted his law in 1969. That was the 
only reason.
<P>
	Section 23 of the 1982 Constitution Act protects the rights of 
French-speaking communities outside Quebec, with respect to 
their schools in particular, but even Supreme Court decisions 
were not enough to put this in practice. Mrs. Landry, the 
Minister of Canadian Heritage, had to give $112 million to the 
provinces, and I agree with our friends from the Reform Party 
that it costs the federal government a lot of money because the 
provinces do not assume their responsibilities. The provinces do 
not respect the Constitution and the federal government's only 
recourse is to give them $112 million so that they can respect 
their minority populations.
<P>
	I think it is extremely important to realize something else. 
Among the many symbols we are very proud of in this country is 
the national anthem we still have in common, namely O Canada, 
which was first performed on June 24, 1980, and officially 
proclaimed as our national anthem on July 1, 1980. The music 
was composed by Calixa Lavallée and the lyrics were written by 
Mr. Routhier. I remember very well the debate that took place in 
this House, and it would be quite informative for the members 
who did not have the opportunity to follow that debate. I 
remember how difficult it was to draft the English version and 
even today I meet anglophones who are surprised to see that we 
changed the lyrics of their national anthem. It is time to set the 
record straight. Canada comes from Quebec. That is where 
Canada got its start, just like the national anthem. It should be 
pointed out that when each province joined the Canadian 
community, the majority  was French-speaking. If 
francophones' rights had been respected from the start, we 
might not be where we are today.
<P>
	Before I sit down, I want to remind members of one last thing, 
namely that belonging to a country has its price. Here, Canada 
decided to be bilingual. Those who find it too expensive can 
move to the United States. It is cheaper to live in the United 
States. But there is a price to pay for living in a bilingual 
country. It seems extremely important to me, and Quebecers are 
also aware that, costly as it is to be Canadian, it may be a little 
more expensive to be a Quebecer, but at least we will have all the 
tools we need to grow the way we want.
<P>
<B>(1700) </B>
<P>
	<B>Ms. Albina Guarnieri (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> Mr. Speaker, personally I am 
disappointed by the hon. member's speech, and I am sure 
Canadians must be surprised at the position and views of the 
Bloc Quebecois on official languages.
<P>
	I have a question. The other day, the hon. member, who is the 
heritage critic, asked and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``When will they,'' meaning the provinces, ``start treating 
French Canadians as well as the English are treated in Quebec''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Her leader, commenting on the same subject, said and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
``The Quebec government did not do enough, even the Péquistes 
did not do enough. The federal government certainly did more 
than Quebec. I am ready to admit that''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, my question is, why do Bloc members not speak 
the same language?
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Tremblay (Rimouski-Témiscouata):</B> I think we do, 
Mr. Speaker, but I did not think that was the point of this debate. 
I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage asked this question, because I am 
disappointed as well.
<P>
	What I find particularly disappointing is the position taken by 
the Liberal Party-I do not know whether I am supposed to say 
that here-by the government, I should say. It is the same thing. 
What I find disappointing is that the minister arranged for two 
planted questions, and trick questions at that, one from the hon. 
member for Madawaska-Victoria and one from another 
member who talked about Saskatoon today, in which they 
praised the government for not making any cuts.
<P>
	Francophone communities are in dire straits, and the minister 
was very sympathetic to the needs of francophone communities. 
Budgets have been cut. Last year, there was a 10-per-cent cut in 
funding for these associations. They expected another 
10-per-cent cut this  year, and they got another 5 per cent on top 
of that. In some cases, some associations will cease to exist or 
they will have to lay off several staff members.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3181"> 3181 </A></B>
<P>
	When we no longer have associations to defend our rights, 
it means being left without any protection whatsoever. That is 
what is so disappointing. Our position is clear. We respect the 
francophone community. We want to work as partners when 
Quebec becomes a sovereign nation, and we will do everything 
to try and defend that community as long as we are part of 
Canada. However, we cannot give them the 5 per cent the 
government refuses to give them and which they need so badly. 
That is the truth of the matter, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Warren Allmand (Notre-Dame-de-Grâce):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the hon. member for St. 
Boniface. Unfortunately in the 10 minutes I will have and the 10 
minutes he will have, we will not have enough time to respond to 
all of the arguments that have been put forward in this debate, 
especially some which I believe are false and misleading.
<P>
	The hon. member from Nanaimo of the Reform Party 
proposes three things in his motion. First he proposes to amend 
the Official Languages Act to provide territorial language 
rights. Generally speaking it would mean there would only be 
one official language in Quebec, which would be French and one 
official language in the rest of Canada which would be English.
<P>
	While he did not accept that extreme expression of the 
territorial principle, some members in his party in speaking to 
the debate have supported it. The Reform Party has not been 
completely together on this one. He said that bilingual services 
should apply in the east and north of Ontario, in the northeastern 
part of New Brunswick and west of Montreal. He gave those as 
examples. When I questioned him on it, he said he was not hard 
and fast on the examples but at least it gave us an idea of the 
territorial bilingualism he had in mind. As I pointed out in the 
question which I put to him, it would leave out the anglophones 
in the eastern townships, the anglophones in the Gaspé and the 
anglophones in the Outaouais region. It would leave out the 
francophones of Manitoba that have had historic rights in that 
province. It would leave out the francophones in Nova Scotia, 
the Acadians.
<P>
<B>(1705) </B>
<P>
	What we are talking about is how wide or how narrow is 
interpreted the expression ``when numbers warrant''. It would 
seem that the hon. member from the Reform Party would 
interpret it widely so it would be very difficult for many 
minority communities to qualify. He would interpret it in a way 
that would leave out, to a greater extent than we do, minority 
language communities.
<P>
	We oppose the first proposition in his resolution because we 
believe that the one million francophones outside Quebec, as 
citizens of Canada, have rights and  those rights should be 
protected. The approximately 800,000 anglophones in Quebec 
have the same rights, to be protected under the federal Official 
Languages Act and policy.
<P>
	The second point in his resolution is to provide for English 
and French in the Parliament of Canada and the institutions 
relating to the Parliament of Canada and to the Federal Court. 
That is the law and the policy right now. I do not know how that 
part of his resolution would change anything. I may be incorrect. 
He did not spend much time speaking to that part of his 
resolution.
<P>
	The third part of his resolution asks that we refrain from 
spending on those aspects of language which come under 
provincial jurisdiction. He did not speak to that part of his 
resolution either but if we were to adopt that policy, it would 
mean cutting assistance to the provinces for minority language 
education and second language education, including immersion. 
That would be a bad thing.
<P>
	The money the federal government provides to the provinces 
for second language education, including immersion, and for 
minority language education is a good thing. It is done for the 
national unity of the country because many of the provinces 
could not afford to give adequate minority language education.
<P>
	The hon. member from Nanaimo asked that we keep an open 
mind. I came to this debate with an open mind but I must say in 
listening to the speeches, as a party the policy has been unclear 
and ambiguous. I am not saying all of them. I listened to them 
all. I was here for the entire debate. They gave different 
versions. In fact some of them proposed things that were 
contrary to the resolution. Some of the proposals they spoke of 
were truly retrograde, a step backward in protecting the 
language rights of Canadians, including minority language 
rights.
<P>
	He said in his opening remarks that the act was not working 
well, therefore it had to be changed. He said in many cases it was 
divisive and too expensive. He suggested that commissioners of 
official languages had supported that criticism.
<P>
	That is not correct. It is true that from time to time, and the 
reports of the official languages commissioner will attest to 
that, they are critical of the administration for not following the 
provisions of the act or where there have been mistakes or 
errors. That is the role of the Commissioner of Official Lan-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3182"> 3182 </A></B>
<P>
guages, to point out where the administration has failed to live 
up to the principles in the act.
<P>
	No commissioner that I know of has criticized the principles 
and the general policy of the act. As a matter of fact, all 
commissioners agree that without the act things would be much 
worse with respect to our language minorities.
<P>
	As to whether it is working well or not working well, these are 
relative concepts. In fact, there are now 162,000 francophones 
outside Quebec in 700 French primary schools. There are 23,000 
francophones outside Quebec in 45 colleges and universities. 
Four million Canadians, or 16 per cent of the population, speak 
both official languages.
<P>
<B>(1710) </B>
<P>
	The second criticism he made is that it is too expensive. 
Again, I do not know of any Commissioner of Official 
Languages who criticized the entire policy as being too 
expensive. The present commissioner criticized the bonus 
program and suggested we get rid of it but he has not said that 
the policy is too expensive in a global sense.
<P>
	Commissioners have criticized specifics within the policy 
and asked that they be corrected, but not that the entire policy be 
cancelled or cut back.
<P>
	With respect to expense, in fact it only costs 20 cents out of 
every $100 that the federal government spends on programs. 
That comes to three cents per day per Canadian. In response to 
the member of the Reform Party, it will not keep many hospitals 
open that are closing in his constituency. The cost for official 
language policy is a very small percentage of our entire budget.
<P>
	Finally, he says it is divisive. Again I do not know of any 
Commissioner of Official Languages who says that the 
principles of the act are divisive. It is divisive in the sense that 
some people will not accept the principles in the Official 
Languages Act. It is their democratic right to oppose it and we 
hear that today. I do not think the reason, the cause of the 
divisiveness, is the principles in the act. It is just that some 
people will not recognize the rights of linguistic minorities.
<P>
	The polls that I have looked at-I do not want to spend too 
much time, but they are on the record-indicate that from 60 to 
75 per cent of Canadians support the policies in the Official 
Languages Act.
<P>
	The purpose of the Official Languages Act is to provide 
legally enforceable language rights and language justice for the 
two official language communities in Canada, that is the one 
million francophones outside of Quebec and the approximately 
800,000 anglophones in Quebec. It is also to serve the interests 
of the six million francophones in Canada, including those in 
Quebec because they are a minority in the entire country.
<P>
	It is a law that is based principally or inspired by a need for 
tolerance, understanding and generosity. I am pleased that our 
government is going to bring back the court challenges program 
because it is no use having rights in law if you cannot enforce 
them in the courts.
<P>
	There is no obligation to become bilingual under the Official 
Languages Act but I heard members of the Reform Party once 
again saying today that French is being thrust down their 
throats. No language is being thrust down the throat of the 
consumer of services. It is true that if you are going to provide 
those services some people have to speak French and some 
people have to speak English in order to provide the services but 
generally speaking that is in the institution.
<P>
	By the way, 70 per cent of all federal government positions 
are unilingual either English or French. Only 30 per cent of the 
positions are bilingual.
<P>
	I thought I had until 5.15. I wrote down the time. How much 
time do I have left?
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Zero.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> I have zero time on such an important subject.
<P>
	Unfortunately we do not have the time to debate this 
important matter in the way it should be debated. I have many 
points I would still like to make. I will have to come back on 
another day.
<P>
	Please put the motion before the House again so we can all get 
at it once more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Darrel Stinson (Okanagan-Shuswap):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
listened to the hon. member say that the Reform Party has been 
saying this is being thrust down people's throats. No, it has been 
thrust on to the backs of the taxpayers at the sacrifice of 
hospitalization in this country. We have to prioritize. This is all 
we are saying on this side of the House.
<P>
	How can I tell people in my constituency that they have to 
wait for months for hospitalization and for operations and still 
fund official bilingualism from the pockets of the taxpayers? 
They do not understand it. It is not a priority out there. We do not 
have the numbers.
<P>
<B>(1715 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, of course health care is 
important. I do not have the figures here today as to how much at 
both the federal and provincial levels we are spending on health 
care, but it is probably not enough. However, to suggest that you 
can save hospitals with the little bits of money that we are 
spending on our bilingual program at the federal level is to 
mislead Canadians. It plays to the minds and hearts of bigots 
when you do that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3183"> 3183 </A></B>
<P>
	I am not saying that the member is one, but when you suggest 
that you can save the health care system with the budget that we 
have for official languages that is distorting the situation.
<P>
	I will give examples. They could be given in English Canada 
as well. An elderly anglophone who is close to me went to a 
hospital, in this case in Quebec but it could happen to a 
francophone outside Quebec, for health care and could not 
communicate with the nurses or the doctors in that hospital 
because nobody could speak English. I know there are many 
examples on the other side where francophones go to hospitals 
and they cannot get service in French and they are trying to 
describe their ailments, which is not easy even if you have a 
doctor or nurse who speaks your own language.
<P>
	Therefore, to suggest that it is either one or the other, it is 
health care or official languages policies or services, is to 
mislead Canadians. Both are necessary on a basis of justice and 
social policy. I suggest that you will never save one hospital or 
one major health care program in this country with the little 
bitsy budget that we have for official languages.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to address a couple of points made by the hon. member. 
One part of the problem is the costs of official languages. The 
problem is that we do not know what those costs are.
<P>
	Now we are told $601 million per year. We are told three cents 
on every $100. Frankly, I have received correspondence from 
the Department of National Defence specifically telling me: 
``Here is our figure of cost of this thing but we cannot tell all 
because of Treasury Board rules and regulations''.
<P>
	It is our perception that much of the cost of official languages 
is hidden somewhere or other. We would really like to unearth it. 
Perhaps that is the procedure that we can follow in the standing 
joint committee.
<P>
	The other point that I would like to address which was made 
by the hon. member concerns the overall. What is it that we are 
trying to do here in examining the Official Languages Act? He 
was taking territorialism as an example and using the example 
that I was giving and saying that it did not go far enough. I agree. 
Let us take St. Boniface, Gravelbourg and Maillardville outside 
of New Westminster as places where it does merit it. Surely what 
we should be doing is studying the thing and not just rejecting it 
out of hand and saying the act is good, most people agree with it, 
therefore let us not look at it.
<P>
	Please, let us go at it step by step and examine things that 
come up with a policy that works for all of us.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Allmand:</B> Mr. Speaker, on his first point, with respect to 
the true costs, I would agree with him. If the present costs that 
are put forward by the government are not the complete costs 
then let us have the complete costs. I do not think it serves the 
debate well to have varying versions of the costs.
<P>
	I do not know whether these costs are the full costs or not but 
we will have a chance in the committee to tie officials down on 
that. I think all the costs should be put on the table and then we 
can judge. I am sure, however, that in comparison to other 
programs they are still very small as a percentage base 
compared to health care, social services and so on.
<P>
	His next point was with respect to what should be the exact 
definition of where the people demand the services. I was on the 
official languages committee in 1968-69 for the first act. We 
spent almost a year on it. I was on the committee in 1988 for the 
second version and we went through at great length the points 
that are being raised by the member: How narrow or how wide 
should the definition be in covering minority language 
communities? Should you cover Gravelbourg or not cover 
Gravelbourg? Should you just cover large areas like the east and 
north of Ontario and leave out, let us say, the Acadian 
community in Nova Scotia? We went through that for months 
and months in 1988.
<P>
<B>(1720) </B>
<P>
	The hon. member and myself are both on the official 
languages committee and we will have a chance to go through it 
again. That does not strike to the heart of the legislation, to the 
principles. Here we are debating how wide or how narrow, that 
concept of which populations should be served and where, how 
big that should be before we give the services. We will have a 
chance to go at that.
<P>
	It comes also to a question of justice. Take the eastern 
townships as an example. There is a majority of francophones in 
the eastern townships now but the first Europeans to come to 
that part of Quebec were anglophones who fled from the United 
States to towns like Cowansville, Knowlton and Frelighsburg. I 
have lived there. I lived in Sherbrooke. They built a university 
there and they built colleges; Stanstead, Bishop's, Compton 
Hall and so on. Now it is mostly French speaking. Are we to 
leave these people out altogether with these long historic rights? 
That is a very important question.
<P>
	We studied it before and we will study it again.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, as a francophone member from Western Canada, I am 
pleased and honoured to speak on this motion.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3184"> 3184 </A></B>
<P>
	Our policy, that is the policy in force at the present time, is to 
ensure that our country is one in which all Canadians, 
francophone and anglophone, can feel at home, regardless of 
where they choose to live.
<P>
	I had planned to speak exclusively about French language 
education governance.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Having heard some comments, I cannot help but address not 
only the government's French language schools and 
post-secondary opportunities in French but the proposal being 
made today.
<P>
	Many people will know that the key to growth for minority 
language communities is quality education. The government has 
assisted in the management of minority language schools. The 
charter recognizes this right. The management of schools, that is 
its realization, has required much effort. It is still not complete, 
but for those where it is not complete the federal government is 
available to render some assistance.
<P>
	The point I would like to make is that if you are going to 
develop the French language or English language community 
you need quality education. You cannot have the highest quality 
education unless it is the people themselves who govern, who 
manage, and that is a basic issue that we need to understand.
<P>
	We also need to understand that without the help of the federal 
government this would never, never have happened.
<P>
	Look at the language rights accomplishments of provinces 
throughout the years, whatever the political stripe. It has never 
been terribly generous. Quite to the contrary. They have done as 
little as possible in spite of judgment after judgment to do it to 
the contrary. That is where the federal government has that 
important right. It has an important responsibility to the people 
of Canada.
<P>
	Where do you think immersion schools would be today if it 
had not been for the federal government's involvement? Where 
do you think the management of schools would be? Where do 
you think post-secondary opportunities in French would be if 
the federal government had not been willing to assist in their 
financing?
<P>
	Without the federal government we would have accomplished 
a great deal less.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would like to quote from a document that I read recently. I 
think it will be extremely useful since it expresses what I have 
been saying. I quote: ``The establishment and expansion of 
centres of excellence for francophone communities outside 
Quebec was made possible thanks to the assistance of the federal 
government''. For example, the <I>Collège universitaire de 
Saint-Boniface</I> in Manitoba has become the finest 
French-language post-secondary institution in Western 
Canada. Each year, the international centre for French common 
law at the <I>Université de Moncton</I> in New  Brunswick welcomes 
several dozen interns from a number of francophone countries. 
Its reputation now extends beyond Canada's borders.
<P>
<B>(1725 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	We are richer for those particular institutions at a time when 
countries' boundaries are no longer nearly as important as they 
were, at a time when we talk about globalization, when we reach 
out and we talk to other countries not only about economic 
development but other types of development.
<P>
	It would seem to me that our minority communities, indeed all 
language communities, are a tremendous asset to this country.
<P>
	I want to talk about the proposal. I will not dwell too heavily 
upon some of the points that have been made, but what is 
territorial bilingualism. I fear territorialism. We have 
territorialism in the former Yugoslavia, I fear.
<P>
	It is a little tent here for someone with a little tent here for 
someone else. We put the tribes into those tents and sometimes 
they decide not to talk to each other.
<P>
	Is territorial bilingualism really not French for Quebec and 
English for the rest of Canada? Is that not a nice way of saying 
it? Is it not a recognition that if that were to happen that over 
time those small fragile communities, very often with very few 
people, would disappear?
<P>
	What is demonstrable local public demand? What percentage 
is it? Who is that makes the request?
<P>
	There is a French language school in St.-Lazare, Manitoba, 
which is several hundred kilometres away from Winnipeg. Is 
there a demonstrable local public demand there? What is it 
exactly?
<P>
	We talk about the costs. What I resent most is there is a 
suspicion that the costs are much more than the $601 million 
that has been mentioned. Rather than wait for the proof they 
prey on the prejudice of people who think that. Rather than say 
let us find out in committee, oh, no, that is not good enough.
<P>
	This is why I deplore this particular proposal. It is insidious. 
It is malicious. I think it is intellectually dishonest. It is preying 
on the prejudices of people.
<P>
	It is saying to the crowd ``What do you want? We are prepared 
to give it to you because we want to keep your support. We want 
to keep your support''.
<P>
	Why give languages back to the provinces? Why? They know 
the records of most provinces. They know that provinces have 
not been generous. They know that over time the provinces 
would reduce those particular language rights and that is the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3185"> 3185 </A></B>
<P>
intellectual dishonesty. They know that and they are trying to 
put forward that position without owning up to it.
<P>
	To suggest as was suggested before that the budget attributed 
to official languages would keep hospitals open is the height of 
irresponsibility. I said irresponsibility. There are other words 
that could have been used.
<P>
	As I indicated before it is the old tribalism back at work. We 
have our tribe. You can have your tribe. Within each of those 
tribes, and we have seen that, there are some members who are 
more valued than others.
<P>
	We are having a debate about official languages. What will be 
the next target? Multiculturalism? Aboriginal 
self-government? Obviously there are people out there who are 
concerned. I share those concerns and I am quite prepared to talk 
about them but let us be honest about it.
<P>
	I do not deny, I have never denied, and I have written 
professionally about this topic, that the Official Languages Act 
costs money. I have said it. I have outlined the costs and I will 
continue to say it. But you have to look at it in perspective. You 
have to stop pretending that for the deficit and the debt and the 
hospitals there is a miracle cure. I am tired of hearing that kind 
of nonsense and I think a lot of others are tired of hearing that 
kind of nonsense as well.
<P>
	If the Reform Party of Canada is truly interested in official 
languages why would it not look at what we have and try to build 
upon it as opposed to destroying it? It is among the first who 
would blame the Bloc for wanting to separate and destroy a 
country. I have asked the Bloc: Why not stay with us and help us 
build a better country? I say to the Reform Party rather than 
destroy the official languages, rather than perpetuate the myths 
that are out there which are frightening people, why not join in a 
debate that is intellectually honest?
<P>
<B>(1730) </B>
<P>
	Why would you not say that if the federal government does 
not continue to be involved that those small communities will 
disappear? Those small communities are fragile. Have you ever 
lived in one of those small communities? Do you know how 
difficult it is for someone to retain that language? Do you know 
how long they fought to do it? Do you know what price they had 
to pay? I doubt it because if you did-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please. The hon. member knows 
very well he is to put his remarks to the Chair. The reason we do 
not want members saying ``you'' is to avoid emotions getting 
too high. Will the member please do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I suggest that if the hon. 
members who brought forward this motion had lived in minority 
language situations as many people have had to do, if they had 
had that experience they would not have brought forward this 
motion.
<P>
	I ask them, through you Mr. Speaker, to put away their 
prejudices and look at how we can improve it. Of course it can be 
improved. There is not a program in government that cannot be 
improved. Of course money  can be saved. There is not one 
program in government that cannot be improved in terms of 
more efficient use of funds.
<P>
	That should be the focus of the debate. The debate should 
consider what kind of Canada do we want. What kind of 
investments are we willing to make in our minority language 
communities? How are we going to make sure we make the 
investments that are sufficient not only to sustain them but to 
permit them to grow?
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I have one final comment. Like 
my colleague who preceded me, I would have liked to have a 
little more time. I would simply ask my hon. colleagues to try 
and be constructive, rather than destructive.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bob Ringma (Nanaimo-Cowichan):</B> Mr. Speaker, first 
I will address the comment of whether any of us had lived in 
minority situations. I was a kid in Vancouver and I was one of 
those foreigners and heard: ``His parents are foreigners. What is 
a name like Ringma anyway? That is funny sort of foreign name 
to me''. I have lived it probably more than others in this House.
<P>
	I heard the last speaker talk about intellectual dishonesty. I 
want to say I heard some intellectual dishonesty coming out 
from there saying why would we not build on the official 
languages policy rather than destroy it. It is precisely what we 
are trying to do. We are saying to amend the Official Languages 
Act, not chuck it out. We are saying to amend it and build on 
what is good in it.
<P>
	I heard talk about intellectual dishonesty. If we are talking 
about bilingualism now, what will be next? Multiculturalism? 
Native rights? Do we not have a right, an obligation in this 
House to talk about these matters without emotions coming to 
the fore and people saying: ``You cannot talk about that''. This is 
nonsense. That is what Parliament is for. I will stand on my 
rights to talk about all of these subjects. It is my duty, how much 
it may hurt.
<P>
	Finally, demonstrable local public demand is the phrase that 
was picked out of the motion. I agree it is a difficult one. It 
equates to what is in the act today, where numbers warrant. That 
is an area we should go at together. We should specify whether it 
is 5,000 or 10 per cent or 2 per cent of the population and under 
what circumstances. Let us put it out. Let us not just deny it.

<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, first I want to make certain that 
my colleague who just spoke does not misrepresent what I said. I 
at no time said that we should not be talking about these topics. I 
said we should be talking about them in an intellectually honest 
way. I object so much to the suggestion that the costs are such 
that hospitals are closing and people are suffering as a result of 
that. That is the intellectual dishonesty to which I refer.
<P>
	When we talk about territorial bilingualism and demonstrable 
numbers there is a significant difference in what the critic and 
some other members of his party are saying. They have to decide 
whether or not they are talking about the same terms in the same 
way. I have heard significant differences in the speeches today. I 
will try to do a standing order statement on those differences just 
to point them out in case some people think I am exaggerating.
<P>
	The member suggests I am saying we cannot talk about this. 
Of course I did not say that. I said we need to build. I suggest that 
what is being proposed today is destroying and not building. The 
provinces will not protect minority language rights. Looking at 
their record, it has not happened over time. That is what would 
happen.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jean-Paul Marchand (Québec-Est):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
is a subject that I care deeply about. The rights of francophones 
outside Quebec are very much affected by the Official 
Languages Act and this law-
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Official bilingualism in Canada is a complete failure. There is 
no doubt about the fact that it is a complete failure. The Reform 
Party talks about costs in dollars and cents but does not refer to 
the human costs of the failure of official bilingualism in Canada.
<P>
	There are some MPs who talk about rights, especially 
anglophones in Quebec talk about their fundamental rights. If 
there is a community in Canada that has never had their rights 
respected, it is the francophones outside Quebec. Their rights 
were denied in spite of guarantees in the Constitution. Those 
rights were abolished illegally by every single province in 
Canada, every single one, right after Confederation. It was just 
Quebec that respected its English speaking minority. Every 
other province in Canada, every single province abolished 
French language rights in those provinces.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The answer must be brief; time is 
already up.
<P>
	The parliamentary secretary has the floor.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Duhamel:</B> Mr. Speaker, I understand very well that there 
has been a huge loss for Canada, the whole country, because 
minority communities like francophones outside Quebec were 
neglected for years.  Because of this neglect, it took extra effort 
to help them rebuild their infrastructure.
<P>
	I know that it is not much use making comparisons because we 
all have our prejudices; I prefer my solution, you prefer yours 
and so on. Nevertheless, when dealing with such a sensitive 
subject as this, I would like us to consider people first and what 
can be done to help them keep the language they had since birth, 
whether it was French, English or some other language. For me, 
a Canadian very strongly aware of his roots, I most certainly 
want all Canadians, not only francophones or anglophones, to be 
able to keep their language and culture and at the same time to 
work and join with others.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, I will 
dive right into my speech without commenting on some of the 
things that have gone on.
<P>
<B>(1740 ) </B>
<P>
	In his report to the Prime Minister of England a century ago, 
Lord Durham's characterization of Canada was profound and 
enduring. He described English and French Canada as two 
nations warring within the bosom of a single state. We cannot 
hide the unfortunate reality that there have always been varying 
levels of tension between the two groups.
<P>
	Because of their numbers the English have in times past 
enjoyed the lion's share of political power within Canada. We 
find an example in the federal civil service which employed very 
few francophones in proportion to their share of the population. 
Federal services were almost unavailable in French, which was 
clearly unjust. In Ottawa, the nation's capital and an hour and a 
half from four million francophones, many services were simply 
unavailable in both official languages.
<P>
	For nearly a century there was very little overt reaction but 
Quebec underwent a fundamental transformation after the 
second world war. After it had served there so nobly like a 
sleeping giant, Quebec shook itself awake and it defined itself as 
Confederation's underprivileged partner. Its intellectual elite 
began to pursue redress with a vengeance in a quiet revolution.
<P>
	The Canadian way is the way of compromise. Some see this as 
a political weakness. That can be true, but in general the way of 
compromise is the way of peace and reconciliation. Rwanda is a 
nation without compromise. The democratization of South 
Africa we hope will be an example of noble compromise.
<P>
	The Liberal government saw that compromise was necessary 
in order to keep Quebec within Confederation. Under Pearson 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3187"> 3187 </A></B>
<P>
the federal government began to right the old wrongs in part by 
providing services in French and hiring more francophones.
<P>
	It also passed an act of Parliament in 1969. The Official 
Languages Act was designed to quell calls for Quebec's 
independence. Its architect was Pierre Trudeau and his purpose 
was to satisfy other Quebec intellectuals by making federal 
services bilingual across Canada. The notion that some federal 
employees might not want to become bilingual did not appeal to 
Mr. Trudeau. The fact that there might be no demand for it in 
certain regions did not concern him. The cost of this venture 
went unestimated.
<P>
	Twenty-five years later what do we find? Has the purpose of 
the act been fulfilled? Is Quebec satisfied? With the expenditure 
of over $600 million a year is Quebec now more comfortable 
within Confederation? I should say not. Quebec is closer than 
ever before to separation and the Bloc Quebecois is calling the 
act a failure.
<P>
	On April 12 the Commissioner for Official Languages tabled 
a report that describes in detail not how civil servants across this 
land have embraced bilingualism, not how services are now 
adequate in both languages, not how the administration of the 
policy has been cost effective, no. The commissioner reported a 
litany of bilingual woe across Canada.
<P>
	Many offices designated as bilingual can hardly deliver the 
service. Offices that have virtually no demand are hounded by 
the commissioner's language police to display bilingual 
signage. Imagine a Canada employment centre in Saskatoon 
being rebuked by the commissioner for putting up an ad for a job 
that was not translated perfectly. This rebuke came in response 
to one complaint and this is in Saskatoon. The commissioner 
forced the letter of the law upon an unwilling office.
<P>
	Let me talk about a small post office in my constituency in the 
community of Sardis, B.C. The Official Languages Act says that 
where there is a significant demand for two languages, the 
service shall be provided by the Government of Canada. There is 
no definition of the word significant in the act although it does 
define a bilingual district as an area where 10 per cent of the 
population speaks the minority language.
<P>
	To transfer the meaning of the word significant to my 
constituency, it would require a population of at least 8,000 
people with French as their mother tongue to require services in 
French. After the last census the government determined there 
was a significant number of francophones who needed bilingual 
services in the tiny Sardis post office.
<P>
	What does the word significant mean to the government? One 
point seven per cent of the population identifies their mother 
tongue as French. That is 1.7 per cent. Far fewer actually speak 
the language. That is their mother tongue. To top it off there was 
not one request in the post office for service in French, not one 
ever. Yet bilingual service must be provided. This is just one 
example of a silly policy that becomes horrendously  expensive 
when it is repeated in different ways thousands of times across 
Canada.
<P>
	It is no wonder bilingualism costs $660 million every year. 
That is only the official figure. Add in the administrative 
inefficiencies, enforcement, lost opportunities and the 
opportunity costs and the real world figure is much higher.
<P>
<B>(1745 ) </B>
<P>
	A comprehensive study done by Scott Reid says it seems 
reasonable to set this overhead cost at approximately 5 per cent 
of all public service staffing costs or $951 million per year.
<P>
	Donald Savoie, a noted Canadian scholar, hikes the figure to 
20 per cent.
<P>
	Is this incredible cost necessary to hold Canada together? Are 
French and English bound only by the glue of this frustrating, 
burdensome regulation, inefficiency and waste? Why maintain a 
charade of bilingualism when after trying and spending for 25 
years people still do not want it?
<P>
	If the loss of the Official Languages Act would cause Quebec 
to separate then the act must be one of the main pillars on which 
this country rests. We managed for a century without such an 
act. Is bilingualism really the substance of Canadian unity? I do 
not believe it.
<P>
	Canada is much greater than that. Canada possesses the only 
cords strong enough to bind a nation together. They are not the 
shackles of language law, they are historic ties, unity within 
diversity, the bonds of shared sacrifice, shared elements of 
culture, shared hopes and values, bandaged where necessary 
with generosity and good will.
<P>
	Petty arguments over language cannot sever the fundamental 
oneness felt between all Canadians. Like a storm on the ocean, 
there may be tumult above but beneath the waves the deep 
waters lie undisturbed.
<P>
	I am grieved that the Bloc Quebecois, along with other 
intellectuals, has created such a storm in Quebec. Even though 
the problems of inequity are largely resolved, the media and the 
politicians have for 20 years repeated their perception that vast 
inequities still persist. They have trumpeted this concept and 
held out false promises to persuade people to pursue them in 
their folly.
<P>
	What will be the result of their actions? Every Canadian of 
every group will suffer, chief among them the people of Quebec.
<P>
	I question the attitude of the Bloc when I hear of its support 
for unilingualism in Quebec, asserting at the same time that 
even if Quebec separates the federal government should force 
bilingualism on English Canada. This is not the spirit of the 
tolerance and generosity that has helped make Canada one of the 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3188"> 3188 </A></B>
<P>
best places in the world to live. This is the kind of political 
ambition that breeds mistrust and anger.
<P>
	The Commissioner of Official Languages expressed a great 
principle at the beginning of his report when he quoted 
Montesquieu: ``Nothing is just merely because it forms part of 
the law; rather, it should be law because it is just''.
<P>
	The commissioner said that the form of law must reflect the 
substance of justice. The law simply reflects an underlying 
reality. I agree fully with that concept. Where there is 
significant demand, as our motion states, it is only just that 
bilingual services reflect that demand. The Official Languages 
Act is an attempt to change Canadian reality, to shape a different 
Canada, to create a new reality by forcing bilingualism coast to 
coast on what is frequently an unwilling population. It is 
expensive, it is intrusive and it is unnecessary.
<P>
	The Reform Party does not oppose bilingualism. All 
Canadians would profit by learning another language if they 
would like to. Reformers are not unkind or insensitive to the 
rights of minorities. The Official Languages Act is not the act 
that makes us kind or sensitive. It is my desire and the desire of 
Reformers to make law reflecting underlying reality by giving 
jurisdiction over language to the provinces and using federal 
powers to protect all minorities from linguistic injustices.
<P>
	We live in a changing Canada. Millions of new Canadians 
today were born neither French nor English. They too deserve to 
become part of the Canadian language equation.
<P>
	The Reform Party of Canada wants to effect a new Canadian 
compromise, to reach out to French Canadians to cement and 
rebuild our great national home, not on the artificial, unstable 
basis of language or ethnicity but on the sure foundation of 
mutual respect, understanding and equality for all races, 
cultures and languages; on the desire for peace and prosperity 
rather than on power, anger or unrest.
<P>
	To this new vision of Canada we pledge ourselves today and I 
invite all members to join with us in this grand adventure.
<P>
<B>(1750) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Francine Lalonde (Mercier):</B> Mr. Speaker, I have 
endured the debates all afternoon, but now, I know that my time 
is short, but I will try to speak calmly.
<P>
	The Official Languages Act was a late attempt to right serious 
historic wrongs, and to answer the question forthwith, Mr. 
Speaker, before it is overlooked, as a young francophone from 
Ontario used to say: ``What you call Quebec's French 
unilingualism, we would really like to have as Ontario's 
bilingualism.''
<P>
	Come and see the reality of rights. Come and see the reality of 
rights in schools, in social services, in hospitals for 
English-speaking people and in the debates within the Parti 
Quebecois to preserve these rights. And I would like it if, in 
Canada, they had the same debates to  preserve rights when 
Quebec is gone. Because I will tell you one thing: a debate such 
as the one here today will not give anyone in Quebec the desire 
to stay in this country.
<P>
	There is an historic dimension missing. Perhaps I should 
apologize for the fact that my ancestors arrived around 1647. I 
must apologize for that. Their name was Tremblay and others 
came later. I must apologize for what they built at the time. They 
were Canadians, real ones, the first ``Canadians''.
<P>
	They were all over the continent you know, they also explored 
the West, but we do not have time for a history lesson. After the 
conquest, ``Canadians'' were mostly confined to the territory of 
Quebec, but over the years, they maintained the desire to go all 
over Canada.
<P>
	I would like to mention one fact. In 1928, headlines in <I>Le 
Devoir</I> stated that Montrealers were worried because 
francophones, instead of going West where there were some 
good lands, were emigrating to the United States. For a hundred 
years, 10,000 French-Canadians a year went to the United 
States-there were large families in those days-but why did 
they not go West? Because in 1928, it would cost $48 to have a 
family come over from Liverpool, but $928 for the same family, 
that is ten children-as was common in those days-and two 
parents, to cover the same distance but from East to West.
<P>
	We must realize that ``Canadians'' tried desperately to make a 
place for themselves, their schools and their own religion in this 
country but they were kept from doing so. Mr. Trudeau tried, 
although belatedly, to remedy the situation, yet he knew full 
well that in Quebec things had already started to move and that 
the measures he was implementing were no more than a paper 
barricade.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Strahl:</B> Mr. Speaker, there was not really a question at the 
end of that but I certainly caught the gist of the member's 
comments. I can try and understand historically some of the 
frustrations, not being from Quebec.
<P>
	Overall the French culture and the French language have done 
very well within the Canadian context. The people the member 
mentioned who went south into the United States were not able 
to hang on to their culture and their language by and large and 
they have lost that and have become assimilated.
<P>
	As I mentioned earlier, there were wrongs in the past. To take 
note of them and try to rectify them where we can is obviously 
what Canadians have tried to do. A further mistake would be to 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3189"> 3189 </A></B>
<P>
try and redress past wrongs in a way that exacerbates another 
problem somewhere else.
<P>
	Our motion is to try and get at the nub of the issue which is 
where numbers warrant and where there is significant need for 
the French language outside of Quebec then those services 
should be provided; likewise in Quebec where there is 
significant demand for the English language.
<P>
	I will use my own province as an example. French barely 
makes the top ten languages in British Columbia. Chinese is by 
far the second most frequently used language. In my own riding 
people who are either unilingually German or use German as 
their mother tongue outnumber French-speaking people 
perhaps 200 to 1.
<P>
<B>(1755) </B>
<P>
	Where there are numbers and where we can justify it and 
where we can financially afford it, for that reason, because we 
want to provide it, I say let us provide it. We cannot have a 
Canada wide policy to try to redress some wrongs from the early 
part of this century. It is not practical. I do not think we can 
afford it. I do not think it redresses those wrongs and makes 
people feel better. If it did we would have unanimity. As it is we 
have people who are actually driven apart by the act.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> The time has expired for questions and 
comments. The member was dividing his time with the hon. 
member for Calgary North.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary North):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleagues have discussed at some length the problems we have 
had in Canada with the policy of official bilingualism and I 
would now like to take a look at how the policy has worked in the 
public service.
<P>
	The recent annual report by the Commissioner of Official 
Languages echoed Lester Pearson, as annual reports have done 
practically since the inception of official bilingualism, with the 
following words: ``The Official Languages Act requires federal 
institutions to ensure that English-speaking and 
French-speaking Canadians have equal opportunities for 
employment and advancement within their ranks''.
<P>
	This is a high minded and noble goal, one that all of us in this 
House can agree with. It is hard, however, to reconcile this ideal 
with a statement made by the hon. minister of defence, for 
example, on February 25: ``We are putting on notice 
anglophones who want to be generals or chiefs of staff that they 
have to be totally and absolutely bilingual''. This is in <I>Hansard</I> 
at page 1855.
<P>
	He later commented: ``Anglophones have more to be worried 
about than francophones because of the tougher bilingual 
requirements for senior officers''.
<P>
	It seems pretty clear and obvious from these completely 
opposed statements that the ideal and the reality of official 
bilingualism are two different things.
<P>
	I do not believe for one moment that the hon. minister of 
defence favours French-speaking Canadians over 
English-speaking Canadians, but I think the minister is  faced 
with the problem of having to defend an inherently flawed 
system.
<P>
	There is good reason for the fact that of the 3,000 
communications received by the ombudsman under the Official 
Languages Act over half were complaints of one sort or another.
<P>
	To put it very simply, the current implementation of official 
bilingualism does not work. It does not work for anglophones 
and it does not work for francophones.
<P>
	The term bilingual describes a person who is equally 
proficient in both official languages. By this definition there are 
very few Canadians who can claim to be fluently bilingual and 
yet we persist, after 27 years of failure, to believe that this 
policy will somehow be made to work if only we wish harder and 
spend more money.
<P>
	By way of example let me draw your attention to many of the 
members on both sides of this House, myself included, who 
would not be eligible for employment in virtually all the senior 
positions in the public sector today because our command of the 
other official language is less than functional.
<P>
	It is ironic that although many of us in this House are not 
bilingual we expect anyone who wants to advance in the public 
sector to be fluent in both languages.
<P>
	The reality is that the great majority of Canadians are not 
bilingual and those who claim to be often are not.
<P>
	The second problem is that the designation of bilingual 
postings is increasing, often doing so when there is no real need 
for bilingual services, as my hon. colleague has just indicated.
<P>
	One example of the unnecessary designation of public service 
posts as bilingual was uncovered by the Ottawa <I>Citizen</I> in 1991. 
In that case there were eight positions designated as bilingual. It 
turns out that the eight employees were asked to use their 
bilingual capabilities just once in the past two years and that was 
when an English-speaking caller had a wrong number and the 
employees were able to direct him to the right one.
<P>
<B>(1800 ) </B>
<P>
	The example I have just given is one of scores which show 
that many public service positions are unnecessarily designated 
as bilingual.
<P>
	There is an alternative to the present implementation of 
official bilingualism which will not only allow public servants 
to speak in the language of their choice, but will also eliminate 
language based discrimination.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3190"> 3190 </A></B>
<P>
	In 1977 in response to the problem of de facto discrimination 
against francophones, the royal commission on bilingualism 
and biculturalism recommended that the public service be 
reorganized into two parallel hierarchies of unilingual work 
units. French would become the language of about 25 per cent of 
those work units and English would be the language of the rest.
<P>
	It is important to keep in mind that this would not be a quota 
system because anglophones could try to win jobs in the French 
language work unit and vice versa. However, in each case 
workers would be allowed and required to communicate with 
fellow employees in the language of the work unit.
<P>
	The big picture within the public service as a whole would be 
that employees could choose whether or not they wanted to 
make the substantial financial investment required to learn the 
other official language. Either way there would be a place for 
them to work in the language of their choice. Not only would the 
choice have been left to the employee, but the enormous cost of 
government sponsored language training would have been 
saved.
<P>
	This proposal has been tested in the private sector and has 
been very successful in bilingual companies. Most positions can 
be filled by unilingual speakers of one language or another and 
only a few bridge positions need to be filled with bilingual 
employees. Had this model been adopted when it was 
recommended 27 years ago full equality between the languages 
would have been achieved by now and there would be no 
meaningful discrimination against speakers of either official 
language.
<P>
	However, Trudeau chose to adopt another model in which 
every individual position was designated as to the official 
language skills it required. Francophones and anglophones 
would be expected to work in close proximity throughout the 
public service which means that many posts, including all posts 
beyond the most junior level would involve regular 
communication between speakers of two languages.
<P>
	In this situation two unfortunate results were inevitable. First, 
the traditionally dominant language, English, would continue to 
dominate. This is why virtually all public service meetings 
continue to this day to be held in English. Second, there would 
be a huge need for bilingual people to occupy all supervisory 
positions since the rules now proclaimed that each person must 
be supervised in the language of his or her choice.
<P>
	It is in the wildfire spread of bilingually designated posts that 
the real tragedy has occurred. On the one hand the system helped 
to boost the number of francophones employed by Ottawa. This 
is because two-thirds of the designated bilingual posts in the 
public service are occupied by francophones. On the other hand 
between 60 and 70 per cent of francophones in Canada do not 
speak English. For this majority the chances of finding  
employment in the public service have been reduced by the 
system of designating individual posts as bilingual.
<P>
	In fact between 1974 when the policy was introduced and 
1992, the number of positions in the federal civil service open to 
persons capable of speaking only French dropped from 34,000 
to 25,000. This is a drop of 26 per cent. Even more staggering is 
the impact in Quebec itself where over half of all the jobs in the 
federal public service are open only to persons who speak 
English as well as French.
<P>
	If the majority of francophones face discrimination the 
situation among anglophones is even worse. Nearly 90 per cent 
of Canadian English speakers are incapable of speaking fluent 
French. This means that most English Canadians are ineligible 
to rise above the junior public service or above the rank of major 
in the armed forces. The result of this situation is dramatic.
<P>
	In a 1990 survey by the Professional Institute of the Public 
Service of Canada over one-third of anglophone respondents 
stated that the policy of designating individual posts had 
negatively affected their advancement opportunities in the past. 
Over half of the respondents stated they believed the policy 
would hurt their promotion opportunities in the future. Nearly 
42 per cent stated that on at least one occasion in the past they 
had not even bothered to apply for a post solely because of the 
restrictive language requirements.
<P>
<B>(1805) </B>
<P>
	In other words, because they structured their reform so 
poorly, the federal government managed to actually increase the 
level of discrimination faced by the average francophone and 
simultaneously introduced discrimination against the average 
anglophone. Canada is probably unique in having managed to 
systematically discriminate against both its major language 
groups at the same time by means of the same policy.
<P>
	The way out of this mess is to toss aside the present system 
and to finally adopt the system of French and English language 
units proposed by the B and B commission 27 years ago. New 
Brunswick has recently adopted elements of this model for its 
provincial language service. It seems to be a success. That 
would be our territorial bilingualism policy within the public 
service. We believe it is time for Ottawa to follow this example.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Harvard (Winnipeg St. James):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
have been listening to the debate all afternoon. I would like to 
say most respectfully that the members of the Reform Party have 
been intellectually dishonest in this debate.
<P>
	The member from Calgary said, or implied at least, just a few 
moments ago that because very few Canadians are bilingual that 
represents failure of the bilingualism policy of this country. 
Nothing could be farther from the truth because there was never 
any intention of the Official Languages Act of 1969 to cause all 
Canadians to become bilingual.

that he was not against bilingualism. He said that he was in 
favour of Canadians picking up a second language. Again it is 
not the intention of the Official Languages Act to cause 
Canadians to become bilingual. It is the intention of the 
government to provide bilingual service to the founding 
language groups in this country.
<P>
	It offends me that the members would use-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Does the member have a question? 
There are two other members who wish to ask questions or make 
comments too.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Harvard:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will ask a question by framing it 
this way. Earlier it was said that the Reform Party would like to 
see priorities set and spending cuts with respect to cutting back 
the provisions of the Official Languages Act. I would ask this: 
What would be a greater priority than the federal government 
providing French language service to the four million unilingual 
French speaking residents of Quebec and also service in English 
to the millions of English speaking-
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Order, please, the hon. member for 
Calgary North.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I will be brief.
<P>
	The first thing I would like to say is that we do not see the 
policy of official bilingualism as making Canadians bilingual. 
What I was talking about was the need of the policy to provide 
equality of opportunity for all Canadians to participate in civil 
service jobs and in the defence sector in our country and that it 
has not done.
<P>
	Second, the member asked what greater priority would the 
government have than to make sure that there was a provision of 
services for both official language groups in the country. I would 
like to point out on behalf of over 12 million Canadians whose 
mother tongue is neither French nor English that this 
government is to serve and to meet the needs of every single 
Canadian, of all Canadians.
<P>
	It is time we recognize the fact that Canada is changing. I 
would say that the greater priority that this member asked about 
would be to ensure fairness for all Canadians, equality of service 
for all Canadians. That should be the greater priority that we 
should now be moving toward.
<P>

<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Bernier (Gaspé):</B> Mr. Speaker, to start with, 
regarding the motion, I would like to tell the member from 
Western Canada that in my riding of Gaspé, which takes 
approximately 7 hours to cross by car, around 11 per cent of the 
population is anglophone.
<P>
<B>(1810) </B>
<P>
	If the notion of French predominance were to be accepted, 
that would mean that, for all intents and purposes, the 
anglophone communities of my area would be deprived of 
services. Even when Quebec is sovereign, I will be the first one 
to offer the people in this part of  Quebec the right to speak their 
own language and to be served in both official languages.
<P>
	The question I want to ask the member of the Reform Party is 
this: If the goal is to save money, it can be done through less 
emotional means than that, and will the member support a 
motion to eliminate overlapping, for instance? I would like to 
point at to her that only in training, we could save $250 million 
in Quebec, or one billion for Canada as a whole. A while ago, we 
were talking about a figure of $660 million. Would she be 
willing to vote in favour of the elimination of overlapping 
jurisdictions?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Ablonczy:</B> Mr. Speaker, I would first like to point out to 
the hon. member that we in our motion are suggesting that 
services be available to official language minorities in their own 
language in any part of the country where there is demonstrable 
local public demand. It would be a judgment that would have to 
be made by the government as to whether in this member's 
riding, with 11 per cent anglophones spread across a very large 
area, it would constitute a significant demand. I think it would 
certainly constitute larger demand than the one my colleague 
just spoke of where there was 1.7 per cent but still requiring 
bilingual services or at least the offering of bilingual services by 
the commissioner.
<P>
	We want to be careful that we do not get into these matters 
simply on the basis of dollars and cents. We have to get into the 
situation on the basis of common sense and on the basis of this 
significant demand and not just ask where can we cut back. We 
need to ask where do we really need the services, where do 
Canadians really require these services. On that basis there can 
be savings. We are suggesting that because there are services 
provided where there is no real demand, there is no significant 
need, that money is being wasted.
<P>
	We need to approach it from the point of view of the needs of 
Canadians rather than simply from a straight dollars and cents 
viewpoint.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Don Boudria (Glengarry-Prescott-Russell):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, this will be one of the shortest speeches I have ever 
delivered. I think we have about three minutes left.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I am pleased to take part this afternoon in this debate on the 
Official Languages Act.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I do not agree with this business of territorial bilingualism.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3192"> 3192 </A></B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I represent a riding in the province of Ontario, where the 
majority of people speak English. According to the principle of 
territorial bilingualism, as defined in the motion before the 
House, English would be the predominant language of the other 
provinces, hence of my province of Ontario. Most of the people 
in my riding are French, and they live in a province where the 
vast majority of people speak English. Like myself, almost 70 
per cent of my constituents have French as their mother tongue. 
According to the hon. member, in such a case, territorial 
bilingualism would apply at the riding level, but that would not 
work either. What would such a policy do to some of the 
communities in my riding, to the 35,000 anglophones living in 
my riding?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Thirty-five thousand anglophones in my riding, if you 
applied this territorialism at the riding basis, would be denied 
their rights; 65,000 if you applied it on a provincial level. That is 
how impossible that proposition is.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	I would have liked it if we could have used today's debate to 
criticize the flaws of the Official Languages Act, since all 
legislation has flaws, and to suggest changes to the Official 
Languages Act to ensure it can better serve the people of 
Canada, and by that I mean the unilingual people of Canada, 
because if the population were already bilingual, we would not 
need an Official Languages Act.
<P>
	Neither the member for Quebec-Est nor I need this 
legislation, for we are both fluently bilingual, but the people we 
represent have the right to be served in their own language. It is 
for them that it is important to have an Official Languages Act, 
not for the member for Glengarry-Prescott-Russell 
personally and not for my colleague who is also a 
Franco-Ontarian, sitting across the way, from the riding of 
Québec-Est.
<P>
	So I would have liked to learn today how we could use this 
Official Languages Act to unite both founding peoples of this 
country, not to divide them. That is the topic I would have like to 
have debated today. Speaking of the history of these two great 
peoples, I heard one member speak earlier of her ancestors who 
came here around 1640-mine arrived in La Prairie in 
1680-and of all the other members who are new Canadians who 
came here a few years ago, like some of my colleagues in this 
House, or whose ancestors have been here almost forever, as in 
the case of our native colleagues. So I regret that we had this 
debate today, especially with this slant; I would have preferred it 
to be otherwise, needless to say.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> It being 6.15 p.m., in accordance with 
the provisions of Standing Order 81(16), it is my duty to 
interrupt the proceedings and put forthwith every question 
necessary to dispose of the business of supply.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Is it the pleasure of the House to adopt the motion?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> No.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those in favour of the motion will 
please say yea.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Yea.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> All those opposed will please say nay.
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Nay.
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> In my opinion the nays have it.
<P>
	<I>And more than five members having risen:</I>
<P>
	<B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(a), I 
have been requested by the deputy whip to defer the division 
until a later time.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 76(8), a recorded division on the 
proposed motion stands deferred.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Accordingly, pursuant to Standing Order 45(5)(a), the 
division on the question now before the House stands deferred 
until tomorrow at 5.30 p.m., at which time the bells calling in 
the members will be sounded for no more than 15 minutes.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It being 6.18 p.m., the House stands adjourned until tomorrow 
at 10 a.m.
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 6.18 p.m.)
