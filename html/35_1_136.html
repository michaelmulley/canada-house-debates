	The House met at 10 a.m.

<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">_______________ </H4>
	<B>The Speaker: </B>My dear colleagues, this is a very sad day for us 
here in this House. One of our own is ill. I hope that our 
colleague, Lucien Bouchard, will be in your prayers today.
<P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">GOVERNMENT ORDERS</H2>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER"><A NAME="INCOMETAXACT">INCOME TAX ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from December 1 consideration of the 
motion that Bill C-59, an act to amend the Income Tax Act and 
the income tax application rules, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Dumas (Argenteuil-Papineau, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, you will understand that having just learned of the 
sudden and dreadful illness that has afflicted our leader, we are 
all, and particularly those of us who are members of the Bloc 
Quebecois, deeply saddened, not to say in shock. I can only hope 
that the Leader of the Opposition will make a speedy recovery.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is opposed to Bill C-59, an act to amend 
the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Application Rules, 
because of certain measures it introduces. We are not, however, 
opposed to the following provisions of Bill C-59. First, the 
permanent renewal of the provision under which money 
accumulated in an RRSP can be used to finance the purchase of a 
first home. Second, the measure increasing the value, in many 
cases, of the charitable donations tax credit. The Bloc 
Quebecois is in agreement with this last measure, as it 
recognizes the contribution made by charitable donations to the 
well-being of the community.
<P>
	At the present time, taxpayers are entitled to a tax credit 
equivalent to 17 per cent of the first $250 of charitable donations 
and a tax credit equal to 29 per cent on charitable donations over 
$250. The bill before us increases the total value of the tax credit 
for charitable donations, while lowering the threshold from 
$250 to $200.
<P>
<B>(1005) </B>
<P>
	The third measure that we do not object to is the one that 
permits a tax deduction for contributions into mine reclamation 
funds by businesses in the mining industry in the year in which 
these contributions are made. Such funds are used to cover the 
costs incurred when mines are shut down.
<P>
	However, as a spokesperson for seniors' associations and 
organizations in Canada, I have undertaken to ensure that the 
social programs review not be reduced to simply making cuts 
across the board in programs designed to protect the 
disadvantaged, and the aged in particular.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois denounces the fact that, over the next 
three years, the federal government will take half a billion 
dollars from seniors with this reduction in the age tax credit.
<P>
	The National Advisory Council on Aging reported the 
following regarding the personal disposable income of the 
elderly: in 1989, the average income of unattached senior 
citizens 65 and over was $16,316, as compared to $23,080 for 
their counterparts under 65. An unattached senior citizen is a 
person who lives alone or in a household in which he or she is 
related to no other member of the household.
<P>
	In 1992, the average income in unattached senior citizen 
households was $18,434, whereas that for other unattached 
persons was $25,039. Nearly 21 per cent, or 625,000, of 
Canadian senior citizens are considered as low income. The 
percentage of low income elderly is always higher than in the 
general population.
<P>
	On March 9, I rose in this House and asked the Minister of 
Human Resources Development this question:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>By making alarming statements on the old age security system, is the 
minister preparing to hit seniors with a considerable cut in their old age 
security pensions?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	By way of an answer, the Minister of Human Resources 
Development and Minister of Western Economic 
Diversification simply said that he wanted to ``ensure that there 
will be a stable, effective, fair, honest system for seniors in the 
future and to make sure that this country can pay for it''.
<P>
	Allow me to wonder about the meaning of the word ``stable'' 
used in his reply in relation to seniors, as some tax provisions in 
Bill C-59 create a climate of insecurity for seniors.

<P>
	On September 28, I asked the Minister of Human Resources 
Development another question concerning programs for 
seniors:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Does the minister still intend to slash programs for seniors in order to 
finance other federal government programs?</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The minister's reply was this:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Mr. Speaker, it never was our intention, it will not be our intention, <I>la 
réponse est non</I>.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	The next day, September 29, I rose again in the House of 
Commons to say this to the Minister of Finance:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The Minister of Finance turns a deaf ear to public opinion and is using 
current consultations to deflect any questions. Senior citizens have often 
saved for years to have a decent income in their old age-</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The government wants to change the rules in the middle of the game. 
Although the minister has been stalling for several days, he will have to make 
a decision. Seniors hope he will select the only fair option: no taxation of 
RRSPs.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Bill C-59 clearly penalizes those most in need. Seniors have 
worked hard all their lives. We should be grateful to them for 
being pioneers.
<P>
	In the last budget, the federal government decided to reduce 
the age credit. All taxpayers aged 65 and up can apply for a tax 
credit equal to 17 per cent of $3,482 at the federal level and to 20 
per cent of $2,200 in Quebec. This credit is non-refundable, that 
is, it applies to the tax payable and there can be no refund on the 
excess portion.
<P>
<B>(1010) </B>
<P>
	The credit reduces federal income tax by about $610 a year for 
all seniors who have to pay income tax. In most provinces, 
including Quebec, this credit also reduces provincial income 
tax. The combined reduction of federal and provincial income 
tax averages about $950; in Quebec, it is about $1,050: $610 in 
federal tax and $440 for Quebec.
<P>
	The change made by the latest budget would reduce this credit 
for seniors whose net income exceeds $25,921, the current 
threshold for other income-dependent credits. This threshold 
will be indexed to the annual increase in consumer prices over 3 
per cent. The credit will be reduced by 15 per cent of an 
individual's net income over $25,921 and will be completely 
eliminated when his or her income reaches $49,100.
<P>
	This measure will be phased in over two years. In 1994, the 
reduction will be half the amount calculated and the total 
reduction will apply starting in 1995.
<P>
	According to the finance department, this measure will affect 
800,000 out of 2.6 million seniors, including 600,000 seniors 
whose income is between $25,921 and $49,134 and 200,000 
whose income is over $49,134.
<P>
	Although the finance department estimated that the credit 
cost the federal government $1.3 billion in 1991, the expected 
savings are as follows: $20 million in 1994-95, $170 million in 
1995-96 and $300 million in 1996-97.
<P>
	By tightening the program conditions for seniors, the 
government is just lowering their income and making them feel 
insecure.
<P>
	Furthermore, the government still stubbornly insists on 
penalizing seniors by proposing to install voice mail systems to 
answer inquiries from seniors. On May 10, I asked the minister 
responsible for seniors about using voice mail to answer 
inquiries from seniors. The minister simply told us about how 
fast the proposed service was. I explained that many seniors 
were reluctant to use this type of service, as the representative of 
the seniors' federation said clearly on their behalf. At the 
beginning of the period when we present petitions, I will have 
several petitions to table on this subject.
<P>
	On May 11, 1994, I raised the issue again by asking this 
question in the House:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-why does the federal government insists on attacking senior citizens, 
considering that most of them find it very difficult to deal with a system that 
is so impersonal?</BLOCKQUOTE>
The minister's response was both disarming and unacceptable. 
He said that the program would be more efficient and 
personalized, and that it would provide better service to seniors. 
The implementation of a centralized telephone answering 
system using voice mail to answer every request for information 
from seniors regarding government services will have a major 
impact on the quality of services provided to these people.
<P>
	The Liberal Party was the first one to oppose cuts affecting 
programs for seniors. The government did not keep its promises. 
After targeting the age credit, cutting into old age pensions, 
scaring seniors with the announcement of a review of the 
Canada Pension Plan, the government now has the audacity to 
try to tax RRSPs. Every available source of income for seniors 
will be adversely affected and the federal government does not 
guarantee anything any more to people who saved money 
throughout their lives to have decent retirement incomes.
<P>
	This fear among seniors is prevalent right across the country. I 
recently met with a delegation representing various associations 
for seniors, and I was told about their concerns regarding the 
government's proposed cuts to seniors' programs. I am referring 
more specifically to the old age pensioners' association, which 
was represented by its president, Mr. Grabke, its director of 
public relations, Mr. Ben Swankey, and its chairperson, Mrs. 
Marjory Kingsbury.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	This association is the oldest organization in English Canada 
and has nearly 10,000 members in about 100 groups throughout 
British Columbia.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8585"> 8585 </A></B>
<P>
	The position of the seniors in these groups was expressed as 
follows by their representatives.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``The position of seniors is that our generation made a lifelong 
contribution to building our country and we believe strongly 
that Canada should continue to provide a measure of security for 
seniors in their declining years''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	On December 1, here on Parliament Hill, I also met 
representatives of the coalition of seniors for social equity. The 
association which has a membership of about 500,000 senior 
citizens, submitted a brief on the income of seniors: Myth or 
Reality. The coalition expressed the need for wide ranging 
consultations and planning, involving both government and 
seniors groups, before any changes were made in the old age 
security program.
<P>
	Mr. André Lécuyer, a spokesman for francophone seniors, 
stressed that it was important to give people time to plan and 
adjust to changes in the system. According to Mr. Lécuyer, the 
public had been led to believe that the government could save 
more money than it does now, by cutting income security 
programs for seniors.
<P>
	The spokesman for the coalition and president of the Federal 
Superannuates National Association, Mr. Claude Edwards, said 
during this press conference that they were not prepared to sit 
idle at a time when the very foundation of their superannuation 
plan was cracking. He said it was like buying insurance during 
one's working life and, upon retirement, being told by the 
insurance company that the policy had been cancelled and the 
money was no longer available. Why tax seniors?
<P>
	And what about family trusts? According to some tax experts, 
wealthy Canadian families use family trusts as a special tax 
planning tool. Assets in trusts are not subject to capital gains tax 
for several decades, which means that these families are able to 
protect part of their family inheritance from one generation to 
the next. The family trust system introduced in 1972 by the 
Trudeau government, provided for the disposition of assets in 
trust after 21 years, which means in 1993, for instance, in the 
case of trusts created before 1973.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois has nothing against the principle of 
family trusts but objects to their use as tax shelters. For instance, 
the Bloc Quebecois objects to the carrying forward of capital 
gains tax to the next generation. Furthermore, we want the 
government to reveal the figures on the value of assets and 
family trusts and the amount of tax revenue lost by deferring 
capital gains.
<P>
	Why is the government so hard on the most vulnerable in our 
society who have worked all their lives and deserve a decent 
quality of life?
<P>
	Bill C-59 is unacceptable in its present form because, as a 
result of certain measures introduced in this bill, the most 
vulnerable in our society will be penalized.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Mississauga South, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
today is a sad day for parliamentarians, a sad day for Quebec and 
a sad day for Canada. Our thoughts today are with our hon. 
colleague, the Leader of the Opposition who is courageously 
fighting a very serious personal battle. I wanted to begin my 
comments by letting him know that our prayers are with him, his 
family and his children. All Canadians are with him.
<P>
<B>(1020 ) </B>
<P>
	I am pleased to join in the debate and to support Bill C-59. 
There are several aspects of the legislation and how it relates to 
our overall tax system that deserve comment and clarification.
<P>
	Let me emphasize that our government knows full well 
Canadians believe taxes are already too high and we agree with 
them. That is why our priority objectives are to stimulate 
economic growth while putting in place real fiscal discipline. It 
is this double-barrelled thrust that will ultimately allow us to 
reduce taxes in the years ahead.
<P>
	Let us remember that the tax deficit relationship is a two-way 
street. Every dollar of deficit borrowing we accept today will 
axiomatically lead to higher taxes tomorrow. Every dollar we 
can trim from the deficit, preferably through spending cuts but 
also through tax measures if need be is a step on the road to 
keeping the tax burden down.
<P>
	That is why our government's 1994 budget was in many ways 
a tax reform and a tax reduction budget. It included measures to 
eliminate loopholes and increase tax system fairness and equity. 
It also committed to direct action to bring down unemployment 
insurance premiums which is a payroll tax that acts as a real 
barrier to new job creation.
<P>
	It was also a tax reduction budget because of the firm 
commitment made by the Minister of Finance to cut the deficit 
to 3 per cent of the economy in three years. Again, let me make 
this central point. Fiscal discipline is the key to long term tax 
reductions in two key ways.
<P>
	Obviously the less we have to borrow the less we have to tax 
to repay the loan and its interest, but there is another important 
dimension to this process. Controlling government's appetite 
for debt is our fundamental tool for getting interest rates back 
down. Lower interest rates mean lower carrying costs on our 
$500 billion debt. Again that means fewer tax dollars we need to 
spend.
<P>
	I understand the concern some Canadians may feel about 
measures that add to tax revenues today in order to let us cut 
taxes in the future. We know the tax fatigue felt by so many. That 
is why the 1994 budget undertook a program of net spending 
reduction over three years. That is the most significant of any 
budget in a decade.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8586"> 8586 </A></B>
<P>
	Over 80 per cent of the net fiscal improvement delivered by 
the 1994 budget over three years comes from spending cuts. In 
other words there are $5 of spending cuts for every $1 of revenue 
increase.
<P>
	There is another aspect of our approach I must highlight. The 
net savings of $17 billion we will achieve in spending cuts 
comes after paying for our new initiatives. Some $6.7 billion in 
current federal program spending was reallocated to encourage 
growth, create jobs and to fund new priorities.
<P>
	So far I have touched on the broad budgetary context of Bill 
C-59. Now let me comment on some of the specific aspects of 
the legislation and how it relates to the tax system and to other 
issues.
<P>
	Clearly the most contentious part of the legislation is the 
measure to subject the age credit to an income test. Let me 
remind hon. members how this will work. Under the existing tax 
system Canadian seniors 65 years and over are eligible for 
special tax relief in the form of an age credit. It results in a 
combined federal-provincial tax reduction of about $950 per 
year. It is critical to note that under Bill C-59 individuals with 
net incomes below $25,921 will retain their full credit. That 
represents three-quarters of all seniors; 2.6 million seniors will 
not be affected.
<P>
	But what about the 800,000 seniors who will feel an impact? 
Like our tax system itself, the effect will be progressive. For 
individuals with net incomes above the threshold, the age 
amount will be reduced at a rate of 15 per cent of their net 
incomes exceeding $25,921. The threshold will be indexed.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	The bottom line is that most of those who will be affected will 
continue to receive partial benefits. In fact, only about 6 per cent 
of seniors, some 200,000, will no longer receive benefits 
because their incomes exceed $49,134, the threshold at which 
the benefits will be exhausted.
<P>
	Let me just step aside for a second and give a context to that 
threshold. In 1992 only 10 per cent of all Canadians filing tax 
returns had incomes over $50,000. I should also point out that 
the reduction will be phased in over two years. For 1994 the 
reduction will be one-half of the amount otherwise determined. 
As well, the age credit will remain transferable to a spouse.
<P>
	Let me now turn to the measures in Bill C-59 to eliminate the 
$100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption. As was said in the 
House yesterday, this exemption has been subject to much 
criticism. It distorts the tax system, totally exempting certain 
gains while taxing others. It also gives our tax system the real 
sense of being inequitable because it mostly benefits high 
income Canadians.
<P>
	Let me highlight just one aspect of the dilemma. In 1992 there 
were some 12,000 Canadians out of the 19.4 million tax filers 
who earned $50,000 or more yet paid no income tax. A wide 
range of allowable tax deductions  and credits made it possible 
for these people to eliminate their tax liability. Figures show 
that over 4,700 people in this group, some 40 per cent, used their 
lifetime capital gains deduction to reduce their tax payable.
<P>
	I am not suggesting that those Canadians did anything wrong. 
But there is a real public policy problem, a philosophical wrong 
at work when millions of less affluent taxpayers see those 
well-off individuals escape taxation completely.
<P>
	The bill will be an important step in helping to restore 
Canadians' faith in tax equity. It will help prevent some people 
from feeling any justification for their tax evasion, an important 
goal when the Auditor General reports billions of dollars of 
unpaid taxes.
<P>
	The issue of tax system fairness and the ability to avoid taxes 
leads me directly to other measures of Bill C-59, those related to 
the corporate sector. There are many Canadians today who feel 
that the business sector receives preferential treatment 
compared to the individual taxpayer.
<P>
	It is worth noting that people often focus on the corporate 
income tax and do not recognize the many other taxes that 
businesses must pay. They include provincial corporate income 
taxes, capital and insurance premium taxes, payroll levies such 
as UI premiums, Canada and Quebec pension plan 
contributions, workmen's compensation premiums, and 
municipal property taxes.
<P>
	In fact in 1993 Canadian corporations paid some $51 billion 
in such taxes, about $21 billion to the federal government and 
$30 billion to the provincial and municipal governments. That 
being said, the perception of corporate welfare bums still 
remains in many minds. People still read of profitable 
corporations paying no tax. They believe there are still too many 
loopholes and deductions that are not justified given our serious 
national debt problem.
<P>
	Bill C-59 takes new steps to reduce deductions and eliminate 
loopholes that were clearly violating the spirit of a fair tax 
system. For example, the bill will reduce the tax deduction for 
eligible business meals and entertainment expenses from 80 per 
cent to 50 per cent. This measure will make the tax system fairer 
by helping to ensure that all businesses, large and small, pay an 
appropriate share of tax. It also better reflects the element of 
personal consumption that we believe is inherent in such 
expenses.
<P>
<B>(1030 ) </B>
<P>
	I should reiterate a key point made by the government's 
opening speaker. This measure is consistent with recent 
reductions of business meals and entertainment expense 
deductions in Ontario, Quebec and the United States.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8587"> 8587 </A></B>
<P>
	The legislation also proposes to restrict the use of certain tax 
shelters. These are ones where limited or passive investors in a 
partnership have been able to claim tax deductible losses and/or 
to receive cash distributions that actually exceed the cost of 
their investment.
<P>
	Similarly Bill C-59 will also curtail the use of the tax 
avoidance technique known as a purchase butterfly. Let me 
remind members of how this flighty corporate provision has 
functioned.
<P>
	Current federal tax rules permit corporate property to be 
divided pro rata among its shareholders on a tax deferred basis. 
This assists the splitting up of a corporation so that the 
shareholders can continue to carry on separately the 
corporation's business.
<P>
	In recent years, unfortunately, the rules have been used to 
avoid or defer tax on the sale of corporate assets. In May 1993 
the government introduced rules to curtail cross border purchase 
butterfly transactions. Bill C-59 proposes to modify these rules 
and extend them to all purchase butterflies.
<P>
	The final measure I want to highlight is the proposal to make 
large private corporations ineligible for the small business 
deduction. In today's new economy small business is the major 
job creator. It is a sector that deserves effective targeted support.
<P>
	Unfortunately under the existing rules this support was also 
going to larger firms, companies that do not have a reasonable 
claim on the limited public and taxpayers' purse.
<P>
	The small business deduction recognizes the special 
financing difficulties and higher capital costs faced by the vital 
small business sector. The deduction lowers the basic federal tax 
rate on the first $200,000 of active business income of Canadian 
controlled private corporations from 28 per cent to 12 per cent, a 
reduction of 16 percentage points.
<P>
	This lower tax rate provides small corporations with more 
after tax income for reinvestment and expansion. Regrettably 
under the current rules, some very large corporations are also 
obtaining this benefit. The proposed rule changes will make 
large corporations, those with taxable capital of $15 million or 
more, ineligible for the small business deduction. As well, the 
rule changes will reduce the deduction for corporations having 
taxable capital between $10 million and $15 million.
<P>
	Let me acknowledge that Bill C-59 will not in itself resolve 
Canada's fiscal problems nor restore equity throughout the tax 
system. Those are the goals that will only be met by consistent, 
continuous effort, effort our government is committed to 
delivering.
<P>
	Bill C-59 does take valuable steps in both directions, 
measures to broaden the tax base for fiscal renewal and even 
more important, measures to improve the fairness and efficiency 
of the tax system itself. On both counts it deserves the full 
support of the House.
<P>
	As I said, Bill C-59 in itself is not going to change or fix all 
our problems. We do need a continuous and consistent effort to 
deal with the deficit and the debt.
<P>
	I want to spend the remaining moments of my time to review 
very briefly some of the initiatives that the government and the 
finance minister have brought forward in preparation for our 
next budget.
<P>
	On October 17, 1994, the finance minister came before the 
finance committee of the House of Commons and outlined the 
framework for economic policy. I want to remind hon. members 
of the first principles that the finance minister articulated for all 
members.
<P>
<B>(1035 ) </B>
<P>
	He said: ``First, we have one overriding goal as a government, 
that is jobs and economic growth. Second, good economic 
policy and good social policy are one and the same. Third, a 
country that is to continue to care for its citizens must be a 
country that can pay its bills, and, fourth, we need to create a 
new infrastructure for a Canada of ideas and innovation''. 
Finally he said that government itself must change. A 
government cannot or should not do everything. Responsibility 
should lie with those who are best able to do the job.
<P>
	We have had changes in the world economy. We are now in a 
strong economic recovery. Jobs are being created. The job crisis 
is not just about a recession or a cycle. It is a global epidemic. 
The world economy is truly integrated. Trade barriers are now 
gone. Communications are instant. Transportation is efficient. 
Markets never close and of course information technology is 
exploding. All this spells competition and opportunity. To be 
successful we need to upgrade our skills to fit a knowledge 
based economy. In addition we must reform our social and 
income support programs upon which so many Canadians have 
become dependent.
<P>
	The fiscal track we have been on is unsustainable, not because 
of ideology but because of its mathematical reality. The only 
answer to our job dilemma is sustained substantial economic 
growth. That growth requires improved productivity in terms of 
ingenuity, better management and paying attention to the 
common sense workers.
<P>
	High productivity increases incomes and contributes to a 
higher standard of living for all Canadians. To improve our 
productivity we must also improve our skills.
<P>
	During the social program review and in the budget review it 
has become clear that we will and we are reviewing all 
programs. Rather than trying to fix everything by ourselves we 
are also trying to facilitate solutions in partnerships with 
business, industry, and Canadians at large.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8588"> 8588 </A></B>
<P>
	We must also continue to clean up federal regulations which 
cost businesses billions of dollars. We must create a healthy 
fiscal and monetary climate. We must restore our fiscal health 
and deal with the deficit and the debt. As we know the debt is 
growing faster than the economy and that is unsustainable. As 
the finance minister and the Prime Minister have told us on so 
many occasions, our goal is to balance the budget.
<P>
	As an interim target the government is committed to reduce 
the deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by the 1996-97 year. We are 
going to hit that target.
<P>
	Finally let me highlight the principles guiding our choices in 
the 1995 budget as represented to the finance committee on 
October 18. He said that deficit reduction is an integral part of 
jobs and growth strategy. Fairness, and I stress fairness, is 
paramount so the most vulnerable in our society will not be left 
behind. Deficit reduction must be selective and strategic, 
reflecting clear priorities and not simply a mathematical across 
the board approach.
<P>
	Budgetary action should weigh on the side of cuts and 
expenditures and not increased taxes. Economic assumptions 
must be prudent to stimulate confidence that deficit targets will 
be achieved.
<P>
	We have $120 billion that the government spends on 
programs, one-third of which went to individuals in the form of 
elderly or UI benefits, transfers to Indians or to the Inuit. 
Twenty-five per cent of transfers were to other levels of 
government, ten per cent to business subsidies, international 
assistance, et cetera, and nine per cent to defence. All aspects of 
our program spending will be reviewed.
<P>
	This is the commitment of the government. This is the 
direction established by the 1994 budget. This is the direction 
supported by Bill C-59.
<P>
<B>(1040 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased today to rise for debate on Bill C-59, an act to amend the 
Income Tax Act and the income tax application rules.
<P>
	Before getting into my speech, I want to say that I am deeply 
concerned for the health and welfare of the Leader of the 
Opposition as I know all my colleagues are. I want him and his 
family to know that our thoughts and prayers are with him 
through this ordeal. We sincerely wish him the very best.
<P>
	I am going to speak against the bill today for reasons I will 
talk about later. I would like to first summarize the bill. As I do 
that I will point out the positive and negative aspects as I see 
them. I will outline why I will not support the legislation. Then I 
will briefly talk about what the government should have done 
instead of putting these changes in place.
<P>
	To summarize, the bill has 12 main points. First is the 
elimination of the $100,000 lifetime capital gains exemption. I 
believe this is the most significant change in the bill. I will 
discuss it later.
<P>
	Second, it extends employee benefits to include the first 
$25,000 of life insurance. Reform supports this measure. I 
support this measure because it harmonizes employer funded 
plans with private plans.
<P>
	The third aspect dealt with in the bill is the age tax credit. It 
reduces the amount of credit based on an individual's income 
level. It provides for income testing which I believe is 
something we need in this tough financial crisis we are facing 
right now. It provides a clawback of credits that begins at 
$26,000 and ends at $50,000 when the credit is fully clawed 
back. We support this measure because it moves away from 
universality, benefiting those most in need. This is something 
we have to move to in the times we are in.
<P>
	The fourth aspect is extending the homebuyers plan 
indefinitely for first time buyers. While I support this to some 
extent I do have some concern with it. It is discriminating 
against second and third time buyers and so on. One thing I do 
not like to see in the income tax system is measures that 
encourage and give special preference to one group and not to 
others. While I support the idea and think it will be productive, I 
do have some concerns for these reasons.
<P>
	Fifth is the area of charitable donation tax credits. It lowers 
the threshold at which the tax credit is calculated. The amount is 
now 17 per cent of the first $250 donated and 29 per cent for 
anything over $250. The change lowers the threshold for the 29 
per cent benefit to $200. This is an acceptable change.
<P>
	The sixth change is a reduction in the business meals and 
entertainment expense allowance from 80 per cent to 50 per 
cent. I support the elimination of this measure which I believe 
has been a subsidy to business to some extent. I believe the meal 
allowance is due to some extent at least a double-up on an 
expense that would normally be there in the life of other 
individuals who are not carrying out business. I agree with the 
lowering of this level to 50 per cent from 80 per cent.
<P>
	Seventh, in terms of tax shelters and partnership interests, it 
requires limiting the amount to passive partners. It really deals 
with the issue of using partnership interests for tax shelters. I 
believe this change will correct a loophole that Reform has seen 
and we support it for that reason.
<P>
	Eighth, the device of corporate recognition closes tax 
loopholes. This loophole has allowed capital gains on 
disposition of corporate assets to be avoided in certain 
circumstances. Because it is being removed we support it.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8589"> 8589 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The ninth measure, the investment in research and 
development tax credit, reduces regional disparity in certain 
credit schemes and distortions in the tax regime. Because it 
removes these disparities in the distortion we support it as well.
<P>
	The tenth amendment is the expenditure limit on scientific 
research and development. It prorates the expenditure limit for a 
Canadian controlled private corporation and is based on the 
corporation's business limit for the year. It seems that it would 
make sense although we have some concern about that as well.
<P>
	The eleventh measure reduces the small business deduction 
available to Canadian controlled private corporations with 
taxable capital over $10 million but under $15 million. These 
changes ensure that only small businesses can avail themselves 
of this deduction which was intended for small business in the 
first place. At least it is moving the deduction toward the more 
common or more accepted definition of small business. We 
support the measure for that reason.
<P>
	The final change is to the mine reclamation fund. This results 
in lower taxes and provides for environmental clean-up. It is 
something that Reform expects in any business venture. Part of 
the business analysis before start-up should involve 
environmental reclamation in the case of mines or should 
involve figuring the cost of putting the environment in as near to 
the original condition as possible. Reform supports that.
<P>
	Why does the Reform Party not support the legislation? The 
main reason is that the $100,000 capital gains tax exemption is 
being removed. This is a serious impediment to the build-up of 
wealth in Canada. To me that is a large concern.
<P>
	Yesterday and the day before I attended a conference in 
Toronto. It was called Hitting the Wall and was sponsored by the 
Fraser Institute. There were speakers from several countries 
who were seized very much with the situation in countries like 
Canada that had refused to deal with the situation until it became 
a crisis.
<P>
	One of the things that was talked about at the conference was 
the fact that it is very important to have savings in a country, 
especially a country like Canada that is seriously facing the very 
real possibility, in fact probability according to these speakers 
who had lived through this in other countries, of Canada being 
cut off in terms of bond issues to other countries.
<P>
	It is a very real possibility. I will talk a little later about how 
the different speakers dealt with this issue and their thoughts on 
it. If there comes a time, and I believe there will come a time, 
that Canada issues a bond and there are no takers, we have a 
crisis. Our savings in Canada have been declining. It used to be 
that the United States had the lowest percentage of savings in the 
OECD countries. Now Canada has surpassed the United States 
in having the lowest savings level in the OECD. The United 
States  which is notorious for having low savings now has been 
outstripped by Canada in winning that honour.
<P>
	When the time comes that we have no takers on our bonds 
from outside the country, we will then we have to rely solely on 
Canadians to finance any additional debt and to finance 
payments on our present debt. What does it mean if savings are 
decreasing? It means there is that much less money available to 
finance the new debt and the new money that Canada has to 
borrow just to continue to keep the country operating. Therefore 
there is less money available.
<P>
	Speakers at the conference made it known that it gives us less 
margin to react come the time when our bonds will no longer be 
accepted. There were speakers at the conference who deal in 
offering and buying Canadian bonds. One individual worked for 
a Japanese corporation. When asked he said that his corporation 
probably would continue to fund Canada's debt through bonds, 
but not because Canada is a good risk. In fact this gentleman said 
very clearly that Canada is a very bad risk. But his corporation 
will continue to buy bonds because Canada will pay the risk 
premium that is necessary for its investors to be willing to buy 
them.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Another reason is that the proportion of Canadian bonds held 
by this huge bonding company, of which this gentleman is the 
chief economist, is 3 per cent of its portfolio. Because of the 
high risk premium, in other words the high interest rates Canada 
must pay to maintain this foreign debt, this company will 
continue to finance these bonds for now.
<P>
	However this gentleman said there could well come a time 
when the financial situation will be so bad that Canada will not 
be able to fund our debt from without. It could be very soon. 
That is why it is extremely important we have savings in the 
country to at least tide us over until we can make some kind of an 
arrangement with the International Monetary Fund to deal with 
the crisis, get some intermediate funding and work out an 
arrangement to work through the crisis which is caused by debt 
that is out of hand and government spending which is out of 
hand.
<P>
	At this conference several things came across very clearly. 
First, most of the speakers at the conference said that Canada is 
in a very serious situation right now. Two of the speakers said 
they thought government would not deal with the problem. In 
other words they said Canada will hit the wall. It means that our 
economy and this country will go into a crisis situation. We will 
not be able to obtain financing from outside the country.
<P>
	Both of these speakers were very clear in saying that it does 
not have to be like that, but that history has shown that is what 
happens. The history of Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Chile, Mexico 
and New Zealand among other countries has shown this. These 
are countries that had well developed economies, much like 
<P>

<B><A NAME="8590"> 8590 </A></B>
<P>
Canada's. However  history has shown that governments in well 
developed countries will not deal with the problem.
<P>
	Two speakers said we are going to hit the wall, our economy is 
going to collapse. Most speakers said we do not have to. The 
telltale time will be the finance minister's next budget. If he 
comes out with a budget that cuts spending, that will lead to a 
balanced budget in a very short time, then we will avoid this 
crisis.
<P>
	These speakers were not confident that will happen. They said 
we certainly can avoid it. But this next budget is the last chance. 
They made that very clear.
<P>
	One speaker told a story about our finance minister. He said 
our finance minister had gone to the doctor because he had a 
serious hearing problem. The doctor said: ``Your hearing 
problem is directly related to the fact that you are drinking a 
little too much. You have to cut your drinking down and that will 
fix the hearing problem''. The finance minister went away and 
came back several months later. The doctor asked: ``Have you 
quit drinking?'' The finance minister said: ``Yes, I have. I did 
quit drinking but I found that what I was drinking was much 
better than what I was hearing, so I started drinking again''.
<P>
	I hope sincerely that is not the case, that is not the way the 
finance minister will react to this crisis and that he will come 
down with the budget we need next February. It is our last 
chance to avoid this crisis.
<P>
	Increases in taxation will not solve the problem. A decrease in 
government spending will. This is our last chance. Let there be 
no doubt about it.

Lac-Saint-Jean is facing.
<P>
	Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife and family as they

sincerity and dedication to his cause and those who support him.
<P>
	Good health and a loving family are far too often taken for 
granted as we deal with life each day. It is the suddenness of 
something like this that serves to remind all Canadians of how

legislation.

	The vast majority of my constituents of Parkdale-High Park

violent crimes with a gun. We welcome mandatory jail terms for 
those caught in possession of stolen or restricted firearms. All 
Canadians are pleased to see that gun smugglers will serve up to 
10 years.
<P>
	Tougher gun control is just one part of the government's

on the safety of the blood system in Canada were revealed

of consistency in the work done by Health Canada's Bureau of 
Biologics, which is responsible for controlling the quality of 
blood products and facilities at the seventeen transfusion 
centres of the Canadian Red Cross.
<P>
	This proves how reluctant the Minister of Health is to take the 
present situation seriously. The minister prefers to let the 
provinces take the blame for this mess and, instead of doing 
what she is supposed to do, has tolerated these lax procedures at

	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
in July of this year an RCMP officer in my constituency caught 
Ian David Martin crossing into Canada illegally.
<P>
	This 200-pound man lunged at the officer, knocking her down 
and wrestling away her service revolver. Just before he could 
shoot the officer a private citizen by the name of Klaus Soth 
stopped his car and intervened. Though threatened with death he 
bravely continued to reason with the assailant until they could 
both escape. Subsequently the criminal torched the police car, 
causing $41,000 worth of damage.
<P>
	For these grievous crimes he received a slap on the wrist of 15 
months. He may be paroled by Christmas. Mr. Martin also had a 
smuggled .357 magnum revolver on his person.
<P>
	If the government would have followed Reform's prescription 
a year ago and put in place automatic sentences for the 
commission of crimes while using a gun, this dangerous man 
could have been put away for years instead of months.

	<B>Mr. George Proud (Hillsborough, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
government has launched the first ever comprehensive review of 
social security programs.
<P>
	To say the least, this has been long overdue. Canadians realize 
that the social safety net no longer meets the needs of those in 
need. Not enough emphasis is placed on ending the cycle of 
dependence on poverty.
<P>
	This is particularly true in Atlantic Canada. That region 
desperately needs better access to higher education and training 
programs to help people get jobs that last.
<P>
	Atlantic Canada has a seasonal economy. Agriculture, 
tourism and fishing are our largest industries and will remain so 
for a long time. In redesigning the unemployment insurance 
program and other social programs, I urge the minister to 
remember the seasonal foundation of our economy.
<P>
	I am confident this government will design a package that will 
help us move beyond a seasonal economy and that seasonal 
workers will not be left behind.

two very important bills. Bill C-365 considered crossbows 
dangerous weapons and recommended that they be prohibited. 
Bill C-366 sought to prohibit the sale and use of replica guns 
that might be mistaken as a real weapon and used in crime.
<P>
	These bills came about as the result of major crimes in our 
community. On behalf of the victims of these crimes, in 
particular Patricia Allen's family and friends, I want to 
congratulate the Minister of Justice in committing this 
government to taking action on the banning of these two items.
<P>
	The people in my community are solidly behind the minister's 
bold, progressive and dynamic approach to addressing the issues 
of crime and community safety.

a view to accelerating fiscal consolidation the next few years.

Speaker, the Minister of Justice has indicated his desire to enact 
stringent gun control measures that will primarily affect 
law-abiding citizens and will do little to address the criminal 
use of guns.
<P>
	I fully support several measures which call for increased 
penalties for the trafficking of illegal weapons and certainty of 
sentencing for weapons offences. However, I caution the 
Minister of Justice to bear in mind that of all homicides 
committed between 1961 and 1990, less than 1 per cent were 
committed with legally owned handguns. As a result the 
registration of all firearms will be of little value in attempting to 
reduce crime and it will be the law-abiding citizens who will 
bear the brunt of this legislation.
<P>
	The reality is we have a serious crime problem, not a serious 
gun problem. The principle of the protection of life and property 
of every Canadian citizen must be the number one priority when 
considering all legislation pertaining to our criminal justice

	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> First of 
all, Mr. Speaker, before answering the hon. member's question, 
let me say that our thoughts and prayers go out to the Leader of 
the Opposition and his family. We pray that he will recover and 
regain his health. I think that I speak not only for my colleagues 
but for all Canadians.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	I was in agreement with what the Prime Minister said when he 
made the remarks quoted by the hon. member. I continue to be in 
agreement with those remarks.
<P>
	However, after the announcement of the consortium yesterday 
that they had acceded to the request of the government to review 
their decision but after doing so had decided to maintain their 
original decision, we sought legal advice. I say with some regret 
that the advice  was that the government does not have the legal 
means to do anything to change that decision.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, while everyone, including the Minister of Natural 
Resources and the Prime Minister, admits that MIL Davie was 
wronged by this appalling decision and that the Hibernia 
consortium is making a mockery of the established rules, does 
the government now intend to intervene directly so that justice 
and equity prevail?
<P>
	I recall that there were two bidders. When one of them cannot 
fulfil the contract, usually the second one is called on. Will the 
government put sufficient pressure on the board of directors?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, MIL Davie was not the only one wronged by this 
decision. I think that all other shipyards that could have bid are 
in the same position. That is why the government, in light of the 
report from the Newfoundland-Canada Offshore Petroleum 
Board, asked for a review of the initial decision.
<P>
	I am sorry to say that based on the legal opinions we have 
received we cannot insist that the call for tenders be reissued. I 
must add that a general review of all the economic spinoffs in 
this area is already in place. The government will take this 
situation into consideration to see what changes must be made in 
future to avoid a recurrence.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gilles Duceppe (Laurier-Sainte-Marie, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, let us recall the facts. The Canada-Newfoundland 
board said that only MIL Davie was wronged. First, no other 
shipyards were mentioned. Second, all the shipyards could bid. 
When Hibernia called for tenders, only two shipyards bid, 
Marystown and MIL Davie. Normally, the second one is called 
on if the first is not up to scratch.
<P>
	Remember that before he left for Paris, the Prime Minister 
clearly instructed Hibernia to review its initial decision, which 
he termed unfortunate. How does the acting Prime Minister 
explain that, although his government guarantees 50 per cent of 
the Hibernia project and is investing more than $3 billion in it, it 
cannot make the Hibernia consortium respect its decisions and 
those of the Prime Minister?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> First of 
all, Mr. Speaker, I said that not only MIL Davie but also the 
other shipyards were wronged by the decisions in question 
because all the other shipyards did not have a chance to bid on 
the work which was taken away from Marystown.

<P>
	Second, my answer was given in light of the fact that the 
previous Conservative government had passed a bill on the 
Atlantic Accord which does not give the present government the 
power to have the contract in question reopened. I am sorry but 
that is why the government is reviewing the whole program of 
economic benefits to be certain that the situation will not recur.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I wish to remind the Acting Prime Minister that the 
Bloc Quebecois was the only party to vote against the Hibernia 
legislation; the current government voted in favour.
<P>
	The Hibernia consortium, heavily subsidized with billions of 
dollars from taxpayers in Canada and Quebec, was denounced 
last week by the Canada-Newfoundland Board for violating the 
terms of the plan for awarding Hibernia contracts. By renewing 
their decision, probably with the agreement of the 
representative from Petro-Canada, 70 per cent owned by the 
federal government, the members of the Hibernia board of 
directors continue to deny justice to the MIL Davie shipyard.
<P>
	Is the government aware that by not immediately demanding 
the cancellation of the contract awarded to Saint John 
Shipbuilding, it is condoning another decision that 
discriminates against the MIL Davie shipyard?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, according to the advice I received, the government 
does not have the power to have the contract in question 
reopened but, because it wants to ensure that MIL Davie and all 
other shipyards are treated equally in this matter, the 
government has asked the consortium to review its decision. We 
regret that the consortium has decided to maintain this decision. 
As I just said, that is why we will undertake a full review of this 
system of economic benefits and do what we can so that this 
situation does not happen again.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Michel Bellehumeur (Berthier-Montcalm, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, if I understand correctly, the government has no power 
to act, but it has the power to sink billions of dollars into this 
project.
<P>
	Are we to understand that the government's refusal to take 
immediate action in this matter is intended to doom the MIL 
Davie shipyard and to satisfy its little Liberal friends in the 
maritimes?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. Herb Gray (Leader of the Government in the House 
of Commons and Solicitor General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is unfortunate that in this difficult situation the hon. 
member can do nothing but try to sow dissension and ill will 
between various parts of Canada. I think it is shameful that he 
misuses this serious situation in this way.
<P>
	This government wants to treat all involved in a fair and 
equitable fashion: MIL Davie, the shipyards in Atlantic Canada 
and everyone else concerned, and that is the way we have been 
acting. We have used the powers we have and unfortunately they 
do not extend to having the whole thing reopened. However, we 
are reviewing the whole process to try and make sure that this 
unfortunate situation does not happen again.

	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the report of the special joint committee on Canada's 
defence policy has been generally well received. There has been 
virtually unanimous support for the recommendation to 
constitute a standing joint committee on defence to monitor 
progress on defence department programs. I have been unable to 
find any reference to this committee in the white paper.
<P>
	I ask the defence minister, is this an oversight or has the 
government decided to exclude Parliament from defence 
matters?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
deliberately did not address ourselves to this particular question 
in the white paper because this is really a matter of negotiation 
between the leaders of the various parties and in the other place. 
That is something my colleague, the House leader, will 
obviously take into consideration. However, that is not within 
the ambit of defence policy.
<P>
<B>(1125 ) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, perhaps this falls into the same category, but I think the 
minister should address it.
<P>
	The committee report also recommended that except in 
extraordinary circumstances Canadian forces commitments for 
overseas tasking should not be made prior to a debate in 
Parliament.
<P>
	Canadians want to know what is involved and want to have 
more opportunity to express their opinions before our forces are 
committed overseas. The government has been better than the 
previous government, but Rwanda and Haiti had in fact been 
decided before they were brought before Parliament.
<P>
	Will the government reconsider and commit to incorporating 
this parliamentary process?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I think the 
hon. member has answered his own question, if I may say. The 
fact is this government has had debates on our peacekeeping 
engagements and I am sure the Prime Minister will continue to 
do that in future.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8596"> 8596 </A></B>
<P>
	In terms of the flexibility of having those debates, that is 
really up to the Prime Minister and the government generally. 
Again it is a representation that I am sure we will consider.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jack Frazer (Saanich-Gulf Islands, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we would very much like to see a commitment by the 
government to bring this to pass.
<P>
	The military training assistance program is one in which 
foreign military personnel are trained in concepts and 
procedures by our military. Unlike Canada, foreign military 
officers are often directly involved or very influential in their 
governments.
<P>
	In the white paper the government has committed to expand 
this program. While the training is done by the military the 
results support foreign relations, international trade or it could 
even be called foreign aid. The committee recommended that 
that defence dollars be spent only on defence.
<P>
	Will the minister confirm that the costs of the MTAP will not 
come out of the defence budget.
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, they do come 
out of the defence budget now and they obviously will in the 
future.
<P>
	I beg to differ with my friend. We believe that the bilateral 
assistance that we give to members of other armed forces is 
consistent not only with our foreign policy, but is an aspect of 
defence policy. That is something we will continue. In fact, in 
the white paper we do announce a decision which was 
communicated by the Minister of Foreign Affairs yesterday in 
Brussels to his colleagues to reduce our commitment to the 
NATO infrastructure budget so that some of those funds which 
now do not come back to Canada, because Canada has given one 
of the largest shares and has probably the lowest payback, will 
be used for bilateral training at our Lester B. Pearson 
Peacekeeping Institute in Cornwallis, Nova Scotia, involving 
specifically those countries in the Partnership for Peace 
Program from eastern Europe.

	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence. The war is 
more intense than ever in Bosnia. After the visit of the UN 
Secretary-General to Sarajevo ended in failure, Bosnian Serbs 
took more peacekeepers hostage in a raid in Croatia. They are 
pursuing their assault on Bihac and continue to block 
humanitarian relief convoys. It is even reported that, today, they 
fired missiles on Sarajevo.
<P>
	Does the minister confirm these reports? And can he give us 
an update on the situation in the former Yugoslavia, especially 
as the conflict may well spread to Croatia now?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we did not 
get any dramatically different news from the former Yugoslavia 
today than we got yesterday except that there are some hopeful 
signs. Some convoys, I believe involving British and Dutch, 
have been allowed to proceed. So they are not being detained.
<P>
	Discussions are under way concerning our Canadian 
peacekeepers that have been detained. As I have said publicly, 
those people who are detaining them from the Bosnian-Serb 
side are not unknown to our forces. There is a good rapport 
between them. While it is obviously becoming much more 
worrying and frustrating for everyone concerned, especially the 
families, we have no reason to believe that the situation 
involving our own peacekeepers has deteriorated substantially.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
contact group is scheduled to meet today in Brussels to develop 
a new diplomatic approach. Can the minister tell us what 
Canada's preference would be in terms of such an approach and 
whether or not he supports the idea that was put forward, to let 
the Bosnian Serbs form a confederation with Serbia?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this gets a 
little out of my realm. Perhaps my colleague, the Secretary of 
State for Foreign Affairs, who is here, would like to address it 
subsequently.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	As far as we are concerned it is time to take a fresh look at 
negotiations for a settlement in the former Yugoslavia. 
Obviously the settlement the contact group came up with earlier 
this summer is unacceptable, at least to the Bosnian Serb side.
<P>
	We need some fresh thinking. Whether or not Canada is part 
of the contact group we are kept informed. We have indirect 
input. I hope that Canada can play a more prominent role in

<P>
	In the finance hearing, the Canadian Chamber of Commerce,

<P>
	My question is for the Minister of Finance. Does he believe 
this is realistic at this point in time?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the government 
continues to be committed to its deficit reduction target. Its 
interim target is 3 per cent of GDP in the third year of its 
mandate. It is definite. It is clearly the Minister of Finance's 
response to this. It is clearly on the agenda and we will certainly 
make that target.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ray Speaker (Lethbridge, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the pillar 
of the Liberal Party is the red book. On page 20 of that book it 
says that there will be a balanced budget, but it also says that it is 
unrealistic to do it five years. It is time the government puts on 
the table what is a proper time line. Could the minister indicate 
to the House when the budget will be balanced?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the interim target 
is within two years now. It is important for the government to 
meet its targets on a year by year basis.
<P>
	It is important to restore the confidence of the financial 
markets in the ability of the government to meet its targets. 
There is no point in putting forward a target that is unreachable 
such as the Reform Party has done in the past. It is important to 
put forward targets that are reachable and attainable to ensure 
we have the financial market's support.

	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of National Defence.
<P>
	The minister tabled yesterday, and rather hastily, his white 
paper on defence, which is in fact a botched job, a spur of the 
moment job, a paper characterized throughout by a 
backward-looking vision and lacking any real, meaningful 
direction.
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that the hurried tabling of his 
white paper has deprived the government of practical proposals 
with respect to NATO, NORAD and the UN and thus provides no 
real vision of the future?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I cannot 
believe the hon. member made this assertion. I can only assume 
he has not read the white paper. As has been pointed out by the 
critic for the Reform Party, the white paper has been very well 
received.
<P>
	As to the timing, we always said we would try to table the 
document before Christmas. We are cognizant of the fact that 
going into the holiday season people are preoccupied with other 
matters and we wanted to give Parliament and Canadians a good 
time to reflect on it.
<P>
	Again the hon. member is indirectly reflecting on the work of 
the special joint committee on defence. I know his party had a 
dissenting report, but there were three other parties including a 
party not represented in the House officially, but represented in 
the Senate-which shall remain nameless-that all agreed with 
the report. We have taken the core of that report, almost all the 
recommendations, and we have embellished them. I believe that 
if the hon. member reads the document he will see it does set out 
a clear vision for defence policy in the 21st century.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Philippe Paré (Louis-Hébert, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
knowing that the development of any defence policy is really 
only possible when it is keyed to a clear foreign policy, how can 
the minister suggest and maintain that he has a clear vision of 
the future, when his white paper was tabled before the 
government even had the chance to announce the new thrust of 
its foreign policy?
<P>
<B>(1135) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> It is true, Mr. Speaker, that 
defence policy is to some degree an instrument of foreign policy 
but not exclusively so. There are constitutional requirements 
made of the armed forces which do not fall into the foreign 
affairs category. The whole question of protecting Canada 
offshore, around its coasts, aid to the civil power, are domestic 
considerations to protect Canada's interest.
<P>
	With respect to the substance of the question on why we have 
done this now as opposed to doing it jointly with a foreign policy 
report, the government felt that with all of the rapid changes, 
especially reductions, being faced by the armed forces we owed 
it to all those in the forces, both civilian and uniform personnel, 
to give some clear indication of where we are going as quickly as 
possible, but also to set in motion some of the equipment 
purchases for which we have a dramatic need.
<P>
	The defence white paper and its security review coincide with 
the recommendations of the joint committee on foreign policy, 
the joint committee on defence policy and was developed in

who is quite comfortable with it.

<P>
	The Reform Party is committed to ensuring that every 
Canadian citizen receive essential health care services in a 
timely fashion regardless of income. The presence of private 
medical clinics would allow this by decreasing waiting lists and 
decreasing pressure on the public system.

Act and threatening to penalize Alberta for trying to provide 
better health care for all of its citizens?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary

of Commons, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, at the meeting of November 
28 the Minister of Health advised that she would be providing a 
clarification of our interpretation of the Canada Health Act to all 
provinces in the very near future.
<P>
	The minister has repeatedly maintained that the Canada 
health system is the best system in the world. The rest of the

the other provinces are doing, to continue to protect and develop 
this wonderful system.
<P>

tragically we do not any more. I hope no one in the House has to 
find that out.

this by cutting transfer payments and not Ontario?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Alfonso Gagliano (Secretary of State (Parliamentary

	<B>Mr. René Laurin (Joliette, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is 
for the Minister of National Defence. In spite of the disastrous 
state of public finances, the Minister of National Defence has 
drawn up an extensive shopping list. Indeed, he wants to buy 
new armoured personnel carriers, new land helicopters, new 
remote controlled weapons, and even new submarines. Yet, the 
white paper  tabled yesterday does not include any concrete 
measure to eliminate the waste of some $100 million disclosed 
by the Auditor General in his recent report.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that his white paper totally 
ignores the Auditor General's recommendations and that his 
department still does not implement better management 
practices to cut spending and save money?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I do not think 
the hon. member has read the report.
<P>
	The white paper talks about improvement of administrative 
practices, of saving money, of privatizing certain functions such 
as maintenance and things of that nature, all of which have been 
advocated by the Auditor General over the years. In addition, 
administrative measures have been announced recently that are 
ongoing and meet the Auditor General's requirements.
<P>
<B>(1140) </B>
<P>
	On the question the hon. member raises about a so-called 
shopping list, the fact is, and let us be frank about it, we are 
either in the defence business or we are not. If we are in the 
defence business we cannot have our armed forces personnel ill 
equipped. There is agreement both in the parliamentary 
committees and across the country that we have to equip our 
armed forces better.
<P>
	In the case of the armoured personnel carriers I do not think 
there is any argument that these are justified. In the case of 
helicopters we always knew that the search and rescue 
helicopters would have to be replaced. It is a civilian role, not 
purely military.
<P>
	As to the question of the helicopters on the ships that is 
something that was recommended by the special joint 
committee and something we can fully justify.

the procurement programs of the defence department?

	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member 
should understand that the human rights commission is an 
independent body which is not under the control or direction of 
the government or any minister thereof.
<P>
<B>(1145) </B>
<P>
	The commission is obligated by law to make up its own mind 
based on its own investigation and the exercise of its own 
independent judgment with respect to those matters to refer to 
tribunals for hearing. We would not want it any other way. There 
must be independence.
<P>
	While she may ask me as the minister responsible to the 
House for the Human Rights Act and its administration to speak 
to matters of structure or of the human rights system, I do not 
direct the commission in what decisions to make or what matters 
to undertake in terms of hearings.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Sharon Hayes (Port Moody-Coquitlam, Ref.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the minister for that response. I do feel the 
minister has made it clear he is convinced that there is wide 
support for this issue.
<P>
	I challenge the minister today, as he is unwilling to challenge 
the Human Rights Commission, will he not agree if he thinks 
there is so much support to allow a free vote on this issue so that 
the real will of the people on this issue can be expressed?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Justice and Attorney 
General of Canada, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is a separate 
question and I understand it is separate. I am prepared to deal 
with that as a matter for which I am responsible, that is to say 
whether the Human Rights Act should be amended to add certain 
words. That is my responsibility.
<P>
	We are dealing with commitments made by the Prime 
Minister and by me, not so much based on polling for support 
but based on principles and what is right, on fundamental 
justice.
<P>
	The amendment which is under discussion has to do with 
adding sexual orientation as a ground on which discrimination is 
prohibited. I would have thought that on that principle, that is to 
say whether discrimination should be prohibited against 
somebody only on the basis of their sexual orientation, there is 
not much debate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8600"> 8600 </A></B>
<P>
	On the subsidiary questions, separate questions, of whether 
there should be same sex benefits or whether there should be this 
or that form of marriage, those are entirely separate. We are not 
proposing any amendments to deal with those. We are talking 
about discrimination and it is on that issue I would have thought 
there is not a great deal of controversy.

	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Minister of National Defence. 
The minister's new procurement policy, which consists in 
buying equipment already operational and available on the 
world market, will have harmful consequences on the Canadian 
defence industry.
<P>
	In his white paper tabled yesterday, the minister recognizes 
that it is vital to promote defence conversion, but no concrete 
solutions are proposed.
<P>
	How can the minister explain that his white paper does not 
contain any concrete initiatives on defence conversion, given 
the clear commitment made in the red book?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
colleague, the Minister of Industry, will talk perhaps on a 
supplementary on the matter dealing with conversion 
specifically as announced in the white paper.
<P>
	With respect to the capital purchases that we have announced, 
we do have in Canada the capacity to build armoured personnel 
carriers. One company has served the Canadian and foreign 
markets quite well, the General Motors diesel division in 
London, Ontario. Many components are built across the country 
including in the member's home province of Quebec.
<P>
	In terms of the helicopters, I have to emphasize that while this 
could in all likelihood come from external sources, much of the 
work with respect to avionics, electronics and integrated 
systems probably would all be done in Canada because anybody 
who wants to sell to a country like Canada equipment of such 
cost knows that it is in the best interest of being competitive to 
source a lot of that work in Canada. I do believe that the 
equipment purchases will not have the effect the hon. member 
says.
<P>
	Finally, with respect to the submarines, I covered that 
yesterday. This is simply a matter of exploring whether this is a 
good deal for Canada. That question will be looked at very 
carefully before a decision is taken.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Réal Ménard (Hochelaga-Maisonneuve, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, obviously the minister did not answer my question. I 
hope his wife will remind him of that.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	Does the minister not realize that the existing defence 
material program, DIPP, of which only a part concerns defence 
conversion, is clearly insufficient, and that he must show 
leadership with his colleagues from Industry and Public Works 
to implement a true conversion strategy for that industry?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry, Lib.): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, as always, it is very hard to figure out what the Bloc 
wants.
<P>
	First, one member tells us not to buy military equipment 
because it is a waste, and then one of his colleagues says that we 
must save the defence industry.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	It is always a little hard for me to understand quite where this 
party is coming from. Its two wings do not always beat at the 
same pace.
<P>
	The fundamental issue that we need to deal with is the use of 
the existing program DIPP as a defence conversion program. As 
the hon. member knows, of the 41 applications approved by this 
government under DIPP so far 39 have been for civilian or dual 
use purposes. Clearly that has been the key tool in assisting 
industries in their defence conversion.
<P>
	More important, and I have said this repeatedly and I hope 
other members understand how important this is, the 
government's strategy in helping the Canadian industries in all 
sectors is not to throw money at them. It is to provide them with 
the strategic advice and assistance that will enable them to be 
competitive in the world markets. That is the key to their 
success.

	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
week marks the end of the 30-day discussion period between the 
U.S. and Canada on proposals made by the U.S. department of 
agriculture that all Canadian grain shipments to the United 
States must go to a feed lot, a feed mill or an end user and require 
an end user certificate.
<P>
	What have we heard from the minister of agriculture on this 
issue? Silence.
<P>
	My question to the minister is what action has the minister 
taken on this issue which is a direct violation of the August 1 
Canada-U.S. grain pact on wheat which specified that neither 
country would introduce any new trade restricting measures 
until the deal's one-year term ended?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, to the member 
across the way, he should get his facts straight. The United 
States has not yet made its decision on whether it is going to put 
end use certificates in place.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="8601"> 8601 </A></B>
<P>
	We have expressed to the United States our views on that. It 
knows our views and we will await its action as far as end use 
certificates.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leon E. Benoit (Vegreville, Ref.):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
expected, the minister has done absolutely nothing on this issue. 
The United States has not made the decision yet therefore it is 
not urgent.
<P>
	Why has the government done nothing? I would expect that 
the reason is that it could be wanting to protect the Canadian 
Wheat Board at the expense of farmers. For the Canadian Wheat 
Board end user certificates only involve slight inconvenience, 
while for the farmers it will put an end to their market in the 
United States.
<P>
	Why has the minister once again chosen to avoid the real issue 
which is reform of the Canadian Wheat Board, a change which 
he has acknowledged farmers want, by letting American foreign 
policy solve the problems for him here at home?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I again remind 
the hon. member that the United States has not yet made the 
decision that he would obviously like it to make. It should be 
pointed out that he has made that assumption and western wheat 
growers and farmers should note that.
<P>
	I repeat, the Canadian government and the minister have 
made our views very clear to the United States as far as how we 
would view its imposition of end use certificates. That 
discussion will continue and we will await its reaction to our 
views.

	<B>Mr. Raymond Bonin (Nickel Belt, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, many

possible for the rich to invest in order to avoid paying taxes.
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	My question is for the Minister of National Revenue. Can the 
minister tell my constituents what he is doing to ensure that all 
Canadians pay their fair share of taxes?
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Anderson (Minister of National Revenue, 
Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the hon. member for 
his concern on this very important issue.
<P>
	The Minister of Finance and I issued yesterday a press release 
outlining changes to the tax system that will plug loopholes with 
respect to tax shelters. We are particularly concerned that there 
are many people who are taking advantage of what were 
originally set up as legitimate opportunities in high risk areas. 
They are now taking these opportunities simply to avoid paying 
taxes.
<P>
	For example, we have uncovered tax shelters where no 
business activity was being undertaken and the only thing the 
individual received in return for their investment was a 
brochure; that is, the only thing other than a tax benefit of 
substantial proportions.
<P>
	We will continue to make sure that the tax system is fair for 
Canadians and we will make changes as necessary to make sure 
that all Canadians pay their fair share.

	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies, 
BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in his white paper the defence minister 
claims that he is going to save $7 billion over the next five years. 
Yet the minister is planning to buy numerous helicopters, 
submarines and a good deal more. In short, the Department of 
National Defence is embarking on an unjustified equipment 
purchase program which will be the source of additional waste.
<P>
	Since today's international context does not justify new 
capital expenditures, how can the defence minister explain, in 
view of the present fiscal restraints, the planned purchases listed 
in his white paper?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of National Defence and 
Minister of Veterans Affairs, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, there has 
always been in the capital program of national defence spanning 
a 15-year period the need to replace certain types of equipment. 
Those allocations were made.
<P>
	Over the last number of budgets, including those of the former 
government, $21 billion has been cut off the projected 
expenditures for national defence, including a lot of the capital 
program.
<P>
	We announced yesterday that we will be cutting $15 billion 
out of the capital program over the next 15 years for planning 
purposes. With respect to helicopters, I am surprised that the 
hon. member would make the assertion that we do not need to 
replace helicopters when he knows that the Sea Kings and the 
Labradors are coming to the end of their life.
<P>
	Even if he does not agree that our state of the art ships and our 
refurbished destroyers should not have combat helicopters on 
board, surely he, from a province that has a coastline and uses 
the search and rescue facility, has to agree that the Government 
of Canada will be committing a grievous error if we did not 
make provision for new equipment even on the search and 
rescue end which is purely civilian.

<P>
	The number of Canadians unemployed is still too high but it is

determined how many of the new jobs are worthwhile, 
rewarding and full time jobs as opposed to part time jobs?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Douglas Peters (Secretary of State (International 
Financial Institutions), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, that is good news 
for Canada. This raises to over 400,000 the number of new jobs 
that have been created in this country this year alone. All these 
jobs are full time jobs. Indeed, last month there was a growth in 
employment of some 95,000 new jobs. All those were full time 
jobs. There was an actual drop in part time employment.
