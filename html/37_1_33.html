</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Adams (Peterborough, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
through the supporting community partnerships and $305 million, 
the federal government is assisting community groups with 
problems of homelessness.  The government pays 50% of project 
costs, matched by local money, volunteers and time.  In 
Peterborough, this amounts to almost half a million dollars. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Equally important, the government is working to help the 
homeless directly.  For example, in Peterborough various federal 
programs have supported the John Howard Society and its work for 
unemployed youth.  The CMHC works with it providing permanent and 
temporary shelter, and the federal co-ops and the first nations 
groups continue their fine work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As another example, HRDC has been able to assist with forums on 
homelessness and with a local housing resource centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Homelessness is not simply a matter of lack of shelter.  Of 
course every person should have a roof over his or her head, but 
while providing shelter we should work hard to solve the various 
problems that cause people to live on the streets.  Let us 
continue to make this a national priority.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Val Meredith (South Surrey—White Rock—Langley, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, Senator Max Baucus of Montana, who 
has led the attack on the Canadian softwood lumber industry, now 
claims that lax Canadian forestry practices and environmental 
protection amount to a subsidy for Canadian producers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada does not have to take a back seat to anyone in the world 
in forest management.  Unlike their American counterparts, our 
foresters can actually light a controlled fire without burning 
the entire state of New Mexico.  Did anyone hear Senator Baucus 
object when imported Canadian firefighters spent last summer 
saving the forests in his home state? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the environment, not only does British Columbia contain 
designated parkland that is almost the size of the entire state 
of Montana, we have many species of wildlife, which have been 
driven to extinction in the American west.  If Senator Baucus is 
truly concerned about endangered species, perhaps he should try—

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Sue Barnes (London West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this 
August the cities of London, St. Thomas and Woodstock, along with 
the village of Grand Bend and the University of Western Ontario, 
will hold the first Canada Summer Games of the new millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is expected that 5,000 athletes, coaches, managers and 
technical officials from 650 different Canadian communities will 
take part in the summer games.  They will compete as members of 
13 teams representing our 10 provinces and three territories.  We 
will welcome Nunavut for the first time into the Canada games 
family. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In full collaboration with a number of partners, including the 
Government of Canada, and building on the experience of previous 
game hosts and the community itself, the London Alliance will 
advance the Canada games legacy of building Canadian unity, 
fostering personal excellence through sport and enriching 
community life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to wish all involved the best and to congratulate 
them on their hard work and preparation.  I welcome Canadians to 
London, Ontario, and different venues in my region.

<P><A NAME="LINK9"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Scarborough—Rouge River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, Norouz, which means new day, marks the beginning of 
the Iranian New Year, celebrated on March 21.  Norouz has 
always begun precisely with the passing of the sun into the 
vernal equinox and marks the arrival of spring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically, Norouz was introduced and celebrated by an 
ancient Persian emperor, Jamshid.  Others have credited the 
Achaemenid Persian dynasty in 12 BC for the festival.  Today it 
is celebrated as New Year's Day by millions of Canadians, 
regardless of their religious beliefs.  Iranian, Afghani, Parsi, 
Ismaili and other communities all celebrate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is much we can learn from such an ancient and wonderful 
tradition still celebrated after 3,000 years.  Joy and happiness 
were always regarded as major forces defeating the hostile 
spirits and Norouz has always been considered a time of change 
and renewal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This day of celebration forms part of the heritage of millions 
of Canadians of many cultures.  Perhaps March 21 should be called 
Norouz Heritage Day.  Let me say happy new year to everyone and 
invite them to enjoy the festival.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Hélène Scherrer (Louis-Hébert, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, UNESCO has 
designated today as World Poetry Day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the great 
poets who have left their mark on our literary history.  I am 
thinking of Émile Nelligan, Alain Grandbois, Saint-Denys Garneau, 
Anne Hébert and Marie-Claire Blais, to name just a few. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the perfect opportunity for us to rediscover this art, 
this creative use of words.  I urge everyone to renew their 
acquaintance with our poets.  Their poetry has marked our 
history and continues to mark the era in which we live. 
I urge people to discover or rediscover their poems, and laugh, 
cry, reminisce and reflect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also like to take this opportunity to encourage 
Canadians to express their feelings through the medium of words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and my colleagues hope that this day will also highlight 
Canadian art generally.  The works of our artists help to 
strengthen our feeling of belonging to Canada, and our pride in 
who we are.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Diane Ablonczy (Calgary—Nose Hill, Canadian

all hon. members to a special person in our West Block post 
office, Mr. J.P. Leblanc.  J.P. has just achieved 35 years of 
service on the Hill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>J.P. began his career on Parliament Hill in 1966 as a page in 
the House of Commons and at the same time attended school to 
complete his education.  He then transferred to the committees 
and private legislation branch, during which he travelled 
extensively across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>J.P. moved to the post office branch in 1973, where he became 
well respected for his courteous and friendly manner toward 
everyone.  If he could do it all over again, would he choose to 
work on the Hill?  J.P. says that he definitely would. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He represents the best of the many dedicated and hard-working 
staff who help ensure that the Parliament of Canada functions 
smoothly.  I would like to say best wishes to J.P. and tell him 
that we wish him well as he continues his excellent work for the 
House of Commons.

Liberal government for its steadfast support of supply 
management, a system that provides many family farms in my riding 
and across Canada with stability and profitability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The stable environment provided by supply management encourages 
investment and research into better production practices. 
Consumers benefit from top quality chicken, eggs and dairy 
products at a very reasonable price.  Supply management works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has defended its system of supply management at the 
international level and won.  I call upon the government to 
continue its support for supply management and to ensure a bright 
future for our family farms and the top quality products they 
produce.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Christiane Gagnon (Québec, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, in 1999 UNESCO 
designated March 21 as World Poetry Day, a day on which to give 
fresh recognition to international poetry movements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although there are many forms of artistic expression, painting, 
song, film, photography, writing, sculpting with clay, everyone 
would agree that there is no art without poetry, as the 
celebrated French painter Eugène Delacroix was so fond of 
saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the ways in which culture is expressed is through words. 
Poetry is one of the mediums available to us for expressing who 
we are, what we are experiencing and feeling, and particularly 
what we wish to become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Who better than our poets to illustrate the truth of this? 
Gilles Vigneault captured it very well:

International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The day was created to raise public awareness and to overcome 
racism in all of its forms.  It enables us to change a page of 
our history and move forward from the centuries of conflict and 
suffering caused by racism and intolerance throughout the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Despite the fact that countries everywhere admire Canada for the 
open-mindedness and respect Canadians have for each other, we 
still need to continue to take steps against racism. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Laws may have changed, but the battle is not yet won.  One need 
only think of the aboriginal people and visible minorities to 
realize this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon members of this House to reaffirm their convictions 
about the equality of all human beings and their support of 
Canadian multiculturalism.

French culture is in good health in western Canada and the

</I></B></P><P align=left>When Canadians think about the francophonie, their thoughts turn 
to the east and the French culture of Quebec and New Brunswick. 
There is, however, a flourishing culture in Canada's west, in 
Alberta and in Legal, Alberta, in particular. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The pride its people take toward their heritage is such that 
they have undertaken to make their city Canada's capital of 
French mural art. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Murals on French culture have begun to appear on the walls of 
numerous buildings.  The citizens of Legal invite francophones 
and all Canadians to come and celebrate their heritage with 
them.

will the maritime accord which exempts producers in the four 
Atlantic provinces from the quotas applied through the agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the four premiers of Atlantic Canada stated in a letter given 
to the Prime Minister, “failure to continue the current 
agreement would have a devastating impact on our region's 
softwood lumber industry”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Atlantic Canada has not been targeted in the softwood lumber war 
with the U.S. on every occasion since 1987.  Why?  Because 
maritime timber is sold competitively in an open market and is 
harvested from private, not crown, lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even certain U.S. congressional leaders have said and understand 
that a Canadian solution to the softwood lumber issue should 
incorporate Canadian regional circumstances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I urge the Government of Canada to renew the maritime accord and 
to hear the chorus of provincial maritime ministers, like Peter 
Mesheau of New Brunswick, calling for action to protect maritime 
softwood lumber.

personal ethics trainer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberals claim that the letter, which of course was written 
and paid for by the Prime Minister's former business partners, 
clears him.  Actually it proves nothing.  The only way we will 
get to the bottom of this Grand-Mère affair is if all of the 
relevant documents are released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why is the Minister of Industry still refusing to release the 
names that appear on the shareholder registry that shows who was 
the fourth shareholder between 1996 and 1999?  Why will he not 
just release it? 
<P><A NAME="LINK33"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition has been part of a demand 
for the ethics counsellor to investigate this matter.  The ethics 
counsellor has done so and, as recently as yesterday, said 
clearly again that the Prime Minister was not in any conflict. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition was part of a demand for the RCMP 
to investigate this matter.  The RCMP did investigate and closed 
the books because there was no basis for an investigation.  The 
Leader of the Opposition asked that the company release the names 
of the shareholders and, by the way, independent verification is 
being sought today with respect to that list.  That information 
is forthcoming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say it is time for the Leader of the Opposition to get back to 
the real business of Canada.

want the Minister of Industry to get his shorts and his socks in 
a knot.  I am just asking a basic question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We never asked that these names be released by the company.  We 
asked that the ethics trainer for the Prime Minister release from 
the corporate registry the names of the shareholders.  We still 
do not have them.  Whose names were on there between 1996 and 
1999?  That is all we are asking.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Brian Tobin (Minister of Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

got in a knot when he got sued for $800,000 for making sarcastic, 
wrong and false comments about another individual. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The gentleman talks about ethics, but it was his party that paid 
$50,000 to bring about a byelection and still has not produced 
the money.  It is that party that accepted $70,000 from a law 
firm that benefited from the very suit for which the member was 
found guilty.  The member has no room to lecture this Prime 
Minister on ethics, none whatsoever.

the sale of the shares had not gone through.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me quote from what the ethics counsellor said yesterday, 
less than 24 hours ago.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am satisfied that the prime minister had no personal interest 
at stake when he assisted the auberge in its applications before 
the Business Development Bank.

</I></B></P><P align=left>He went on to say that the golf course ceased to have an 
interest in the auberge in mid-1993 and that the Prime Minister 
ceased to have a financial interest in the golf course in 
November 1993.

names were on the registry between 1996 and 1999? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister is shaking his head.  He wishes this would go 
away.  The future hopeful leader is wishing it would go away. 
That is a lot of baggage to carry.

consult.  We consult trade unions.  We consult business.  We 
consult universities.  We consult people all over the place, but 
they do not have access to the special negotiation text.

nothing to do with either the golf course or the hotel...The debt 
that was owed to me...was in the hands of a blind trust.  I have

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
the carefully crafted letter of evasion tabled yesterday is most 
significant for what it hides.  It says that a transfer of shares 
was approved.  It carefully does not say that a transfer of 
shares occurred.  In fact, it affirms that the so-called 
purchaser, Akimbo, was never listed as an owner of the shares. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concrete proof can the Prime Minister offer the House that 
a transfer of shares actually occurred?  If he has any proof at

foreign money was being brought into the Conservative Party.  He

to advise the House, because in fact I checked in anticipation of

release that letter.  That consent was received, because I

<P><A NAME="LINK77"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Francine Lalonde (Mercier, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, this answer is

Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is well aware that several

engaging in protectionism, of keeping southern countries behind 
and of imposing on them a way of doing things that slows down 
their economic development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feel that, through trade, we must allow these countries to 
improve their access to the global economy, thus strengthening 
their own economic development. However, we must also make

enforcement issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish there were simple and easy answers to this question. 
Canada's approach again reflects the balance that is required. It

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, when the Liberals were elected in 1993 the Canadian

that the military now faces a significant shortfall below the 
government commitment of 60,000 and still dropping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the minister tell the House today, first, how many members 
there are in the Canadian forces on the active list?  Second,

<P><A NAME="LINK111"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the defence white paper of 1994 calls for 60,000 
regular force troops, plus a number of other civilians and a 
number of others in the reserve force.  We intend to continue to 
work toward that level and try to maintain that level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a shortage now because of attrition.  We are in fact 
going on a recruitment campaign to make up those numbers. 
<P><A NAME="LINK112"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Leon Benoit (Lakeland, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the minister's answer conflicts with a recent study 
which said that in fact Canada's military is now 4,000 short, but 
it will be a startling 17,000 members short by the end of 2002 if 
the current trend continues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister will go down in history as the man responsible for 
killing Canada's military through funding cuts, through delayed 
equipment replacement, and now through a critical shortage of 
personnel.  Is the reason for this critical loss in personnel the 
weakness of the minister, or is it a deliberate plan on the part 
of the government to destroy Canada's military?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Art Eggleton (Minister of National Defence, Lib.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the hon. member has his numbers all wrong, as he 
usually does.  He is extrapolating very extreme cases where there 
is no intention of the government to see that happen at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has made a very clear commitment that we want to 
make sure we keep the Canadian forces in a position where they 
are able to contribute to international peace and security and to 
carry out the will of the government and the people of this 
country in their desire to create peace and security in the 
world.  We will continue to do that.  We will continue to follow 
the white paper defence policy of parliament.

transgression for which I apologize not only to you, Mr. Speaker, 
but also to the House and to the nation whose interests I serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While certainly I meant no disrespect in my action, all

</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament's rules are to be respected because they are written

</I></B></P><P align=left>I hereby submit my person to the penance of the Chair, and ask

certainly do not stand here to challenge, nor do I seek changes 
to, the rules.  My hope is to be forgiven by the Chair, before 
the witnesses in the House, and in front of my colleagues.  The 
essence of the House is honour.  I would never intentionally 
dishonour the House or its procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Of course the Chair is anxious to forgive 
any transgressions that hon. members make, but I want to draw to 
the attention of all hon. members the provision in our rules that 
deals with the recognition of visitors in the gallery. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 239 of Marleau and Montpetit, which I know almost 
everyone keeps under his or her pillow, it states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only from the Speaker's gallery can distinguished visitors (such 
as heads of state, heads of government and parliamentary 
delegations invited to Canada) be recognized and introduced to

</I></B></P><P align=left>During a sitting, the Speaker may draw the attention of the House 
to the presence of distinguished visitors seated in the gallery

</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been departed from on occasion.  The hon. member for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey (Cumberland—Colchester, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
yesterday the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in London, 
England a fundamental change in foreign policy for Canada.  In 
question period today the parliamentary secretary confirmed it to 
members of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No advance notice was given to members of parliament and no 
notification was given to the foreign affairs committee.  It 
continues to be the ongoing practice to notify the media before 
notifying members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take objection to this and, if you, Mr. Speaker, find a bona

motion to discontinue this practice. 
<P><A NAME="LINK127"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I must say to the hon. member that 
ministers make speeches here, there and everywhere, and so do 
hon. members.  Some of us travel and make speeches in some places 
and there is always the risk that there might be an announcement 
in one of our speeches about something or other that is not made 
in the House first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not want the point of order I dealt with the other day to 
be misconstrued.  It was quite specific and dealt with a press 
conference held before the introduction of a bill that was to be 
tabled in the House.  However statements by ministers can be made 
outside the House, and have been made outside the House, and have 
not incurred the displeasure of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know the hon. member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is an 
expert on the subject.  He has raised these kind of points 
frequently in the House.  Perhaps he and the member for 
Cumberland—Colchester can consult on the point because I think 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough is thoroughly 
familiar with the views of the Chair on the issue.  I have ruled 
on several of his points of order already and I do not think 
there is a question of privilege or a point of order in the issue 
raised today.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I will endeavour to reach her later this afternoon.  As we

respond to what the hon. member has raised. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  It is clear the minister is not here to

Commons and the Senate, were established for the enactment of 
laws, those events necessarily incidental to the enactment of 
laws are part of the “proceedings in Parliament”.  However, 
Parliament has also always been a forum to receive petitions, and 
the Crown's satisfying the grievances of members before granting 
supply eventually led to straightforward requests for 
information.  Therefore, the events necessarily incidental to 
petitions, questions, and notices of motions in Parliament in the 
seventeenth century and today are all events which are part of 
“proceedings in Parliament”.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Maingot went on to say: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Privilege of Parliament is founded on necessity, and is those 
rights that are “absolutely necessary for the due execution of 
its powers.”  Necessity then should be a basis for any claim 
that an event was part of a “proceeding in Parliament,” i.e., 
what is claimed to be part of a “proceeding in Parliament” and 
thus protected should be necessarily incidental to a “proceeding 
in Parliament.”

</I></B></P><P align=left>On page 72 of a 1939 report from the Select Committee on the 
Official Secrets Act, it states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—a proceeding in Parliament covers both the asking of a question 
and the giving written notice of such a question. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has been seeking for two years, through the daily 
question period, evidence regarding the Prime Minister's stake in 
161341 Canada Inc.  The Minister of Industry promised members of 
the House that the information was coming.  The appearance of the 
ethics counsellor at the Standing Committee on Industry yesterday 
was used as a follow up to the questions in the House and to the 
promise given by the industry minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Opposition asked the ethics counsellor: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will the Corporations Directorate be communicating to the 
minister, and to you, the name of any fourth shareholder, whether 
it's Jonas Prince, whether it's the Prime Minister himself, 
whether it's some other person?  Will they actually be 
communicating that to you so that the House can determine if the 
Prime Minister had a conflict of interest or not? 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To which the ethics counsellor replied: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I expect that the Corporations Directorate will be responding to 
my letter.  I'm not sure exactly when that will take place.  But 
what my intention is, as I indicated to you in my interim reply, 
once I have that in hand, I will be responding directly to you 
and I am quite confident that will remove any lingering 
uncertainties. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, in the dying minutes of that committee meeting, 
after the ethics counsellor was finished as a witness—and you 
will find this in the last line of the minutes of the committee 
meeting—he tabled with the chairman the letter he claimed he 
would give to the Leader of the Opposition directly when he had 
it in hand.  The ethics counsellor then marched over to the 
media, released the letter to the media and conducted interviews 
regarding the same letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That information should have been tabled as soon as he had it 
and it should have been part of the proceedings of that meeting. 
He had promised the Leader of the Opposition earlier that the 
moment he had it he would give it to the Leader of the Opposition 
but he withheld that information.  It was contemptuous when he 
had that, not to have delivered what was asked of him.  It was 
useless for the committee to release it at the very end when the 
questioning was over.  It was as if he attempted to meet the 
criteria on some purely technical basis on the notion that the 
letter should have been tabled with members before the media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I would argue that what the ethics counsellor did was 
essentially give the media the first opportunity to scrutinize 
the letter and to do an interview with him.  This was an indirect 
act that impeded the committee.  The entire time the questioning 
was going on he withheld that critical information about what was 
in the letter which dealt with the question that the Leader of 
the Opposition had put to him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Erskine May describes contempt as: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—any act or omission which obstructs or impedes either House of 
Parliament in the performance of its functions, or which 
obstructs or impedes any Member or officer of such House in the 
discharge of his duty, or which has a tendency, directly or 
indirectly, to produce such results may be treated as a contempt 
even though there is no precedent of the offence. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Minister of Industry tabled the letter in the House 
later, he too was guilty of contempt when he promised he would 
deliver it the moment he had it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 20, the Speaker ruled that: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to material to be placed before parliament, the 
House takes precedence....  To deny to members information 
concerning business that is about to come before the House, while 
at the same time providing such information to media that will 
likely be questioning members about that business, is a situation 
that the Chair cannot condone...I have concluded that this 
constitutes a prima facie contempt of the House. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would argue that an act that has the same results 
as what you pointed out in your ruling is also contempt.  This is 
what the authorities on parliamentary procedure would have us 
believe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask that you examine the committee minutes. 
The committee was divided into two parts: a question and comment 
period about the ethics counsellor and his role as the ethics 
counsellor, and a meeting concerning the Lobbyists Registration 
Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, as you go through those minutes you will find there 
is nothing about the letter that he tabled at the end of the 
meeting.  There are no comments and no questions because we did 
not know the letter existed, even though he obviously had it in 
the pocket of his jacket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, if you read the papers this morning you will see 
much discussion on the details of that letter but once again the 
media came before parliamentarians.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House did not see the letter until much later that same day. 
The ethics counsellor may not report to directly to parliament 
but he has now put himself in a situation where parliament must 
deal with him directly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor must be held accountable for his actions. 
He knew full well that he had the letter in his pocket.  He 
denied that information to the Leader of the Opposition when he 
was asked directly when that information would be available.  He 
denied he had it.  He said he would make it available as soon as 
it was in his possession.  It was in the pocket of his jacket the 
entire time.  He denied information to members of parliament that 
was germane to the subject matter and critical for us to do our 
job.  He is in contempt of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that you find a prima facie case 
against him and I am prepared to move the appropriate motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as chair of 
the Standing Committee on Industry I wish to clarify exactly what 
took place at committee yesterday afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The meeting continued on after the first round of questions. 
During the second round there were questions about the Lobbyist 
Registration Act.  During that time period, at approximately 5.12 
p.m., Mr. Wilson notified me that he had just received a letter 
in both English and French.  I thought, mistakenly, and the blues 
will show, that it was from Industry Canada.  I suggested that 
Mr. Wilson should speak to it in between the questioning of 
witnesses by the member for Burlington and the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During that time period Mr. Wilson explained that he did not 
want to be excessively dramatic.  He had just been given 
clearance to give the committee a letter.  It was an original in 
French, with translations from Pierre Paquette, the lawyer that 
represents the golf club, who has written to Industry Canada.  He 
apologized that it was not available earlier but there it was. He 
hoped that the representatives would get it to their party 
leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee then continued for approximately 15 minutes during 
which time no one raised the question of the letter.  If we go 
back, the earlier comment was with regard to the corporations 
directorate.  This is a different letter from the lawyer for the 
corporation. 
<P><A NAME="LINK136"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was not at the committee meeting.  I am not sure whether the 
official opposition House leader was either, but I just wanted to 
say on the matter that it does seem to me a bit odd that this 
letter should have been released at the time that it was to the 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard conflicting reports as to whether or not the ethics 
counsellor may or may not have had the letter on his person all 
the time that he was there, or whether he received it some time 
later in the meeting, as the chairman of the committee contends 
and as I heard from someone else. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not really matter whether or not he actually had it on 
him when he was answering the Leader of the Opposition or whether 
he received it later, although if he had it on him it sort of 
compounds the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Given the preoccupation of the House with this issue, and it is 
not always a preoccupation that those of us in my party have been 
able to share because we have decided to devote our few questions 
to other issues, I have listened carefully to what has gone on 
between various opposition members and the government on this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to say that this is the first time, given the behaviour 
of the ethics counsellor yesterday in the committee with respect 
to the release of the letter, I have had an inkling or a feeling 
that perhaps the ethics counsellor was more than just a guy 
caught in a very difficult situation, trapped by the limits of 
his mandate, by the limits of whom he appoints, whom he reports 
to, who appointed him, and by the limits of the current conflict 
of interest guidelines the Prime Minister and others operate 
within. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until yesterday it never occurred to me that the ethics 
counsellor might actually be acting in a way that was favourable 
to one side or the other of the argument.  However, I have to say 
I think the ethics counsellor owes the House an explanation at 
this point.  I am still not prepared to say that he was taking 
sides, but it sure looks like it when he released that letter at 
the point in time in the life of that committee meeting when he 
did.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would think that an explanation should be forthcoming from the 
ethics counsellor and, if there is not an appropriate 
explanation, it may well be that he was acting in contempt of the 
House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK137"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I have listened with great interest to the point 
that has been raised by the hon. House leader for the official 
opposition.  I have also listened to the input of other members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was present at the committee.  As the chair of the committee 
has indicated, it was just before I was to commence my line of 
questioning that I noticed Mr. Wilson conferring with someone I 
presumed to be a staff person, and then pre-empting the committee 
by the statement.  I can verify that it was along the lines, as 
the chair of the committee said, that he did not mean to be 
dramatic or overly dramatic, and then he proceeded to divulge the 
contents or the gist of the letter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that as indicated previously there were 
two distinct points in time in which members of the committee 
were permitted to ask questions on a certain subject matter, 
namely the Grand-Mère file.  That was limited by the chair of the 
committee and it was directly related to the 
Shawinigan-Grand-Mère file to which this letter pertained. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the main questioners on the particular subject matter 
had left by the time the letter was divulged.  If they were 
present or if members of the committee generally wanted to 
question the witness at that time about the letter, I strongly 
suggest that we would not have been permitted to in any event, 
given the parameters that were placed on the committee by the 
chair.  The timing is highly suspect. 
<P><A NAME="LINK138"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I have heard a fair bit on this point. 
What is apparent at this point, from everything that I have 
heard, is that this is a matter relating to the proceedings in 
this committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that there were proceedings ongoing in this 
committee.  No one has denied that the committee meeting was 
taking place.  It now appears that everyone says the letter was 
produced during that meeting.  Whether or not it was discussed, 
whether it was made public, whether it was tabled, or whether 
there was some allegation of wrongdoing, is a matter surely for 
the industry committee to decide. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must say that at the conclusion of the remarks of the hon. 
House leader for the official opposition I thought it was an 
excellent presentation to make before the committee chair. The 
matter has to be dealt with, with great respect to hon. members, 
in the committee and not here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have not heard a thing that suggests there has been a breach 
of the privileges of the House itself.  There may have been 
something go wrong in the committee, but until the committee 
reports to the House and has dealt with the issue, and it has not 
met since, as I understand it, we are at a bit of an impasse 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could I suggest we leave the issue at this point and have the 
industry committee deal with it, because that is where the matter 
ought to be raised, at least in a preliminary way.  It appears to 
me that it has not been raised there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Until there has been some decision by the committee, and it may 
wish to hear more testimony on the issue, it is premature for me 
to interfere in any way. Indeed, as hon. members know, it is very 
unusual for the Chair to involve itself in committee proceedings 
anyway.  I believe that this is a matter that should be dealt 
with there and I respectfully request hon. members to raise the 
issue in the industry committee at this point.

government of Newfoundland and Labrador has been encouraged to 
consider the importance of the archaeological remains at Fort 
shend National Historic Site of Canada in the planning and 
construction of the new cultural and heritage facility. These

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to point out to the House that the parliamentary

regard to responding to a question put on the order paper last 
June, and subsequently put on the order paper when parliament was 
recalled, regarding the sale of 40 Huey helicopters.  This is 
very important to the House, because the issue of those 
helicopters falling into the wrong hands in terms of Colombian 
terrorists and so on has been raised in the House on a number of 
occasions.

Also at that time I put on the order paper questions relating to 
the sale of 10 Challenger aircraft owned by the Government of 
Canada.  These were brokered through an aviation firm called 
Lancaster Aviation—

not provide details we will never know, because for some reason 
the government simply does not want to answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to the question on the 40 Huey helicopters, I also 
had questions on the order paper going back to last June and 
subsequently re-entered when the new parliament resumed, on the 
sale of 10 Challenger aircraft by the Government of Canada 
through the same brokerage firm, Lancaster Aviation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will we get answers to that set of questions in addition to

think the Canadian people have a right to know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Mr. Speaker, to be technical, I suppose, 
the government will treat the two questions the hon. member has 
on the order paper as new questions beginning in this parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have reviewed a draft answer to one question with the hon.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  Before I call orders of the day, I would 
like to make a statement on a matter that may be of interest 
during the course of the debate that is to take place later this 
afternoon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As all hon. members are aware, recently the House has given 
guidance to the Speaker on the selection of report stage motions. 
This occurred on February 27, 2001, when the House adopted the 
following note to Standing Orders 76 and 76.1: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For greater clarity, the Speaker will not select for debate a 
motion or series of motions of a repetitive, frivolous or 
vexatious nature or of a nature that would serve merely to 
prolong unnecessarily proceedings at the report stage and, in 
exercising this power of selection, the Speaker shall be guided 
by the practice followed in the House of Commons of the United 
Kingdom. 
</UL>
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 15, in a ruling on a point of order raised by the hon. 
member for Richmond—Arthabaska, I undertook to return to the 
House with a statement on how this note will be interpreted. 
Today, I would like to take a moment to provide the House with 
this interpretation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I begin, I want to mention that from time to time when 
the House adopts new procedures, Speakers have seen fit to 
address the manner in which they will be implemented.  Often 
this occurs when a certain amount of latitude or discretion is 
given to the Chair. 
In enforcing new procedures, the Speaker acts as a servant of 
the House, not as its master. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1540"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT21"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT21"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1540

<A HREF="#LINKT20"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, in order that these new procedures function properly, 
I see it as my duty to make a statement on their operation now, 
before the House is seized with a bill at report stage. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1968, rules concerning the selection of report stage 
amendments were established.  At that time, the House first 
undertook a thorough revision of its legislative process which 
resulted in our modern rules where bills are sent to committee 
for detailed examination, followed by an opportunity for 
consideration in the House in what is known as report stage.  As 
<I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> explains on page 
663: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In recommending that report stage be revived, the 1968 Special 
Committee on Procedure considered that stage to be essential in 
order to provide all Members of the House, and not merely members 
of the committee, with an opportunity to express their views on 
the bills under consideration and to propose amendments, where 
appropriate.  However, the intent of the Committee was not for 
this stage to become a repetition of committee stage.  Unlike 
committee stage where the bill is considered clause by clause, 
there was not to be any debate at report stage unless notices of 
amendment were given, and then debate would have to be strictly 
relevant to those proposed amendments. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to prevent report stage from becoming merely a 
repetition of committee stage, the Speaker was given the 
authority to select and group motions of amendment for debate. 
Over the past 30 years, a large body of practice has grown on how 
this important legislative stage is conducted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me briefly review how it works today.  When notice of a 
motion of amendment is given by a member, the Speaker has a 
number of issues to address.  First of all, the Speaker must 
judge the procedural admissibility of the motion; if the motion 
does not meet the time-tested rules of practice, it will not be 
deemed admissible and therefore will not be accepted for 
publication on the notice paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once a motion passes the basic test of admissibility, the 
Speaker must then determine whether the motion can be selected 
for debate.  For guidance, the House has given the Speaker 
certain criteria to apply, for example, motions already defeated 
in committee are not normally selected.  Once the Speaker has 
selected the motions that will be debated, a decision is made on 
grouping them for debate with other motions that have a similar 
theme or purpose.  Finally, the Speaker determines how the 
motions should be voted on, for example, whether one vote applies 
to several motions, or whether the adoption of one motion 
obviates the need to vote on another motion.  When all of these 
questions—admissibility, selection, grouping, voting 
pattern—have been addressed, the Speaker provides the House with 
the report stage ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first two tests which the Speaker applies to motions, those 
of admissibility and selection, are the most important in our 
discussion today.  I would refer the House to Marleau and 
Montpetit, pages 649 to 669, for a detailed discussion of our 
rules and practice in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to admissibility, the Speaker must strictly apply a 
number of rules of procedure.  Does the motion go beyond the 
scope of the bill?  Is it relevant to the bill?  Or is the motion 
incomplete?  Either the motion is inadmissible and is returned to 
the member, or it is admissible and proceeds to the next test, 
that is, the test of selection. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to selection, the Speaker in 1968 was given a 
greater amount of flexibility and discretion.  In the last 30 
years, as practice evolved, successive Speakers were encouraged 
to exercise more rigour in the selection of motions in 
amendment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1985, the third report of the all party Special Committee on 
Reform of the House of Commons, the McGrath committee, recommended 
that the Speaker use existing powers to select as well as combine 
amendments at the report stage.  The committee suggested certain 
principles to guide the Speaker on how this could be done.  To 
quote from the report: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>An amendment disposed of in committee should not be revived 
unless it is of exceptional significance.  Amendments ruled out 
of order in committee should not be reconsidered unless there are 
reasonable grounds for doing so.  Amendments proposed to 
implement government undertakings should be selected 
automatically.  In selecting other amendments, the Speaker should 
seek guidance through consultation.  The Speaker should 
determine, in consultation with the House leaders, which 
amendments are regarded as the most important from the party 
point of view. 
</UL>

<A HREF="#LINKT21"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The report proceeded to list several other guidelines.  It is 
evident that this was a very tall order for any Speaker.  The 
committee recognized the significance of such discretionary 
powers in the hands of the Speaker and commented that, in their 
view, successive Speakers had hesitated to use to its fullest the 
power to select without further direction from the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House sought to provide such direction in 1986 when 
amendments to the standing orders included for the first time 
the note to the present Standing Order 76.  This note took up 
some, but not all, of the criteria contained in the McGrath 
Committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point on, our practices have evolved to where they are 
today and in reviewing those practices, I was struck by the 
reluctance of my predecessors to use the powers of selection in 
any but the most generous manner, giving members the benefit of 
the doubt in most instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament, the House was faced with several bills 
(i.e., Nisga'a, clarity, young offenders) where, at report 
stage, hundreds of motions in amendment were placed on the 
notice paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The most recent attempt to address the situation occurred last 
February 27, 2001 when, by adopting Government Motion No. 2, the 
House again sought to provide the Speaker with more guidance on 
the manner of selection of report stage amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here again, as so often in the troubled history of report stage, 
we see the hope that a more interventionist approach by the 
Chair will resolve difficulties that are being experienced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is not for me as your Speaker to interpret the confluence of 
events that led up to the unprecedented gridlock the House faced 
at report stage in the last parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, even if one grants that the Chair has, in the past, 
been too reticent in the exercise of its power of selection, I 
would argue that this abundance of caution, if such we may call 
it, is only one of the circumstances that have contributed to 
the potential crisis that we face at the report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As your Speaker, I am ready to shoulder the report stage 
responsibilities that the House has spelled out for me. 
However, I think it would be naive to hope that the frustrations 
implicit in the putting on notice of hundreds of motions in 
amendment of a bill will somehow be answered by bringing greater 
rigour to the Speaker's process of selection. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that cautionary note, I want now to outline my approach with 
regard to the selection of report stage amendments for debate in 
view of this most recent directive from the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, past selection practices not affected by this latest 
directive will continue to apply.  For example, motions and 
amendments that were presented in committee will not be selected, 
nor will motions ruled out of order in committee.  Motions 
defeated in committee will only be selected if the Speaker judges 
them to be of exceptional significance.  I refer hon. members to 
pages 667 to 669 of <I>House of Commons Procedure and Practice</I> 
for a fuller discussion of these practices. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, regarding the new guidelines, I will apply the tests of 
repetition, frivolity, vexatiousness and unnecessary 
prolongation of report stage proceedings insofar as it is 
possible to do so in the particular circumstances with which the 
Chair is faced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is in regard to these four criteria alone that I will have 
reference to the practice followed in the House of Commons of 
the United Kingdom, and not to the wider practice surrounding 
what is called “consideration stage” of bills at Westminster, 
which practice is not relevant to our own traditions and not 
helpful to their clarification. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1550"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to apply these four criteria to all amendments at 
report stage no matter which side of the House they come from.  I 
also intend to apply those criteria in the original note, whose 
validity has been endorsed by the adoption of government Motion 
No. 2.  Specifically, motions in amendment that could have been 
presented in committee will not be selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Accordingly, I would strongly urge all members and all parties 
to avail themselves fully of the opportunity to propose 
amendments during committee stage so that the report stage can 
return to the purpose for which it was created, namely for the 
House to consider the committee report and the work the committee 
has done, and to do such further work as it deems necessary to 
complete detailed consideration of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, I believe that this approach will result in the 
Speaker's selection of amendments at report stage being a far 
more rigorous exercise than it has been to date, no matter how 
challenging such an exercise may be. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the Chair intends to maintain its current practice of 
not providing justification for the selection of amendments, or 
reasons for the non-selection of amendments at the time of a 
report stage ruling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, in exceptional circumstances, the Chair may expand this 
usual approach and explain its reasons where this shall be 
deemed necessary or appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>May I end my remarks by reminding members that at the conclusion 
of today's debate, the House will have adopted a motion creating 
a special committee to make recommendations on the modernization 
and improvement of its procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Without anticipating what the committee may decide to recommend, 
it is entirely possible that the House may at some future date 
be seized with proposals that may have an impact on my statement 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, as your servant, I will continue to be guided by 
whatever rules the House may, in its wisdom, decide upon to 
conduct its business. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to thank all hon. members for their attention to this 
ruling which I hope has clarified the situation somewhat for hon. 
members.  For those who found it more confusing, we will have it 
wait and see what happens on the first report stage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  Am 
I permitted to ask you a question of clarification respecting 
your statement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I think what the hon. member should do is 
read the statement later.  I am sure after reading it he will not 
have any questions.  It would be better if he approached the 
Chair without asking questions in the House.  There is not really 
a question period for Speakers.  I thank the hon. member for his 
interest.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to begin my comments by outlining the parliamentary 
initiatives that have already taken place since November 2000, 
since the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will begin with measures that have recently been approved by 
the Board of Internal Economy.  Funds for political parties 
represented in the House have been reallocated to take into 
account the new standings in the House following the last 
election.  This provided an additional $900,000 in funds which 
would have otherwise lapsed for items such as party research, 
caucus services, whips' offices and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members office budgets have been increased by $20,000 per member 
of parliament to cover items such as additional staff salary 
expenses, office rents and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The members of parliament housing allowance has been improved by 
$3,000 to cover higher accommodation costs that MPs face in the 
Ottawa housing market, which is of course very tight.  Hon. 
members were having some difficulty making ends meet with the 
previous budget. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion before us today builds on these improvements and 
follows up on the commitment made in the Speech from the Throne 
to strengthen the institution of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will mention two initiatives that have already been addressed, 
namely the resolution of the report stage issue just clarified 
before the House of Commons by Mr. Speaker, and the announcement 
I made together with the leader of the government in the other 
place some days ago about increasing the research capacity for 
the Library of Parliament by an amount of $986,000 per year.  All 
of these are improvements to strengthen this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's motion proposes to implement a commitment in the Speech 
from the Throne to improve the rules of the House of Commons. The 
terms of the modernization committee are set in the motion that 
was read by Your Honour moments ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair and hon. members will have noticed that this committee 
will only report on items where we have unanimous agreement.  In 
other words, where we agree there will be a change.  Where we do 
not, it will be the end of the discussion.  That is an excellent 
formula.  It was not one that I thought of myself.  I give credit 
to other hon. members with whom I have consulted.  Members across 
the way proposed this formula for reporting.  For that, I 
congratulate them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to thank all hon. members for accepting to put this 
motion before the House in the terms that we have today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, the committee will report no later than June 1 in order 
to enable the House to deal with the matter expeditiously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am one who believes we can only make large changes, if we 
achieve them they will be large changes, in the initial part of a 
parliament.  After that it is simply too difficult to do so.  As 
we get near an election it is effectively impossible to change 
the rules of parliament.  I have been in enough parliaments to 
know that the older a parliament gets the more difficult it is to 
modernize the institution.  Therefore, these changes must be 
undertaken at the beginning of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I and other members of the proposed modernization committee will 
be interested in what members of the House have to say on the 
proposed changes.  From my part, I would be willing to support a 
further debate in the House on an evening.  As a matter of fact, 
all House leaders have already been consulted on this and have 
informally agreed to do just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members will know from experience, the House of Commons has 
had five political parties since 1997.  Some members may recall 
that the so-called pundits of parliament in 1997 alleged that the 
House would not be able to function at all.  They called it the 
pizza parliament, the House divided, divided into several 
parties.  They said it would be chaotic and unproductive.  They 
have been wrong, thanks in large measure, to the co-operation 
that I have received from House leaders on all sides of the 
House, through the excellent chairmanship of this institution, 
through the excellent staff supporting us and, it is never said 
around here, largely through the good and constructive behaviour 
of members of parliament on all sides of the House.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has worked well in the last two elections.  I submit 
that we have made dozens and dozens of changes to the standing 
orders, proof that the House simply could not function under five 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were not provisions for five parties when I became the 
government leader in the House in 1997.  We all had to sit down, 
which we did, and we made the changes necessary to reflect 
existing conditions in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the risk of quoting myself in my first meeting with my 
opposition counterparts in 1997, I told them that we had been 
elected to make parliament work and that nobody had been elected 
to make parliament not work.  I am glad to say that I truly 
believe that is the attitude they all took. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is one of the reasons a modernization committee, which 
includes House leaders of all parties as well as the Deputy 
Speaker, has good prospects for agreeing to further improvements 
to House rules.  Of course, ultimately everyone has a veto if 
anything is proposed that they do not like.  A modernization 
committee of House rules will be successful because all House 
leaders have worked closely with their caucuses and they all have 
excellent records of achievement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already met with interested members of the government 
caucus, and I intend to do so again throughout the modernization 
committee's mandate between now and June. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To review this, I would like to have another debate like this a 
few weeks hence in the House as members gather their thoughts on 
the subject.  I would also like to have another meeting with my 
own caucus colleagues, plus of course all the informal meetings 
we have with one another around here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another reason I am confident about the committee is that it 
draws on the very successful work of a very similar committee, 
practically identical as a matter of fact, in the United Kingdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition leader and I were privileged to appear 
before what they call the U.K. modernization committee earlier 
this year.  We both testified before that committee.  We were 
impressed by the U.K. committee's organization and by the quality 
of its work.  I hope we are equally successful in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me identify and offer for comment some changes I would like 
to see.  Perhaps some members will argue that many of the things 
I am about to suggest would be more beneficial for the 
government, although not everything I say will do that.  Everyone 
should enter the debate with an open mind and enumerate things 
that they think will work better for them and hopefully for the 
other side of the House.  As we sit together, after listening to 
several hours of contributions from members, we should be able to 
improve the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give the House a few ideas to start.  First, we have at 
present a committee room with television facilities.  I 
understand that we have the equipment and facilities ready for a 
second one. Why not have another room on Parliament Hill fully 
available with television facilities for the benefit of members 
of parliamentary committees who want to avail themselves of it? 
With two such committee rooms and proper scheduling, I am quite 
confident that virtually any committee that wants to have its 
proceedings televised will be able to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, why can we not have greater use of committee 
teleconferencing?  Every time we have committee teleconferencing 
now, the committee must come and ask the House to do it.  I do 
not believe that is necessary.  In 2001, with the excellent 
committee chairs and vice-chairs that we have, committees should 
be able to decide whether they want to teleconference with 
witnesses throughout Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the second largest country in the world and the most 
technologically advanced country in the world, if I can brag a 
bit.  There is no reason we cannot make it easier for Canadians 
to have video teleconferencing and to testify before 
parliamentary committees.  It would enable committees to work 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me touch a bit on the estimate process.  In 1993 the 
government announced it wanted to work with members of parliament 
to improve the estimate process.  In addition to the estimates we 
now have a provision whereby we identify the propose future years 
expenditures.  Together with my colleague the President of the 
Treasury Board, I would improve on future years expenditures to 
ensure more information is made available to members of 
parliament.  Hopefully, then, greater use would be made of it by 
hon. members. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would now like to turn to interparliamentary relations, which 
are very important.  We have close relationships, of course, 
with the parliamentary associations of a number of countries, 
and I encourage all hon. members be involved with these 
associations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I for one believe we should never have to apologize for our 
relationships with other countries.  If this means being 
criticized occasionally by the media for flying off to some 
other country, that is too bad.  It goes with the territory. 
We live in a country that depends on international trade, that 
depends on international relations, a country that believes in 
multilateralism, so let us then participate in 
interparliamentary relations with other countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is high time as well for us to think of entering into 
interparliamentary relations with the provinces, something not 
much developed in the past.  Why are there no interparliamentary 
relations between Ottawa and Quebec City, between Ottawa and 
Toronto, between Ottawa and the other provinces?  One of my 
party's backbenchers made that suggestion to me a few days ago, 
and I thank him for it. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about changing some of the rules of the House. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Leader of the Official Opposition in the House proposed that 
candidates for the position of House of Commons' Speaker at the 
start of a session have a chance to speak before the House prior 
to a vote.  Why not?  I would be prepared to develop a similar 
idea, which was suggested by the leaders of the opposition in 
the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another suggestion, this time is one of my own.  We have Standing 
Order 57, called closure or time allocation motion.  To date we have 
had to vote at 11 p.m. under this standing order. 
It is outdated and a holdover from when parliament sat until 11 
p.m. every evening.  It is not modern.  It does not reflect the 
fact that the committees sit early in the morning.  It should be 
modernized, as we did at report stage not long ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not say 8 p.m., 8.30 p.m., 10 p.m., but definitely not 11 p.m., 
the present time.  It is much too late and does not serve any 
purpose.  The members are not productive at that hour and it 
does not improve the quality of the debate to sit until 11 p.m., 
when members have been here since 7 a.m. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk briefly about concurrence motions for committee 
reports.  We could consider restricting committee report 
concurrence motions.  Right now they are moved in a rather 
haphazard way and do not seem to do very much.  Why not have a 
measure to restrict concurrence motions until after the 
government has responded to a committee report?  How can we 
concur in a report if we have asked the government to respond to 
it?  If we concur in it there is no need for the response. There 
is a contradiction in the rule which needs to be clarified. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sometimes an hon. member will ask for concurrence in a committee 
report when the committee itself never asked that the report be 
concurred in.  That is another contradiction that needs to be 
modernized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to committees, just so that members do not think I 
want all this to be to the advantage of the government, we have 
right now a provision where the government has 150 days to 
respond to a committee report.  That is too long.  Some 150 days 
later no one here even remembers what the original committee 
report was about.  I therefore propose to shorten that. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1610"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT26"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to offer the following thought.  Why not make it 
120 days or 75 sitting days, whichever is less, because it could 
sometimes cover the summer period in which we do not sit for many 
months? By having the shorter of the two provisions we would 
reduce the time for responding by as much as one-third. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not make routine procedural committee concurrences votable 
but not debatable?  I am referring to such issues as committee 
travel.  If a committee wants to travel to hear witnesses in 
British Columbia, Newfoundland or anywhere else, right now we 
virtually need unanimous consent of the House.  That is not 
reasonable and it is not modern.  Why can we not have a measure 
where we could vote on it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we need a higher threshold than a simple majority we could 
use a reverse vote, such as the measure we have for extending 
hours where 20 or 25 or whatever number of members can rise and 
prevent it if they want. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now effectively any one member has the ability to stop a 
committee from doing its work if it must go outside Ottawa to 
hear witnesses.  We can modernize that.  I have offered two or 
three different formulas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk about opposition day motions.  I notice the Leader 
of the Opposition is with us.  I invite him, and others of 
course, to think about the following because it affects the 
official opposition more than anyone else.  It affects all 
oppositions parties, albeit to a lesser degree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not examine whether the mover should be able to split the 
time on an opposition motion and produce an amendment that makes 
the motion unamendable?  That was started by way of a loophole in 
1994.  It did not exist before that.  I do not believe it 
advances debate.  We used to be able to amend a motion over here 
and make it acceptable to a greater number of members and thereby 
pass it.  It is very difficult to do that now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing is the notice provision.  Right now it is 6 p.m. 
Hon. members want us all to have an intelligent debate on 
important issues facing the nation, yet we are informed at 5.45 
p.m. that we must discuss the future of agriculture in Canada or 
the future of criminal justice or the future of anything else. We 
then have about 12 hours to get the entire bureaucracy and the 
government ministers and everyone else organized to respond to 
issues so important to the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are serious about dealing with issues that way, hopefully 
we could back up that time and make it, say, 10 o'clock in the 
morning.  Whenever the House meets in the morning it could be 
tabled at exactly that time so that all members would know at 
once and could prepare to respond on the following day.  These 
are just ideas, but they could advance debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will introduce a few more.  We could update the procedures for 
reinstating government bills in a new session.  We do not have 
that now.  We did adopt it for private members' bills.  It was an 
initiative by the former House leader of the then Reform Party. 
However we did not do it for government bills at the time.  I 
think it should be the same for both cases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to address the issue of programming the work at 
committee to ensure that committees are able to function better. 
The referral of estimates from the House to committee is a 
votable motion right now.  It does not do anything.  If we did 
not vote for it, it presumably would mean that we would deal with 
the estimates on the floor of the House, as if we could do that. 
It is left over from a bygone era. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not look at the time for the leadoff speeches?  Is it the 
modern way of doing it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now we have a curious situation in the parliamentary 
calendar.  We have one week off in March, which means most 
members do not have March break at the same time as their 
families.  If we came back one week earlier and took two weeks 
off in March, most provinces would probably coincide with it 
three years out of four, or something like that.  What would be 
wrong with that?  We would not lose any House time; it would make 
things work better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to deferring the votes, we defer them now until 
usually the end of government orders. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1615"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why do we not have votes at exactly 3 o'clock on Tuesdays when 
most members are already here?  We could add whatever time is 
lost, perhaps 10 or 15 minutes, to the end of the day.  As all 
members would already be here, the whips could just walk in.  At 
the end of the day, members could do everything else that they 
have to do when the House adjourns.  If members had committees or 
other business to attend to, they would then not need to return 
to the House at the end of the day to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why not formalize the procedure whereby whips supply votes for 
their colleagues in the House?  Again, it requires unanimous 
consent within a party, but we could formalize that procedure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hon. colleagues on the other side of the House have looked at 
having a mini question period immediately before the government 
House leader, or any other minister for that matter but generally 
speaking it is I who does it, invokes time allocation. This could 
be a 10 minute period where members could ask the government to 
explain its decision to invoke time allocation.  In the mix of 
all that, I do not object to doing that.  It is accountability. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been suggested by the opposition House leader that the 
appointment of the Clerk of the House could be subject to a vote 
in the House.  I would not object to that.  Right now it is a 
government appointment made under my recommendation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to question period, the British house has thematic 
question periods three days a week:  Mondays, Tuesdays and 
Thursdays.  It would be a radical change around here, but we 
could at least try a thematic question period one day a week, 
perhaps on Fridays.  Members from both sides of the House could 
reduce their numbers, if they wanted to.  We could have differing 
themes each Friday, such as industry, treasury board, finance and 
so on. The themes would always be designated by the opposition in 
a way similar to the designation of opposition days and with the 
same apportionment for political parties.  Each party would be 
allowed to choose a theme.  It is an idea that I am willing to 
discuss with colleagues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A second chamber has been proposed for discussing other issues. 
Australia and the United Kingdom have done that.  Australia's is 
called the main committee and the United Kingdom's is called 
Westminster hall.  They both deal with local and private members' 
issues.  They have adjournment debates that are similar to the 
ones we have at the end of the day, except that they do not 
necessarily require a question to have been raised previously. 
They only require a notice to be put on the order paper.  Their 
members can discuss issues important to their constituents but 
perhaps not always important enough to make it to the national 
agenda. It is important for us as local members to be able to do 
that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for private members' business, the committee could examine 
the conclusions of the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs on the subject. At present, members of parliament wonder 
which items should be votable and non-votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some feel that every item from private members' business should 
be a votable item, while others disagree. If we make them 
votable, that will mean that fewer members will see their 
particular items come before the House, of course, because 
votable items require longer debates than non-votable ones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the Standing Committee on Procedure and House 
Affairs to provide advice to us. We could then refer the issue 
to the modernization committee for further review. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have given a few ideas to kick-start the debate in the House. 
No, I have not talked about the constitutional convention of 
supply.  No, I have not reformed the Senate today.  No, I have 
not rewritten the constitution in the last 20 minutes.  I am not 
proposing to and I never said that I would.  What constitutes 
confidence will not be discussed here by me.  Others can, if they 
so choose, but that is a constitutional issue and has nothing to 
do with the rules of the House.  That is outside the parameters 
of what is here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have kept my remarks to what I think will be constructive in 
starting the debate on improving how this institution works.  I 
hope all hon. members will do the same during the rest of this 
day.  In the next few minutes I will probably have to leave the 
Chamber for a few minutes, but I intend to be here for several 
hours later this day to listen to the contributions from all 
honourable members on this subject.

forward to a second debate a few weeks hence in the House.  I am 
looking forward to meeting with my own caucus colleagues.  If 
caucus colleagues of other parties would want me to listen to 
their ideas, I would make myself available to do that too. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope to be able to contribute something between now and June 
1, along with everyone else, to make this place work better. That 
being said, the House is not hopelessly defective.  It is a grand 
institution.  It works well but it can work better.  I ask all 
colleagues to work together with me so that we can contribute to 
making this great institution even better than it already is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I see the hon. member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona rising.  A question and comment period is not 
provided for in the rules of debate at this time.  However,

would put the request to the House.

believe you would find agreement for me to split my time with the 
member for Fraser Valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I will need help from the Leader of 
the Opposition in this regard because, as he knows, the rules 
provide for him to have unlimited time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Chair has some difficulty on how to apportion or divide the 
unlimited time.  The hon. member might help the Chair by 
indicating if we are talking about splitting a block of time, for 
instance 20 minutes or 30 minutes.  We should have some type of 
indication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can give assurance that 
my remarks will be no more than 15 minutes at the most.  The 
remarks of the member for Fraser Valley would be approximately 10 
minutes.  We will definitely work toward that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  The House has heard the terms of the 
proposal of the Leader of the Opposition.  Is there agreement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank hon. members for 
their agreement.  I stand in the House today in support of the 
motion to create this special committee to recommend ways to 
modernize and improve procedures in the House.  It is a step in 
the right direction.  The Canadian Alliance and I hope it will 
signal the beginning of a very worthwhile journey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being somewhat skeptical, I have to say that we do not want to 
prejudge where the journey will finally take us but we do hope it 
leads to an enhanced sense of democracy, not just in the House 
but also in the country.  In the last election only 61% of 
registered voters even bothered going to the polls.  It was the 
lowest turnout in recent Canadian history. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT29"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of those who did vote we know that 41% supported the Liberals, 
giving them a majority in the House of Commons.  When we take a 
closer look and include all the registered voters who did not 
bother to cast their ballots, we see that the present government 
has the support of about 25% of Canadians.  That is a sobering 
thought and a sobering reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do these numbers tell us?  One of the things the polls show 
us is that Canadians are becoming increasingly cynical about 
politics and about whether their votes mean anything.  As a 
matter of fact they are feeling increasingly alienated from the 
whole process of government itself.  That is a disturbing 
situation and the results of the committee could actually have 
something to do with remedying that.  That is why we look forward 
with hope, although I say that with some scepticism, to the final 
results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to every elected member in the House to win back the 
trust of the Canadian people.  People will be watching the 
committee.  It will be reported on quite properly, and it is up 
to us to prove to citizens everywhere that democracy is alive and 
well and living in Ottawa in these halls and in this Chamber. 
That will be the challenge for the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing some signs that change is in the air.  These signs 
are fragile.  They are like the first green shoots of the 
crocuses and the daffodils.  We hope that these changes will 
prove to be as inevitable as the first signs of spring.  We hope 
that happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the Speaker's ruling on a question of privilege 
concerning the justice minister, where the Speaker deemed that 
the justice minister had in fact acted inappropriately in 
releasing certain documents to the media before members of 
parliament had the opportunity to view those important papers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We applaud the independence of the Chair in making that ruling. 
It gives us hope.  It speaks to a regard for the highest 
principles and not partisanship.  The power to effect real 
democratic change rests with every member of the House, but the 
ability to exercise that power will at times take courage and a 
willingness to stand on principle. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians are really not seeing members of parliament exercising 
the power we have been granted constitutionally.  They see power 
concentrated in the hands of a few, mostly unelected advisers in 
the Prime Minister's Office.  That is what most Canadians see. 
They see the MPs who are elected to represent them voting the 
government line. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We see government MPs being referred to by the Prime Minister in 
the most cynical of terms as terra cotta warriors that stand in 
line and vote the way they are told.  That is a denigrating way, 
in my view, of treating one's own colleagues and one's members of 
parliament.  It must sting when Liberal MPs read that about 
themselves and they see what their Prime Minister is calling 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have said before and I will say it again that the Prime 
Minister and the Liberal government treat parliament as a rubber 
stamp for the plans which are drawn up in back rooms.  It is 
clearly too often the case and that is not right.  The House of 
Commons should be a place where real debate takes place and real 
action takes place on that debate.  Debate that originates in the 
living rooms, kitchens, coffee shops and workshops of the country 
should be brought to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a recent example, we know that many members of parliament on 
the government side share our concern about the plight of farmers 
in Canada.  Yesterday those members buckled to pressure from the 
Prime Minister's Office and they actually voted down a motion 
which would have given aid to farmers.  Yet we know many of those 
members, had they been able to stand for their constituents, 
would have supported that aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  If I heard the Leader of the Opposition correctly, he was 
commenting on a vote that took place in the House yesterday in a 
derogatory manner with respect to those who voted against the 
motion proposed by the official opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would respectfully submit that the hon. Leader of the 
Opposition is out of order when making such comments on a vote 
that has taken place in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I feel confident that in fact the 
intervention and the interpretation by our colleague from 
Davenport is correct.  I just ask the Leader of the Opposition to 
be guided in fact by those remarks which, in my humble 
estimation, are correct.  The House should not reflect on a vote 
previously taken by it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stockwell Day:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an interesting 
ruling which I respect, although I am not familiar with it.  I 
will just make observations and not reflect pejoratively in any 
sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The nation observed a motion by opposition members to endorse 
something that was proposed at one point.  That something was a 
promise by the Prime Minister and the government that we would 
have an ethics commissioner.  It was a promise taken from the red 
book.  We took the words verbatim because we agreed with the 
proposal.  I have said as opposition leader that where possible 
we will agree with and support the government on things that are 
good for our nation.  We took that promise verbatim and made it a 
motion because we agreed.  We wanted MPs to be able to vote 
freely.  I will just make the observation that the Liberal MPs 
voted down their own promise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the type of freedom that we are looking for in the House 
of Commons to restore the confidence of Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The concentration of powers in the PMO is not irremediable.  It 
is not part of the Canadian Constitution.  It has developed as a 
convention, a disciplinary habit that has diminished the role of 
all duly elected MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This concentration undermines democracy and the respect the 
Canadian population has always had for its elected 
representatives.  Each member of this House has the 
responsibility to stand up and be heard, to show that the 
principles of democracy are dear to him or her. 
MPs have a duty to show that democratic principles are more 
important than the carrot and the stick, than reward and 
punishment. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These things are more important.  Standing for democracy is more 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the parliament opened, our first task was the duty of 
electing a Speaker.  It makes a big difference to the House of 
Commons and to the Canadian people when the Speaker is perceived 
as someone who is fair to all parties.  We believe that is the 
case here.  The election of a Speaker by members of the House is 
something that most Canadians have taken for granted, even though 
it is actually a fairly recent convention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a story from our past concerning the election of 
Speaker that I believe serves as an example to the members of the 
House of Commons.  It is a story that shows that members are not, 
and do not have to be, helpless pawns in a parliament ruled by 
the Prime Minister's office.  It was back in 1827.  I know, Mr. 
Speaker, that you would be familiar with this not because you 
were ever near that particular era, but because you are a student 
of these things.  It was the Assembly of Lower Canada that 
elected Louis-Joseph Papineau to be its Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When Papineau asked the governor for official approval, the 
governor refused to confirm his appointment.  The members of the 
Assembly of Lower Canada did not submit humbly to this.  They 
refused to elect anyone else and they stuck to their guns.  It 
was difficult, and it took courage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government had to interrupt its activities.  Nothing 
happened for a year, but eventually democracy prevailed.  A new 
governor confirmed Louis-Joseph Papineau as Speaker. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister and others might argue that the machinery of 
government control is more important than the members of 
parliament themselves.  However we have to remember that these 
constituents whom we represent are more important than the 
so-called machinery that comes out of the office of the Prime 
Minister.  The people of Canada are more important than the 
machinery. Government should be for people, not people for 
government.  Sometimes and too often in this assembly, it is the 
other way around. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope the creation of a special committee to make 
recommendations on modernizing and improving these procedures 
will be a first step.  However, the real change we are calling 
for demands far more than what a committee can deliver and more 
than what a committee can recommend.  What we are asking for, I 
believe, is going to demand character and virtues like courage.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We could wait for three or four years until the Canadian people 
decide to change the government, but we know that in that period 
of time many more Canadians will be asking themselves why they 
should bother to vote when their MPs cannot even speak for them 
once they arrive in Ottawa. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can wait for the next election or we can act as MPs ought to 
act, and start exercising the power that is ours, in order to 
get some changes made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we show that we really want to do our job here in Ottawa, the 
Canadian public will understand. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need more free votes in the House of Commons.  We have to 
abandon the convention, and this is not a constitutional issue, 
that any losing vote for the government is a vote of 
non-confidence.  We need to address that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us give real power to committees and allow members of 
committees to elect their own chairs instead of having the Prime 
Minister make the appointment.  Let us have the chairs and the 
vice chairs elected by secret ballot, just as the Speaker is now 
elected.  It is good for the Speaker, it should be good for the 
chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us allow private members to bring bills that actually come 
to a vote without having to pass through a party dominated 
committee process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know many of my colleagues from across the aisle share my 
concerns.  They would like democratic reform to proceed just as 
we do.  The MP from Toronto—Danforth, as a good upstanding 
Liberal MP, said “Parliament does not work.  It is broken.  It 
is like a car motor working on two cylinders”.  Another Liberal 
MP and former Quebec cabinet minister said “Being in the 
backbench we are typecast as if we are all stupid.  We are just 
supposed to be voting machines”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to change that.  If these MPs have the bravery and the 
courage to talk about change like that then we need to embrace 
that change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members and opposition members alike know that the 
people of Canada want us to do better.  They want us to deliver 
true change and real democracy.  We have a list of things that 
have to be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the hon. member talked about the changes he wanted to see, 
I was waiting expectantly.  I was thinking he was going to make 
some recommendations for change would break the ground for 
democracy and usher in fresh breezes of freedom to the House of 
Commons.  I thought that when Canadians heard the Liberal House 
leader speak they would say “That's fantastic”. He unleashed to 
the Chamber just moments ago the waves of freedom which would 
cause us to surge onto the beaches of democracy.  Let us listen 
to those. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He wants to move closure from 11 p.m. to 8 p.m.  Now there is a 
democracy breaking move.  How about this?   He said “Let us deal 
with restricting a committee report concurrence motion”.  I 
wonder if he said that when he was out on the hustings.  Did he 
stand before constituents who were talking about freedom and say 
“We will bring something in to restrict a committee report 
concurrence motion?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not trying to diminish these tiny moves but they should 
just be mere shadows of changes that are far more monumental, the 
shadows of changes that will bring true democracy into the House 
and restore for Canadians the sense that they own this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I close with the words a wise person said to me the first time I 
was elected.  I was quite jubilant that particular night.  As I 
was leaving the party which was going on, he said “I want to 
know if you know the definition of the word instant”.  I asked 
him what the definition was.  He said “Usually it is the time it 
takes an elected member to go from representing his or her 
constituents to representing the government”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to remember that.  We need to think of our constituents 
and think of freedom and democracy in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agreed to share my time, and I thank members for agreeing, 
with the member for Fraser Valley who has also been a leader in 
the area of true democratic reform which will vitalise the 
process in Canada and send a message to all Canadians, including 
young people, that the government truly is here to work for them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK173"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to zero in specifically on why there needs to be 
a special committee, which the motion we are debating today would 
set up. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1640"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT33"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT33"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1640

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The regular standing order review which is required under 
Standing Order 51 is taking place this evening.  We will be 
debating which standing orders should be changed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the mandate of the committee that will be 
reviewing this, there are seven paragraphs in the standing orders 
outlining the responsibilities of the committee.  Parliamentary 
reform is only one of those responsibilities.  If parliamentary 
reform is the priority which I think all members of the House 
would like to make it, then the time is right for a special 
committee dedicated to developing proposals to modernize this 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last parliament the process to reform the rules began 
with a similar debate to this one, on April 21, 1998.  The 
Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs was supposed to 
take the wisdom of the debate and come up with proposals to 
reform the House.  The committee did not get around to 
considering parliamentary reform until October 2000.  Then the 
election came and time ran out.  In other words, it just did not 
happen.  Not a single standing order change proposal came to 
committee, made it through the House and became a change that we 
could enjoy in this 37th parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last major reform done in the House of Commons was done by a 
special committee chaired by James McGrath.  The member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona frequently refers to the work of that 
committee.  I am convinced a special committee is required 
because a special job like modernizing parliament requires a 
single focused committee to get the job done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of the proposed committee, I look forward to working 
with a smaller committee.  The McGrath committee emphasized and 
recommended a smaller committee.  The McGrath committee report 
stated that the committee should focus more on the task at hand, 
be less partisan and work toward consensus much easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am convinced that a smaller group is more productive than a 
larger group, as long as the committee reflects the proportionate 
party representation when it comes to speaking time, questions 
and comments, witnesses and so on.  One of the recommendations I 
hope we will eventually see is the creation of smaller committees 
that look after the speaking time and weighted votes.  I believe 
this can be achieved in the days to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other interesting aspect of this committee is the fact that 
its report must be unanimous.  If we are to reform parliament in 
a meaningful way, and not just in a way that strengthens the 
executive, both the opposition and government must buy into the 
proposals.  Ramming through changes under closure, as the 
government did not so long ago, will not work in the long run. 
This is inviting the opposition to find ways to get cranky with 
the government.  It also invites the opposition to find loopholes 
in the standing orders to express its frustration.  Surely that 
is not what we should be spending our time doing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should be spending our time in this committee and in this 
debate today trying to find ways to come to unanimity on 
important changes that give power to all parliamentarians, not 
just the executive branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when the government's famous Motion No. 8 was on the 
order paper in the last parliament.  That was a knee-jerk 
reaction by the government.  The motion was not intended to 
address opposition grievances.  It was simply intended to punish 
the opposition.  The government House leader, who normally 
enjoyed a co-operative opposition for the most part, faced a 
revolt on this motion that even his skills and his majority could 
not have handled.  I believe the Speaker would likely have ruled 
Motion No. 8 out of order if it had been debated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That draconian measure eventually was dropped because of the 
realization that we could not have meaningful reform in this 
place if it was going to be done unilaterally.  The House would 
have been consumed with routine orders of procedure unless the 
government had the co-operation of opposition parties.  No one, 
especially the government House leader, would have liked to see 
that happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that the timing of this committee is right 
because the spirit is right for change.  My party has a number of 
proposals already on the table.  Our last batch of proposals were 
released in a document entitled “Building Trust”.  It has taken 
me personally by considerable surprise because literally 
thousands of people have requested copies of it.  I cannot 
believe there is that much interest in parliamentary reform.

<A HREF="#LINKT33"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is an indication that not only is the time right for members 
of the House to begin fixing parliament, but Canadians are 
calling for it and the media are willing to communicate it, for 
maybe the first time.  Members of parliament can actually get 
cachet on this subject and can get traction on this subject back 
home, where people are saying that parliamentary reform is long 
overdue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The latest series of proposals, which I will be releasing 
tomorrow morning, builds on the original building trust document. 
I will be contacting all members of parliament to get them to 
talk about what I guess we can call “building trust plus”.  It 
is a series of proposals that includes everything I released in 
January, plus much more.  I would like to quickly go through some 
of the specific proposals I hope to take to the committee. 
Hopefully we can have unanimous consent to bring them back to the 
House by June 1. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The building trust document talked about:  free votes; the 
ethics counsellor becoming a true officer of parliament; the 
process of how the Speaker is elected; the creation of a new 
privacy, access and ethics committee, which I think would be in 
all of our interests; how the appointment of House officers is 
done; and the appointment of the clerk as an appointment of the 
House instead of an appointment of the executive, and so on. 
There is a whole series of proposals which I think would 
strengthen the role of parliament instead of just strengthening 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other things I would like to throw into the mix.  We 
should have more of the opposition party members chairing 
committees, like they do in England.  When I told them in England 
that virtually every single committee is chaired by the 
government, they just could not believe it.  In England, a third 
of the chairs of committees are given to opposition members. This 
would make committees so much better in the sense that people 
would understand that our duty in committees is to discuss the 
subject matter, not to have political diatribes.  If the 
government shafts one committee and the opposition is chairing 
the other committee, it could be tit for tat.  There is no value 
in making committees dysfunctional because there is an interest 
in making them work.  Sharing the committee chairs with the 
opposition means sharing some of the power, but it also means 
balancing that power in a way that reflects the true 
representation here in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well, we are keen to televise committees.  I know eventually 
we are going to have a new committee building in these precincts, 
but in the meantime anything we can do to televise more 
committees, to show members of parliament busily doing some of 
the grunt work of parliament, is a good thing, and we should 
encourage it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In regard to the way the government responds to committee 
reports, I know the government House leader would like to have an 
automatic response, but I would point out to him that in the new 
government of Nunavut, for example, when a committee tables a 
report in its legislature and the minister does not respond 
within a certain number of days, it is deemed adopted.  Instead 
of restricting the report, saying that concurrence is as if there 
had already been a debate, and the government being given 
unlimited time to respond, in Nunavut they say that the minister 
has to do that report's bidding unless he or she tables a 
response to do otherwise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, it is negative option billing on the minister. 
He or she responds to the committee's recommendations or it is a 
done deal.  That strengthens the hands of committees.  It 
strengthens the value of the report.  Ministers who say they will 
just ignore reports will find out that their departments have 
been given direction by the House if they have failed to react 
within an appropriate time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of recommendations on closure.  I have always said 
that the government at times will use closure if some shenanigans 
are going on in the opposition and it has to move that way.  On 
rare occasions it is understandable.  However, in return, the 
government should have to produce the minister to the House of 
Commons for a period of questioning on why it has restricted 
debate, on why it thinks debate has gone on long enough, on 
whether it has encouraged enough diversity in debate, and on why 
something is so time sensitive that it has to go through the 
House in such a hurried fashion.  In other words, a minister 
should have to be accountable for bringing in a closure or time 
allocation motion.  We have some specific proposals on that 
matter which I will be happy to bring forth. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also want to bring forward changes in how the estimates are 
handled.  There are good proposals from an all party committee on 
how to improve the estimates process.  Right now the estimates 
are set in stone.  The government brings them forward and members 
cannot change anything.  If members change anything the 
government considers it a non-confidence vote.  That is why the 
all party committee, including the current government whip, has 
proposed changes, which I agree with and which will allow members 
of parliament to move funds around within a department, not to 
spend more money but to allocate funds according to the 
committee's wisdom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That again strengthens the role of committees.  It strengthens 
the role of the Liberal backbenchers and allows estimates, the 
real spending power of parliament, to be brought forward not just 
for scrutiny like they are now, but for actual direction to the 
government.  What a breath of fresh air it would be for Liberal 
backbenchers to actually have that kind of input. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to also talk about things like the order paper 
questions.  This is a technical thing on how those questions are 
answered and how timely the answers are.  I know that the 
government House leader will be keen to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to look at the parliamentary calendar.  We want to 
decide on what is the best use of our time here in Ottawa.  Can 
we make better use of Fridays?  Instead of having attendance that 
is in the 20% to 30% range on Fridays, can we make better use of 
that time so the people who are in attendance in the House on 
Fridays have meaningful debate on meaningful subjects?  Perhaps 
private members' business could have more pre-eminence.  We can 
make better use of our Fridays in the House and I look forward to 
that debate as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the subject of private members' business, in the Alliance 
Party we want any private members' business drawn for debate in 
the House to receive a vote.  Too often people have put a lot of 
time, energy and effort into bringing forward private members' 
bills and, for whatever reasons, there are no votes.  They are 
debated for an hour and then go off into the ether and are never 
heard of again.  Members who have put time into a private 
member's initiative should know that there will be a vote and a 
decision at the end of it.  We encourage all members to allow not 
just the debate but a vote to occur on private members' business. 
I think members on both sides of the House would look forward to 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Again I want to emphasize that it is my belief that smaller 
committees will be more efficient committees.  We need to look at 
committee structure instead of expanding committee membership to 
17 or 18.  Sometimes a joint committee has 25 or 30 members.  How 
on earth can there be meaningful time for individual members on a 
committee of that size?  We need to reflect the proportionality 
of the House, restrict the number of members on the committee, 
and look after the questions of voting and question and comment 
time.  In other words, the time should reflect the 
proportionality.  Let us find ways to deal with this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not just make the committees ever bigger.  They are 
inefficient and a poor use of time and they do not do any better 
job of reflecting the reality of the House as far as numbers go. 
Often people get so discouraged that they quit attending because 
they never get a chance to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look forward to this special committee.  I am grateful for a 
chance to sit on it.  I look forward in the weeks ahead to all 
members feeling free to talk to all House leaders about what is 
on their minds in order to make this place work better for the 
benefit of all of us and the Parliament of Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> I wish to remind the House that the 
following three members will have a maximum of 20 minutes, and 
their speeches may be the subject of questions and comments for 
a period of ten minutes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK174"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier (Roberval, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
particularly happy to speak today on this question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I find it especially interesting that we can have a 
debate in this House in which all members may freely express 
their views on the standing orders requiring change or 
improvement in order to make our work in parliament more 
effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, it is a debate without party lines as such. 
Members may be creative, identify the irritants they see in the 
standing orders and propose solutions.  It is no doubt with 
interest that the House leaders will consider what will happen 
here, what the members will present, and this will no doubt be 
very useful in improving our debates. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1655"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT35"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I want to thank the government House leader, who was 
kind enough to guarantee that no change to the standing orders 
would be made without unanimity among the House leaders.  If 
everyone, does not agrees on the benefit of a change, there will be no 
change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already seen changes to the standing orders not made 
unanimously.  It is extremely irritating to the members of a 
party when the rules change unbeknownst to them, without their 
having either the desire or the possibility of agreeing to the 
change.  I therefore thank the government House leader. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am, however, of the opinion that we, the House leaders of 
other parties, need to be responsible.  There is always a 
certain give and take involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although the government House leader is offering us this 
possibility of blocking changes that do not suit us, we must 
still be reasonable and must sometimes make an effort to 
compromise in order to obtain positive results, instead of 
seeking the slightest pretext to never agree with anything and 
end up with a reform that is really no reform at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are all aware that the standing orders of the House of 
Commons need to be improved.  We are all aware that certain 
avenues exist on which, I believe, we can reach agreement fairly 
readily. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this connection, I offer my co-operation in advance to the 
hon. leader of the government in the House and I want him to 
know that I will be pleased to try to contribute a great deal of 
positivity and open-mindedness and in a spirit of respect and 
promotion of the rights of all members of parliament, not on any 
partisan basis but on the basis of what I would call respect for 
the elected representatives that we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certain principles, however, must underlie the reforms to the 
standing orders with which we will be involved and the work of 
the committee on which we will sit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It must be understood that the standing orders of the House of 
Commons do not exist in order to make people's lives difficult 
and to stop them from expressing themselves.  The rules that 
govern a Chamber like this one, a parliament, are there to allow 
a fair power relationship between the opposition and the 
government. 
A parliament where the government already enjoys an absolute 
majority, as is the case here, is fully capable of making 
decisions without having rules allowing it to do so without any 
interference whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Of course there are rules so that the government can 
govern—and it is ultimately the objective pursued—but there are 
also rules allowing the opposition to slow down the government 
in its decision making process. When we feel that a decision is 
bad, we can slow down the government, we can make things more 
complicated for it, we can even question some bills on which 
there is no consensus, particularly when opposition parties work 
together and pool their resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I say this, it is because it is significant. 
Our colleagues must realize that when a parliament no longer 
gives opposition parties an opportunity to prevent, through 
extraordinary means, the government from quietly proceeding with 
its bills and reforms, there is no parliament anymore. From the 
moment that a government enjoys an absolute majority, there 
would be nothing left to stop it, regardless of the initiatives 
that it may take. Such a situation would not be good. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the public realizes that parliament no longer allows its 
elected representatives to slow down or block certain government 
initiatives, the opposition organizes itself at another level. 
Democracy moves to another sphere, because people realize that 
it is game over in parliament. People organize themselves in the 
streets, they hold rallies and use other means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whether we are government or opposition members, as is the case 
on our side of the House, it is in everyone's interest to ensure 
that the rules of the House give us some power to influence 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to discuss the spirit of the debates that take place 
in a parliament such as this one. We have been in a democratic 
system for a long time and this is probably why we tend not to 
realize the richness of democracy, because we have been using it 
and sometimes abusing it.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one vital problem, when the government enters a debate 
in the House and the idea from the start is to carry the bill to 
term.  I cannot stress enough how important it is for the 
government to listen to opposition members and to consider what 
is proposed.  I know no members in the House who do not want to 
improve bills, in many respects, according to what their 
constituents ask them to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All too often, unfortunately, the debate, the period between the 
time the government introduces a bill and its passage and the 
reading stages, second reading, report stage, third reading, are 
viewed all too often by the government as a necessary evil. 
The time between introduction and passage is a period of time 
that varies in length.  It should be considered an extremely 
rich and fertile period to allow the government to improve its 
bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that bills are not prepared by the members of the House. 
They are prepared by impressive teams of officials.  I am aware 
of all the responsibility borne by the ministers and all the 
teams and armies of officials, who come to them with 
initiatives, bills of 100 or 150 pages, who explain their 
initiatives and, finally, who try to promote their way of seeing 
things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ministers are sometimes obliged, not only in this parliament, but 
in all parliaments, to fight their own machine in order to say 
“The government does not want to go so far with this particular 
bill”. 
There are epic battles between ministers and their own machines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What needs to be understood is that government and opposition 
members alike form a kind of team, which sometimes has to do 
battle with armies of public servants.  Our role is to make sure 
that the concerns of our constituents are expressed in the House. 
It is to take what the administrative machine proposes and say 
“That does not make sense. That should be in a particular order, 
or that should be done this way”.  Our role is to amend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules of debate which we are going to amend, the standing 
orders, the practices and procedures will have to be amended 
such that the period of exchanges between government members, 
ministers and opposition members allows productive review, 
improvement and adaptation of what an extremely powerful 
administrative machine has pushed all the way through to 
parliament.  This is the spirit in which I intend to work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Naturally, I would like to talk about time allocation motions. 
If there is one thing which worries me, it is the extremely 
frequent recourse to such motions.  Whenever time allocation is 
moved, I know that this is a convenient way for the government to 
move things forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But should the government have the right to use a time 
allocation motion if a bill has not been debated more than 12, 
15 or even 20 hours at most?  It is not normal for 
the government to bring forward, after two or three hours of 
debate, a time allocation motion.  Really now.  That makes no 
sense.  Is anyone ready to admit that there is nothing excessive 
about debating an important bill for three hours?  As I have 
said, they are churned out by officials and we have to absorb 
their content, take them apart, analyze them and express our 
views on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time we take here to debate bills gives the general public 
the opportunity to find out about the ones that concern them, to 
organize a lobby, to tell their MP “Hold on there, Mr. Member, 
we want to meet with you because there is a bill before 
parliament, before the House of Commons, and we want to see this 
or that change to it, because it causes us this or that 
problem”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time allowed for discussing a bill must, therefore, be 
substantial if we are to do our jobs properly, if the public is 
to have time to react if there is something about it that does 
not suit it, and also if we are to demonstrate that the real 
objective of government is to improve a bill.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this is not borne in mind, obviously things never move fast 
enough; they will never move fast enough.  Perhaps in a few 
years the government will find an hour's debate on a bill too 
long and will invoke time allocation.  That makes no sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has to return to fairer proportions on this.  It 
must agree to the effort and sacrifice needed to allow members 
to debate.  I am going to try to convince my colleagues, the 
leaders, that the government should not be able to bring forward 
time allocation too quickly in order to ensure quicker passage. 
This is perhaps one thing that needs to be looked at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However it should not be used after three hours of debate, because 
the government House leader is in a bad mood and knows debate 
will probably be extended, so he brings forward a time 
allocation motion. This is not what parliament is about, this is 
not the point of a time allocation motion.  However this is the way 
they now use it, unfortunately.  I do not want 
to offend anyone and start a quarrel when we are having a 
positive debate on the rules, but everyone knows that the number 
of time allocation motions more than doubled from one government 
to the next. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, at some point, it is time to be reasonable too, and I think 
that this is the time to have a look at this.  I think the 
government House leader, a generally reasonable man, should want 
to look at this business honestly and give his opinion.  I 
intend to raise issues in any case. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it should not be usable until a certain amount of 
debating time has passed, and perhaps in exchange it could be 
made easier to pass, not take so long, or some such thing. 
There are some points that need looking into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for electronic voting, I do not want to come across as someone 
who is opposed to change, since I am in favour of modernizing 
the way we vote, but I do have certain reservations.  That will 
most certainly be discussed in that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a certain nobility and an infinite democracy in the 
fact that a member has to rise here in this House before the 
cameras and say in essence “I, Michel Gauthier, the member for 
Roberval, vote for or against this bill”.  There is a 
responsibility that goes with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So much so, that when a motion is presented that is an important 
one, not that there are any that are unimportant, but one that 
holds particular importance from a policy point of view, then 
we, and all parties have all done so, require a member by member 
vote, not applying one vote to another, as you specialized in at 
the time you were whip of your party, Mr. Speaker.  Things go 
faster if that is done, and in many cases it is convenient for 
everyone.  In certain cases, however, members were required to 
stand up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we should find a system which would ensure that, to a 
certain degree, the act of voting would be one of courage. 
Otherwise, a member will become completely anonymous.  We do not 
yet know what the system will be but he will 
come and press a button, or he will be in his office and vote 
with a card—we do not yet know what the system will be—and it will 
show “Michel Gauthier, Roberval”, “Yes or No”, or “For the 
motion” or “Against the motion”, or whatever, and it will be 
much less onerous for the member.   It is this that worries me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that we must move forward, but we must continue to 
require that a member have the courage of his convictions and be 
able to say publicly, “I voted for that, and I was not ashamed 
to do so”.  In certain cases, as we know only too well, 
members are sometimes absent for certain votes.  They prefer not 
to be recorded as having voted for or against certain motions, 
particularly when they must toe the party line. 
This is because voting is an important act.  If, when 
modernizing voting, we decide on electronic voting, we must come 
up with the best process possible, but it must be the one that 
makes members of this House as accountable as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, there are certain standing orders I wish to touch 
on briefly, because I see that my time is running out. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1710"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT39"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT39"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1710
<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT38"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that the standing orders should be changed if, 
for instance, we do not have the support of two thirds of the 
members.  It seems to me that the rules which govern us are too 
important to be passed by the government alone.  That is the 
problem.  The problem is that sometimes the government majority 
represents a large number of the members and there could be 
changes to the standing orders which only the government, not 
all opposition parties, wanted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps it could be proportionate to the number of parties, or 
whatever, so that a change to the standing orders would have to 
reflect a certain consensus or unanimity in the House. 
Finally, there is no point dreaming in technicolour.  They 
should talk about a consensus or a vote in each of the parties, 
I do not know, but some mechanism must be found. This question 
requires attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition days are important to me.  I am going to try to 
convince my colleagues in this regard.  There are not many 
opposition days.  When a party presents a motion, by regulatory 
subterfuge, we have to prevent our motion from being diluted or 
substantially changed.  We are obliged to divide our time, to 
present the motion, to speak ten minutes, to say “My colleague 
will speak during the ten minutes I have left”.  The other 
colleague rises and presents an insignificant motion to prevent 
the motion from being amended, diluted or transformed 
significantly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me that opposition days are held to enable each 
party, and we all have our own days, to speak to an issue that interests 
us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, therefore, that the government should agree to allow an 
opposition motion to be amended only by the party presenting it 
so that there is no need to resort to subterfuge to protect a 
motion.  We do it indirectly, and that complicates things.  Why 
not be honest and let an opposition day belong to the 
opposition, be it the Bloc Quebecois, the Canadian Alliance, the 
NDP or the Progressive Conservative Party, and let each party be 
master of its motion, which may no longer be amended at any 
point during the debate.  This is something to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also going to talk about the coverage of debates and 
about emergency debates that should, in my opinion, all be voted 
on. 
The reason a matter is discussed in this House during an 
emergency debate is that it is something important.  What could 
be more natural than to ask parliament to decide?  I think 
this ought to be addressed as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, as fair as the chairs and vice chairs of committees 
are concerned, we should take a page from the book of the Quebec 
national assembly.  Half of all committees are headed by a member 
of the government party, and the other half by someone from the 
opposition.  The vice chairs are the opposite.  If a government 
member chairs the committee, then the vice chair is from the 
opposition and vice versa.  This would provide more of a balance 
for a healthy democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have already experienced this in the Quebec national assembly. 
I can tell hon. members that it works very well, gets a large 
number of MNAs involved, and gives rise to some extremely 
interesting situations as far as the dynamism of the debate and 
the operation of parliament are concerned.  Instead of having all 
but two committees chaired by someone from the party in power, I 
would like to see a better balance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the matters we will be looking at, but my 
point was mainly to stress that we must approach all this within 
a perspective of openness and intelligence, hoping to see 
parliament operate better and better, and that all MPs, not just 
those in government, will be able to do a more effective job in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the spirit which will govern my contribution.

I would like to ask the member a question on the issue of 
chairing committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under the present situation there is a designated number of 
members from each party on committees.  In the event an 
opposition member became the chair of a committee, it would 
appear to me that it would put the opposition at a further 
disadvantage, in terms of having the sufficient numbers to pass 
motions, because it would be giving up one more opposition spot.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that, in addition to providing for more 
opposition members, additional membership of opposition members 
should have to be provided for to maintain the parody that they 
presently have with regard to committee membership? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Gauthier:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am not an expert on how 
committees work, but it does not take much good faith to know 
that the system is not unrealistic, because it does in fact 
exist. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the system did not exist, I would agree with the hon. member 
that this would perhaps cause complications.  However this system 
already exists in the Quebec national assembly and has many 
benefits, including that of making all members, including 
opposition members, accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know by what means they manage to solve the problems 
the member is raising, but I think that a reform such as the one 
we are undertaking should get us thinking about what is done 
elsewhere and what works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have officers in the House, and I take this opportunity 
to pay tribute to one who was formerly a member of the Quebec 
national assembly.  When I was a member, he was a committee 
secretary, and a good one at that.  He is much more familiar 
with the way committees work than I am. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, we have the resources and the opportunity to go 
and see what is being done elsewhere, and it would be in our 
interest to be open to such things.  It is more motivating and 
more interesting for everyone, and leads to good involvement in 
the work of committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That having been said, implementing such a system could mean 
some difficult times, but since nature abhors a mess and since 
parliamentarians are intelligent beings, I imagine there will 
be certain adjustments and amendments and gradually the 
adjustment will be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On that score I would not worry. My suggestion to the hon. 
member would be that we at least see how it is done elsewhere. 
It would perhaps be in our interest to use this method here, 
because it would perhaps be to everyone's benefit. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK176"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am very pleased to participate in the debate.  I hope that when 
students of parliament look back on this day, or look back on the 
committee that we are striking today, they will see it as the 
beginning of a process which went some way toward reforming 
parliament in the way that so many of us want parliament to be 
reformed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I deliberately used the word reform, even though I know the 
official name of the committee is the committee to modernize 
parliament.  This is a conceptual concession that we all made to 
the government House leader because he would rather talk about 
modernizing the House of Commons than reforming it.  I would 
rather talk about reforming it than modernizing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that will be critical to the work of the 
committee is the tension between modernization and reformation. 
Modernization can have its own merits.  There are things that we 
can do more efficiently.  There are things that we can change to 
make our lives around here less awkward or irritating, but reform 
of the House of Commons is another matter. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I talk about the reform of the House of Commons, I am not 
just talking about tinkering with the standing orders in order to 
make things more efficient.  I and I think a lot of members of 
parliament are talking about redistributing power within the 
parliamentary system and within the parliamentary culture. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1720"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT40"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any parliamentary reform worthy of its name will have as its 
object and as its result the redistribution of power so that the 
powerlessness which so many members of parliament feel, both 
individually and collectively, will be adequately addressed.  If 
the committee fails to do that it will have failed miserably.  It 
may indeed fail totally because from where I sit and given the 
fact that unanimous consent will be required for anything to come 
forward from the committee, if there is not some redistribution 
of power then there will not be any committee report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only so much power one can redistribute by changing the 
standing orders in any event.  It will not be that there is some 
big change we can make in this place by changing the standing 
orders, but we can do a number of things both symbolically and 
practically to give members of parliament, as individuals on 
committees, collectively as committees, and individually and 
collectively in the House of Commons, a bit more freedom, a bit 
more distance from the influences which now often prevent them 
from acting with the freedom many of their voters would like them 
to exercise and which many members of parliament would like to 
exercise themselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first thing we need to do is to change our view of delay. It 
seems to me we have been caught up in kind of a very modern 
notion that everything should happen quickly and efficiently. One 
of the things we have missed in all this is the importance of 
delay. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Delay is not just obstruction.  Delay is not just being 
miserable or partisan.  When something important is being done by 
the government, delay is an important aspect of democracy so that 
things can be dragged on in parliament, to use the pejorative. 
Things drag on here until such time as the opposition, the media 
and others can help Canadians to know what is going on here, what 
the government is about to do, what the government is up to, so 
that they can then respond and give some feedback.  At a certain 
point the opposition has to make judgments about whether the task 
has been achieved or whether it is now overachieved and delay is 
counterproductive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All those kinds of judgments were operative when I got here in 
many respects.  They have been removed from this place.  If 
something is important, boom, we have time allocation within a 
day or two.  Then it is off to committee instead of letting the 
debate go on, having the debate noticed by the media because it 
is not always noticed right away, and playing a kind of 
parliamentary chicken with public opinion.  That has disappeared. 
We have time allocation far too often and far too easily without 
any thought being given to what it is doing to our parliamentary 
culture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On behalf of the NDP I will certainly be interested in a number 
of ways in which we could restrict the use of time allocation or 
make its use more beneficial to parliament.  We could give the 
Speaker more authority.  We could have a system whereby time 
allocation motions would have to be debated, as they were in the 
past.  We could have some special responsibility that the 
government would have to exercise by having a minister explain 
for 30 minutes, an hour or something why the government wanted to 
move time allocation.  There should be some price to be paid by 
the government for use and particularly overuse of time 
allocation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By was of reaffirming the role of parliament and the role of 
members of parliament, we need to restore the Chamber to its 
proper place in the business of the nation.  In recent days a 
number of questions of privilege and points of order have been 
raised having to do with the fact that so much takes place 
outside the House, that the media are given special privileges in 
terms of knowing about things before the House is notified, 
before documents or legislation is revealed in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to go back to a time when the House was used more often 
for ministerial statements and was place where announcements were 
made, where policy was announced. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1725"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT42"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT42"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1725

<A HREF="#LINKT41"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happened in my parliamentary lifetime.  It did not happen 
enough.  This is an old debate, but there was a time when 
ministers made more ministerial statements than they do now and 
the opposition was able to respond.  The media and others came to 
the House to find out what would happen on a particular issue, 
for example, an announcement by the minister of external affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say that with due respect to my colleague on my left who is 
now the leader of the Conservative Party.  When he was the 
minister of external affairs I remember him making these 
ministerial statements in the House because I was his critic at 
that time and I remember responding to them.  That does not 
happen very often any more and we need to have more of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is related to another issue which perhaps the committee 
cannot completely remedy on its own by just amending the standing 
orders: the fact that this is one of the few parliaments in the 
world where treaties are not ratified in any kind of mandatory or 
regular way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is the only NATO country that had no debate on changes to 
the NATO treaty which expanded NATO to include three other 
countries.  All other NATO countries, 14 out of 15, had debates 
in their national parliaments, but in Canada it was by order in 
council and that was it.  That is not good enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make this place a place where important decisions are 
taken and ratified.  These sorts of take note debates that we 
have do not cut it.  We will have one on the free trade agreement 
of the Americas next week.  We will debate it without the text. 
We do not even know what we are debating.  We could not get the 
government to promise when there actually is an agreement, and 
hopefully there will not be, that it will be debated and ratified 
in the House.  We need to restore the place of the House of 
Commons in the life of the nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also need to improve the standing committees of the House. 
Here is where we can begin to chip away at the false culture of 
confidence which the government and its members hide behind. They 
were doing it the other day when they were giving explanations 
for why they did not vote for the opposition day motion with 
respect to agriculture. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say, for heaven's sake, the McGrath committee recommended in 
1985 that all language of confidence be taken out of the standing 
orders because it used to be there with respect to opposition day 
motions, and it was taken out.  It was taken out 15 years ago. 
Yet 15 years later we still have government members saying that 
they would love to vote for a motion but they cannot because it 
is a matter of confidence.  That is procedural BS. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing in the standing orders that prohibits any 
government member from voting for any opposition day motion.  The 
only thing that prevents them is the political culture which 
exists within their own party and the political culture which 
exists within the larger political culture.  People do not want 
to be blackballed.  They do not want to put themselves in a 
position of being disciplined or being set aside in terms of 
career or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could change the culture of confidence or the convention of 
confidence, if we want to call it that.  We could change it 
tomorrow.  If 25 members of the Liberal Party rose and voted 
against the government on any given piece of legislation or 
opposition day motion, as long as it was not a budget or a throne 
speech debate, we would have the Prime Minister in here the next 
day explaining parliamentary freedom. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He would be explaining about how it was not a motion of 
confidence, how they were to move a motion of confidence later 
that afternoon and how the bill that was defeated would have to 
be revisited at another time or be redrafted.  This happens in 
other parliaments.  It happened in this parliament years and 
years ago.  There was a very good article in the newspaper today 
by Jack McLeod who pointed out that this used to happen with some 
regularity a long time ago in this parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to return to the kind of culture where prime ministers 
do not regard each and every jot or tittle and piece of 
legislation as critical to their parliamentary or political egos. 
The same goes for opposition leaders.  If we do not do that we 
will not be addressing what the Canadian people find inadequate 
about this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could start in committee.  We could start by going back to 
the recommendations in the McGrath committee and saying that when 
people are appointed to committee they are appointed for the 
duration of a session or perhaps the whole parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us start with a session.  They could not be removed by their 
party whip no matter how they voted.  No matter how smart or 
stupid or independent or whatever they were, they could not be 
removed.  They would have the power to replace themselves if they 
were absent, but there would be no more parliamentary goon 
squads.  There would be no more pulling all government members 
off committees and putting in a bunch of people who do not know 
what they are doing and are just doing what the parliamentary 
secretary gave them the nod to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That brings me to another matter: taking parliamentary 
secretaries off committees.  That was recommended by the McGrath 
committee.  It was tried for a while and then dropped because 
governments did not like it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another is non-partisan secret ballot election of chairs, not 
just government members for chairs but opposition members.  We 
all know who are the good chairpersons in parliament.  Why can we 
not elect those people to chair our committees?  Why can we not 
elect those people to make committees work the way people want 
committees to work, instead of having the chairmanship of 
committees sometimes regarded as a perk or a step on the way up 
the government ladder? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not to say we do not have good chairs of committees.  I 
see the member for Davenport, who has always been an excellent 
chair, but I have been on committees with some real losers too, 
real losers who should never have chaired a committee no matter 
what kind of committee it was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could start with the committee process by giving individual 
members more freedom from their whips and by electing chairs at 
the beginning of the life of committees that have the respect of 
members of the committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When committee reports come to the House we need to show more 
respect for the work of the committees.  I have seen far too many 
unanimous reports of committees absolutely ignored by government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One report that comes to mind, which has always been a special 
irritant for me, was from the standing committee on transport 
which considered the VIA rail cuts of January 15, 1990, and came 
back with a unanimous recommendation to the House that it was a 
wrong and terrible thing to do.  The Conservative government of 
the day, just so the Liberals do not think I spend all my time on 
them, ignored that unanimous recommendation of the committee 
headed by Mr. Pat Nowlan.  I think I have said enough about 
committees for now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at revising the standing orders to reflect the 
fact that we have five parties in the House.  This is more of a 
caretaking thing, but it has been a number of years and we still 
have not done it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, we have a routine with respect to the first round 
of speeches.  The standing order says what the first three 
speeches will be.  That is there because when the standing order 
was written there were three parties.  We now have five parties 
in parliament.  Is it not about time we adjusted the standing 
order so that it now says five speeches because there are five 
parties?  A parliament that is not capable of updating of its 
standing orders is hardly worth the name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of other things having to do with amendments 
and subamendments on motions, having to do with the throne 
speech, the budget, et cetera, which do not make any provisions 
for the fourth and fifth parties to contribute by way of 
amendment.  These things have to do with updating the reality of 
a five party parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps we could so amend the standing orders that we would not 
have to change them to reflect the number of parties.  I am sure 
there is language that would allow the standing orders to be 
interpreted from parliament to parliament, without having to be 
changed, to give equality to all parties in respect of the things 
I have mentioned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are just a few things.  We will bring many more things to 
the committee process.  I am very hopeful this will be the 
beginning of something that in retrospect will be regarded as a 
bit of a breakthrough, but I also remain skeptical.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the government House leader will try to look at the issue 
a little deeper than he did today in his remarks.  Most of what 
he had to say was directed toward making this place more 
efficient, more modern and more convenient for members.  He 
talked about televising committees and that sort of thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will look at that sort of thing, but the quality of democracy 
does not ride on whether we televise committees.  The quality of 
democracy in this place rides on the quality of what we are 
televising, not on the fact that we are televising it.  Of course 
it is a moot point whether the broadcasting of committees will 
increase the quality of what goes on in them or whether it will 
reproduce the kind of silliness we see here in question period 
when people are looking for the clip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Much damage has been done to democracy in the country by looking 
for the ever diminishing clip on the national news.  Do we want 
to reproduce that in committee, or do we want to think very hard 
about changing our committee structure and our committee culture 
first and then maybe having something that would be more worth 
broadcasting? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a matter that is critical to our discussion here the 
government House leader said he did not want to talk about the 
matter of confidence.  He did say he was open to other 
suggestions, which is fair enough.  Nothing he raised would in 
any way call into question the way the confidence convention is 
interpreted on that side of the House or, for that matter, 
interpreted generally sometimes.  He said it was a constitutional 
question, so he did not want to get into it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think it is a constitutional question.  The only thing 
that is constitutional is that the government must have the 
confidence of the House.  That is a constitutional matter, which 
is fair enough, but within that constitutional stipulation there 
is all kinds of room for interpretation and all kinds of 
precedent because ultimately, 99 times out of 100, the matter of 
confidence is a political matter, not a constitutional matter. It 
is a political matter that can be changed by political agreement 
and political action.  If this committee can do anything to 
change that it will have done Canada a great service.  That will 
certainly be one of the things I will be looking for.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry (Secretary of State (Multiculturalism)(Status 
of Women), Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, today in question period I made 
reference in my answer to an incident in Prince George, British 
Columbia.  I would like to clarify it because I had to leave the 
House early and was not here for the discussion.  May I have the 
opportunity to do so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  I am responding to the point of order.  In 
British Columbia there have been incidents of hate crime, 
including cross burnings.  I know of this because I was contacted 
immediately that these incidents occurred by the mayor of Prince 
George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my position as Secretary of State for Multiculturalism I 
funded the mayor to set up a task force right away.  The 
community was duly concerned and duly appalled at the incident 
and demanded to take immediate action, so I funded the mayor to 
hold a task force.  The task force met and came out with some 
remarkable and courageous recommendations which the mayor is 
implementing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am highlighting is that these incidents occur.  In my 
role as secretary of state I am often very astounded at the 
rapidity with which municipalities and communities take action 
against such things.  It is my role to sometimes assist them with 
resources. I did so, so I know very clearly and personally of the 
incident in Prince George. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was recently in Prince George, where I met with the task force 
and congratulated the mayor and the people of Prince George for 
taking immediate action on incidents that could happen in 
communities anywhere in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise on the same point of order.  I heard the minister speak in 
the House.  She referred to crosses burning as we speak.  Her 
response did not address that question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be in the interest of everyone, and it certainly would 
respect the spirit of this parliamentary debate, if she simply 
apologized and withdrew that inaccurate remark. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Hedy Fry:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would be very pleased to 
remove the piece, as we speak.  Sometimes when we speak in the 
House of Commons we put some of our phrases before and after. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However this was a recent incident.  What I meant to say was 
that as we speak things are happening around the world and in 
Canada and in Prince George that are changing things.  I would be 
very pleased to withdraw the phrase as we speak and say recent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I accept that withdrawal. 
<P><A NAME="LINK181"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Miss Deborah Grey (Edmonton North, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the secretary of state talks about making sure racism 
does not happen.  We appreciate that because it is a dreadful 
thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What she said today was very clearly that they were burning 
crosses in Prince George as we speak.  She has given some sort of 
half-baked withdrawal, but she slammed— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Oh, oh. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I consider the matter closed 
following the withdrawal by the minister.  If it is on another 
issue and another point of order, the hon. member for Provencher 
may rise. 
<P><A NAME="LINK182"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Vic Toews (Provencher, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise on a new point of order arising out of the 
comments the hon. member made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member may well have withdrawn, and I am not clear 
whether she did in fact withdraw, the comment that crosses are 
now burning in Prince George.  However the issue is not simply a 
matter of withdrawing the words.  It is a matter of apologizing 
to the community because she slammed the entire community and 
that needs to be withdrawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I still consider the 
matter closed.  We all take each other's words as being 
honourable.  When one of our members withdraws a statement, as 
was the case here, then I accept the withdrawal.  I am prepared 
to move on to another matter as of now.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>MODERNIZATION OF HOUSE OF COMMONS PROCEDURE 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK184">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK185"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parmiamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Service, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we just heard from the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona. 
Members will probably know him well because of his long service 
to the House, and in terms of a thermometer of earned respect he 
has certainly earned a great deal here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He raised an issue about chairs of committees.  I would like him 
to know, and I think most members in this place would agree, that 
all parliamentarians win when we have good, solid chairs in our 
committees.  I tend to agree with his assessment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also postulated that delay is an important aspect of 
democracy.  I agree with him there as well.  Even though he is 
quite right that at this point that it looks like a process of 
fine tuning and tinkering with standing orders, with the hon. 
member participating on the committee I am sure important things 
can happen and I hope he will pursue them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member has to do with the spirit.  He 
started his speech by saying we should not be going through a 
process of tinkering.  What he said we should instead be doing, 
and he was spot on, is talking about the issue of redistribution 
of power. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1745"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT46"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT46"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1745

<A HREF="#LINKT45"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member is absolutely correct.  That is exactly 
what is on the minds of opposition parliamentarians.  They want 
to redistribute power, because in our parliamentary system, 
constitutional obligations, et cetera, the power is vested in a 
majority government elected to govern.  The opposition has a role 
to play—and maybe the hon. member will comment—and the role of 
the opposition, in my view, is to deliver blows that would 
tenderize a turtle.  I do not believe they have a mandate to 
govern, yet the member is quite right, and I know where he is 
coming from:  redistribution of power is the issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If constitutionally a majority government is required to deliver 
on a mandate, would it in fact be in the best interests of our 
parliamentary system to structure its affairs in such a way that 
a government would be pre-empted in any way from delivering on a 
mandate, which it was democratically elected to do? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am not trying to be 
nasty about it, but if this is the sort of level of insight about 
parliament on the government backbench, it is no wonder we do not 
have the rebellion that we should have over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not talking about redistribution of power between 
government and opposition, although I think there is room for 
that.  I was talking about redistribution of power between the 
PMO and the cabinet, the cabinet and the caucus, the government 
and its own backbenchers, the executive and the House of Commons. 
If all the member heard was me talking about redistributing power 
between the government and the opposition, I have to go back and 
read my speech, or perhaps he should go back and read my speech, 
because that is certainly not what I was concentrating on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To return to what I said at the beginning, real parliamentary 
reform has to do with redistributing power in a number of ways 
around here.  One of those ways is between government and the 
opposition, because over the years much more power has come to 
reside with the government as opposed to the opposition than used 
to be the case.  I am not asking for something that never was or 
never could be.  I am asking for something that used to be.  I am 
asking for a return to some balance, where the opposition has 
much more power to hold the government to account than it now 
does.  I do not think that is a violation of any kind of 
constitutional theory about government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is accountable to parliament.  When people go to 
the polls they do not just elect a government; they elect a 
parliament.  It is out of parliament that governments come.  It 
is not just majority governments.  The member said in his 
question to me that we must have a majority government in order 
to fulfil this constitutional mandate.  No, we do not.  We just 
need to have a government that has the confidence of the House, 
and that could be a minority government, a coalition government 
or a number of different combinations, many of which would be 
much more sensitive to and responsive to the opinions of the 
opposition and the opinions of the government backbench than what 
we now have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need a situation in which the government does not have as 
much power to punish its own members and to override the 
opposition, so that there is some need there for agreement and 
co-operation.  That way other points of view get into the mix and 
they get into amendments that are accepted rather than rejected. 
We get better legislation and better policy as a result. 
<P><A NAME="LINK186"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member, the House leader for the 
New Democratic Party.  He always brings much logic and common 
sense to the debate.  He is a long serving member of the House. 
That is not to infer he is long in the tooth.  He is well 
respected by all who know him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is with respect to the 
devolution, if you will, of some powers, even to the Speaker on 
occasion.  I specifically refer to instances where omnibus bills 
are put before the House of Commons, where legislation is mixed 
and mashed together in an incoherent fashion, where members of 
the opposition most times—and this is equally applicable to 
members of the backbench—are forced to vote against a bill they 
are predominantly in favour of or, similarly, to vote for 
something they cannot reconcile.

<A HREF="#LINKT46"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be fair to suggest that there are occasions when the 
Speaker might be empowered to intervene and to divide omnibus 
bills?  Similarly, are there occasions when the Speaker might 
also be empowered to have greater discretion to turn down the use 
of closure or time allocation where it is not properly being 
exercised by the government, or to at least to call for a debate 
where the government should be called upon to justify the use of 
time allocation or the use of closure?  I wonder if the hon. 
member would have comments on those suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in regard to the last two 
suggestions made with respect to dealing with time allocation and 
giving the Chair more power, I did mention them fleetingly in my 
remarks about time allocation.  It is one of the things I said in 
the debate.  The government is very eager to give the Chair power 
over what amendments would be votable at report stage, but not so 
eager to give the Speaker power to hear motions of time 
allocation which, in the judgment of the Chair, come too early or 
before adequate debate has taken place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The first question was on omnibus bills.  This is probably an 
occasion for me to give a brief history lesson, without wanting 
to look too long in the tooth.  Perhaps the Minister of Transport 
will remember this, and so would the leader of the Conservative 
Party.  It was out of an omnibus bill that a first good wave of 
parliamentary reform came, with the bell ringing incident in 1982 
that was in response to an omnibus piece of energy legislation. 
The Lefebvre committee was created. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Contrary to what the government House leader said earlier, the 
Lefebvre committee came at the end of a parliament.  The 
government House leader said he thought that reform always came 
at the beginning of a parliament, but there was actually quite a 
bit of reform that came at the end of the parliament of 1980 to 
1984 as a result of the committee that was struck out of the bell 
ringing incident. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport was on that committee and will perhaps 
confirm to the government House leader what a wonderful job he 
did at that time in helping other members come forward with 
parliamentary reforms.  Those reforms were built on by the 
McGrath committee.  The first report of the McGrath committee 
basically said to adopt the Lefebvre committee recommendations. 
<P><A NAME="LINK187"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, one of the problems Canadians have 
is the appointment of people, mostly political hacks, to very 
sensitive positions within various departments in Canada.  Would 
the member agree that some of those people who are appointed 
should appear before the respective committee, with their CVs, 
for a peer review, in order for members to see if they truly are 
qualified for the jobs or are just political appointments? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that was something I did 
not get to.  Again, I hate to sound like a broken record, but if 
hon. members go back to the McGrath committee report they will 
see what we recommended for a lot of appointments, such as 
appointments of House officers and appointments to the National 
Energy Board at the time, to the CRTC, to the CBC and to the 
boards of crown corporations, both for chair and for board 
members in some instances.  We recommended that they be brought 
before the appropriate parliamentary committees, not just for 
questioning but in some cases actually for ratification, if I 
remember the recommendations correctly.  This would be another 
way for members of parliament to become more involved. 
<P><A NAME="LINK188"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
intend to share my time, if I can speak quickly enough, with my 
colleague and House leader, the member of parliament for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me be clear.  I think this institution is in very 
significant trouble.  It is appropriate that we should look at 
the procedural changes that are proposed here.  We will try that. 
I think the government should know, and I believe I am speaking 
on behalf of private members of many parties, that if this 
process does not work there is a growing will in the House to 
find some other way that will work, because the status quo in the 
House of Commons is no longer adequate.  It does not attract the 
respect and the sense of legitimacy that the House of Commons 
needs.  It is not accepted by the people of the country. 
Increasingly, it is not accepted here.

<A HREF="#LINKT47"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to start with what may be seen by some as a revolutionary 
principle.  I believe that if parliament works better, government 
can work better.  Of course there is going to be an adversarial 
relationship between the House of Commons and the government, and 
the member for Winnipeg—Transcona was absolutely right.  What 
people vote for is a parliament.  They do not necessarily vote 
for a government.  What we are here to do is to hold a government 
accountable and also to ensure that the government best reflects 
the interests and the sensitivities of the country.  That can be 
done through a strong parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that there will be some inspiration taken from the work 
of the McGrath committee by the members of the committee here.  I 
want to speak for just a moment about legitimacy. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the success or failure of democratic systems depends on 
the public's willingness to support or accept decisions made in 
the name of democracy.  Canadians are prepared to make difficult 
decisions, but they want to shape them.  To do so, they must have 
confidence in their leaders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just as we need wealth in order to prosper, we need confidence 
to govern.  These days, both are lacking. Our objective in these 
discussions must be to find the means to rebuild confidence in 
public institutions, to revive a feeling of legitimacy that will 
mobilize Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is for three reasons.  First, at the end of the day, the 
House of Commons is our most important institution.  It has power 
over the courts, over cabinets and over constitutions.  Let me in 
passing dismiss the notion that there is something 
unconstitutional about dealing with questions of confidence on 
the floor of the House.  Second, this is the only Canadian 
institution to which each citizen in each corner of Canada feels 
connected.  Third, the House of Commons may be the last existing 
pan-Canadian institution.  More than ever, this diverse, blessed 
and difficult community needs institutions it can respect and 
hold in common and we in this House are losing that capacity now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the House is seriously broken and I want to make the 
case that this is no government's fault.  Perhaps the best way I 
could do that is to identify three mistakes that were made, of 
which I was part, at least three, and there were no doubt many 
more.  The most important, I think, had to do with the change 
with regard to the control of estimates.  Last night we sat 
through a system where, in the twinkling of an eye, we approved 
the spending of billions of dollars.  That should not happen that 
easily. That should not happen that automatically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of a parliament, an adviser to a leader of a party 
who, in the name of efficiency, changed the rules of control by 
Committee of the Whole.  That was a mistake.  We should recognize 
that it was a mistake.  We should not consider that because that 
is the status quo now, we are somehow bound to accept it.  We 
have to go back to some control of spending or parliament will 
never have any purpose.  At the end of the day, if we do not have 
the power to control spending, we have power over nothing at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, to come to a point raised by my colleague from 
Winnipeg—Transcona, I was a member of a government—and we in 
that government were wrong—that changed a decision we had 
earlier taken and reinstated parliamentary secretaries to 
committees.  They should not be there.  They threaten the 
independence of the committee.  The McGrath committee report, 
which we briefly accepted at the time, was right. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make this point not because I like to admit mistakes, but 
because I think that if we are going to get anywhere in the 
debate we have to recognize that the present state of the House 
is not the fault of any one party.  It is a collective fault and 
the repair will come only if there is a collective will to try to 
change the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first sitting in the galleries and watching the 
House, sitting right down about here were a couple a members of a 
party that I think was then called the CCF.  They used their 
power with respect to divorce bills to deny unanimous consent to 
the House of Commons to force a change in the law of divorce.  It 
was too sensitive for governments to deal with as a matter of 
initiative, but those two members of parliament at the time, Mr. 
William Peters and Mr. Frank Howard, used that power, which no 
member of parliament now has, to deny unanimous consent on 
individual members and to force a change in the law of Canada. 
Did that incapacitate the Government of Canada?  No.  Did it 
force it to respond to public current attitudes of the country? 
Yes.  What is parliament to do?  It should be to force 
governments to pay attention to where the people are.

we are going to make this institution relevant.  We have to be 
prepared to admit those mistakes and make very fundamental 
changes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During my participation in the debate to the throne speech, I 
outlined a way that I would deal with what I believed was one of 
the most major of the recent failures of this parliament.  It had 
to do with committee of the whole House and control of government 
spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My own view as to how we could do that may not work but I would 
like it looked at.  I would empower the Leader of Her Majesty's 
Loyal Opposition to choose two departments a year.  Their 
estimates would be considered without any time limit and without 
let or hindrance.  There would not be any government spending 
approved until every member of parliament had approved the 
estimates of those two departments.  It would be done in 
committee of the whole House.  It would be understood that the 
choice by the Leader of the Opposition would not be made until 
the day before the examination began so that every department 
would have to prepare, assuming that it would be examined. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that would work.  If it would not work in committee of 
the whole House, I believe some variant that would allow a 
committee of supply to sit in an alternate Chamber would work. 
We have to admit that four decades ago we made a mistake and 
restore to the House some capacity for control of spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to speak very quickly on a matter which my colleagues 
would make clear I speak only for myself.  It involves a quite 
significant change in the relationship between government and the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time to challenge a central assumption about the House of 
Commons, namely the assumption that the power to initiate 
legislation should rest almost exclusively with cabinet and that 
the principal role of the rest of parliament is simply to hold 
cabinet accountable.  In practical terms that means that cabinet 
governs and the rest of parliament simply approves or 
disapproves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Cabinet is at the centre of the decisions and the rest of 
parliament is at the margins, whether as members of a government 
caucus who can often change the details of a proposal but rarely 
change its substance, or as members of an opposition party whose 
amendments or criticisms can sometimes, but not very often, bring 
a change.  We do not have parliamentary government.  We have 
cabinet government in a parliamentary system.  We have to make 
some very significant moves away from that.  One way would be 
through more free votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the question of cabinet government, let me quote from a 
recent article by Eric Kierans, a distinguished former member of 
the House and a former member of the Trudeau government.  He was 
commenting on events 30 years ago, but current today.  He said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada today is run by the Prime Minister's Office and Privy 
Council Office, whose mandarins instruct the elected members as 
to what they should do and say, and what opinions they must 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The notion that the prime minister is primus inter pares—first 
among equals—which appears in every textbook on political 
science, has become a lame joke.  The prime minister has no 
equals, nor any who can remotely aspire to be equal except by 
taking over the job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position is more like a president than a prime minister, but 
within a system not designed for such overwhelming centralized 
control, and in a regionalized nation where such control is not 
merely awkward, but dangerous to the public weal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>So spoke Eric Kierans.  He is absolutely right.  We have to take 
account of the extraordinary dangerous power that any prime 
minister, whether a prime minister from Shawinigan or a prime 
minister from Calgary Centre, holds.  That simply has to be 
changed if this system is going to be valid again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the House to consider a concept.  Let us distinguish 
between two broad categories of the policy questions the House of 
Commons considers.  One set involves issues which are without 
question life and death issues to a modern nation in a 
competitive world and where a government must be able to act 
quickly and decisively.  Those would include economic and fiscal 
policy, trade policy, federal-provincial-territorial relations, 
basic foreign policy, some legal matters and some others.  The 
list would have to be drawn very carefully.  An accountable 
government responsible to parliament should be the principal 
source and author of policy on those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a second category of issues which, while 
unquestionably important, are not at the core of a government's 
ability to lead and protect the nation.  Moreover, in some of 
these fields more imaginative and more appropriate policy may 
come from sources outside government.  That could be the case, 
for example, with issues relating to Indian affairs, the 
environment, the fishery, agriculture and to other policy fields. 
In those cases a principal source and author of policy should be 
an all-party committee of the House of Commons empowered to work 
directly with public servants and to call upon the best advice of 
the community. 
Indeed a process like that may yield better and more pertinent 
legislation than would a government which regards those issues as 
simply secondary to its mandate.

<A HREF="#LINKT49"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In effect we already distinguish between issues which are more 
important to a government and issues which are less.  In lower 
priority ministries, if good ideas come forward from the public 
servants of parliament they are more likely to be shunted aside 
in the privacy of the Prime Minister's office.  Moreover, as I 
know from experience, governments fall on large issues like 
budgets, not on more ordinary questions.  So we already 
distinguish between categories of issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This proposal would make much better use of the talent and 
experience of the men and women chosen by their neighbours to 
serve in the House of Commons.  We are wasting that talent and 
experience today, and we have been for some time.  In my 
consistent experience in the House of Commons in government and 
in opposition, any senior official in Ottawa has more influence 
over public policy than any elected member of parliament who is 
not in cabinet.  That is wrong in our system.  There has to be 
some very basic reforms undertaken if we are going to change that 
system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that breaks the traditions of the application of 
modern parliamentary democracy to a modern society.  Those are 
the sorts of things we have to look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me go to more specific matters.  I am conscious of my time 
and do not want to intrude too much on my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take the distinction made by my colleague from 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  We are talking about reform here if we are 
talking about anything sensible, but modernization is also 
allowable.  We should start by giving consideration for example 
to petitions that come by e-mail.  The standing order requiring 
25 signatures on a petition should be abandoned.  There is no 
reason to be that exclusive.  There is no reason why all motions 
on private members' and supply days should not be votable.  What 
is the House about if we are not going to have the opportunity to 
vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no question that we need a stronger cadre of law with 
respect to the auditor general, the privacy commissioner, the 
information commissioner and the language commissioner.  They 
should all have the status of being permanent witnesses to all 
committees and should be entitled to automatically comment on 
items of business before committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To go back to a matter raised a moment ago, the Speaker should 
have the power to refuse a closure motion and time allocation 
motions when the Speaker is of the opinion that the rights of a 
minority are being infringed upon.  That is done in the United 
Kingdom.  There is no reason why it cannot be done here.  If we 
are interested in following the British example, let us follow 
the good examples that would empower parliament more than is the 
case now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to see more elections in the House.  You, sir, as 
Deputy Speaker, should be elected.  Other presiding officers 
should be elected in the same way that Mr. Speaker is elected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a range of other specific changes that have to be 
undertaken.  As someone who has been in government and who has 
been in opposition, as the only member on the opposition's side 
of the House who has been a Prime Minister and who has sat in the 
cabinet of Canada, I believe the Government of Canada has nothing 
to fear from the Parliament of Canada.  Members who sit in 
cabinet have nothing to fear from the members of parliament who 
do not sit in cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we respect the fundamental rights of individual members of 
parliament and if we shake our rules to reflect that respect, we 
will not only have a government what could command more 
legitimacy, that would be more in tune with the concerns of the 
people in the country, we will have a parliament that will draw 
out the better natures, not the darker natures, of the members of 
parliament here. 
<P><A NAME="LINK189"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciated the message I just heard.  In 1993, when I 
was elected and came here for the first time, I knew things just 
were not right.  After a couple of years I realized just how 
serious an effect the situation was having on good governance in 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I certainly concur with everything the hon. member has just 
indicated.  For the life of me I cannot understand why, for 
example, on 74 occasions with Bill C-68 there were regulations 
and changes made by order in council.  Was that what order in 
council was all about, to make off the cuff changes whenever it 
felt like it?  Was there not a better purpose for that kind of 
situation to exist? 
Is judicial activism a result of the way this place has been 
operating over the years or did it come about by other reasons?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He talked about free votes.  I would like to hear his comments 
on referendum, one of the most effective measures used in many 
democratic countries in the world.  I would also like him to 
relate just a little more on free votes.  I cannot for the life 
of me understand why a person who is elected to this place would 
stand in tears and vote against hepatitis C victims, as I saw in 
this place.  What a disgrace to have to do that.  I know they did 
not want to that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the hon. member takes no offence, but having been a 
conservative all my life and being part of the organization that 
helped elect Brian Mulroney in 1984, surely some of these things 
were beginning to become obvious.  After nine years, why was 
something not done about it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could take partisan 
offence to the question, but I will not because it is a very good 
question.  Part of the reason is, when we come to government we 
put on the clothes of government.  Perhaps one of the 
perspectives I can bring to the House of Commons is as someone 
who has served in both government and in opposition, and has had 
an opportunity to look back on the attitudes that we bring in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We feared free votes too much as a government.  This government 
fears free votes too much.  Free votes, in my judgment, among 
other things, impose an obligation upon individual members to act 
responsibly.  My sense of the House is that if we treat members 
as being irresponsible they will act irresponsibly.  My sense 
also is that if we treat members responsibly they will respond in 
a positive way.  The attitude that we brought in, that 
governments bring in, fundamentally has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say in our defence, we introduced the McGrath Committee. 
We undertook attempts to try to change things at the time.  We 
also made significant mistakes.  Unless this process begun today 
is prepared to take a look at root and branch changes, it will 
make another serious mistake.  To quote the leader of the hon. 
member's party earlier today in the debate, what we will see is a 
continuing slide of public opinion with respect to this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians respect parliament less now than they did before. That 
is because this parliament has less power than it used to have or 
than it does in the textbooks that we use to teach Canadians.  We 
have to change that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK190"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
could the right hon. member briefly comment again on the aspect 
of redistribution of power and maybe try to bring some 
specificity or focus to the elements of power, which the member 
for Winnipeg—Transcona and he talked about, that would make 
these changes he is advocating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, first, there should be 
more free votes.  That would provide more power to individual 
members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, and a more radical idea, we should look very seriously 
at the idea of empowering standing committees in some fields with 
direct access to public service and professional advice so they 
can recommend policy on a much more regular basis in a category 
of issues that are not life and death issues to the government. 
That would give significantly more power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we cannot continue situations where, not to touch a raw 
nerve, an ethics counsellor does not report to this whole House. 
Officers of parliament should report to the whole parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a range of areas in which the power of parliament, as a 
practical matter, could be increased without threatening the 
capacity of the government to establish its mandate on the 
central issues for which it was elected. 
<P><A NAME="LINK191"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I must say it is an intimidating task to follow the 
right hon. member for Calgary Centre.  The tone he has set, his 
wisdom and the wisdom of other members that have been brought 
forward is very encouraging, particularly the commentary with 
respect to the recognition that all previous parliaments must 
shoulder the blame and responsibility for where we are today. 
Both good and bad changes have come about as part of the 
evolution of parliament.  That is natural.  We are a parliament 
that was borne out of the Westminster model.  We have much that 
we can learn from the evolution that has occurred there, as well 
as in other models.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that cynicism exists in some sectors, particularly 
among Canadians generally but also among many members of 
parliament, about the legitimacy of this exercise.  As a 
committee, of which I will be a member, we will have to be 
mindful of that cynicism and produce good results. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are off to a good start in terms of this debate.  I 
congratulate the hon. House leader for the governing party for 
initiating this, for giving us this opportunity and for 
indicating that there could be more.  That may very well come to 
pass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important time because Canadians have begun to 
question not only the effectiveness of parliament but its 
relevance as well.  It is a very serious condemnation of what we 
are here to do, which is to represent Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the outset I want to indicate and put a caveat on some of the 
ideas that I will be putting before the House.  When we go into 
this committee, it is to be understood that we are to improve 
upon, to hear from one another and to modify ideas that may be 
brought to the forefront. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is struggling with this process of modernization, or 
reform.  We are looking for ways to engage Canadians.  One way we 
can do that, and one part and parcel step in the right direction, 
is to modernize parliament in terms of our use of technology. 
The hon. member for Winnipeg South has a great interest in this 
issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member for Calgary Centre referred to the filing of 
petitions through e-mail as a way in which we could engage 
Canadians in a full and open fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Electronic records of the House should contain hyperlinks to 
those documents cited that are electronically available.  We 
should try to increase this access if we are to engage Canadians 
and inform them about the important work that is done by their 
parliament.  This would also help improve accountability. 
Canadians would be informed and they could observe and critique, 
in an open fashion, the workings of parliament.  Surely this 
would improve upon the relevancy, upon their perception and upon 
the real importance that is placed on the work that is done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some who think that parliamentarians themselves are 
losing their ability to be instruments of change.  I do not 
believe that.  I still believe in my heart of hearts that the 
originality and innovation that individuals could bring to 
parliament in their efforts and attempts to represent their 
constituents in an effective way can be enhanced and rewarding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen occasions where individual members have done yeoman 
service, in terms of bringing forward a private member's bill, 
and speaking out on occasion on an issue that may put them 
offside with their government or within their own parties, and it 
becomes a huge issue of consternation.  Other members have spoken 
to the issue of how bad behaviour is sometimes put under the 
spotlight and, therefore, there is perhaps too much emphasis 
put on dissent.  Of all the things that happen in the House of 
Commons, dissent should not be something that is foreign or 
necessarily frowned upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B> Encouraged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  The hon. member says encouraged and I 
agree with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about free votes and, the suggestion many have put 
forward, of having all private members' business made votable, 
these could be achieved by releasing some of the whipping tactics 
that are brought to bear on members by party whips.  The 
government could also abandon its practice of putting confidence 
votes behind issues that really do not have to be confidence 
votes.  Members should be allowed freer expression on issues that 
carry particularly moral implications for not only those members 
but for their constituents.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to empower members to have the ability to command this 
respect, we have to give them actual practical access to those 
levers.  If we are to energize and invigorate parliament, we have 
to take practical steps in that direction.  I would suggest that 
there will be a number of very positive and innovative 
suggestions that will come forward not only in this debate but in 
the committee as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will talk very briefly about the committee itself.  There is 
some scepticism because it is comprised strictly of House 
officers in this instance and it will soon become known as the 
Kilger committee.  Mr. Speaker, you will be presiding over it. We 
are to encourage the ideas, the House leader has expressed that 
spirit, and the inclusion of members in this process. The 
committee, I would suggest, if it is to have legitimacy, should 
be a reflection of all members and all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of wiring this place would allow greater public access. 
House records that should be in the public forum would certainly 
be more available if they were on the Internet at all times.  We 
should be wiring to the max. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another clear example would be the ability to have <I>Debates</I> 
and committee proceedings made more readily available.  The 
technology is there.  It is a costly exercise but it is one that 
would bear fruit long into the future.  We are slipping behind in 
the area of technology and the use that we make of it in 
parliament.  We should be a shining example for other countries 
and other companies that are doing great things.  We could learn 
from the technological advances that are being made in our 
country and in Silicon Valley not far from here.  We have 
businesses that are competing in the highest leagues of the world 
and we should be engaging them to help us to make greater use of 
technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have some specific recommendations I want to put on 
record.  I know we will have a chance in committee to delve into 
them in more detail.  One recommendation would be that we abolish 
the limit of four written questions per member.  We should be 
allowed a greater number of questions on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another recommendation would be to put time limits back in place 
for the government to respond to those questions.  It should be 
required to respond within a relatively short time, 15 or 30 
days.  It should not be the prolonged, dragged out affair that we 
have seen this exercise slide into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Speaker himself, as indicated earlier, should be given more 
powers on occasion to refuse closure motions or time allocation. 
The Speaker should also have the ability to ensure that the 
minority rights of members of parliament are being protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the comments made earlier that the Deputy Speaker 
should be elected by all members of the House of Commons, as 
should, on many occasions, chairmen of committees.  Perhaps we 
should not elect all chairmen, but it is an exercise we could 
enter into gradually.  Having chairmen elected would be a greater 
reflection of the neutrality and the non-partisanship of the 
committee, which is very much the spirit that should exist in the 
committee, away from the carnival atmosphere that we have seen 
question period become. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another issue that I fully believe has to be explored is the 
issue of a code of conduct for members of parliament.  It is a 
broad issue in and of itself, but if we are to expect a high 
standard, there are occasions where we will have to call to task 
bad behaviour and, in some instances, to have some teeth to 
punish. For example, if a member is suspended, and it is a rare 
occasion that it happens, their salary should be suspended to 
show that there is some discipline and some deterrent for bad 
behaviour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many other examples that would enhance the credibility 
of parliamentarians.  We should have an ethics committee.  If we 
are to have an ethics counsellor, we should have a sitting 
committee with an elected chair that would examine breaches of a 
code of conduct. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to officers of the House, who are there to serve 
all parliamentarians and to act on behalf of Canadians, such as 
the auditor general, the privacy commissioner, the information 
commissioner, the language commissioner, the ethics counsellor, 
they should all have a permanent status as witnesses on 
committees.  They should be automatically commanded to appear 
before committees to give testimony on their important findings 
and deliberations.

<A HREF="#LINKT53"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to witnesses on committees, we should consider 
having all witnesses give sworn testimony or affirm when they 
come before a committee.  This would add greater relevancy and 
greater importance.  It would stress the need for honesty, 
openness and integrity when witnesses come before a committee, 
not unlike what we see in the courts across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps there are occasions when we should look at expanding the 
hours in which we sit.  It was not uncommon in days gone by that 
the House of Commons would sit late into the night.  We have done 
so in emergency situations.  When we have crises in agriculture 
such as the ongoing potato wart epidemic in Prince Edward Island, 
as small as it is in terms of the actual epidemic but in terms of 
the ramifications which are causing such problems for those 
farmers, we should be able to sit late into the night if 
necessary to deliberate and talk about solutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many ways that we can improve upon the framework that 
parliament has embraced and come to practise in its important 
deliberations.  We have to improve upon the framework that is 
there and build upon the foundation that has been laid down.  We 
can do so in a non-partisan way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The spirit exists and the time is right.  I look forward to 
participating in the committee work. I will do my best on behalf 
of the members of my party and all members to bring original and 
honest ideas to this process. 
<P><A NAME="LINK192"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Public Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the member for his input into the debate.  He is quite 
right in terms of the House leaders again taking the lead role. I 
am a backbencher and I am here because now is my chance to put my 
two cents in on some issues that are important to me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I had to pick one, it would be private members' business. The 
member talked about being agents of change.  Private members' 
business seems to be an opportunity lost.  Quite frankly it has 
been since 1993, since I have been here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House was once seized with an issue where the resources 
available to private members were tremendously strained because 
so many members were bringing in bills.  They were being drafted, 
researched and all the other things but were never tabled, even 
at first reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder why we did not resolve that effectively.  No matter how 
expeditiously we bring in a bill after it has been selected, we 
could not possibly get 10 bills through.  Why do we allow members 
to put 10 bills on the order paper when it is not possible to get 
them through?  Why can members reserve a subject matter and 
restrict the opportunity of another member who has the same kind 
of idea but cannot bring it forward because someone got it in the 
day before?  Why is it that we do not have questions and comments 
on private members' debate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I am on duty just before the late show, why do I have to 
sit here and listen to designated people speak when somebody may 
have twigged on something that I want to know more about, or they 
may have said something that is quite frankly outrageous and I 
want to say so? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he wants to be an agent of change, I hope he gives us the 
undertaking right now that when he goes to the committee of House 
leaders he will in fact be an agent of change himself.  Maybe he 
will pick up the ball for all of us on private members' business 
and get it out of the damned committee over there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should make sure we have a process that would allow ordinary 
backbench members of parliament to feel that their ideas have a 
fair and equitable opportunity to come forward, even it means 
that I will come forward during the first hour to make my little 
speech.  I will stand here and take questions and answers from my 
colleagues before any other debate, and we will have a quick vote 
on whether members want to proceed any further with it.  Then it 
becomes the decision of this place, not of a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate very much the 
question and the opportunity to respond.  I fully agree that 
first and foremost it sends the wrong signal that it is again the 
House leaders who are meeting in private to perhaps have these 
deliberations and discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a precursor to that, we are getting an opportunity to hear 
from all members.  I appreciate what he said about the importance 
of private members' business.  I fully agree that private 
members' hour should also be subject to questions and comments. 
If we have to expand that time to two hours, we should make 
greater use of unanimous consent to do so on occasion. 
We should make greater use of the opportunity, when a member 
comes forward with an idea, to engage other members to find out, 
as he has said, if the idea should go further.

deliberation in the committee that will get a very broad shrift

engage more members and how we can bring more subject matter

members to put ideas forward then we should do everything in our 
power to do so.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson (Wild Rose, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, in 1993 the government of the day was the hon. member's 
party.  About six months, give or take, before the election the 
Conservative government made the decision to open the borders to 
barley sales and to have an open continental barley market.  It 
was an excellent decision.  Farmers benefited like they had never 
benefited before.  Profits were good and everyone was happy.  The 
wheat board even had record sales because it had decided there 
was competition going on and that it had better get off its duff 
and get to work.  It was a great decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not long after the election, the market was closed.  I asked the 
leader of the hon. member's party if he could remember and relate 
to me why the policy was discontinued.  What do we need to do to 
keep good things going for Canadians?  Why was the mechanism so 
easy to shut down and why, seven or eight years later, am I still 
not able to find out why?  Why was it shut down?  I do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will not be able to 
respond off the cuff.  I will certainly look into the matter and 
try to find an answer for the hon. member.  He deserves an 
answer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often policy decisions are made by incoming governments.  I am 
not saying that is what happened here, but we all know the 
position that was taken on the issue, for example, of free trade 
by the current government with respect to the efforts of the 
Mulroney administration to bring that policy forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Myron Thompson:</B>  But should we be able to provide 
answers? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay:</B>  Mr. Speaker, by all means, information 
should be available.  I will undertake to find out what happened 
in that instance since it was the Progressive Conservative 
government of the day that put the policy in place.  I will do my 
best to get back to the hon. member as quickly as possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Before resuming debate I will inform 
the House that all members now have 10 minutes maximum for their 
speeches, subject to a five minute question and comment period. 
<P><A NAME="LINK194"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock (Winnipeg South, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
trying to fit my thoughts into 10 minutes will be a bit of a 
trick, so I hope members in the ensuing five minutes will help me 
clarify my thinking with some of their questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House is everything that members in the debate today have 
said it is.  It is an enormously important place in the life of 
the country and in the lives of Canadians.  It is the place where 
citizens have a voice.  It is the place where rights are decided 
and arbitrated.  It is the place where power is balanced and 
mitigated.  It is the place where authority is exercised on 
behalf of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite excited about the debate and quite pleased we are 
headed down this road.  Frankly, I like the device that has been 
chosen.  I want to thank all House leaders for the vehicle they 
have created because I have a lot of respect for them.  They have 
a lot of knowledge about this place and they are applying 
themselves to the task.  I hope we will have opportunities for 
members to meet with the committee and to present ideas that are 
hard to fit into a 10 minute speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will step back a bit from the specifics of some of the rule 
changes that have been discussed today.  I will try to position 
the debate in a somewhat different context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A friend recommended I spend time preparing for the debate by 
reading the annotated rules of the House.  They are a fascinating 
read.  Rules are normally not terribly interesting to read. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1835"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT56"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT56"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1835
<A HREF="#LINKT57"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT55"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the rules that govern this Chamber were first created in 
1867 and they were trying to figure out how they worked, they 
brought in a clause that existed for a long time which said that 
if they did not have a rule to cover something then the rules of 
the mother of parliaments would apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we read this we also see the evolution of our society.  The 
Chamber is a reflection of what we are as Canadians.  The rules 
were written before my province, Manitoba, existed as a province 
and had representation in the House, and before Alberta and 
Saskatchewan were formally provinces.  The rules existed before 
the advent of the automobile, the airplane or the telephone, and 
certainly before the fax machine and the Internet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each time changes in the external community put pressure on this 
place and made changes to the environment that the citizens we 
represent live in, the House had to adapt.  It has adapted, and 
tracing that adaptation is an interesting read. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question I raise today, though, is whether we are at a point 
in time on which we will look back in 20 or 30 years and say it 
was a far more revolutionary period than perhaps we ever 
realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians have some advantages.  Some of the foundational 
research on communications, communication theory and 
communication policy has come out of the work of Canadians.  One 
of my favourites was an economist by the name of Harold A. Innis 
who, during the last century, started writing about the economy 
of the country and was drawn into the question of the power of 
communication. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Innis wrote a book called <I>The Bias of Communication</I>.  He 
delivered a lecture in 1947 to the Royal Society of Canada 
regarding his research.  He started the lecture by saying: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have attempted to suggest that western civilization has been 
profoundly influenced by communication and that marked changes in 
communications have had important implications. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What Harold Innis was saying, if I can translate it to the year 
2001, is that the Internet changes everything.  His research 
dated to the early days of clay and cuneiform and traced how, as 
successive civilizations acquired the ability to assemble 
information and extract knowledge from it, the ruling classes 
were able to monopolize the information.  Then a new technology 
would come along and disturb the system and a new power structure 
or a new elite would emerge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Historically these things have happened in dramatic fashion 
through wars and revolutions, but also in other ways.  The rise 
of the modern democracy was built largely around the printing 
press and the availability of information, which has enabled 
people to develop the intellectual tools and knowledge necessary 
to participate in the management of their country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we were concerned in the 1970s about dictatorships in 
Central and South America, there was a fellow who said to send 
them books instead of guns because an educated populace demands a 
democratic solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why are we here today feeling that this instrument of democracy 
no longer functions, when Canada has an educated populace? 
Canadians are literate, well read and engaged with their 
government.  Why are we concerned about a loss of credibility of 
this place? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another reference, an American reference.  It is 
from a fellow by the name of Jerry Mechling who said the same 
concern is being raised in democracies around the world.  It is 
not just a Canadian problem.  The issue arises throughout the 
industrialized world where democracies exist.  By the way, Jerry 
Mechling will be speaking in Ottawa next Wednesday night.  Here 
is how he begins one of his pieces on the changes brought about 
by communications: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are entering a period of historical change comparable to the 
one that inspired Hamilton, Madison and Jay to pen <I>The 
Federalist Papers</I> in the late 1780s.  Their task was to define 
a constitutional vision for a new kind of political community: a 
federal democratic republic.  The challenge for leaders today is 
to define an economic, social and political vision for a new kind 
of society, a knowledge based society, and leadership will be 
crucial.

<A HREF="#LINKT56"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have thought about that a lot.  I certainly support a lot of 
the suggestions people have made here about the changes that 
could be made to the rules to shift the power balance between the 
executive and the House.  I agree with the leader of the 
Conservative Party when he says that when parliament works well 
government works well.  Accountability is an important part of 
the functioning of any good organization. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also agree with the analysis that says authority has over time 
moved to the executive.  However I will put that in context. 
There is a tendency here to personalize that, to say it was 
something the current Prime Minister or the past Prime Minister 
did, or that it was part of some invidious plan on the part of 
somebody.  I do not believe that is true at all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I offer this analysis.  The pace of change in society has been 
accelerating throughout the lifetime of mankind but never as 
rapidly as in the last few decades.  Bill Gates, in his recent 
book, talks about this decade as the decade of velocity.  The 
most important challenge in our society is trying to manage the 
rate of change and deal with the incredible decisions placed upon 
us not just as a government but as a society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at what has happened with large organizations, many 
large companies that were in existence a decade or two ago no 
longer exist today.  A number of the largest companies in the 
world today did not exist in 1980.  The rate of change is 
enormous.  One response to the incredible velocity in the 
external community has been for governments to remove 
decision-making from the floor of the House.  They have done so 
not for malicious reasons but to facilitate decisions and serve 
citizens because this place moves too slowly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was director of child welfare in Manitoba, we wrote 
clauses enabling regulation because it was the most efficient way 
to get changes to reflect the changing needs of our citizens.  I 
am not saying it was the best solution, but it was the only 
solution available.  The shift in power from the House to the 
executive has been, in most cases, an attempt to meet the 
challenge imposed by those whom we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge is not to simply revert to an earlier stage.  It 
is to figure out how this place can reform so that it moves in 
pace with the rest of society.  In achieving this reform, 
therefore, the critical issues are those of electronic services, 
of getting information out earlier and of more efficiently and 
effectively interacting with the community we serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rule changes being debated here are also important and they 
are like the rule changes we find in the annotated history.  They 
need to be done.  The process is a competent one and I am 
delighted that it runs by consensus.  However the bigger change, 
the one we must all get our minds around, is how to make this 
place work at the same speed at which our citizens move.  How do 
we make this place respond to the pace of life in the communities 
we represent? 
<P><A NAME="LINK195"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
just a short congratulations to you on your appointment to chair 
the committee.  In time, when you look back on your political 
legacy, your chairing of this committee has the potential to be a 
defining moment for you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish we could have another hour of the member for Winnipeg 
South here tonight because he has spent thousands of hours 
working on the linkage of electronic government, which is where 
we as a service agency touch the general public.  It is critical 
in this parliamentary reform that the service to the public, the 
linkage of what we do here, is transmitted to the people on the 
street, our constituents, from coast to coast.  Right now they 
ask us as MPs to do things.  It seems we never give them the 
answers they want, or that we give them the answers six weeks, 
two months or a year later. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question for the member for Winnipeg South, who has 
touched on a critical issue here, electronic government.  How 
does he envisage electronic government enhancing service to the 
public?  That ultimately is what parliamentary reform is all 
about, and what ultimately will earn respect for the service we 
are supposed to provide in the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Reg Alcock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, if I could have leave to 
have the rest of the week we could really get into this. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the very important question the member has 
asked, and one which I thank him for, is that we get caught up in 
the tools:  the electronics, the fancy colours and the fancy 
websites.  However, the tools are not the issue.  The tools are 
important to get information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things this does really well is it acts as a huge 
values clarification exercise for the nation where I, as a 
westerner dealing with the economy and interests of Winnipeg, 
have to confront the issue of bilingualism, which is not 
something that is driven as hard in my community as it is here, 
or the cod fishery.  Together we come and forge through the 
exercises that go on in this incredibly wonderful country called 
Canada.  We are really skilful at that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we maintain that but get this beast moving at the same 
pace as the community it has to serve?  The community goes around 
it because it cannot respond fast enough.  That is why we have 
lost authority and our debates have become trivial.  They have 
become liar-liar kind of debates.  What does that do for anybody? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debates need to be substantive and real debates about the 
conditions that are affecting the people in our communities.  We 
are not there because they pass us by all the time.  I will try 
to give a more detailed answer in a presentation to the 
committee, which I will be allowed to do. 
<P><A NAME="LINK196"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally (Dewdney—Alouette, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to participate in the debate on 
parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members of the Alliance, and previously as members of the 
Reform Party, parliamentary reform is something for which we have 
become known.  We are glad to see that we are having a debate in 
the House this evening on such an important topic.  It is of 
course something that has been near and dear to our hearts for a 
very long time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We hope that the debate and the committee that has been struck 
thinks big and has the vision and courage to move ahead in the 
face of those who would argue to maintain the status quo.  We 
must move forward together because where we will end up will be a 
better place than from where we started. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In any debate that we have, in any consideration of moving 
forward on any topic, we need to have a clear understanding of 
why we need to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of parliamentary reform, the public, those to whom we 
are responsible and accountable, are telling us that they want to 
see change in this place.  It is incumbent upon us as leaders of 
this nation to move forward and to show, with our actions, that 
we are willing to listen and that we are willing to do more than 
simply have a debate one day in parliament and then move ahead as 
though nothing had happened.  I am encouraged by this committee 
and this opportunity to explore these very important issues 
because the time is right to move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting that one of the only constants that we will 
experience in our lives is change.  What is now will never be 
again and we will be moving continually forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking, there seems to be two attitudes that people 
have toward change.  The first one, which is the more natural 
inclination, is to resist change because change takes us down a 
new path to somewhere where we are perhaps a little uncertain as 
to where we will arrive.  It is understandable that some people 
and, I would argue, many people are resistant to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a vision of where we are going.  We could bring 
people along to understand that there is a compelling reason to 
move forward to a new destination, to a better place.  We could 
take into consideration people's honest concerns about making 
those changes.  We could have a clear airing of being able to 
present ideas that are holding others back from wanting to go 
forward with change.  I think we could do those things.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could go down that road and end up in a better place. 
Unfortunately there will be no rest for those who are involved in 
change, because once we get to the better place there will be 
others who will suggest further change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Change is constant.  We must grapple with that concept and 
understand that when we are talking about parliamentary reform 
the initiatives that we may move forward on will not be the end 
of the ball game.  In many ways they will just be the beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We certainly need to go down that road.  We certainly need to 
work together in the House in ways we are sometimes unaccustomed 
to working.  We need to work with members of all parties.  We 
need to work together as government and opposition members to 
achieve some goals and a vision of ending up in a better place. 
It is not for ourselves but for this institution and for those 
who will come after us to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have our names on a plaque in the basement of this hall 
one day.  Apart from our families and personal acquaintances, 
very few might ever remember that we were honoured to grace these 
halls.  However we will remember and cherish the moments we had 
to make a difference in Canada.  It is incumbent upon us to make 
the most of this opportunity, to do what we can for this place 
here and now, so that those who come behind us in the future will 
carry that torch for us with that notion of change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This place cannot be a static environment.  The House cannot be 
a place where the rules are cast in stone.  It cannot be a place 
where the ideas and innovations of those who lead this nation are 
unable to make it to the forefront.  It has to be a place where 
all those ideas and issues are brought to bear.  This is the 
place where we have been sent to do the nation's business for the 
period of time we are honoured to serve here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I am encouraged by this opportunity.  It is a great 
honour to serve here.  We need to give hope to our citizens that 
those who are leading are also listening and acting on the will 
of our citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we take these actions it will provide an opportunity to send 
a signal or message to the 40% or so of our citizens who chose 
not to vote in the last election.  Many individuals who did not 
vote in the last election have said that the government and 
members of parliament are not listening, that it did not matter 
who was sent here, that nothing would change.  We need to signal 
to our citizens that we are willing to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many proposals have been put forward by members in the House 
today.  I appreciate what they have had to say.  I would not 
agree with all the suggestions and it is good to have the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I pay tribute to my colleague from Calgary Southwest who 
announced today that he would be leaving public life and 
returning to the private sector.  He has been a leader on these 
issues for many years: before he got to the House and as he 
served in the House and will continue to serve until the end of 
this year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His vision was one that we are now grappling with in the House. 
One of the things he brought forward was the issue of free votes 
in the House of Commons.  There is no reason we cannot move 
forward on that initiative without any legislative change or any 
change to the standing orders.  We could do it simply by allowing 
members to vote the wishes of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Government members could support an opposition motion or a bill 
and opposition members could support a government bill or motion. 
We could work together on areas where there is commonality.  We 
could bridge that gap, the partisan divide that seems to be very 
much a part of this place.  We will never erase that totally, but 
there are many opportunities for us to work together for change, 
and free votes is one of them.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was encouraged by the Minister for International Trade the 
other day.  It was a small item but it was a gesture of good 
will.  When we had a debate on softwood lumber in this place last 
week, the minister consented to stay beyond the regular time for 
questions.  In fact that was initiated, Mr. Speaker, by your 
asking the House if there would be consent for such an item, and 
there was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister stayed and he answered questions from opposition 
members for perhaps another 10 minutes.  Although that was such a 
small item it sent a message of good will to members of the 
opposition that there was a minister who was willing to entertain 
questions.  It was a very small change, but let us imagine if we 
were to incorporate that as a rule change or something we would 
do on a regular basis.  That would help to break down the walls 
of partisanship.  It would build a deposit of political capital 
for ministers of the government.  It would be good for all 
members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to private members' business, all bills should be 
votable.  We could find ways to work around the current schedule 
to make that happen so that members could bring forward their 
items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that my time is drawing short on this topic, so I will 
conclude by saying that I sincerely hope we spend time putting 
these changes into action.  I hope we do not just have a debate, 
put it on the shelf and ignore what we have discussed here.  We 
should move forward together in this place in a spirit of 
co-operation to make it a better place, not only for us but for 
future generations.  Then we would have a responsive parliament 
which reflects the will and the wishes of those who have sent us 
here to govern.

comments.  I was particularly interested in his support for 
making private members' bills votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a technical problem to that.  There are an awful lot of 
private members' bills that are always on the roster at any given 
time and there is a whole problem with respect to how they should 
be selected by lottery or whatever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make a suggestion to him for his comment that 
was raised by the member for London North Centre.  That was the 
possibility of every member of parliament during a session, from 
the time of an election to the next time the writ is dropped, 
being entitled to have one bill made votable.  The actual lottery 
or the selection of the bill would be based simply on the order 
that the members' bills would come up.  Every member would have 
at least one bill during a session that was votable.  I wonder 
what the member thinks of that idea. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Grant McNally:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  I think it is a good idea.  Certainly we would be in 
agreement that all items should be made votable.  We would have 
to make some changes to the way we do business in private 
members' business in terms of the scheduling of those items. 
Perhaps we need to consider the idea of every member having a 
votable item. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would support that notion or any other ideas members may have 
to involve more members and to focus on the main part of the 
member's request that all items be made votable.  That is a very 
important thing that we need to do.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett (St. Paul's, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate you this evening as the chair of the special 
committee on the modernization of House of Commons procedure. 
There is no one better for the challenge of trying to obtain 
consensus.  For us to move forward, it was interesting to hear 
that not only the government would have a veto on this committee. 
Everyone on the committee would have a veto, so I hope there will 
be lots of opportunity for compromise, change and getting good 
ideas through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In every organization there must be ongoing efforts to make 
things better.  In the private sector it is called CQI, 
continuous quality improvement, or TQM, total quality management. 
In government it is called parliamentary reform, a phrase that 
seems to mean something different to everyone.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to make sure that people understand this is not about a 
revolution from the backbench MPs.  It should actually be an 
ongoing process by which we discover the optimal practices of the 
301 citizens who come to Ottawa to try to best represent the 30 
million citizens.  It is about ensuring the public good by 
identifying the obstacles and sharing the solutions.  Today's 
special committee is an extraordinarily important step. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my heroes, Ursula Franklin, talked about good government 
as being fair, transparent and taking people seriously.  It has 
been worrying to a lot of us over the past several months that 
somehow the public has become disengaged.  If one went to Israel 
and saw six million politicians discussing what happened 
yesterday in the Knesset, it would be understood why we here 
worried on a daily basis about the cynicism and apathy of 
Canadians.  We have to always look at what we can do.  Each of us 
has a responsibility to hand on democracy at least as thick as we 
received it, if not a tiny bit thicker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People feel Canadian democracy needs some reintegration.  The 
most obvious symptom of the need for reform was the steep fall in 
the election turnout on November 27.  After drifting down an 
average of 2.7% per election, turnout dropped more than 5% for 
the 2000 election.  This confirmed years of academic admonitions, 
politician's anecdotes and pollsters findings that Canadians were 
indeed disengaging. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1984 the national average was a 75.3% turnout in a federal 
election of which we were always very proud.  Last year it was 
61.18%, and even lower in Ontario.  It means that we have to see 
what we can do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today's special committee is an important first step.  The idea 
that we can move forward by consensus is of huge importance to us 
collaborating on this important challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that rules are not enough.  Changing only the rules 
of parliament will not change what happens here.  As Robert 
Marleau said to the rookie school of the new members of 
parliament, we can change all the rules we want but it is the 
culture of the place that really matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wear four different hats in trying to make a difference and in 
trying to make sure that things change.  The first is in the 
House and in committees.  The second is within our caucus, in 
trying to make sure that the culture is one that is respectful of 
the kinds of changes that people want to make.  The third is in 
my riding.  The fourth is within the Liberal Party of Canada.  We 
need to work on all four fronts if we are going to have the 
desired effect that Canadians again begin to engage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extraordinarily important that the caucus has evolved a 
parallel process in which we can also look at all the things that 
have been done and the telephone books full of papers that have 
been written on the topic of parliamentary reform.  We should 
start to look not at reinventing the wheel but going forward with 
Canadians at our side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a caucus we need to be able to look at the party options, the 
role of parliament, the role of parliamentarians, as well as what 
this very important committee will do in terms of how the House 
of Commons operates, its procedures, standing orders, question 
period and all of those things.  Private members' business has 
been discussed and will be an important part of the deliberations 
of this committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also extraordinarily important that we look, as the member 
from Winnipeg South said, at the role of technology and make sure 
that if we are indeed modernizing parliament that we do it with 
all the citizens as engaged as possible, both at committees and 
with members in their offices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has a huge ability to create the new kind of deliberative 
democracy that I think we are looking for.  I was heartened to 
hear the minister of Indian affairs, who came to women's caucus 
today, talk about his amazing project in terms of his 
technological ability to be in contact with the bands and the 
schools in order to do his job.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We know we have to have a look at standing committees.  There 
are ones that are working extraordinarily well in a very 
non-partisan way and with its eye on the goal.  Others have been 
rendered dysfunctional.  We need to figure out why that is.  It 
is important that we look at standing committees.  It is 
important that they deal with horizontal issues across 
parliament.  Chapter 20 of the auditor general's report said how 
difficult that was. We look at having the standing committees can 
help us with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I as chair and members of the subcommittee on disabilities were 
thrilled that the auditor general thought our committee, which 
looked at the issue of disabilities across all ministries, had 
been helpful in that management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at caucus committees and their culture, it is 
important for us to look at, like the English and French 
parliamentarians, the purpose for us being here is not to try to 
get into cabinet.  That culture of careerism has to stop.  There 
are important things that people can do.  Look at some of the 
ministers in other countries who actually give up their 
administrative roles in order to be able to do an important 
project.  It is a culture problem.  We need to make sure that 
people are not paralyzed by some fantasy of a role at cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is really important that we look at the accountability of 
government.  This is not just about what money we spend, but 
whether we get good value for it.  With the chairman of the 
public accounts committee, I was thrilled to chair these round 
tables on societal indicators.  We discussed how we could use the 
estimate process in a better way to make sure we were funding 
programs that worked and ones which would ensure we had safer 
streets, healthier populations and cleaner air.  We also 
discussed how we could measure that and use that to build back 
the credibility of Canadians so they would know we were spending 
their money wisely.  There are extraordinarily interesting things 
that can happen in terms of the accountability of our government 
and building back the faith. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important that there be good supports.  Above all 
things, the most interesting to me in parliamentary reform is the 
relationship we need to build with the citizens of Canada so they 
see this institution as relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. Paul's is an amazing riding.  Forty per cent of the people 
have a university education.  We have an amazing ability to 
engage.  However, one thing I adored doing over this last month 
or so was taking the problem of cynicism and apathy of Canadians 
to the students of grade 10 in all the ridings.  This was related 
to the citizenship engagement award.  I asked them what they 
thought the problem was in terms of cynicism and apathy and what 
they thought we in the government could do differently to help 
them.  I did this understanding that their knowledge of the 
technology was much better than mine and that maybe they could 
find us some web based solutions on which we could move forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that in all of the Ekos polling, Canadians believed 
that if we as parliamentarians could take the national problems 
to the people at the grassroots, we would solve most of our big 
national problems.  We must figure out a better way of doing 
that.  It was quite clear that Canadians felt the media, senior 
business leaders, lobbyists and interest groups had too much 
power.  The Ekos poll noted that Canadians felt that 
parliamentarians had little power and that the average citizen 
had way too little power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The challenge of democracy between elections is what we need to 
see.  We need to see that it is not just about going to the 
polls.  If we are not engaging citizens between elections they 
stop going to the polls. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the people of Canada have an enormous 
contribution to make in the development of public policy.  We 
must try to involve them in a grassroots movement for democratic 
reform, which will produce lasting results.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for her excellent 
dissertation.  I wonder if she could comment a little further on 
the political culture, that is the context in which we seek 
parliamentary reform, the relationship between the backbench on 
the government side, for example, and the sometimes lack of 
opportunity of expression because they are government 
backbenchers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Carolyn Bennett:</B>  Mr. Speaker, some of what the hon. 
member is talking about is actually perception.  I was thrilled 
at the last election to write single spaced on one page what I 
thought I had been able to do here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committees I had the privilege to sit on, whether it was the 
national health products committee, the committee on custody and 
access or the finance committee, was one of the best abilities 
for the government to go out to real Canadians and harvest good 
ideas.  It was been extremely satisfying.  We got to push the 
issues we wanted.  It was like any board that one might sit on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In caucus we fight for the things we really care about.  We do 
not win all the battles but we go out as a united front. It was 
the same as any other board I sat on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is so much to do around here.  There are so many issues 
that require real champions.  It is quite clear that when the 
stakeholders and the citizens of Canada who must work in concert 
with us as politicians to sometimes work through a bureaucracy 
that has too much on its plate, we get to shine the light and 
move those things through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hugely optimistic.  I think the frustration is real, but 
there are serious ways that we can make a difference here.

<P><A NAME="LINK200"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères—Les-Patriotes, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am very pleased to take part in this debate pursuant 
to Standing Order 51(1).  Its purpose is to ensure that we are 
able to debate in this House any matter relating to the reform of 
the standing orders, consolidate the achievements that we deem 
appropriate and make the changes we feel it would be advisable to 
make so that this House can be a modern parliamentary institution 
and meet the expectations of our fellow citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In that regard, I would say that we are becoming increasingly 
aware of a certain cynicism among the public, a loss of 
confidence in political institutions and, more generally, in the 
men and women chosen to sit in this very House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Consequently, it is certainly appropriate for us to give 
ourselves a kind of shock treatment to jolt our political 
institutions more into line with the expectations of our fellow 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us recall that, on April 21, 1998, a similar debate was held 
in this House under the same Standing Order 51(1). Unfortunately, 
it did not result in any changes to the standing orders. 
This time I trust the debate will not be in vain, that it will 
not be pointless and that we will be able to see a sensible 
outcome leading to substantial amendments to the standing orders 
such that they will, as I have said, be brought more into line 
with the expectations of the people of Canada and of Quebec about 
what a representative political institution should be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, we have not used the standing orders to make the 
changes to the electoral and parliamentary system we ought to 
have made.  It is to be hoped that the process put in place 
through this committee will produce some results.  I hope that 
this committee will show the necessary transparency to enable us 
to achieve results fulfilling not only the expectations of our 
fellow citizens but also the wishes expressed here in this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just go quickly through my shopping list, in the light of 
comments I have heard from both sides of the House as an ordinary 
member.  In my role as party whip, I have also had the 
opportunity to hear my colleagues defend various points of view, 
and those of our constituents, the people we have the duty and 
honour of representing here in the House.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with respect to committee chairs, if we want to ensure 
that committees can operate in as non-partisan a manner as 
possible, with the maximum consensus, something must be done to 
eliminate to the greatest extent possible partisan comments 
within committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, I would first recommend that there be a better 
distribution of chairs and vice chairs between the opposition and 
the government, and that it not be exclusively government members 
who are assigned as committee chairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of committees that operate this way, 
including in the national assembly in Quebec City and in the 
house of commons in London, and all signs are that this approach 
is very useful, very productive and very positive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Ultimately, the current standing orders notwithstanding, the 
Speaker of the House will have to be able to intervene when a 
serious problem arises in committee.  Unfortunately, when 
decisions taken in committee run counter to the standing orders, 
common sense and the very interest of democracy, members need to 
have a court of last appeal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the circumstances, I believe that the Speaker of the House 
would be ideal for this purpose, because he is elected by all 
members of the House.  He could therefore not be accused of any 
favouritism. 
He should therefore be an impartial judge, who could, as need 
be, produce a final ruling that is both equitable and just. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the public expects members of the House of Commons to be 
able to vote more often according to the interests of their 
riding and according to their conscience rather than along party 
lines.  Too often, the public has the impression that their 
members have become more instruments of their political party 
than representatives of their riding in the House of Commons, in 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will have to be allowed more flexibility, so that they 
can vote freely not only on moral issues, but also on a host of 
government management issues.  To do so, the notion of 
confidence must be redefined. 
Every time we vote, the government must not necessarily feel 
that a vote of confidence is being held. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Apart from budget issues, perhaps we could create a mechanism 
whereby, if the government were defeated in the House, the very 
next day it could put a motion to the House to find out whether 
it still enjoys its confidence.  In such a case, the government 
would not fall automatically when it is defeated on a particular 
measure.  It would simply be required to ask the House whether 
it still enjoys its confidence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen a harmful and unfortunate tendency in recent years, 
which the government follows increasingly frequently, that of 
imposing closure and time allocation motions. 
A mechanism has to be set to require the government to justify 
and explain its reasons for the measure, which should be 
exceptional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standing orders provide for this.  Indeed, Standing Order 78 
provides that it must be as a last resort.  Just as the standing 
orders refer to the concept of abuse of parliamentary practice, 
perhaps we could, as we did with Motion No. 2, allow the Speaker 
to rule whether House practices are being abused. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Speaker is considered able to rule on the repetitive, 
frivolous or vexatious nature of amendments introduced by 
members, I think it should also be provided that the Speaker may 
rule on the vexatious nature of the government's excessive use 
of time allocation and closure motions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To avoid the very unpleasant and embarrassing situation in which 
we found ourselves during the last parliament at third reading of 
Bill C-20, on reform of the Elections Act, we should allow at 
least one representative from each recognized political party in 
this House to speak at each stage of the review of a bill or 
during each debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not find ourselves in the same situation as the one we 
experienced during third reading of Bill C-20, to amend the 
Elections Act, when only two of the five political parties in the 
House were allowed to express their views through their 
spokespersons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be appropriate, I believe, to allow all political 
parties to express their views at least once on any issue brought 
to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, all the issues brought to the attention of 
parliamentarians should be votable items. I am referring to 
private members' business, to emergency debates and to take note 
debates. Of course we will have to devise a new process to select 
the bills that will be reviewed by the House. However, once the 
House looks at a bill or a motion, particularly a bill or a 
motion proposed by parliamentarians, it would be more than 
appropriate for members to vote on them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must design a process whereby the House would be asked to 
formally ratify international treaties signed by the Government 
of Canada, as is done in most democracies. Canada is an exception 
to the rule and not necessarily a good one. Under the current 
system, the government does not have to ask parliament to ratify 
the treaties it signs. This is an anachronism that should be 
corrected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to change the parliamentary calendar. The 
government House leader likes to pick and choose when deciding 
which Westminster rules are important or relevant for the House 
of Commons in Canada. There are a number of practices in London 
that do not necessarily suit his needs, so he does not talk about 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary calendar was modified in London some years 
ago.  They took a number of factors into consideration and 
lightened the calendar.  Doing so would not mean that we would 
sit any fewer hours; they would just be distributed differently. 
Friday sittings would not necessarily be abolished, but they 
would be changed.  We could, for example, look at private 
members' business on Fridays.  We could, as they do in London and 
in Quebec City, have an inquiry mechanism which would require us 
to go into a specific matter in greater depth with the minister 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to realize that, with the exception of Ontario, 
all ridings represented by the members of this House are larger 
than their counterparts in the provincial legislative assemblies 
and in the national assembly. They are, therefore, ridings with 
far larger populations.  The fact is that the members of the 
House of Commons sit far longer, and far more often, than their 
counterparts in the various provinces and in Quebec.  As a 
result, we have far less time to cover our far larger ridings and 
to serve our far greater numbers of constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think we ought to address this reality, particularly since we 
need to take increasingly into consideration the expectations of 
our fellow citizens in this respect, as well as the fact that 
members of parliament have families.  We need to be able to 
reconcile politics and a family life, particularly if we want to 
attract more women to politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are therefore grounds for reassessing the parliamentary 
calendar, reworking things so that all members, or at least most 
of them, can spend at least one day a week in their riding, not 
including weekends of course, to do the work of their riding 
office and look after the needs of their fellow citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the years, as a result of custom, of the various Speakers' 
rulings, and of the work done in the Standing Committee on 
Procedure and House Affairs and in similar committees in previous 
parliaments, we have seen an erosion, as it were, of 
parliamentary privilege. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would perhaps be appropriate to reinforce the notion of 
parliamentary privilege such that it can be effectively applied. 
There has, of course, been an extension of privilege in committee 
work, but there has been a erosion of privilege per se, and this 
needs to be revisited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thought needs to be given to making the prescribed form for the 
presentation of petitions more flexible. This poses a serious 
problem with our constituents who are not necessarily up on all 
the parliamentary jargon and who may spontaneously circulate a 
petition on a matter of public interest and submit it to their 
member, only to be told that it is not in the prescribed form and 
cannot be presented in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This goes against the very principle whereby citizens should be 
able to submit petitions to the Parliament of Canada.  Something 
must therefore be done to make this prescribed form naturally 
accessible to citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In order to avoid embarrassing situations such as those we saw 
prior to 1994 and those we have seen in recent years, the rules 
must be changed to make opposition motions non-amendable, if I 
may put it that way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something has to be done so that committee work may be televised 
much more easily, in keeping naturally with the guidelines set 
by the House Standing Committee on Procedure and House Affairs. 
You will recall, Mr. Speaker, since you were on the Standing 
Committee on Procedure and House Affairs at the time, that these 
guidelines concern the rules established for broadcasting the 
debates of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules for allowing emergency debates must also be made more 
flexible.  Very often we have different experiences in the 
various regions of Canada and Quebec, which we would like to draw 
to the attention of the Chair.  It may, for a variety of 
perfectly legitimate reasons, not recognize the importance of 
issues raised by members. Accordingly, it would be important for 
us to be able to ease the rules on emergency debates, especially 
since they do not impinge on regular hours set aside for the 
business of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As they do not affect the business of the House, the 
government's legislative agenda, private members' business or the 
regular operations of the House, I argue in favour of an easing 
of the rules on the acceptance of emergency debates, so that this 
House may respond in a timely way to the various situations that 
may arise in the regions of Canada and Quebec. As members can 
see, the subject is vast and many changes may be made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I note with considerable satisfaction, I must say, and with 
great pleasure that the government House leader is still with us 
this evening to listen to what we have to say. 
I hope he will not merely listen, but that he will also 
follow up on the comments made by his colleagues here today, so 
that we can, as I said at the beginning, amend the standing 
orders to allow our fellow citizens to identify with our 
parliamentary system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the benefit of the government House leader but, as I 
mentioned at the very beginning of my speech, we cannot take this 
issue casually. In view of voter turnout at the last election, we 
must recognize that our fellow citizens are losing interest in 
public affairs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This compels us to question the electoral process as well as the 
political and parliamentary institutions. We must modernize our 
institution so that our fellow citizens can identify with it. 
These reforms must be such that Canadians feel that we members of 
parliament are not mere instruments of political parties or 
voting machines, but are here to represent them, to protect their 
interests and to voice their concerns.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Bev Desjarlais (Churchill, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have two brief comments before I ask my question.  First, dealing 
with the democratic process within the House and committees is an 
important effort parliamentarians are making.  After a short time 
here—one term and now into my second—I will say that it has 
been a very frustrating process.  Those members who have gone on 
year after year dealing within this process are to be 
congratulated and should all be nominated for the Order of Canada 
just for surviving what has sometimes been so frustrating that we 
wonder why we come to the House each day.  I want to congratulate 
all those who have worked so hard to have this issue brought to 
the forefront.  Hopefully in a non-partisan manner we will all 
continue to work to make this a more democratic House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to tell the member from the Bloc that I was 
very disappointed with his comment that women need to spend time 
on family matters.  A number of women are already being 
criticized for becoming actively involved in the political 
process because they neglect their families.  I know that men as 
well as women want family time and want to be very much a part of 
it.  I had to get that comment in because I do not want women 
feeling that they are neglecting their families in any way, shape 
or form by becoming involved in the political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Often what happens in a country where there is a lack of 
democracy in parliament is that there is also a lack of democracy 
within the country.  I wonder how my hon. colleague from Quebec 
feels.  Does he see the people of Quebec and Canada as feeling 
very much part of a very undemocratic country today? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron:</B> Mr. Speaker, in connection with the 
comment by my colleague, I would like to make sure she understood 
my point of view clearly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was not referring specifically to women when I spoke of family 
life.  What I was saying was that, if we want to get more people 
interested in public life, more women in particular, interested 
in public life, or a career in politics, perhaps we should make 
it possible for a life in politics to leave more room for family 
life. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not wish to imply in any way that we are neglecting our 
families, but perhaps a more sustained physical presence in our 
ridings might enable us to better meet the expectations of our 
fellow citizens as far as serving the public is concerned. 
Perhaps in some cases changes to the calendar might also make it 
possible for us, and the men and women who will make up this 
House in future, to better meet the expectations of our family 
members.  I do not know if this reply responds better to the 
concerns of my colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the sense of being part of a democratic society in 
connection with what goes on here, that of course is not even 
addressed by this debate.  Since she has asked, however, I would 
tell my hon. colleague that a number of my fellow citizens view 
with some perplexity the fact that this parliament is composed of 
two chambers: one elected, with all the difficulties, constraints 
and vicissitudes that surround election to this House and to its 
operations, and the second appointed, made up of unelected 
individuals who are, to all intents and purposes, chosen by the 
government of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For a so-called modern democracy like Canada, whose electoral 
legislation most certainly could do with some modernization and 
whose parliament contains one chamber composed of people who are 
not elected, there is indeed a rather common perception that 
Canada's democratic institutions may be a bit out of date and 
perhaps need some of the cobwebs dusted off. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the entire matter of parliamentary reform numbers among 
the concerns of a large part of the population about our public 
and political institutions.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise in the debate not to argue for 
more opportunities for backbench MPs, but to plead with you 
specifically, Mr. Speaker, to help us retain as backbenchers the 
little opportunity that we still have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I was alarmed today when I sat in this House and I 
heard your statement pertaining to Motion No. 2 that was passed 
in the House on February 27.  Motion No. 2 referred to the 
streamlining of report stage, because it was perceived by all 
sides of the House that report stage was sometimes utilized in an 
abusive manner, and Motion No. 2, which was passed by the House, 
was designed to correct this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read.  Motion No. 2 says: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—the Speaker will not select for debate a motion or series of 
motions of a repetitive, frivolous or vexatious nature or of a 
nature that would serve merely to prolong unnecessarily 
proceedings at the report stage and, in exercising this power of 
selection, the Speaker shall be guided by the practice followed 
in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, today in replying—in making your statement to that 
motion that was passed, as I say, already by the House—you said, 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to apply these four criteria to all amendments at report 
stage, no matter which side of the House they come from. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>And by that, Mr. Speaker, we understood you to mean that you 
would not select those amendments for report stage that were 
repetitive, frivolous, abusive or would unusually prolong debate 
in the House.  But then, Mr. Speaker, you went on.  You said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also intend to apply those criteria in the original note whose 
validity has been endorsed by the adoption of government Motion 
No. 2.  Specifically, motions in amendment that could have been 
presented in committee will not be selected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me just repeat that:  “Specifically, motions 
in amendment that could have been presented in committee will not 
be selected” by you. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In supporting Motion No. 2 I never felt that I was 
supporting that proposition because, if I understand that 
proposition broadly, what it means is that any amendment that a 
member could have put in committee will not be selected by you. 
But, Mr. Speaker, that happens all the time.  I am not at all 
committees.  Sometimes I want to submit amendments at report 
stage and I am not a member of the committee.  This would suggest 
that any report stage amendment that I submitted, if I could have 
put it in committee—and of course, as MPs we can always put an 
amendment in a committee—you would not select it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you go on and you seem to add to this proposition 
because what you say, you make a recommendation to MPs like 
myself, backbench MPs, and you say: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—I would strongly urge all members and all parties to avail 
themselves fully of the opportunity to propose amendments during 
committee stage so that the report stage can return to the 
purpose for which it was created, namely for the House to 
consider the committee report and the work the committee has 
done. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not my vision of report stage at all. 
Report stage, I always understood, existed to give members an 
opportunity who were not on committee, who had a differing 
opinion of what was going on in committee, our opportunity to 
propose an amendment in the House and to stimulate debate. 
Indeed, Mr. Speaker, in your own speech you make allusion to the 
1968 special committee on procedure which said that it considered 
that report stage to be: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>essential in order to provide all members of the House, and not 
merely members of the committee, with an opportunity to express 
their views on the bills under consideration— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>While I can only believe, Mr. Speaker, that you will interpret, 
or I should interpret your words very narrowly because I can 
assure you on this side of the House, the government House leader 
and the leadership of my party assured we backbenchers that the 
Motion No. 2 would in no way restrict our opportunity to express 
ourselves at report stage, Mr. Speaker, and with good reason.

<A HREF="#LINKT68"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality, particularly as a government backbencher, is that 
in committee the government dominates.  If we as backbench MPs 
want to move some kind of amendment that is not in keeping with 
what may be the government's direction of things, then we are not 
given an opportunity to push our amendment forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I can give you a classic example.  In 1995 I was on the lobbyist 
registration committee—or the committee of industry studying the 
lobbyist registration act—and I made it known to the whip that I 
was interested in supporting an amendment that was being proposed 
by my opposition colleagues on the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What happened was that when it came to clause by clause, the 
whip withdrew my voting privileges on that committee and 
substituted someone else.  So the only way under those 
circumstances for me to advance the amendment I believed in would 
have been to submit it as a report stage amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, sometimes one wishes as a backbench 
government MP to utilize report stage to submit one's own 
amendment because one knows full well that the government will 
not support it.  You know full well that the amendment will not 
pass.  However, report stage gives a backbench MP an opportunity 
to present his thoughts, his concerns shall we say, before the 
entire House and before the entire nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reality is that if we make a speech in front of committee, 
sadly even the Hansard of that committee is not available to the 
public until sometimes many weeks after the statement has been 
made, and indeed the media normally does not follow the debates 
in committee unless there is some incredibly important thing that 
is occurring which is of great media interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It becomes absolutely, dreadfully important to have this 
opportunity at report stage to draw the attention of the public 
to one's deep concerns as a backbench MP to some aspect of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, in the citizenship bill last year I proposed at 
report stage an amendment to the oath of citizenship.  The 
committee and the minister made it very clear that they were not 
prepared to entertain a change in the oath of citizenship as it 
was in the legislation.  I had to use report stage to actually 
get what I deeply, deeply believed in before the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to believe, Mr. Speaker, that you are going to 
interpret the need to submit an amendment to committee very, very 
narrowly.  I would assume that if you do want to give backbench 
MPs like myself as much opportunity for debate as possible, what 
you may choose to do is interpret what you said in your own 
words, perhaps interpret it as referring only to those members of 
committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of the committee do not 
propose amendments then perhaps there is a reasonable argument 
that they should not be allowed to then do it in report stage 
separately, but backbench MPs cannot be in more than one place at 
the same time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I track the work of a number of committees and I can tell you 
for instance, Mr. Speaker, I have a possible report stage 
amendment for Bill C-9, the Canada Elections Act amendments, that 
I know the government will not like.  If I put it in committee it 
will die instantly.  If I put it in report stage then I put it 
for all the House to see and consider.  I have not decided yet 
whether I want to do it but it is an essential privilege as a 
backbench MP.  And if, in your interpretation of Motion No. 2, 
you deprive me of the opportunity to move report stage amendments 
as a backbench MP—if you confine me only to moving those 
amendments in committee—Mr. Speaker, you will have absolutely 
eroded the very essence of my role here as a backbench MP. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly I do not know what I would do if that is the way 
you rule but, Mr. Speaker, I look forward to the next time we go 
to report stage.  I will be looking closely at how you do select 
amendments for report stage.  I hope, Mr. Speaker, you will 
remember my words that I said when I spoke to Motion No. 2.  If I 
may read them, these were my concluding words before we passed 
the motion. 
I said, “But I end with one caution, because I remind you, Mr. 
Speaker, that whatever you do, you must protect the rights of the 
backbench MPs and the opposition MPs to have their say in debate 
on legislation at report stage”.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for his quite alarming comments. 
We will soon find out whether his concerns will be realized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tomorrow I will be attending the committee dealing with Bill C-9 
where I will be putting forward some amendments.  Report stage 
will be next week and I will be watching, with as much interest 
as he, to see whether further proposed amendments can be brought 
forward at that time.  I do hope that his concerns are unfounded, 
although I fear they are not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the member's proposed or preferred method of dealing 
with report stage?.  Would it simply be a return to the status 
quo ante, or would he make some other suggestion for change? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, what we understood we were 
agreeing to on this side, in order to support the government's 
Motion No. 2, was that the Speaker should put limitations on 
vexatious and frivolous amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the hon. member will recall, progress in the House was 
delayed because of hundreds of amendments of a frivolous nature 
pertaining to certain bills.  That is fine, but unfortunately 
what seems to have happened, if I read Motion No. 2 correctly, it 
says that the Speaker will also be guided by practice in the 
British parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, none of us know what is meant by being guided by 
practice in the British parliament.  It would appear, from what 
the Speaker has said, and I cite it here, that he is making an 
allusion to Motion No. 2 and something that was endorsed by 
Motion No. 2, and I can only believe it was the guidelines that 
were cited in the original motion.  He is using that, it would 
appear, to justify saying that only motions presented in 
committee will be selected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope that is not the case because the reality around here is 
that we have to trust our leadership, on this side and on the 
member's side, in getting our support for legislation or a 
motion, that it will not introduce something into the wording of 
the legislation or the motion that it knows that we as backbench 
MPs will not have the opportunity or the expertise to check. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I make my appeal to the Speaker and tell him most emphatically 
that never did I understand, nor do I think the vast majority of 
the backbench MPs on the Liberal side understand, that the 
Speaker would confine amendments to be selected only to those 
that were proposed in committee.  In other words, if we were to 
follow the Speaker's reasoning as we see it, what we would find 
is that the only committee amendments that would appear at report 
stage would be government amendments.  If that is the case, then 
there would be no point in debate.  The debate would have 
occurred at committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Never did I ever believe that what was proposed by Motion No. 2 
would make it impossible for me to submit my amendments as a 
backbench MP to anything other than the committee.  I need to 
have the right to submit my amendments at report stage in this 
House if I am not a member of the committee.

we are really asking, and these are good men, is whether they are 
the best people available for those positions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree that their c.v.'s and the 
details of their positions should be forwarded to the appropriate 
committee for further discussion to see if they are the most 
appropriate people for those sensitive positions? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I can only confine my reply 
to the nature of my speech.  I have to say that I have absolute 
faith in you and in the independence of your decisions.  The 
House has absolute confidence in you, that you will exercise your 
heavy responsibilities with absolute impartiality and always look 
to the best interests of all the MPs because, as you are fond of 
saying, you are a servant of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why I did get a little impassioned there. In fact, I 
have full confidence that you will interpret the power that 
Motion No. 2 has given you in a way in which the opportunities of 
backbench MPs to submit amendments at report stage will be 
preserved.  In fact I do not expect you to follow literally the 
suggestion that motions in amendment that could have been 
presented in committee will not be selected.  I am sure that you 
intend that to be exercised extremely narrowly.  I have full 
confidence in you.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member who has just spoken for bringing 
a very serious matter to the attention of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It will be a very interesting test when Bill C-9 comes before 
the House.  The hon. government House leader is also the minister 
sponsoring Bill C-9.  It will be the first bill back which will 
apply the recently adopted motion.  We will see him occupying 
several roles I guess.  We will watch with great interest to see 
how enthusiastic he is about allowing for a full range of debate 
in this place on potential amendments that were not brought 
forward in committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also be able to get a sense of the sincerity with which 
he is intending to apply the motion we are currently debating. To 
what degree is the motion sincere as opposed to the degree to 
which it is meant as window dressing, merely to divert attention 
from the ongoing erosion of democracy.  That erosion is contained 
in Bill C-9 and the series of rather pernicious laws, of which it 
is merely the latest, designed to limit access of third parties 
during an election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill C-9 is intended to restrict the ability of Canadians to 
participate fully in referendum campaigns, which can only be 
called at any rate at the behest of the government, and to limit 
the ability in the case of this law of small parties to 
participate in election campaigns on an equal footing with those 
larger parties represented in the Chamber.  I hope we will 
discover that the government House leader is very sincere.  I 
fear we may find the opposite, but we will find out and we will 
be watching with great attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last member to speak did so on a very narrow but important 
topic.  It is my intention to draw from some of the same themes 
but to speak in a very broad sense.  I will also dwell upon some 
of the broad themes of democracy that the motion addresses or 
hopes to address.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am thinking here of the spirit that motivates the 1867 
Constitution of Canada and the words found in its preamble.  It 
begins “...with a Constitution similar in Principle to that of 
the United Kingdom—”.  The Constitution of Canada is a written 
constitution, whereas that of Britain is not.  The Constitution of 
Canada is federal and Britain is a quasi-unitary state and was 
entirely unitary in 1867.  There were no regional assemblies in 
Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The essence that was being captured in that preamble was the 
notion that Canada would be similar to the United Kingdom in 
having certain understandings as to how Canadians would be 
treated by their government.  It was an idea conceptualized in 
the imperial parliament at that time in a law called the Colonial 
Laws Validity Act, which attempted to make clear limitations on 
what colonial assemblies, including Canada at the time, could do 
in terms of restricting the rights of their citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any law that was repugnant would be repugnant to the laws of 
England as applied in England and would also be invalid in a 
colonial legislature.  That was used with limited success as an 
argument against racist laws in Australia that were meant to 
exclude non-whites from immigration from other parts of what was 
then the British Empire. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The preamble was also meant to make it clear that Canada would 
be adopting many of the conventions that existed in Britain. The 
most important of those conventions was the party system which at 
that time was starting to gel in Britain.  The convention that 
the ministry was responsible to, its House of Commons, and this 
had already taken place to some degree in Canada in the form of 
responsible governments.  We are being true to our own 
independently developed traditions which paralleled those which 
developed in Britain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This empiricist tradition is at the base of our political system 
and is the basis of the great success of our democracy or, as I 
like to say and have said on other occasions in this place, of 
our republic.  I mean republic in the traditional Aristotelian 
sense; a mixed government in which there is a monarchial element, 
an aristocratic element and a democratic element.  This is the 
basis of the success of our system and I worry when I see it 
eroding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An alternative system has been used widely in the west and has 
done a great deal of damage over the past two centuries.  This is 
the tradition that developed through Jean-Jacques Rousseau.  This 
is the concept of a general will which is expressed not through 
institutions such as this one, not through rules of order and not 
mediated at all, but a will which is expressed.  It is different 
from the mass of individual wills.  It is, in some respect, a 
common will felt by the people which is interpreted almost 
intuitively by a leader who is in mystical union with the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We saw this developed by Rousseau and saw it actualized in 
France in the regime of Napoleon Bonaparte and later on by 
Napoleon III.  We have also seen it in action in other countries. 
In Argentina, it was known as Peronism.  We saw it develop into a 
cult of personality in a number of countries like fascist Italy, 
Portugal and Spain. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The danger is that these institutions, which have been developed 
so carefully in Canada and in countries like the United Kingdom, 
Australia and New Zealand, and also which in a very different way 
were jelled and set down in constitutional stone in the United 
States following its revolution, will erode over time.  The 
American founding fathers worried a great deal that the natural 
course of things is for power to centralize in the hands of a few 
or eventually of one ruler. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tendency has been for power over time, in the absence of 
some sort of cataclysm which resets everything back at its 
republican origins, to centralize.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We see this developing in the United States, for example, in the 
so-called imperial presidency in which to some degree, to a minor 
degree but to a growing degree, we have seen effectively an 
elected monarch with a four year periodic election of that 
monarch.  This is something we have seen drawn to the public 
attention at various times.  The phrase “the imperial 
presidency” comes from the time of Richard Nixon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada we see the centralization of power in the Prime 
Minister's Office and in the hands of the Prime Minister.  We 
even see, to some degree, members of cabinet, except for those 
very central members of the inner cabinet, frozen out from power. 
We also see the House being turned into what amounts to an 
electoral college in perpetual session simply reaffirming the 
Prime Minister, who is in a very genuine sense simply our elected 
king, reaffirming him in office periodically through these forced 
votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is something which absolutely must be fought against.  Of 
course the first step in doing this is to try to create more 
democracy in the House.  This is of course why I feel so strongly 
and why I do hope that the motion here is meant sincerely, that 
the committee will come back with some very practical suggestions 
which will indeed return some autonomy to the House so that it 
serves as the democratic check on the monarchical power 
represented by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As well of course, we would like to see the Senate turned into 
an aristocracy as it was originally meant, that is to say a 
natural aristocracy, the best among us selected to represent the 
wisdom by which the decisions made here are mediated before they 
become the law of the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very briefly, because I know I have just a few moments left, I 
want to draw the attention of the House to one possibility that I 
think the committee should consider as it meets to decide how it 
will change the way in which this place operates, and that is the 
secret ballot.  The secret ballot, of course, is used here only 
for the election of the Speaker.  I think all members are happy 
with that system.  I think it works well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if we could not broaden the system and use it as well 
for electing the Deputy Speaker, chairs of committees and also 
commissioners reporting to parliament, who are after all, at 
least nominally, to represent the will of parliament and to be 
responsible to us as opposed to the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also wonder if we could not perhaps solve the problem of 
supreme court justices being non-representative if they were to 
be elected by secret ballot in parliament from perhaps a list 
nominated by the government or proposed by some other method. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I wonder if patronage appointments could not be 
ratified, perhaps in groupings, by means of secret ballot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that if we do this we consider using some means 
of voting that is a little more expeditious than the method used 
in the election of the Speaker, that is to say something that 
takes less than a day to execute.  Perhaps electronic voting is 
appropriate.  Perhaps a single transferable ballot is 
appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I simply present those options for your consideration, Mr. 
Speaker, and for the consideration of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my previous question was completely 
forgotten or ignored by the Liberal backbencher, so I will ask it 
of my hon. colleague from the Alliance Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of appointments are made to various boards and agencies 
throughout the country.  We in our party are very concerned, as 
are most Canadians, that the right person is appointed for that 
particular position.  In most cases we assume they are either 
friends of the Prime Minister or friends of the current 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the member or his party support the idea that when people 
are appointed to boards such as the immigration board, the 
pension appeals board for veterans, and the transportation safety 
board, that at least their CVs are presented to the appropriate 
committee for review?  Would the member also support the idea 
that, if possible, individuals be brought before committees to be 
asked questions about their experience and their knowledge of the 
particular board they are on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At least that way, at least in my belief, Canadians would then 
know that the person appointed to that position is the best 
person available and not just necessarily a political 
appointment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member raises a 
good point.  I do not think that the exact method is necessarily 
the important thing.  It is some form of review prior to, as 
opposed to after, appointments have been made, some form of 
questioning, that would be profitable.  Committees are certainly 
a good place to start.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is always a problem with these things when the votes take 
place openly because then we get, effectively, some kind of party 
discipline or pressure being applied to the decisions that are 
made and to the questions that come up.  However, I am afraid 
this is probably all that is available to us and it is a good 
starting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have struggled with the question of how we deal with patronage 
appointments, ensuring that they are in fact based on merit. 
Absent the presence of a philosopher king who always chooses 
exclusively on merit and who is virtually omniscient in being 
able to choose the best people, we need to have some form of 
delegation.  I would think that the nominations going forward to 
whoever is doing the review ought to as well be coming from a bit 
broader source than merely the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say this with some reservation, because there may be problems 
with this, but I think that perhaps we should consider the 
possibility of excluding certain classes of people from patronage 
appointments, such as people who are defeated candidates for a 
party in the prior election until a period of time has passed, or 
people who have perhaps donated more than a certain amount of 
money to a governing party, or people who have served in some 
other capacity that would make them obvious candidates, unless 
they go through some sort of special further review to ensure 
that they really are being chosen on their merits and that their 
political allegiance is purely coincidental.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I am delighted to see that some of my supposed friends have 
arrived in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it interesting.  I suspect we are heading into an 
opportunity lost.  I commend my House leader for attempting to 
put forward some ideas and some recommended changes.  I think 
they are good and they will make our lives as MPs and our ability 
to represent our constituents a little easier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This will simply change the rules, but frankly I am sure that 
the types of changes that we are hearing opposite will not change 
the nature of this place.  I hear people over there saying we do 
not live in a democracy.  Democracy, or the lack thereof, should 
not be confused with acquiescence to one's ideas or to the ideas 
of one party or another.  If the fact that we do not agree on 
something upsets someone over there, or even over here, it seems 
to me wrong, by its very nature, to stand up and say that is not 
democratic, to say that because people are going to do it their 
way because they were elected to do it that way and others cannot 
change their minds about it means they are not democrats.  That 
in its very nature is just wrong-headed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, the real true test of democracy in the country happens 
in the electoral system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear the member opposite using an interesting phrase.  He says 
this place is like an electoral college in perpetual session.  I 
am sure people at home are watching this and asking what the heck 
he is talking about or asking what a lot of these people are 
talking about when they talk about change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real issue is, do we respect one another or do we even 
respect the role that we are expected to play as 
parliamentarians?  Or do we simply want to use our partisan 
position to somehow denigrate the work of others in this place 
and therefore play into the hands of the naysayers and the people 
who would say that this place is not democratic?  To paraphrase 
Winston Churchill, he basically said that this may not be the 
best system in the world but it is a long way ahead of whatever 
is in second place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does that mean we should not have change?  Does that mean we 
should not perhaps change the way our committees operate? 
I heard my hon. colleague from this side of the House arguing in 
favour of having the ability to place amendments on the floor at 
report stage in this Chamber and not be restricted to committee. 
I think that is a good idea, again, as long as it is not abused.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen members opposite put in place as many as 3,000 
amendments.  We have been through this debate.  Changing a comma 
to a semicolon:  is that democracy?  Does that make any sense 
whatsoever?  Is that the appropriate use of even the lighting 
that it takes to keep this place operating, never mind the staff 
and all the support services in this building?  The Canadian 
people who, by the way, do not live in the little beltway that we 
live in, who watch all of this on the 11 o'clock news or read it 
in the morning, are saying  “Why are those guys fighting all the 
time?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The real essence of this place and this system is that we indeed 
can disagree.  I have said this before.  Some people would say 
this is scary, but our weapons are our minds and our words and 
our thoughts are our ammunition.  We fight with one another in 
this place in a very democratic way.  We go to the people and say 
to the people, here is what we believe in as Liberals or here is 
what we believe in as Alliance members or Tories or NDP or Bloc, 
so please vote for us, and they do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting to me that we arrived here in the numbers that 
we did and what happened?  Those who did not win government 
immediately jumped up and said they want parliamentary reform.  I 
wonder why.  At least the House leader for the New Democratic 
Party made an honest statement in the House earlier tonight when 
he said this is not about changing the rules. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many rule changes have been put forward.  In fact, the committee 
is called the modernization committee on House rules and that is 
terrific.  Let us modernize the rules around this place. However, 
it is really much more than that.  The New Democratic Party 
member said that it is not about changing the rules but about 
changing the balance of power.  He used that word, power, and 
that is true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing here is people who are unable to obtain power 
through the democratic process and now want to do it through some 
form of subterfuge called parliamentary reform.  I do not think 
that is what they want at all.  Every time a member over here 
stands up and gives an honest opinion, such as my colleague who 
talked about having the ability to place amendments at report 
stage, what happens?  An opposition member jumps up and says 
there is a member on the backbench over there who has just said 
something that is really important and is it not awful, oh my, 
and those guys are dictators and they will not free up their 
backbench, like “free my people”.  What is that?  It is 
nonsense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, people here who denigrate the work of any member 
on any side denigrate themselves.  We can disagree on policy and 
we should.  We can fight over the direction we believe the 
country should take and we should.  However, we should all carry 
a message that the vast majority of the men and women who arrive 
in this place—as they have for decades—are honest, dedicated, 
hard-working people who come here to make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That does not mean we should be opposed to change.  However, to 
suggest that it is not democratic in this place is just playing 
politics with a system that has survived the true test of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us make some improvements at committee.  I find it 
interesting that people say one of the ways in which we can 
democratize parliament is to televise our committee procedures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us examine what happens when that occurs.  The citizenship 
and immigration committee, of which I am a member, is currently 
dealing with amendments to the Immigration Act.  It has not been 
dealt with in 40 years.  It is very controversial. 
Immigration brings out tremendous debate.  Some think we have too 
much.  Some think we do not have enough.  We do not like certain 
problems that occur.  We hear about people who come to the 
country and commit crime.  It gets very emotional.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decided as a committee that we would televise hearings, and 
we did.  We met in the railway room off the Hall of Honour and we 
were on television.  On the first day of the meeting the Leader 
of the Opposition showed up.  Would the Leader of the Opposition 
have been there if it were not on television?  The industry 
committee had the ethics counsellor on television.  Who showed 
up?  The leaders of all opposition parties showed up.  Would they 
have been there if it were not televised?  Maybe they would and 
maybe they would not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it really is important that the Canadian public can watch 
CPAC, and I am sure Canadians are delighted to do that with a 
bowl of popcorn, then let us televise it.  If it will make the 
process more open, accessible and transparent to the Canadian 
public, and if it will really make a difference to democracy in 
the country, then let us televise it all. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If all it will do is provide the opportunity for people to come 
in to attack, criticize and denigrate individuals in this place, 
then it works much more toward anarchy than democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to reform parliament we should do it.  However as I 
said in my opening remarks, I fear this will be an opportunity 
lost.  I have served on both sides of the legislative system, in 
opposition and in government, and I believe opposition members 
can have the greatest influence in reforming the way parliament 
does business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we really want to change let us take a look at how some of 
our committees work.  Let us look at public accounts.  It works 
tremendously well.  A member of the opposition chairs that 
committee and there is no partisanship.  We work extremely well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When there is not too much attention from the public, the 
immigration committee can work extremely well.  We should try to 
work together and respect the work we all do as parliamentarians. 
That would be the greatest reform.  Changing the rules is not a 
problem.  Reforming the mentality of this place so that we 
respect one another would be an accomplishment.  It would show 
the Canadian public that we respect them and the democratic 
choice they made in the last election.  We can reform parliament 
by reforming attitudes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK208"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the hon. member talked about how this place is very 
democratic and how he worries that, and I believe these are his 
words, there would be anarchy if we did not have the status quo. 
I may be wrong but that is my understanding of what he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make a few observations about this place and then talk 
about some other places that do not have the kind of party 
discipline that exists here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To date I have seen very few occasions on which members on any 
side of the House, and that would include Liberal and opposition 
sides, have not voted the will of their party.  There have been 
very few.  It is our understanding that there was pressure 
applied yesterday to a member on the opposite side to make sure 
he voted with the government, because he has voted against the 
government too often and it has become an embarrassment.  We all 
know there are tremendous pressures put on members by the party 
whips.  I wonder how that can be described as democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we had a system of open votes in Canada there was 
tremendous pressure on people to vote with the governing party. 
Sometimes people were paid by being given alcohol.  That is why 
liquor sales were prohibited on voting day.  It was the first 
attempt to deal with the problem.  The secret ballot was 
introduced, but methods were found to ensure voters would still 
reveal their ballot.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone might have been given a ballot by one of the parties as 
he or she went into the poll.  The pre-marked ballot would be 
handed in and the ballot that had been issued upon entering the 
poll would be returned to the party operative waiting outside.  A 
bottle of liquor would be given as a reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Counterfoils such as numbered ballot sheets and so on were 
developed to promote genuine democracy by creating a system of 
fairness and secrecy.  That seems far superior to what we have 
here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Literally thousands of other legislative bodies in the country 
do not have party discipline or parties, and there is no anarchy 
there at all.  I am thinking of our municipal governments.  I 
fail to see any anarchy there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Looking at the 10 municipal governments plus a county council 
that exist in my own riding of Lanark—Carleton, I see that they 
are far more efficient, collegial, effective and frugal bodies 
than is this place and this government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look as well at the governments in two of our territories, 
which are run not on a partisan basis but on a collegial basis. 
That seems superior to the method in which the House is run. When 
I look at Britain's parliament in the 19th century, the golden 
age of parliament, although there was a party system it was in 
fact a very loose system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member would agree that perhaps there are 
alternative models that are superior to this one and that perhaps 
our model is not quite the paradise he has painted it as being. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I almost rest my case 
because the member has reacted, typically, by saying I have 
somehow argued for the status quo.  That attitude is what stifles 
true discussion in this place.  The member says that unless a 
person is prepared to stand and buy into the line that the whole 
system is rotten, that we must change it and that we are all 
trained seals, then supposedly somehow he is in favour of the 
status quo.  It is just not true.  We can, should and will make 
changes to the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot compare the situation of parliament to that of 
municipalities.  I served in municipal government for 10 years. 
There was no partisanship, and there was no one sitting ready to 
attack and denigrate and criticize our every move.  There is not 
much partisanship about roads and potholes and things of that 
nature in building municipal communities.  It is a different 
scenario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We literally have a situation where it does not matter what one 
does in government, whether one is a Liberal or a Tory or what 
have you.  It does not matter.  The system is that the opposition 
attacks and opposes.  That is the only thing it is here for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we want to make parliamentary change we should try working 
within the committee system to support some of the activities the 
government is dealing with.  Members on all sides would then have 
an opportunity to have input.  It is a double-edged sword. Simply 
throwing it all on this side and saying it is not democracy 
shows, frankly, inexperience in someone who has not served on 
both sides of the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK209"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom (Regina—Qu'Appelle, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will say a few words in the debate as someone who has 
been in the House for quite a while.  I was first elected in 
1968.  This is my ninth mandate in the House of Commons, having 
missed the period from 1993 to 1997.  I have seen a lot of 
differences, and I think many of the differences are negative in 
terms of the lack of seriousness and respect the present 
government shows toward parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A friend said to me a few minutes ago in the lobby that the 
government does not really have respect for the House of Commons. 
I think there is a lot of truth in that.  In 1968, for example, 
there were a lot of great parliamentarians.  I remember John 
Diefenbaker, Allan MacEachen, Ged Baldwin, Stanley Knowles, Tommy 
Douglas, David Lewis, Réal Caouette, and people of that sort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In those days there seemed to be more respect for the House by 
the government and a lot more real debates would take place.  I 
do not think a serious announcement was made by the government in 
the late 1960s and early 1970s that was not made on the floor of 
the House of Commons.  The minister would come to the House, he 
or she would make a statement, and the response would come from 
the opposition parties.

<A HREF="#LINKT77"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gradually over time that practice changed.  I think it changed 
more radically after the election in 1993 of the government that 
now sits across the way.  Even in the days of Brian Mulroney and 
the Tories there seemed to be more give and take in this place. 
In those days I sat on the finance committee which was chaired by 
Mr. Blenkarn.  It was one of many committees that had a semblance 
of independence about it, a certain arm's length relationship 
with the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should be a certain amount of creative tension between the 
executive and parliament.  Parliament should hold the executive 
to account.  We do not have that today.  That is one reason our 
politics have descended into a vortex of great negativity which 
is getting more and more negative all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It does not mean that in the former days it was not positive. 
The member for Winnipeg—Transcona was here in 1979, I believe, 
and on.  It was not any less partisan in those days.  It was 
still very partisan.  If we ever want to see somebody partisan, 
watch a John Diefenbaker or a Tommy Douglas or an Allan 
MacEachen.  They were really partisan individuals and great 
parliamentarians.  However there was great debate in those days 
and parliament really meant something.  It was the centre of 
activity in terms of public policy in the country.  Much of that 
is gone now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are heading toward a crisis in terms of this institution and 
the respect that it does not have across the country.  Today we 
are having a debate in the House.  As I speak I hear about 10 to 
12 members speaking in the House, and that is normal.  Even the 
members do not take this place very seriously.  During the day, 
of course, committees are meeting at the same time.  This place 
is getting more and more irrelevant in terms of decision-making 
and in terms of having a real impact.  We need to take a serious 
look at real parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition, we need electoral reform.  We must look at the idea 
of bringing in a measure of proportional representation.  We must 
do something about the Senate.  I believe we should abolish it. A 
lot of people believe we should reform it.  In the polls only 5% 
of the Canadian people support the existing undemocratic, 
unelected Senate, yet parliamentarians have continued decade 
after decade to support that institution across the way.  We must 
do some of these things and do them soon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House we start with the idea of confidence votes.  We 
have far too many confidence votes in the House of Commons.  We 
are the most handcuffed parliamentary system in the world.  We 
model ourselves after the British parliament.  It is common to 
have a bill defeated in the British House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Blair government was exceedingly popular in its first three 
or four years and is still popular.  It has had many bills 
defeated by its own backbenchers.  It was the same in the days of 
the Thatcher Conservatives.  Margaret Thatcher was extremely 
popular, had great control over the country in terms of her 
agenda and her vision, and changed that country dramatically. 
Despite that, there were several occasions when she lost votes in 
the House of Commons on certain bills.  I say so what?  All the 
better.  All the more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I meet government backbenchers every day who are horrendously 
frustrated.  At least in opposition one can get up and make a 
speech and criticize a policy or advocate a new vision or 
direction.  Government members cannot do that to the extent they 
should because of the power of the Prime Minister's Office.  The 
PMO and the PCO have the power to appoint cabinet ministers, 
committee chairs and parliamentary secretaries.  They decide 
different trips, appointments and positions of influence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That system must end.  It must change if parliament is to be 
more relevant in the future.  We need fewer confidence votes. The 
only confidence votes should be on budget bills, money bills, and 
things of importance like the throne speech which lays out the 
vision of the government for the next parliamentary session. 
Those things must change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees must have more independence.  We elect the Speaker of 
the House of Commons by secret ballot and the whips are not on. 
We have now had at least two Speakers who were probably not the 
favourite of the Prime Minister of the day.  I am not talking 
just about this Prime Minister, but former Prime Minister Brian 
Mulroney.  Members voted freely for the person they thought could 
best fill the duties of the Chair. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot even take that principle to committees of the House of 
Commons and freely and secretly elect the person we think should 
chair the committee.  My God, how timid we are in the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will give another example.  Just yesterday in the finance 
committee we were studying Bill C-8.  It is the most voluminous 
bill in the history of the country.  It the financial 
institutions bill.  It has 900 pages and affects about 1,400 
pages of statues.  It is a very big bill and a very complicated 
bill.  One of its recommendations is to set up a new consumer 
agency. 
There is supposed to be a commissioner of that consumer agency 
appointed by the Minister of Finance.

but to have a look at it and express an opinion.  Every single 
government member voted no.  Every single opposition member voted 
yes.  We could not even empower ourselves to have a look at the 
minister's suggestion before the minister appointed that person. 
What a minuscule almost irrelevant piece of parliamentary reform, 
and yet we have the stupidity in this place to be so polarized. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Where the Prime Minister's office cannot control each and every 
thing that happens, then it is no good.  I saw intelligent and 
highly educated men and women who went to that committee 
yesterday and voted nine to zip in opposition of that minuscule 
step.  I know that probably seven of those nine would have liked 
to have taken that little step to reform this parliamentary 
institution, but they could not because of the kind of system we 
are locked into. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only way it will change is if government backbenchers 
empower themselves and if we opposition parliamentarians empower 
ourselves and say no to the government from time to time, like 
they do in Great Britain and like they do in almost every other 
democratic country around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no reason why parliamentary committees should not have 
more independence to initiate legislation and the independence in 
timetable of legislation.  There is no reason why a parliamentary 
secretary has to come to a standing committee as a member of that 
particular committee and dictate how to vote on each and every 
single amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The bill we talked about yesterday, Bill C-8, is a big bill. 
Hon. members should ask the member for Elk Island how long it 
took the finance committee to consider it yesterday.  It took 
maybe an hour and a half.  It was a futile exercise, because 
every single amendment that the opposition proposed, the 
parliamentary secretary, who was the first person recognized, 
would say no.  All the government members voted no.  All the 
opposition voted yes.  The only amendments that were accepted 
were government amendments.  Again, only the parliamentary 
secretary spoke to them.  What kind of parliamentary system is 
this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to change the system to make it more relevant.  No 
wonder people are growing frustrated.  No wonder they are not 
voting or participating.  They rank politicians close to the 
bottom of the totem pole in terms of respect in this country. 
These are the kinds of things we should look at. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should look at more permanent membership on parliamentary 
committees.  We see this revolving door on these committees, 
mostly on the government side but not exclusively on that side. 
We need more permanent membership so people develop some 
expertise, some independence, some backbone and some gall. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look at my friend across the way who was a respected member of 
the national assembly.  I know he has a strong feeling about 
reforming this place.  I know that from all the articles which 
were written about him two or three weeks ago in the press about 
making this place more meaningful. If people would think like he 
does and then put into action the feelings that he has, we could 
make some meaningful reforms in this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my last minute I want to talk about the whole question of 
appointments.  I do not think there is any democratic country in 
the world where the prime minister has so much power.  The Prime 
Minister appoints the head of the national police, the RCMP.  He 
appoints all the justices of the supreme court.  He appoints the 
head of the military.  He appoints all the cabinet ministers.  He 
appoints all the senators.  He appoints all the heads of the 
crown corporations.  He appoints all the heads of the important 
boards and agencies.  He appoints all the lieutenant governors. 
In addition to that, he appoints thousands and thousands of 
people to boards and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, we often get a lot of people who should not be 
sitting on those particular boards and agencies.  There is no 
vetting or venting of the process by a parliamentary committee. 
In many cases a parliamentary committee should have the authority 
to either ratify or reject the nomination of the Government of 
Canada.  What is so radical about that?  At the very least, the 
Parliament of Canada, through a relevant committee, should review 
many more of these appointments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliament itself should have more timetables.  We should have 
a timetable to set throne speeches, set budgets and a fixed 
election date to take that power away from the executive and the 
Prime Minister of Canada, and put more power back into the hands 
of the people through their elected representatives, the people 
elected in all parties in this House.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give an example. This evening, I attended a meeting 
of the parliamentary committee on employment insurance dealing 
with Bill C-2. Parliamentarians, those whom we call backbenchers, 
even on the government side, would have had an opportunity to 
express themselves democratically, to propose changes and 
amendments to the employment insurance program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is as if these people had been told by the minister “No, 
there must not be any amendment from the opposition. That is 
unacceptable”. We have a supposedly democratic process. Yet, in 
committee, it is so obvious that all opposition members vote one 
way, while all government members vote the other way. It is as if 
there was no justice. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is where I find there is no democracy. There is no 
democracy at all in committee or in the House. I see Liberal 
backbenchers complain and moan because they never have an 
opportunity to express their views. But when they do, sometimes 
they do not seize it. Has this been going on only since 1993 or 
for a longer time? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Lorne Nystrom:</B> Mr. Speaker, it is worse now than it was 
20 or 30 years ago.  I well remember in 1968, when I was first 
elected, that there was greater respect for the Parliament of 
Canada.  In the days of Mr. Diefenbaker, Mr. Douglas, Mr. Al 
MacEachen, and Mr. Ged Baldwin, there were many great 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I said, any ministerial statement was made here in the House 
of Commons.  This was the place that was the most important back 
then, but in the last 15 or 25 years, a lack of respect for the 
Parliament of Canada has gradually set in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think that this system has very quickly changed with the 
present government, which was elected in 1993.  Under the 
Mulroney government, there was greater respect for parliamentary 
committees.  I clearly remember the Standing Committee on 
Finance, which was chaired by Mr. Blenkarn. I also have very 
clear memories of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
International Trade, which was chaired by another Progressive 
Conservative member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The finance and foreign affairs committees had a certain 
independence, as did many parliamentary committees.  That was 8, 
9, 10 or 15 years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now, however, committees are often playpens for government 
backbenchers.  This is not right.  This is not a good 
parliamentary system.  We need democracy in the House of Commons. 
We need an important role for members from all regions of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important to have parliamentary reform, to have real 
democracy here.  Even in England, there have been a number of 
occasions where the government was defeated by its own 
backbenchers. This was a reality for Mr. Blair.  It was a reality 
for Margaret Thatcher and for John Major.  This was a reality in 
England. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our country, everyone must vote with the party. 
This is not right, this in no way resembles a real parliamentary 
system.  This is not a system that is good for the collective 
health of Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK211"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln (Lac-Saint-Louis, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, the 
most traditional institutions, churches and monarchies, are becoming 
democratic today because they realize they have to be closer to 
the people.  They have to live with the times.  However, our 
parliament here is so stuck in tradition it is ridiculous. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is one small example.  When the Speaker rises, the three 
pages required to sit at his feet rise as well.  If he sits, they 
sit.  What is the point of all this?  Has it improved the life of 
the pages?  I think it is symptomatic of a tradition that, today, 
is completely outmoded, undemocratic and does not improve the 
life of the pages who come here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think about all our colleagues here.  Do we call them by their 
name?  No. We speak of “the hon. member for 
Bellechasse—Etchemins—Montmagny—L'Islet” or of “the hon. 
member for Hastings—Frontenac—Lennox and Addington”.

<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just five minutes ago one of his colleagues from the same party 
could not remember the member's riding.  Does this help 
parliamentarians to get to know each other? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been to many parliaments where people call each other by 
their names.  It is no sin to call someone Smith or Tremblay. 
They get to know each other.  The irony of this place is that in 
here I am an hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis.  When I get to a 
committee I am no longer hon.  I am Lincoln.  What sense does 
that make?  If it is good for a committee, why should it not be 
good here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find that in committee I can put a name and a face to people. 
There is a certain human bond that develops, while here there is 
this sterile thing.  I pity your job, Mr. Speaker, you have to 
remember all these quaint names, sometimes four or five in a row. 
That should be changed.  We should live in our times.  I would 
like to be able to call the member for Regina—Qu'Appelle by 
name.  It would be far friendlier than calling him by his riding 
name. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for votes, I really believe very deeply that our system of 
calling all votes confidence votes, with free votes being the 
exception, should be reversed.  All votes should be free votes 
except for confidence votes.  They should become the exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will just give a few figures from the British house which I 
gleaned some time ago.  In the British house of commons, 
dissenting votes have been a significant fact of life for a long 
time.  In the seventies dissenting votes accounted for 25% of all 
voting divisions in the British parliament.  In the first session 
of 1983-1987, when the Tories were in power, 62 divisions took 
place in which 137 Tory backbenchers cast a total of 416 votes 
against the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here that would be viewed as heresy because any type of 
expression that is contrary to the wish of the government is seen 
as disloyalty.  I do not see it as disloyalty.  I see it as 
intelligence.  I see it as being accountable to my conscience and 
to my electors.  I separate completely confidence votes, which 
are a fact of life and must be in a government, from the rest of 
the votes where we could vote very freely and the government 
would carry on all the same, and be no worse for it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to a code of ethics, in 1997 the present Speaker, 
the member for Kingston and the Islands, was co-chair of a 
committee that produced a code of official conduct for senators 
and members of parliament.  Some of the members here were part of 
that committee.  The report is still lying on the shelf.  Why can 
we not institute that code of official conduct for all members 
and for senators?  Why can we not make this official?  Why can we 
not have a counsellor responsible to the Parliament of Canada?  I 
do not see any reason why this should not become a part of our 
rules that govern our conduct as parliamentarians.  That should 
be an essential and a prompt reform to institute. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about private members' bills, for six years I have 
had private members' bills that have just stayed in there. 
Recently I won.  By magic my name got drawn, like the 649.  Then 
I appeared before a committee and it decided that the bill was 
not important enough to be votable.  So for one hour I had a 
little debate here and the bill died. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I look again at what happens in the British parliament.  The 
differences are striking.  In the British parliament, during the 
years 1983-1987, out of 415 private members' bills introduced in 
the British House, 70 of them were given royal assent, or 17%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our parliament, between May 13, 1991 to February 2, 1996, 
four and three quarter years, 428 private members' bills were 
introduced.  Out of those, 163 were selected and only eight 
became statutes.  Only 5% of bills were selected and a mere 2% 
became statutes. 
These bills made lacrosse and hockey national games and silly 
things like that.  Very few items of substance are ever made into 
statutes.

<A HREF="#LINKT81"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The British house had 70 bills that became statutes, which gave 
a feeling of dignity and a feeling of empowerment to members of 
parliament who were otherwise viewed as backbenchers only good 
for coming to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This reform needs to be carried out very promptly.  All private 
members' bills should be made votable.  We should have enough 
help to put private members' bills through. Admittedly let us 
have a limit on private members' bills.  It could be one per 
member.  I do not care.  However let us have a chance to debate 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the majority of our colleagues vote against it, I will be the 
first to agree.  Let us give a chance for them to be debated so 
that a measure which we feel is good enough to be debated by our 
colleagues has at least a slight chance of becoming a statute. 
Otherwise, why have it at all? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe that committees should be much freer to vote.  I 
am quite happy as the chair of a committee today to see my 
position being voted in by my colleagues.  I also believe that 
during the examination of legislation committees should be very 
free and open.  Parliamentary secretaries should sit as expert 
witnesses for committees rather than be part of a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was in the National Assembly of Quebec as a minister. I had to 
appear as a minister to defend my legislation right through.  I 
know the task of ministers is sometimes impossible.  Therefore 
let the parliamentary secretary take over that function rather 
than sit as a member of the committee during the study of 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also believe the Board of Internal Economy in the House of 
Commons should be made more open.  Certainly I do not disparage 
the members, including you, Mr. Speaker, who sit on the board 
with great diligence and conscience.  However it should be made 
far more open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committee chairs from day to day do not quite know how their 
budgets will be met.  Halfway through the year they have to beg 
for another travel allowance.  It should be far more open, far 
more transparent.  There should be far more input by members of 
the committees, chairs of the committees and House members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a lot of reform to do. I would love to talk about other 
items such as electoral reform and the powers of the executive 
office, but I sincerely believe we have to start somewhere. 
Within the standing orders I think we can make reforms to 
parliament that will not make me less a Liberal, less a part of a 
government or less a part of an opposition if I were voted into 
opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will fight very hard for the things I believe in.  At the same 
time I will feel empowered.  I will feel dignified as a member of 
parliament.  I will feel that the little intelligence I have been 
given, the little creative powers I have been given, have a 
chance to be expressed and find their way forward rather than 
just be there for duty times, be there for votes when I am 
supposed to vote a certain way, and be there always as a 
backbencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we be hon. members and backbenchers at the same time? It 
does not make any sense to me.  There is a contradiction in 
terms.  I would rather be a plain mister but have some powers.  I 
would rather be a plain mister and feel that I can make much more 
of a contribution to this place than I do today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rules deserve to be reopened and looked at again.  We should 
look at what the Finns do, what the Swedes do and what the Brits 
do.  Then we could say that surely there must be a way to improve 
this place which is not against traditions, against rules, 
against the government or against the opposition.  It will make 
the place better, not only for all of us but for all Canadians.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am delighted to acknowledge that I have total respect, 
looking at the Liberal side, for every member in his or her seat 
over there.  That has to be taken in the context of the present 
situation.  I will not go any further because I know the rules of 
the House.  We have many silly rules, and everyone here knows 
what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have exceptionally high respect for the member who just spoke. 
I agreed with much of what he said.  I was intrigued with his 
statements with respect to free votes, confidence votes.  I 
believe very strongly that democracy would be strengthened and 
the rules in this august Chamber which apply to all citizens of 
the country would be enhanced.  We would have better legislation. 
We would make better laws if we were able sometimes to defeat or 
improve a faulty motion or amendment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question for the member is very specific.  We are dealing 
today with changes to the standing orders.  I know he has a lot 
of knowledge in this area.  How would he specifically propose a 
change to the standing orders that would allow for more 
non-confidence votes?  How would he change the standing orders, 
or is it strictly a matter within each party's purview to 
implement? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Clifford Lincoln:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the question of 
declaring which votes are confidence and which votes are 
non-confidence depends primarily on the executive.  I do not 
think the standing orders would establish that.  It would be left 
to the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It would be part of the overall reform of parliament if we had a 
broadly based task force, working group or whatever.  It would 
include House leaders and MPs from all sectors who believe 
passionately in parliamentary reform in a constructive fashion. 
We could arrive at some sort of modus vivendi which included 
issues like the way we vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could arrive at it the way the Brits did: by trial and error. 
I do not know who started it, whether it was members of the 
Labour Party or of the Conservative Party, but they started it at 
one point by saying that cross voting was quite acceptable.  They 
started a tradition of goals: one week goals, two week goals and 
three week goals.  They decided among themselves to establish a 
tradition on grading legislation including confidence votes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now it is a given that dissenting votes in Britain do not mean 
that a Conservative is less conservative or that a Labour Party 
member is less a member of labour.  They established a tradition 
whereby they respect the rules and confidence votes are binding. 
I think we could establish that here without too many problems.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  I like the 
change to the rules already, Mr. Speaker.  I too agree.  I have a 
lot of respect for the hon. member for Lac-Saint-Louis and I 
listened to what he had to say with great respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my short tenure in the House I have found when legislation 
comes forward and is placed on the floor of the House it is 
almost a fait accompli.  The ministers, the bureaucrats and the 
departments have gone through the whole process, come forward 
with a piece of legislation, dumped it on the floor and did not 
listen to any other ideas on changes to the legislation to make 
it better.  They do not listen to backbench members in private 
members' business who might have some pretty good legislative 
ideas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the member agree that there should be more influence from 
members with respect to the presentation of legislation?  Does 
the member agree that perhaps private members should have the 
opportunity of putting forward legislation or helping implement 
legislation that comes forward to the House without the minister 
of the particular department interfering with the legislation?

time I believe I am here to use my brain in the best way I can to 
try improve legislation if I feel it should be improved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If somebody from the opposition has a better idea than I have, I 
am prepared to accept it.  If a matter arises where the 
legislation would be better if an amendment were made to it by 
the government or the opposition, we should be open to look at 
it.  That is the way I have always done it either as a member of 
the House or the chair of a committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more we do this, the more it will build mutual respect, if 
it were on the basis that members of the opposition understood 
that government members had constraints just like they do. 
Eventually trust is built.  Sometimes a hard line is taken and 
people accept it because they know it is part of the system.  At 
the same time fairness and openness are used to the greatest 
degree possible.  That is the way it should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I understand two colleagues would be

there are lots of moments in the House when one is not proud to 
be part of if, but tonight I feel we are here to improve the 
House and its functions.  It is quite refreshing and quite 
exciting.  I hope we are successful in achieving the goal of 
improving the effectiveness of members of parliament and the 
effectiveness of parliament itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From my point of view as a member of parliament who has been 
here on and off since 1988, the first and most important thing 
that could be changed is the committee system.  We have a circus 
in committees right now.  The chairs are predetermined and 
selected by ministers.  Voting is distorted and contorted.  It is 
set up so that only one person can win the chair of a committee. 
That in itself sets the tone of the committee and makes it far 
less effective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees would be much more effective if we had secret ballots 
in the same way as we choose the Speaker.  It is just as 
important to have secret ballots on the agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the transport committee in the last parliament we went 
through a series of determinations of important issues to be 
discussed.  We went from 15 issues to 8 to 6 to 2.  Just as we 
were to decide which one we would take up next, the minister 
announced that he wanted us to do something else.  All government 
members agreed with him and that is what we did.  It was not on 
the list.  It was not what we were to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the agendas of the committees could be set by secret ballot 
they would be much more effective and productive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Parliamentary secretaries are like policemen at committees. They 
are there to ensure government members fall in line and do 
exactly what they are supposed to do.  They should not be there. 
If they are there, they should be there as witnesses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have the power to initiate legislation and the freedom 
to make amendments much more in line with what is appropriate for 
the particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have transcripts from committees much faster.  It 
takes weeks and weeks for the public to get a transcript from a 
committee, at which time the bill could have gone through final 
reading in the House and have been passed.  What is the point of 
having a transcript so much later? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Britain there is a limit of two weeks for transcripts to get 
out to the public, and that is the way it should be here.  There 
is no reason it cannot be done.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Access to information is a thorn in my side.  I have seen my 
ability to do my job weakened by changes in the access to 
information application and government policy.  When I apply for 
access to information I usually get a number of pages, half of 
which have nothing on them and some of which are all blanked out, 
with the important parts taken out.  It distorts the whole 
purpose of the access to information system.  It could be 
extremely effective and helpful to us in doing our job.  First we 
are stalled.  Then we get abridged versions and distorted 
versions.  In fact, in many cases they are just simply useless. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another thing that is happening is that as the government 
divests operations we are losing access to information.  A good 
example is NavCan, the system that controls air traffic control. 
When it was under Transport Canada we could access information on 
air traffic controller incident reports, their complaints and 
concerns.  We could access structural reports on air traffic 
control towers.  We can no longer do that because it is divested 
to NavCan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Confidence votes are almost the rule and they should not be. We 
should have free votes on many more issues than we have. 
Everything is confidence now, even trivial issues.  Government 
members are told to stay in line or they will pay a huge price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Questions on the order paper take too long to get answered.  We 
could use questions on the order paper much more to our advantage 
and to the advantage of the Canadian people if there were a 
shorter time limit.  Why does it take more than seven days to 
answer a question on the order paper?  There is no reason.  That 
is something that should be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced in London, 
England, that we had changed our policy toward India.  That is an 
abuse of parliament.  He should come here and make that 
announcement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have more access to committees and much more effective 
committees.  I only hope the exercise we are about to go through 
is not smoke and mirrors.  We have the opportunity to improve 
things, and I hope we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  If 
the member goes over his time we should arrange it so that the 
other person's time is reduced by the same amount so that 
together they get 15 minutes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Lincoln):</B>  The member has two and 
a half minutes for questions and comments. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
will not take the full two and a half minutes, so perhaps it 
could be tacked on to the intervention of my colleague from St. 
John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have one very quick question and the member just briefly 
touched on it.  As one member across the way said, it is contempt 
of parliament.  Recently we have talked about ministers who 
prefer to go to the news media, to a press conference, and to 
outside organizations to make policy announcements that should be 
made in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member expand on that a little?  The time for 
questions and comments could then go to my good friend from St. 
John's West. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Casey:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will just use the example 
I mentioned.  Yesterday the Minister of Foreign Affairs announced 
a change in our policy toward India.  That affects the foreign 
affairs committee but we were not told. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We were not given any advance notice.  We were not given any 
opportunity to comment, question, criticize, advise or maybe make 
improvements to the policy.  It did not come to parliament.  We 
had no opportunity to deal with the issue in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has become pervasive.  The government does it more and more. 
It makes announcements in the media.  It does not bring them to 
the House. It does not give us a chance to comment.  It is a very 
serious issue.  It is moving away from tradition and precedence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
delighted to participate in such a discussion this evening.  It 
is a pleasure to partake in such an interesting exercise. Today 
is a great day to have such a debate because it is international 
day for the elimination of discrimination.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of us are wearing multicoloured ribbons representing the 
different nations within our country.  I wonder, as many of 
Canadians watch the debate this evening, what they are saying 
about us? What do they say about us every day when they watch 
this honourable House?   We must remember that people outside the 
Chamber only see what is portrayed on television and only hear 
news reports.  Quite often it is not very pretty. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was an honour this evening, Mr. Speaker, to listen to you, to 
listen to my leader earlier, and to listen to the member for 
Regina—Qu'Appelle.  If my French serves me right, qu'appelle 
means what calls.  The question we might ask is what is calling 
us to be here tonight?  Unfortunately there are not too many of 
us, but why are we here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You are whipped. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  It is not because of our whip, with all 
due respect to my colleague.  Some of us who are in the Chamber 
at this late hour, and some who will stay even later, believe in 
the institution.  We also believe that perhaps tonight we can 
make some difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What concerns us is who is not here.  I know we cannot draw 
attention to individuals but let us draw attention to classes. 
The people who hold the power may not have the same concerns 
about what happens in this great Chamber as those who perhaps are 
abused by the power that some people hold. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  They are listening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  We hope they are listening and we hope 
that they learn.  All of us have learned tonight from all 
those who have participated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could ask for many things to be changed. Practically all of 
them are on the record already.  We could talk about ministerial 
statements that should be made in the House so that there is a 
chance to respond and people across the country understand what 
has been announced, particularly if those statements refer to 
policy and financial items. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should see ministers here during the late show when we have 
questions but are not satisfied with the answers we receive.  We 
ask for more deliberation so that they can understand what we are 
talking about.  We should not have their parliamentary 
secretaries rushing in with a prepared text to slough off members 
with an answer prepared by someone else.  That is not learning 
about the problems which confront the country and problems which 
they as government ministers should be doing something about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are also looking at the time it takes to pass legislation and 
comparing it to the time wasted in this honourable Chamber. 
Tonight I returned from having dinner with a group of young 
students who are here in a forum of young Canadians.  I asked 
them as they sat at my table what they thought of their visit to 
the House.  They were impressed, as anyone would be who comes 
here, but they also said that the decorum is certainly not what 
it should be and that we waste a lot of time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to the dissolution of the House when the election was 
called I saw all the bills that died on the order paper, 
particularly bills like the employment insurance one that left a 
lot of people in dire straits for the fall and winter.  I wonder 
how many of these bills could have been passed if we did not 
procrastinate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know my time is short but let me say that despite all the 
suggestions being made by everyone in relation to the work of the 
committees, the performance of ministers, the methods and 
mechanisms of pushing through legislation, if we are to attain 
change in this honourable Chamber it has to come from the heart 
of each and every one of us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need the intelligence and the imagination to envision what 
this Chamber should be and what it can do.  If each and every one 
of us, elected by our constituents, does what we were elected to 
do, we will not have to worry about parliamentary change.  It 
will happen automatically.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the hon. member on a 
wonderful speech.  What really deserves credit is the fact that 
he described his affection for parliament.  That is very 
important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important for those who do not want parliamentary 
reform to understand that those who want parliamentary reform do 
it from an affection, a love and a respect for this place.  We do 
not do it because we do not respect parliament.  It is in fact 
the exact opposite.  We respect and love this place and want it 
to be what it should be.  That is why we ask for parliamentary 
reform.  I very much appreciated that comment in the hon. 
member's speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to ask him a specific question about quorum.  He 
mentioned that we should probably increase quorum so that we have 
more members in the House and the debates are livelier and more 
deliberative.  This place should be a national debating body. The 
whole notion of deliberation, of give and take, of debate back 
and forth, and of the tension between the opposition and the 
government side, is what produces good governance.  Would he 
comment on whether we should increase the quorum requirements of 
the House of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Loyola Hearn:</B>  Mr. Speaker, a number of years ago I 
came from the government side of a legislature where our leader 
gave us a fair amount of flexibility.  I then spent three years 
in opposition where I saw premier number one pull the plug on 
Meech Lake despite the wishes of the majority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also came from the same legislature where I saw the same 
leader lead a vote of non-confidence in the speaker because he 
was caught short on quorum.  I have seen many people try to make 
good speeches and nobody listened.  That was unfortunate.  How 
can we individually react and do anything about the problems in 
the country or parliamentary reform if we are not even listening 
or we are not even concerned with what is going on? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the hon. member that we should always have a large 
number in the House so that the give and take will lead to 
positive results. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I was inspired to come to this community and ultimately 
participate in electoral politics back in 1980 by the Right Hon. 
Pierre Elliott Trudeau.  I remember one day in debate in 1983 
when we were chatting about certain issues.  He stood in the 
House and said that the essence of the Chamber was to speak for 
those who did not have a voice and that the essence of our work 
was to support those who needed our help when they needed it 
most.  That has been my compass. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before I get into my direct comments on why this place needs to 
be more effective, Mr. Speaker, your courage and your inspiration 
are very similar to those of Mr. Trudeau.  Your speech earlier 
tonight in the House of Commons on how we need to reform to make 
this place more effective and more relevant very much reminded me 
of Mr. Trudeau. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 5, 2000, I wrote an article for the <I>Hill Times</I> in 
which I talked about parliamentary democracy.  I know a couple of 
times today I have been quoted on the fact that we are nothing 
more than voting machines, that the place is irrelevant and that 
it is a car with a broken engine.  I stand by everything I said 
on June 5. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight I celebrate the fact that the leadership of all 
parties has finally made a public confession that it is time to 
take the engine of this place into the repair shop and make it 
more relevant.  That is a great thing.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I stand here tonight I think of my constituents.  They are 
kind  wondering about committees, special motions and all the 
different rules of the House.  They do not understand any of 
that.  They elected me to come here and work on the issues that I 
ran on in the last election. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of those issues, for example, is the whole struggle that we 
are having to get more affordable housing in the downtown Toronto 
area.  I know it is a national problem but I am speaking to my 
constituents tonight.  They wonder what is going on, that after I 
ran on a certain issue, the government ran on a certain issue, 
the Prime Minister takes a lead on a certain issue, I was elected 
on November 27 and then I come up here and nothing happens.  They 
do not get it.  They cannot figure it out.  I have to confess 
that I also cannot figure it out and I have been here for 13 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To be brutally frank, and I say this to all members of the 
House, I am totally fed up with the current system. I am not fed 
up because it will make any difference to me personally.  What 
bothers me is the contempt that the entire machinery of 
government has toward each and every member of the House of 
Commons.  I do not care what party it is, it is contempt. Those 
are strong words but I stand by them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have, through access to information, documents in my 
possession showing that departments of government have passed on 
memos saying what they will feed up to the minister or to the MPs 
so that they will stop bothering them.  That happened when I 
tried to serve my constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, we go back 13 years.  I pray and hope that under 
your watch we can make this House of Commons work the way it is 
supposed to work.  It has to start.  I worked my guts out in 1984 
to help the Prime Minister become not only the leader of my party 
but the Prime Minister of Canada.  I have immense love and 
respect for him, but I do not have respect for the 800 men and 
women in the Privy Council Office who, in no way shape or form, 
reflect the experience of the populist approach that the Prime 
Minister has had throughout his 35 years of serving parliament 
and the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support all the recommendations from my colleague for 
Lac-Saint-Louis but I want one other amendment to come to 
parliamentary reform.  I want one day a week, or maybe one day a 
month if that is all we can get, to be contempt for parliament 
day, a day where MPs can bring to the House examples of where 
they have tried to serve their constituents on issues that are 
government policy but could not get a response, of where they 
tried to get service for their constituents but the bureaucrat's 
response was that they should call the minister's office.  Does 
that mean that a public or city councillor can call the 
bureaucrat but a member of parliament cannot call him or her and 
get service without going through a minister's office? 
That is crap.  That is not the way to run a country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think parliamentary reform will ever take root until we 
create an environment where the machinery of government, the 
public service, responds to all of us as we try to serve the 
public and our constituents.  I submit to the House that this is 
not happening today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is good to see you in the chair.  I know that 
parliamentary reform is something that is very much on your mind 
and on the minds of many members here tonight.  Throughout the 
coming days and weeks I am hoping that we can keep this spirit 
alive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members have engaged in the debate throughout the past 
number of hours.  I commend the hon. member from Edmonton who has 
a long career ahead of him as a parliamentarian and has shown a 
great many insights already that will serve us well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to put a question to the hon. member for 
Toronto—Danforth.  As he has pointed out, he is a long serving 
member and he has expressed very eloquently a frustration that 
many members feel from all corners and all parties.  He has 
focused in on one of the key problems that we are wrestling with 
and finding some difficulty in articulating, the bureaucratic 
influence that exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It appears that the levers of powers given to elected 
representatives have somehow been stripped away, watered down or 
diminished.   A simple example the member used was of a member 
being able to access information on behalf of a constituent.  It 
would normally take weeks or months to get a response.  We would 
normally punch in a telephone number of one department only to be 
sent off to another department or to another province.  We may 
have called our local office only to get another city in another 
province.  He knows the problem.  He has encountered it as have 
many of the members here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we change this institutionalized attitude that appears to 
exist?  It is a non-partisan issue because it has evolved, as 
have a lot of the problems, but how do we change the mindset or 
the attitude that seems to exist within the bureaucracy?   Should 
we limit terms for members and senior civil servants?  Is there a 
way we can police the bureaucracy more effectively? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my recommendation in our 
list of parliamentary reforms is that we have a contempt for 
parliament day.  On that day, the clerk of the Privy Council 
would sit here and be responsible for the complaints on behalf of 
constituents that come to the clerk.  He could then fan them out 
to his deputies.  We could then get a better service to the 
public.  I do not see it any other way. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am intrigued by the speech that the hon. member has 
just given.  Without being personal, I will make this statement 
so general that it will not attack an individual member here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely he must agree that the way things work around here, and 
specifically with respect to the PMO and Privy Council, that this 
is a function of the executive branch of government.  It has to 
be within their ability to change that and to reign it in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is that not where we should be working in the House of Commons 
instead of blaming bureaucrats?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are not here tonight 
blaming anyone.  We are here tonight renewing ourselves.  All of 
us in the House have to blame ourselves for the way we have 
allowed the pendulum to swing away from us.  I put myself at the 
top of the list.  I have turned the other cheek too many times on 
behalf of my constituents.  I should have been tougher many years 
ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is one thing all my colleagues must learn, which I learned 
a long time ago when I used to work in the Prime Minister's 
office.  A highly respected senior bureaucrat once said that if 
we allow resistance, we will get resistance.  I must confess that 
over the last number of years I have allowed too much resistance 
when I should have been more forceful on behalf of my 
constituents. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield (Yellowhead, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we are having an interesting debate today and it is 
absolutely vital for me, as a new member in the House, to be able 
to speak to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons, as far as I am concerned, has to return to 
the people of Canada.  Parliamentary reform has taken far too 
long and is long over.  The rights and responsibilities of 
members of parliament to represent the views of their 
constituents has disappeared.  The government seems much more 
concerned about maintaining power than representing the will of 
the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons is the people's parliament.  It is the 
voice of the common people of Canada.  We must make it responsive 
to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I took my seat here only a few short months ago and I have 
already come to recognize, despite the efforts of hard-working 
individuals from all sides of the House, that this place is no 
more than a voting machine.  Last night I witnessed 16 motions 
being voted on in a few minutes, rubber stamp laws that were 
mainly drawn up by unelected bureaucrats from the Prime 
Minister's office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is up to the members of parliament, the government and the 
opposition to take parliament back.  We must take parliament 
back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came believing that I could offer some constructive input on 
pressing legislation and engage in serious debate on important 
issues.  Instead, I saw an example yesterday of where we turned 
our back on a very important issue, an economic fibre of our 
country, the agriculture crisis. Many members were not even 
allowed to debate on it.  However, we can go all night tonight on 
this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mechanism of government was inherited by a proven British 
parliamentary system created by the Fathers of Confederation. 
They answered the great question:  Should the chief power of the 
country be the king or parliament?  They determined that they 
would be governed by the people and not by the will of one man. 
It is an illusion if one thinks that Canadians live in a 
democracy.  We are controlled by the Prime Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My grandfather fought in both world wars.  He went to war 
defending the rights of democracy so that we could stand in the 
House today to debate.  He fought for freedom.  Young men and 
women, aged 18, 19 and 20 years old, gave up their lives so that 
we could be here to  debate.  It is sad for me to think that the 
people of Canada have been conquered by a dictator without a shot 
being fired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can change that by free votes.  We can work toward reforming 
parliament.  There are a lot of things that have been talked 
about today, all of them very worthy of note, but for me the 
greatest change would come with the free vote of every member in 
the House, because it is up to us to vote the will of the people 
who sent us here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Have governments forgotten that only four short months ago the 
citizens of the country elected each one of us into our seats? In 
four short months we have forgotten who we represent.  We need to 
shift how government works and to be responsive to those who put 
us here.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As I see it, we are bribing Canadians with their own tax 
dollars, and there is wasteful spending on unnecessary programs 
and unaccountable government.  Cabinet is barking to the tune of 
the bureaucrats and special interest groups.  Free votes will set 
us on a path for parliamentary reform and that is a path that we 
need to get on really quickly as far as I am concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A real interesting concept is that government members believe 
that if the government introduces a bill that is defeated or if 
an opposition bill, motion or amendment is passed it would bring 
down the government and they would have to resign.  It is beyond 
me where that idea comes from.  It is archaic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister coerces backbenchers into believing that 
voting the will of the constituents would bring the government 
down.  That would not bring the government down at all.  Voting 
for their constituencies and constituents would make the 
government stronger and Canada stronger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal backbenchers have been forced into something that the 
Prime Minister wants.  He has been bullying them around, sort of 
like a schoolyard bully, but bullies are only powerful as long as 
no one stands up to them and no one really challenges them or 
thinks around their bullying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know that the hon. members across the way are truly hard 
working people.  I have talked to many of them.  Now is their 
chance to stand up.  Not many of them but a few of them are in 
the House right now.  They can talk to their colleagues and do 
something for Canada that is beyond anything they have done to 
this point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 301 members elected to the House of Commons.  We have 
the power to implement change.  We set the rules.  We were 
entrusted to make the laws of this country.  I am not asking 
members to vote for something they do not believe in, but I will 
not be holding my breath that the Prime Minister will come 
through that door any time soon, unmuzzle the backbenchers over 
there and allow free votes in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As democratically elected members of parliament, we do have the 
power to make the change.  We could make it as early as tomorrow 
morning, if we had the political will to do so, by passing a 
motion that we truly have free votes in this place.  All it would 
take is 30 Liberal backbenchers to live up to their potential and 
to influence government in a way they have never influenced it 
before.  That is all it would take.  We could change Canada and 
never go back.  That is how easy it could be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe in blaming the bureaucrats.  I believe it is 
our duty.  We need to do something about it and we need to do it 
soon.  Backbench MPs have that potential to be more than just 
voting machines.  I would challenge them to do it, to be more, 
because they owe it to themselves and they owe it to this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud that I can represent the people of Yellowhead who 
have chosen me to be here as their representative in the House of 
Commons.  They trust me to inform them of the problems, seek 
their opinions and vote their will.  After being in parliament 
for only a few months, I have already realized that my ability to 
represent my constituents has been hampered by the Prime 
Minister's obsession for power.  If he were really interested in 
creating the legacy he talks about, he would implement 
parliamentary reform himself.  However, we do not have to wait 
for the Prime Minister.  We can implement it now.  We have the 
power to do it and we should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right after the election of November 27, 2000, I came to Ottawa 
with a few MPs for orientation.  They were from all sides of the 
House.  We were excited.  We had just been elected.  We had just 
been given the opportunity to change Canada, to lead Canada, to 
make a difference in this country.  I was excited about it and I 
am still excited about it.  As I talked to the other MPs, they 
said they were excited about the concept of a free vote.  They 
thought it was something they could and should do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is interesting now to see how disappointing it is that they 
have fallen victim to the system and have thrown away their 
ideals and their principles.  If these walls could speak, they 
would tell us about the great leaders who have sat in these same 
chairs and who have fought for a better Canada, who have done 
what was right for their constituencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am calling on every member of the House to live up to the 
vision of the founding fathers and to vote for a motion to allow 
free votes, because members owe it to this country.  It is the 
greatest country in the world and we need to protect it.  We can 
do it and we should do it now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Malpeque, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wanted 
to raise a point when the member for Toronto—Danforth made his 
points.  I just want to put on the record that I do agree with a 
lot of what he said.  We do not really need to change the system 
in here; we need to change it totally, starting at the Privy 
Council Office and on down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the member who just spoke talked a lot about free 
votes.  I really think on that point that I look at every vote as 
a free vote in the House.  I vote my conscience.  If I want to 
vote against my party, I can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned that if these walls could speak, but if 
these walls could speak they would tell us that there have been 
more free votes since 1993 in the House than ever in its history. 
Those are the facts.  That is reality.  There is not this great 
restriction.  In fact, we have seen more members vote different 
from their party on this side of the House, the governing party, 
than we have seen in the member's party, the Canadian Alliance, 
over the last number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want to point out that I agree with free votes, but they 
are not the do all and end all in terms of changing everything in 
this place.  I was not able to be here for a lot of this evening, 
but I listened to a fair bit of the debate on TV.  I really like 
what I see tonight.  There is a good spirit in the House, with 
good discussion, good debate and good ideas, and I think we need 
to carry it further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I just want to point out to the member opposite that 
free votes in and of themselves will not be the do all and end 
all in terms of changing how this place operates, because we have 
had more free votes with this government than ever before in our 
history, but it may not be enough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member 
for the question.  I would just like to explain that in the time 
I have been here, in the time that I have witnessed, I do not 
have to go back very far to see that what the hon. member is 
saying about free votes has been stifled very significantly.  I 
just have to go back one day, because yesterday we saw many of 
the backbench Liberals vote against a bill that they honestly 
believed should have been there.  We know that from witnessing it 
on agriculture, as he may have believed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am suggesting is that the free vote is a place to start. 
There has been a lot of good discussion here today and I 
appreciate all of it.  I agree with the hon. member that there 
are some very good ideas about parliamentary reform.  I also 
believe that it has to start with the free vote.  If we did that, 
it would pave the way for everything to flow out of it.  That is 
what I am suggesting. 
<P><A NAME="LINK223"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the member for Yellowhead.  I appreciate his 
candour.  Of course he has certainly distinguished himself as a 
new member of parliament and I am pleased to see him enter a 
debate that I think is so important, not just to the essence of 
what this place is but, more important, to what we are as 
Canadians and what we share in common. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier this evening we heard the hon. House leader talk about 
the notion of at least being able to ensure that we have more 
meaningful debate and opportunity for members on both sides of 
the House to provide amendments to opposition day motions, the 
so-called practice that has been around since 1994, with the hon. 
member's previous party, in which the opposition splits its time 
and as a result effectively forecloses on any opportunity for 
meaningful debate by simply putting the word immediate after its 
own motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member not agree, then, with the House leader's 
position that perhaps we could encourage the very thing he is 
looking for?  We have members on this side like myself, who on 
two occasions has tried to provide meaningful amendments.  That 
might allow members on this side of the House to join with the 
members, as we might have yesterday, on a very important debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rob Merrifield:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of 
different ideas about how reform should happen in this place.  We 
have talked a lot about them and we have heard almost all of them 
today.  I could get into the details of that one and many more. 
I would prefer to keep my focus exactly on where I think we 
should start.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Where we should start is the free vote.  We should start with 
being able to do what our constituents want us to do and that is 
to vote their will in the House.  If we did that, then we would 
bring meaningful debate into this place.  Right now we do not 
have that.  I have not seen it.  We can get into all those other 
details, but I would rather not because I want to keep my focus 
on where the fundamentals are and then work from there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK224"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank the hon. member for Yellowhead. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Part of the process of parliamentary reform perhaps includes 
some of the more subtle parts of the ways in which the practices 
of the House have evolved over the years and have been so 
important in providing the kinds of routines that allow us to 
discharge our functions day in and day out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, it is an honour for you to be in the chair this 
evening, particularly as I give my perspective in terms of 
parliamentary reform, because I think it is rather poignant that 
a debate which took place some time ago, a contest that I am very 
proud we both had an opportunity to run in, was really, in my 
view, the beginning of a new phase with respect to the issue of 
parliamentary reform.  Some two months or a month and a half 
after that deliberation, we now see ourselves, unlike other 
parliaments, still continuing in the need to look at and study 
the issue of improving the relationship that members of 
parliament have with the House and, more important, with their 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opportunity for us to speak today as a result of an 
agreement by all House leaders is one that I believe is of 
essential and extreme importance to all members of parliament. 
Parliamentary reform is an issue that concerns many Canadians. 
What we are in fact discussing today centres on the future 
viability of parliament and the value of those who have been sent 
here to represent the interests of their constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most interesting things that has happened, which has 
been discussed by various members in the House this evening, has 
been the question of the disconnect, to some extent, among 
constituents, Canadians and their voting patterns.  However, I 
think the more disturbing trend might be encapsulated by those 
who observe and who I believe do not do so with a political bias. 
These are people such as Peter Dobell, who in his recent report 
entitled <I>Reforming Parliamentary Practice:  The Views of 
MPs</I>, wrote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In no other British-type legislature has the shift of power to 
the executive proceeded further than in the Canadian federal 
House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is obviously some tension with respect to this negative 
view and the idea that perhaps the House of Commons may not be 
able to continue to be relevant as long as power and decision 
making is so intently focused in one area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we have been placed in the unenviable position of 
trying to represent, as members of parliament, the views of 
constituents to bring forth worthwhile ideas, while at the same 
time realizing that very little can be done to accomplish this 
without the approval of the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the items that has not been discussed at great length 
this evening and which I would like to touch upon is an area that 
I think all members of parliament can readily agree with.  That 
is the notion of our private members' business.  I look across 
and I know there are members of parliament who have helped this 
member in particular pass two pieces of legislation.  One, Mr. 
Speaker, was passed with your help in 1996 with respect to organ 
donation.  The other was with the help of members across the way, 
including the Minister of Justice, with respect to the issue of 
pursuit.  It was the first change of the criminal code by a 
backbencher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are changes that reflect the essence and the 
meaningfulness of what members of parliament really must 
challenge and must bring forth in the House of Commons beyond 
question period in order to ensure that this place continues to 
be ever more relevant. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a problem.  Some of this issue can be solved 
not simply with respect to the standing orders.  I think all 
members of parliament in the House would agree that private 
members' business is something that is far more important.  It 
might give an opportunity to members of parliament to see their 
positions effectively and, to some extent, properly addressed if 
we were to make all private members' business votable.  It is 
reverse onus on members of parliament not to come forward with 
frivolous propositions in terms of legislation.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members of parliament truly believe in what they are saying, 
and they truly believe that what they are advocating on behalf of 
their constituents is worthy enough of being on the floor of the 
House of Commons, then we owe it to members of parliament and to 
Canadians to ensure that members of parliament become accountable 
not to their colleagues and peers, but to the Canadians which 
they represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Each and every one of us has within our own right the privilege 
of being here.  It is with the private members' business that I 
believe members of parliament can work with this side of the 
House and vice versa, by working on issues over and above the 
precious issues of the day that come up for 45 minutes, which you 
are no doubt familiar with, Mr. Speaker, with respect to question 
period.  I believe we have an opportunity here to give members of 
parliament the hand up that they need to pick one, maybe two 
issues, in every parliament which they can broker and perhaps 
broker successfully, assuming they can lobby other members of 
parliament to tell them how important their issues are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have had some experience in winning a few bills.  I have also 
had some rather unsavoury experiences with losing a bill, and 
particularly one dealing with predatory pricing.  The House of 
Commons is supreme, parliament is supreme and not a committee 
that from time to time has usurped its authority to simply erase 
the bill because it did not happen to like it or because it was 
under particular instructions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We all know that there are obligations on those committees. 
Ultimately, no committee as an adjunct or an arm of the House of 
Commons can assume a power which belongs to the House of Commons 
alone.  It is for that reason that if we are going to treat 
private members' business seriously, when it goes to committee 
the role of committee must be to improve that bill, not 
extinguish it, not destroy it, not vandalize it and not remove it 
from existence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am speaking to the idea that bills that are votable must be 
treated with great respect.  It has been a determination of the 
House that they be treated in such a way.  I ask for the 
indulgence of members and the House leaders to consider that.  If 
they truly want to make the role of members of parliament that 
much more relevant, that I believe is one area that we must work 
much harder on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More important, I appreciate the role of the House leader of 
this party.  I appreciate the role of the members who have had 
plenty of experience in the House and, yes, our new members who 
bring a very new perspective to what Canadians are saying to the 
House of Commons.  It is equally important for us as members of 
parliament to be able to talk to members of parliament of the 
Conservative Party, the Alliance Party, the Bloc Quebecois and 
even other parties like the NDP. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this context, it is important we have hope, pride and 
confidence in members so they set partisan politics aside for a 
while and ensure we are here to promote the interest of Canadians 
and that we work toward that end. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it is clear that partisanship has a lot to do with the 
effective operation of this House, but perhaps as well can on 
occasion be a threat of confidence in this House. That is why I 
implore members, and hope to have their support, to show 
today in this debate that we can work together for the good of 
our country, to ensure our country is running well and to offer 
it a better future. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we do nothing more than work together on the very valuable 
proposals that are being put forward individually by members of 
parliament, irrespective of their partisan affiliation, we will 
have accomplished in this parliament what no other parliament has 
done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Wracked by the internal internecine fights of “we have got to 
make the point, we have to embarrass the government, the 
government has to protect itself,” I believe we have an 
opportunity which begins here this evening at ten to ten eastern 
standard time, to provide Canadians an opportunity to understand 
that what we do here is meaningful and important. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many times we will see Americans and people from other countries 
come into this famous House of Commons.  They will find it 
fascinating that less than two sword lengths apart people every 
day, day in and day out, can see the most important issues of the 
day debated.  Some people call it a farce and some call it 
theatre.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We have an obligation to explain to Canadians what we are doing 
here, but to also let Canadians know that we have the opportunity 
and an advantage here this evening to do what no other parliament 
has done before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While there is only ten minutes for discussion in what is 
otherwise a very worthwhile evening, there are issues of the 
Board of Internal Economy and perhaps opening that up to members 
of parliament, making decisions to members of parliament and to 
make sure their needs are truly met.  These are all part and 
parcel of the much wider question of how we continue to reinvent 
ourselves and modernize ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I compliment the government and the House leaders for having the 
courage to go and visit this debate.  We need to deal with 
substantive issues.  Let us work together to make this parliament 
relevant and in so doing we will have honoured all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK225"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciated the member opposite's 
speech.  I thought it was very well done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the certain issue of private members' bill, as a 
member I fully concur that private members' bills should all be 
votable.  It simply does not make sense to have two-thirds of the 
private members' bills that come up for debate for an hour not 
votable and then they are off the order paper.  That does not 
make sense.  I fully support the member in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also agree with him that it makes members more 
responsible.  If they introduce a private members' bill that does 
not make sense, they will be the ones who are held accountable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the member two questions.  First, should the 
House extend the hours for debate of private members' bills?  If 
we look at the parliament of Canada, for about the first 50 years 
we had more time devoted toward private members' business.  Since 
about 1911 we have tended to move toward more government 
business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second question is a genuine question for the member 
opposite.  In my short time here I have observed him and take him 
to be an intelligent and independent member of the House.  The 
fact is we are hampered by a concentration of power in the Prime 
Minister's office and the Privy Council Office.  That hurts those 
intelligent and independent members like himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was a conference last year in Edmonton that was 
co-sponsored by the previous member for Edmonton Southwest and 
the member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough.  A member there 
said that all that we needed was for the opposition parties to 
join with a few backbench government members to say to the 
executive that they were not going to tolerate the control they 
had over parliament.  He called it a backbenchers' bill of 
rights. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would it be possible for the backbench government members to 
join opposition members and take back the rights from the 
executive that all parliamentarians should have, and should we do 
it right now? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are definitely 
challenged by the tenacity and the acuity of new members of 
parliament who seem to be very much on the ball, even at 38.  I 
have to apologize, I have grey hair now but I did not eight years 
ago.  The hon. member from Edmonton Southwest may know that in a 
couple of months.  Perhaps if he spends a bit of time as a 
backbencher he will know what I am talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To answer his first question, there is no doubt the hours should 
be extended.  I think there is common perspective on the notion 
of extending the hours of debate in the House of Commons to 
accommodate private members' business.  Perhaps one of those 
could be to devote the entire Friday to that end.  That would be 
important as long as the condition was that private members' 
business was votable and that it would be taken more seriously, 
so that more members of parliament would come to the House and 
participate in those debates.  That time should not extended on 
non-votable bills because we basically talk out those bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>His second question is even more important.  I agree with him, 
as have many academics and many others who have observed this 
since about the time of Pearson and Trudeau.  We have seen an 
accretion of power to the centre.  There are a number of reasons 
for it including globalization and separation.  Also, the media 
has changed.  Rather than looking for information in the 
post-Watergate period, it has looked for the scandal.  We have 
certainly seen that in the past few days, and the member is not 
unaware of that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would I agree to the notion that members of parliament can take 
back the House of Commons?  They can do it at any time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think it takes the collective will of members on both sides of 
the House to work together on issues and principles, as long as 
they can agree that there is a place and a time for partisanship.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I refer to that in my few comments because the House tends to be 
so rife with division based on party lines.  We tend to have an 
us versus them mentality.  That is the very thing we have to try 
to get around if we are going to go to the question of whether we 
can restore the sovereignty of the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  The member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough; a brief question. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member for 
Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge.  I know he brings an extraordinary 
ability to identify important humanitarian non-partisan issues. I 
have great respect for the work he does in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a question along the same lines as the member from 
Edmonton.  I know this particular member has participated in 
recent hearings on the impartiality of commissioners and 
individuals who are to serve the House and serve the Canadian 
public with an arm's length relationship. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we be looking at how the financial strings which are 
attached to cabinet might influence its decisions?  What I am 
referring to is protection for the officers like the auditor 
general, the privacy commissioner and the ethics counsellor. 
Should we be looking in some way to distance the resources that 
are made available to them through the treasury board and 
cabinet?  Maybe we should be tying it more to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While we are on the subject, should we not have an independent, 
arm's length ethics counsellor to report directly to parliament? 
I know the member has followed this issue.  Would it not increase 
public understanding and public— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Speaker:</B>  I did ask the hon. member for a short 
question.  We are now going to have a short response from the 
hon. member for Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know you want to hear a 
yes as an answer.  I agree with and respect the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that in order to allow the House to function, 
those who serve it must also be seen as being able to discharge 
their function in a way that is at arm's length and in a way that 
is above reproach.  I think this is something that Canadians can 
trust as being part and parcel of the importance of our 
institution, which is to ensure that its officers function day in 
and day out in a way that ensures the level of confidence we have 
in our institutions, beyond the function of the members of 
parliament.  Everything must be done and seen to be done to do 
just that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very briefly, we need to do this with respect to officers who 
may have worked within various ministries, portfolios and 
departments to ensure there is a cooling off period and to ensure 
that Canadians have that accountability and that trust. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am certainly pleased to participate in this debate on 
parliamentary reform.  It has been something that has been near 
and dear to my heart for a number of years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I first came to parliament, the 35th parliament from 1993 
to 1997, I worked on a subcommittee chaired by what is now the 
government whip.  We produced a report that is called ”Business 
of Supply: Completing the Circle of Control”, which was called 
by the clerk of the House of Commons at that time one of the best 
reports in 50 years on reforming the House of Commons.  It was 
unanimously adopted by all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It was tabled in the House of Commons.  We did not get a 
response before the election was called in 1997, so we retabled 
it in the 36th parliament.  Even though it had all-party 
agreement, the government said that there was nothing in it that 
it wanted to adopt.  That is why we are frustrated when it comes 
to parliamentary reform.  I will give some examples of what we 
are talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure to handle the estimates is a process by which the 
House approves the estimates and grants the government's supply 
money to pay the bills of the government.  Last night we approved 
billions of dollars in 30 seconds flat.  It is a crying shame. 
There was no debate, just a pro forma, first reading, second 
reading, committee of the whole, shall this clause carry on 
division, shall this clause and this clause, shall it be reported 
back to the Chair, all in favour, yeas and nays and it was a done 
deal.  We approved $16 billion that fast, without any 
examination.  That cannot be.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are to have a parliament that will hold the government to 
account, we need a real process to handle the approval of supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, you are one of the more learned members on the 
issue of supply.  For the edification of all Canadians, there is 
a simple process.  If a motion is being debated, it can be 
amended.  When an amendment is moved, we vote on it.  If the 
amendment carries, the motion is amended.  A vote is then taken 
on the main motion.   When it comes to the estimates, the process 
is reversed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If I put a motion on the order paper to reduce an expenditure by 
$100, $1,000, $1 million or to eliminate the expenditure 
entirely, that causes the President of the Treasury Board to 
reaffirm what she wants to spend.  Her motion comes up before 
mine.  After she reaffirms what she wants to spend, how can she 
say it is impossible to vote against my motion when she has just 
reaffirmed what she wants to spend?  It would be ludicrous to say 
one thing and then say the opposite.  The system is fixed to 
ensure the government gets its way.  This cannot be.  That is why 
we are totally frustrated with the process of the estimates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996 we talked about such things as evaluation.  I 
complimented the President of the Treasury Board when she 
introduced a new policy on evaluation a month ago. It is along 
those lines that we have been talking about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government will spend $170 billion this coming year but 
most parliamentarians do not know what it will be 
spent on.  It spends this money through programs.  Since 1996, I 
have been asking that programs be evaluated by asking simple 
fundamental questions, such as what is the program for and what 
public policy is this program designed to address.  If 
there is a need for it, fine, but we should be told what it is. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we have figured out what the program is trying to do, the 
second question would be quite simple:  How well is it doing it? 
We could then measure the success of the program.  The next 
questions could be:  Are we doing it efficiently, and can we 
achieve the same results in a better and more efficient way? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me take for example the program that the Minister of Finance 
introduced just before the election.  I am talking about the 
heating fuel rebate which was paid out to prisoners, people in 
graveyards and so on.  He said that the government would 
help low income people with their heating fuel bills.  That is 
fine.  There is nothing wrong with that.  However, he did not 
tell us the methodology he would use to send out the $125 
cheques. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it turned out, people who live in apartments and do not pay 
heating fuel bills received cheques.  People in prison got 
cheques even though they do not pay heating fuel bills.  People 
who recently died received cheques.  They are in a graveyard and 
cannot cash it.  The money will go to the estate even though the 
estate does not pay a heating fuel bill.  It goes on and on.  My 
son who lives with me received his cheque and he does not pay a 
heating fuel bill either. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What was the public policy?  The public policy was to help low 
income people with their fuel bills.  That is okay.  How well did 
the program achieve that objective?  As we can see, there was 
gross waste in the program by virtue of the fact that far too 
many people received a cheque even though they did not pay 
a heating fuel bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 2001, five years after the business of supply report was 
brought down, the government said there was nothing in the report 
that was worth adopting. 
It finally slipped in the idea that maybe program evaluation was 
not such a bad thing after all, that it might be able to do a 
little pilot project to see if it could get the thing moving 
forward.  Why did it take five years?  That is the point.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On reallocation of funds we have heard about March madness: the 
money has to be spent before the end of the fiscal year because 
if it is not spent it will not be there for the next year. 
Empires will get smaller.  There will not be a big raise. There 
will be staff reductions and maybe even transfers to different 
departments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday at the public accounts meeting  we were dealing with 
the billion dollar boondoggle in HRDC.  It is still hanging 
around.  The auditor general had a chart that was the perfect 
chart for March madness.  It showed that $5 million to $8 million 
a month was the average expenditure, and then in the month of 
March it went right up to $50 million.  In April it went down to 
some $5 million to $7 million.  That went on for a whole year. It 
came to March of the following year and it went up again to $50 
million and back down to some $5 million to $7 million.  It 
multiples by 10 in the month of March.  Is that March madness? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that we should have the capacity to move money 
from one budget to another.  What does the government say?  It 
says it cannot have that, that it would never do and that it 
would upset the protocol of budgets and so on.  I cannot 
understand why the government cannot see the sense in money being 
transferred from one budget to another in this modern day and age 
of computers, budgets, accountants, financial statements and all 
these things. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deal with another situation in public accounts.  This is how 
ludicrous it was.  The Department of National Defence has a 
budget to repair houses and it has a budget for new houses.  It 
needed some new houses but there was no money for new houses.  It 
still had some money in the repair budget.  It would demolish 
wrecks of houses but keep one little corner of the basement so 
that it could build a new house on that corner of the basement 
and call it a repair.  It was a brand new house. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about statutory expenditures, it is $100 billion a 
year that does not even get debated in the House.  Let the 
taxpayers know that $100 billion never gets debated but it is 
spent, and that has to change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The auditor general talked about the child tax credit.  It is an 
actual expenditure but it gets netted off on taxes and does not 
show on the books.  Loan guarantees do not show up until they are 
bad.  Once they are bad, what can be done?  There should be a 
process by which we can evaluate loan guarantees.  I would love 
to go on for an hour but I know my time has ended. 
<P><A NAME="LINK228"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dan McTeague (Pickering—Ajax—Uxbridge, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I have a very simple question for the member for St. 
Albert.  I heard him talk about things that I know are near and 
dear to his heart such as expenditures for the country.  I 
compliment him for his work on the public accounts as chairman 
there.  It is one of the only examples where there is an 
opposition chair.  This should be extended to other committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was quite amazed that on the subject of parliamentary reform 
he could not see the obvious in his own personage in terms of 
being the chair of that committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take some exception to the member's comments about home 
heating fuel.  I found them passing strange in that the premier 
of his province had shown wisdom by extending a rebate to his 
people, as did the federal government, particularly those who are 
very poor.  He talked about the boondoggles and concerns of 
individuals with respect to the money being poorly spent.  Yet 
tens of millions have been spent properly for Canadians to help 
alleviate what was arguably one of the coldest winters, certainly 
in eastern Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the one or two minutes he has left, is he prepared to talk 
about the subject of parliamentary reform, particularly in the 
context of his knowledge with respect to whether we should have 
a few more chairmen from the opposition chairing committees?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Why stop at a few, Mr. Speaker?  We 
could have all the committees chaired by the opposition.  There 
is no reason they cannot be.  We are advocating a secret ballot, 
so that could quite easily happen.  There is nothing wrong with 
that.  Is there anything wrong with a parliamentary committee 
being chaired by the opposition? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  No. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Williams:</B>  Even the Liberals are agreeing that we 
could have a secret ballot.  He talked about the heating fuel 
rebate in the province of Alberta.  The money was paid directly 
to the utility company who then took it off the bill.  Those who 
did not get utility bills did not get any rebate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Finance said that anybody with a low income 
would get the rebate cheque.  As I said, they are in the 
graveyards and in the prisons.  They are living in rental 
accommodations or with their parents and they received the money. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us remember the four questions I asked.  What is public 
policy?  I did not disagree with public policy.  The second 
question was about how well it was achieving that public policy. 
The heating fuel rebate is a disastrous waste of money because 
there was so much spillage over to people who did not pay utility 
bills.  The third question was whether it was being done 
efficiently. Can we achieve the same results in a better way? 
These are simple questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to have committee chairs from the opposition, perhaps 
we could have some real intelligent debates in committee where 
these things could come forward rather than being rammed through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember Bill C-78, which was several hundred pages long.  If 
I had not been there to try to filibuster the best I could, the 
whole bill would have been dealt with in 30 seconds flat.  That 
is disgusting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are here to deliberate, to debate, to analyze, to assess and 
to check to see that legislation is valid and proper.  The 
government would have taken 30 seconds in committee to deal with 
a 200 page bill which took $30 billion out of the pension plan of 
the public servants, the military, the RCMP and so on, money that 
had been set aside for their retirement.  The Minister of Finance 
said that he needed the money to make his books look good and 
took it, with no ifs, ands or buts. There was no debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It cannot be that way.  That is why we want parliamentary 
reform.  Parliament is here to debate and to hold government 
accountable.  If it cannot do its job, the government will be the 
worse off because of it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia (Davenport, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
because of the time limitation to which the hon. member for St. 
Albert has already alluded, I will very quickly put forward a 
proposal for consideration by the appropriate committee and then 
dive into the main issues that have emerged in the course of this 
afternoon and evening. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rationale for the proposal I would like to put forward has 
to do with the fact that debates in parliament tend to be focused 
on pressing issues and controversies.  They may be issues arising 
from legislation coming through the system, debates in question 
period, emerging debates, opposition days, et cetera. Rarely do 
parliamentarians get the opportunity to engage in debates 
addressing long term challenges, looking beyond the short term 
horizon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proposal I am putting forward is to allow for one evening 
debate per week on complex long term issues facing Canadians and 
perhaps the globe.  The purpose of this exercise would be to make 
parliament more relevant, as it would extend its scope to analyze 
emerging issues, to examine future challenges and to articulate 
the public interest.  Such debates would inform Canadians, would 
allow parliamentarians to tackle difficult issues and would allow 
for thinking outside the so-called box.

<A HREF="#LINKT99"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Such debates would not deal with issues currently on the 
legislative agenda, of course.  They would likely not be subject 
to party discipline.  They would allow for non-partisan debate in 
the House, constructive input by backbenchers at an early stage, 
and they would perhaps provide guidance for the executive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The procedure would be simple.  A committee of parliamentarians, 
one from each party, would review submissions of topics by 
colleagues in parliament and by the public, and they would decide 
the topic for debate.  The topic would be presented in the form 
of a question in order to prompt debate about future trends and 
long term impact.  CBC Radio does this frequently with a program 
on Sundays called <I>Cross Country Checkup</I>, an open mike 
program for listeners. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many examples of possible topics for discussion.  They 
could include the price of medications, the impact of 
organizations, the relevance of economic indicators, regulating 
the Internet, modernization of the United Nations and the 
security council, Canada's role in peacekeeping, the electoral 
system, the impact of changing demographics in Canada, the aging 
population and our social services, and the demand and supply of 
the energy market. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Daylight savings time could be debated.  Food safety is very 
topical, as is sustaining our forests and fisheries.  We could 
debate setting limits to economic growth.  We could look at 
trends in consumerism or the pace of technological change.  The 
speed of political change would be a fascinating topic to debate, 
namely the race between the turtle and the hare.  We could 
examine things from reproductive technologies to genetic 
engineering and the difficulties of the political system to catch 
up with the speed of technological change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We could have a debate on social cohesion in Canada, on 
interprovincial trade, public transit, civil society, members of 
parliament's salaries if that is the wish, federal-provincial 
relations, the concentration of power in the media, and so on and 
so forth.  These are possible topics for consideration by the 
appropriate committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Diving into the heart of the debate, which is quite interesting, 
I agree with a number of observations made by previous speakers, 
although time does not allow me to be more specific.  Following 
the member from Prince Albert, I will say that in order to engage 
in thorough debate, particularly of estimates, we would need to 
look at our own calendar.  Examining expenditures at length and 
in depth used to be the rule in the House until the late 1960s. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We would also need to change our patterns of attendance in 
Ottawa and probably delete a number of the weeks we are currently 
able to spend in our respective ridings.  We would not be able to 
do some of the things that have been suggested this evening 
without changing our calendar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to what has been said by those who want free votes and 
who have expressed frustration, and this seems to have been 
overlooked this afternoon and this evening, we operate in a party 
system.  We are not a municipal council where it is every man for 
himself and where each person can vote and develop policy on the 
fly, so to speak.  We have party conventions, we have a party 
program at every election, we have party associations, we have 
party caucuses, we have a party leader and there is consistency 
of policy in that respect.  Therefore the vote is determined by 
our party affiliation. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2220"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT101"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT101"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2220

<A HREF="#LINKT100"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That explains why there is party discipline.  It explains why we 
have a party whip.  Sometimes we vote in a manner that we would 
not do if we were freewheeling on a municipal council.  That is 
very true.  However let me add that we can vote against the 
government if we are on the government side. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We can vote against our party leader if we are on the opposition 
side, if we see fit to do so.  It is not a pleasant experience, 
or something one lives with easily afterwards.  However it can be 
done, it has been done and it will be done.  That does not mean 
the system is bad.  It is a party system.  It is not a municipal 
council.  The system requires discipline to move ahead and get 
things done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure every member of the opposition tonight, if they were 
on this side of the House and we were on the other side, would 
come to the same conclusion.  There must be discipline, 
particularly on the part of members of the party in power, in 
order to move ahead and to govern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Standing Order 108(2), committees can be the creators of 
very interesting reports.  Time does not permit me to provide the 
titles of all of them.  A report 20 years ago titled “Equality 
Now” was a great success.  Very recently there was one on 
pesticides.  If there is good will it is possible for a committee 
to determine a topic and produce reports which, if timely, can 
influence the course of action of governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Winnipeg—Transcona made a number of very 
interesting points.  One of them, which I remember clearly, is 
that he urged the House to introduce a measure whereby we would 
debate the ratification of treaties.  He is right.  We must do 
that.  That is a shortcoming that needs to be corrected.  He made 
a number of observations about which I would love to comment in a 
positive sense, but time does not permit me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important that we not lose sight of the role of 
the committee in charge of statutory instruments.  It now has a 
different name but it nevertheless looks at regulations as they 
are drawn from legislation that is passed by parliament.  It is 
an extremely important committee because a tremendous amount of 
power is inherent in regulations when they are written and that 
very often escapes the attention of parliamentarians.  The 
regulations sometimes run in a direction that is not the one 
intended by the legislation from which they are drawn. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important for us, if we are interested in the exercise of 
power, to ensure that committee is properly equipped, properly 
staffed and that it has the resources necessary to examine the 
regulation.  The same applies for public accounts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Someone else has already mentioned the importance of allowing 
Canadians to see the candidates for the election of the Speaker. 
I support that idea fully. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will conclude with the golden rule, which is this.  It is for 
my party, since we are in power.  In changing the rules of the 
House we should not adopt any rule or measure with which we would 
be uncomfortable and of which we would be critical one day when 
we might be, perish the thought, in opposition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bill Blaikie (Winnipeg—Transcona, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member for Davenport said he did not have the time 
to be as positive as he would have liked about some of the things 
I had to say.  I was tempted to get up and give him the time by 
asking him to continue but I did not want to be that 
self-serving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member did speak properly about some of the committees 
that have had a great deal of influence over the years. 
He referred to the committee “Equality Now”, which was a 
special committee of the House.  At the time to which he is 
referring there were a number of special committees of the House. 
There were committees on equality, on the disabled and on 
federal-provincial fiscal arrangements.  I think there was one on 
trade.  A number of special committees were struck for specific 
purposes.  They had limited membership and they produced, not all 
of them but a lot of them, reports that became the basis for 
later policy decisions and policy development.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to reinforce the point the member made because I remember 
being on one such committee myself.  They were called 
parliamentary task forces in the early 1980s.  I was on the one 
for federal-provincial fiscal arrangements in 1981 which, in 
trying to deal with some of the federal-provincial disputes over 
the enforcement of the Medical Care Act, really laid the basis 
for what later became the Canada Health Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another committee which did a lot of good work, and which the 
member and I served on, was the Special Committee on Acid Rain. 
The member may have mentioned it in his speech.  If he did, I 
missed it because I did not hear everything he had to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the member would like more time to reflect on the good 
committee experiences of which he has been part, many of which 
were good because he was part of them, then I afford him the 
opportunity by inviting him to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Charles Caccia:</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are running the 
danger here of becoming a mutual admiration society.  I can only 
say that I appreciate the additions the hon. member for 
Winnipeg-Transcona has made.  Yes, he is quite right, the acid 
rain committee is one that I failed to mention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Trudeau era a number of innovative ideas were introduced. 
Let the blossoms bloom was the spirit of the time.  There was a 
tremendous amount of parliamentary activity, and that could be 
with us in this century, in this decade.  There is no doubt that 
the talents are in this House to permit the flourishing of 
another crop of good initiatives, be they through the standing 
committee or through special committees.  There is not a fixed 
route. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The important thing is to know that under the rules we have, and 
perhaps by improving them, by moving them into the 21st century 
and modernizing them, if you like, or reforming them, to use a 
term the member for Winnipeg-Transcona used in his speech this 
afternoon, we could move toward a very productive parliamentary 
period in which we could eliminate the existing malaise and 
frustration.  We could do so as long as we remember that we 
operate under a party system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Caroline St-Hilaire (Longueuil, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, despite the 
late hour, I will try to keep your attention on the debate on 
Motion No. 3, which reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a special committee of the House be appointed to consider 
and make recommendations on the modernization and improvement of 
the procedures of the House of Commons. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a number of reasons why I find this debate important 
and interesting. 
First, at a time when polls show that a majority of the public 
believe parliament is operating with great difficulty and that 
people are not pleased with how parliamentary business is being 
conducted, we, as parliamentarians, must ask ourselves about the 
current and future effectiveness of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this debate is so important is that the public sees 
parliament as a place of confrontation, rather than a forum 
where its voice must be heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the outside world sees us as voting machines. People 
feel that the government does as it pleases, that it imposes the 
party line when things are too controversial. This, of course, 
generates frustration not only among members of parliament, but 
also among our fellow citizens.

</I></B></P><P align=left>We must always keep in mind two terms that are found in the 
motion, modernization and improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The term modernization means to organize so as to meet current 
needs, and the needs that we must meet are those of our fellow 
citizens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the term improvement, it means to make things better and 
more satisfactory. Again, I believe it is our fellow citizens, 
not the opposition or the government, who must be satisfied. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Any recommendation for modernization or improvement must, in my 
opinion, always be made in the best interests of our fellow 
citizens, so that their voices can be heard through us here in 
this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That said, in recent years there have been a number of reforms. 
The purpose of some of them was to increase the power of the 
government to govern more effectively, and very often this was 
at the expense of the ordinary MPs and watered down their 
powers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of all these reforms was that, while they indeed 
speeded up the legislative work of parliament, they considerably 
reduced the ability of members of parliament to make a personal 
contribution.  Examples of this are the reduction in time 
allocated for private members' business, the increased use of 
time allocation motions, and the time restrictions in question 
period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we need to look at what the government has in mind with 
this parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my opinion, what is desirable is to maintain the balance 
between the government and the opposition parties, the balance 
between the government's right to govern and the right of the 
opposition to oppose it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The objective of the reform should be to enable the entire body 
of MPs to perform their duties rapidly and effectively, and to 
truly play their role as legislators.  Our rules must guarantee 
freedom of debate and protect the rights of all 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, the philosophy of the current government tends 
toward reducing more and more the role of parliamentarians, the 
ordinary MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The time allocation motions imposed by the Liberal government 
are clear evidence of its guillotine philosophy, and this is 
contributing to the decline of the legislative role played by 
MPs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Liberals formed the opposition during the Mulroney 
era, they were fiercely opposed to the government's habit of 
using time allocation, and they spoke out against its abuse of 
power and affront to parliamentary democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, this was what was behind the Liberal party's 
promise, made in its 1993 red book, to give political parties a 
greater opportunity to criticize government bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the time, the Liberals spoke about restoring parliamentary 
integrity by governing with integrity.  The red book said, and I 
quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the House of Commons, a Liberal government will give MPs a 
greater role in drafting legislation— 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the information of the House and of members of the public 
listening this evening, it was in this same section of the red 
book that the Liberals promised to appoint an independent ethics 
counsellor.  We know what happened.  They voted against their 
own promise.  It is this kind of attitude, this rigid party 
line, that is causing citizens to lose interest in what we do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to time allocation motions, this measure which was 
supposed to be the exception has now become the rule.  Since 
coming to power, the Liberals have not changed the way things 
are done one bit.  On the contrary, the situation has become 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since time allocation was added to the standing orders, and 
despite its strong opposition to it during the Progressive 
Conservatives' term of office, the Liberal government is the 
government that has used it the most. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, now, in greater detail are certain recommendations I wish 
to make to the committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My first recommendation concerns time allocation motions.  I 
have spoken of them, of course, but I stress the point, because 
they must be used as a last resort, not just after a few hours' 
debate and, most important, the Chair must intervene more to 
prevent the government from making excessive use of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My second recommendation concerns the electronic vote.  It is, 
in my opinion, high time it was considered.  Of course, the 
votes have to be taken here in this House according to the will 
of members of parliament, who will want votes to be taken by 
recorded division in some instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My third recommendation concerns electronic petitions, which we 
must consider too.  In fact, we must remember that we are living 
in a modern world and that parliament must reflect this fact.

<A HREF="#LINKT103"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>A fourth recommendation concerns private members' bills. 
Despite what I heard from the government House leader a little 
earlier, they should all be votable, as should the motions for 
emergency debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, it would be a good idea to amend the schedule of House 
proceedings so that routine proceedings occurs always at the 
opening of the sitting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The success of parliamentary reform lies in the political will 
of the government to improve things. 
However, reforms of the past have taught us that, as a general 
rule, the government is much more inclined to make changes 
favourable to it and ones that do not limit its ability to act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the point of advocating reform of parliamentary 
procedure if there is no political will to adopt it? What is the 
point of advocating reform of parliamentary procedure if the 
government opposes any change that will put it at a 
disadvantage?  What is the point of advocating reform of 
parliamentary procedure if the Liberal majority is not prepared 
to do without the procedural tools that give it so much 
latitude? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, parliament must be modern, open and more 
democratic. While the majority prevails, the minority must 
be given the right to oppose and to express.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentery Secretary to Minister of Public 
Woks and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
am pleased to participate in the debate concerning the new 
committee on modernization of parliament or, as some would refer 
to it, reform of parliament.  I had the opportunity earlier to 
participate to some extent through questions and comments, but I 
want to take this opportunity to better frame a particular area, 
that being private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a member of parliament since 1993, one of the things that 
really is very clear to me, and I suspect to most members, is 
that listening to speeches is okay, but the questions and 
comments, whether it be in the House or at committees, provide 
the most stimulating activity for members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also aware that in parliamentary tradition it is 
inappropriate for a member of parliament to actually read a 
speech.  How many times have we seen the top of a member's head 
as he or she continues to read a speech?  I am aware that members 
can certainly refer to notes where they are quoting or where 
there perhaps was some detail that would be appropriate to ensure 
accuracy on the record. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the following are the types of things I have heard 
through this debate today.  Members are seeking out ways to 
ensure that the quality of debate in the House is improved, to 
ensure that opportunities for members to participate are improved 
and to ensure that we are making the best use of our time.  I 
know most members would admit that there is not enough time to do 
all the work that we really would like to do and are asked to do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I only have 10 minutes to speak—and I do appreciate the 
opportunity—I would like to move on to private members' 
business, which to me represents an important opportunity for 
backbench members of parliament to express themselves in terms of 
the quality of their thinking and in terms of their opportunities 
to advance issues and possibly even effect legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1993 when I was elected, private members' business has 
been an important aspect of my work.  I have had the opportunity 
to present to the House some 20 or 25 private members' bills or 
motions.  That has allowed me to get very familiar with the 
process we must go through.  Quite frankly, I believe we can do 
better. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most members know that the process of a lottery and going 
through a committee that has deliberations in camera to determine 
votability means that the possibility of a private member's item 
getting through, whether it be a bill or a motion, is actually 
quite limited. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On top of that, in my experience there have been other things 
that have concerned me. 
For instance, at one time there was a substantial amount of 
concern about the stretching of the resources available to 
members for research purposes.  Yet it was also disclosed at the 
same time that the research personnel and the legal people were 
being asked to do a lot of work on proposed bills by members, and 
a large number of these bills were never introduced in the House. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2240"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT105"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2240
<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The cost of that is very exceptional in terms of monetary value, 
but it is also significant in terms of utilizing resources that 
other members could make use of.  I would hope that the committee 
would address the issue of the drafting of bills, the utilizing 
of resources and the commitments that members make to follow 
through and at least introduce those bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also raise it because of another incident that happened to me. 
An opportunity to reintroduce in the 36th parliament a matter I 
had before the 35th parliament was denied to me because another 
member had put that item in before I did.  When we carry that to 
its logical extension, we can see that it would be very easy for 
a particular member to put in dozens of bills on issues which 
possibly were not his or her own.  The fact that the member 
submitted them for drafting purposes means that all other members 
would be restricted from having a same or similar bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That seems to be a pre-emptive move on behalf of members, to not 
only be able to take another member's issue away from him, but 
also to restrict other members from being able to do a very good 
job on an issue that another member has no intention of ever 
bringing through.  That problem has to be dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of being in the House of Commons, whether it 
be on a Monday morning or after government orders on Tuesday 
through Friday, for private members' business.  Members know that 
speakers for private members' business are generally arranged in 
advance, although they do follow a party distribution for 
speakers.  However, other members who have House duty and who 
must be here have no recourse but to sit on their hands and 
listen to debate by other members on issues which may be of 
interest to them.  They cannot say anything.  They cannot rise on 
questions or comments.  All they can do is listen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems like a contradiction in terms to say that we call that 
debate in this place when in fact debate is not really taking 
place.  It is a linear situation.  Debate in this place should be 
interactive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier today I asked a question of the member for 
Winnipeg—Transcona.  I am not as learned as he is on some of the 
issues and I gave it my best shot.  He answered with a couple of 
things that I thought maybe indicated a small misunderstanding of 
my question or my intent, but I did not have an opportunity to 
rebut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The question is whether members in committee find that the 
questions and comments of witnesses, or among committee members 
when dealing with committee in camera business, are more 
effective or constructive when there is more than one question, 
more than one comment and an opportunity for rebuttal?  Today I 
would have appreciated an opportunity to come back with a second 
question or a rebuttal statement to the issues.  Maybe, just 
maybe, we should consider whether or not we are going to 
reinstitute debate in this place.  By debate I do not mean 
speeches that people have not read beforehand because they have 
been provided by someone else, but debate where people have an 
opportunity for rebuttal and debate where we respect people's 
time by not being redundant in the speeches.  That could go a 
long way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The final item regarding private members' business that I would 
like to remind the committee of, because this is my opportunity 
to have input, is that there are on the order paper now about 140 
private members' bills.  Many of those bills are on the order 
paper on behalf of a member of parliament and that member of 
parliament has no possibility of having all of those bills dealt 
with in the current session or in this parliament.

<A HREF="#LINKT105"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is sensible to me that there should be some reasonable limit 
on the number of items that members could put on the table unless 
they are prepared to withdraw something to put something else on. 
If members come up with 100 bills so that they can include in a 
piece of literature that they introduced that many bills at first 
reading, I am not sure whether or not it is a good utilization of 
the resources of the House or good utilization of a member's 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to private members' business and as part of 
parliamentary reform, we are looking at trying to improve the 
ability of all members of parliament to participate in a variety 
of ways to make good use of their time.  We are looking at ways 
to give them ample opportunity to express their views and to 
allow them to leave their fingerprints on this place.  We all 
know that this is not a forever position.  I am somewhat 
concerned about other issues that I will not have time to get 
into, but this is a good starting point. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard a lot of talk about reform with regard to the 
standing orders.  The government House leader raised some issues 
which the committee will have a opportunity to come to consensus 
on.  If this is a successful venture, it may be the starting 
point for more expansive reform which all members of parliament 
would support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member on his remarks.  I know he 
has been very active in the debate and follows it with a great 
deal of interest and sincerity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to him is with respect to private members' business. 
He spoke of a system where members might be free to remove 
certain bills.  Would he also like to see a system where members 
might be free to exchange bills between one another if the 
occasion arose? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Something that has been broadly discussed throughout the evening 
is having all private member's bills deemed votable so that there 
would be an expression of the entire House when the bills came 
before us.  This would attach some particular significance to 
bills.  Would the hon. member comment on that? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the first item 
my colleague raised.  I would also like to respond to his 
question about making all bills votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a conversation earlier with the leader of his party about 
good faith.  We talked about all hon. members wanting to do good 
things.  If we presume that members are here in good faith to do 
a good job, it would be easy to accept all matters as being 
votable. However our recent history shows that when things go 
wrong or get a little tight, people look for ways to be 
disruptive or to delay issues, et cetera.  I agree with the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona that delay is part of the 
democratic process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's presumption would have to be that members would not 
abuse the opportunity and would not be frivolous in bringing 
items forward.  I would much prefer that private members' items 
would have to qualify under the existing and maybe even stricter 
basic criteria so that they would not be dealt with at all if 
they had been previously dealt with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now many bills and motions come forward which are very 
close to being the same but are a bit different.  People who 
draft legislation say that if they change a couple of words in a 
bill it can come forward.  If the issue has been dealt with in 
the House already there are also ways to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a compromise, I suggest that if a member is prepared to go 
through whatever process is involved to get his or her bill 
before the House, is prepared to give his or her presentation on 
the merits of the bill and be subjected to scrutiny and 
questioning by members of the House, there could be a preliminary 
vote to determine whether the House has sufficient interest in 
the matter going any further.

<A HREF="#LINKT106"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would deal with the problem of making everything votable. 
It would have to be three hours and the number of members on it 
would be restricted.  There is an equal disincentive or negative 
if we have ten excellent bills before the committee but only five 
could be picked to be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member is quite right.  The private members' issue has many 
opportunities.  We can already do swapping.  The House has done 
that in the past with consent.  There are ways that can work but 
the problem areas to address have to do with efficiency, equity, 
fairness and transparency.  Right now we do not meet all the 
tests. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson (Crowfoot, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I rise to speak in favour of parliamentary and 
democratic reform.  It is not the first time in the past six 
months that we have spoken to parliamentary reform.  We have 
spoken about it a lot. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the last general election we probably held close to 25 or 30 
forums and public meetings where we spoke about issues such as 
agriculture, fiscal responsibility and judicial reform.  More 
than anything else we spoke about parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spoke about the need to see certain reforms in the Senate. We 
want to see an equal Senate.  We want to see a Senate that is 
effective and is elected.  We talked a great deal about that in 
the constituency of Crowfoot.  We spoke about free votes.  The 
member for Yellowhead so eloquently this evening showed us the 
need for free votes.  I agree with his words. We spoke about 
referenda, about recall and about citizen initiatives.  All these 
things are fundamental to the parliamentary reform we would like 
to see. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tonight we come to the House to discuss parliamentary reform. We 
are talking about different minor things that can change in 
certain technical aspects of bringing bills forward.  They are 
probably things that are very important.  We are talking about 
using notes or not using notes.  In the past two months I have 
been here I have heard a lot of people give speeches where they 
should have used notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I want to speak about parliamentary reform.  There is a 
country that understands parliamentary reform, a country with a 
population of less than seven million, with very few natural 
resources.  It has a harsh climate and 25% of its land mass is 
covered by mountains.  It has four official languages, many 
ethnic subgroups, and large regional economic disparities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One would think such a country would be riddled with economic 
and social strife, division and troubles, but nothing could be 
further from the truth.  The country has had the highest standard 
of living of any other country over the last 50 years. Never has 
the country experienced more than 1.5% unemployment. Inflation is 
never higher than 4% and interest rates are always close to 6%. 
It has an extensive high quality health care, an excellent 
education system, generous social services which I might add are 
truly for the needy, and a social service program that looks 
after those who are handicapped and in need.  The country has a 
world class transportation system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In proportion to population the country has the smallest civil 
service in Europe, the lowest tax rates and the smallest national 
budget.  Why does the country enjoy such economic and social 
success?  It is because Switzerland has a recipe for success. The 
ingredient for success is called true democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Swiss truly have government of the people, by the people and 
for the people.  Power is literally in the hands of the people, a 
concept that for far too long has escaped the imagination of 
those who sit in power here and run this country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in Canada have government of the politicians, by the 
politicians and for the politicians.  It is time for change. We 
in Canada have top down rule.  The tendency of this and previous 
governments has been to increase their own power by employing 
closed door policies.  Only an exclusive few, the cabinet, the 
executive of government and those influenced by special interest 
groups and lobby groups, are the ones that come together to 
decide policies and programs in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian citizens have effectively been excluded from 
participating in a forum that decides how their daily lives will 
be conducted and affected.  Effective communication between 
citizens and their elected representatives has been cut off. 
Politicians are no longer accountable to the electorate on a day 
by day basis.  Rather than thinking of gaining public confidence 
through listening and accommodating public concerns, elected 
officials have spent their time selling their government programs 
and legislation to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen that in the last week.  We have seen farm groups 
and agricultural people who have come together to say that the 
programs the government has put forward are insufficient. The 
response of the government is to come out with hundreds of 
thousand dollar advertising campaigns selling their programs back 
to the people of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Rather than representing their constituents in Ottawa, our 
federally elected officials are representing Ottawa back home to 
their constituencies.  My colleagues on this side of the House 
and I are committed to changing this sad fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked about throughout the last general election.  We are 
committed to changing the autocratic means of decision making by 
restoring power to the rightful owners, the people.  Individuals 
on the other side of the House are chuckling at the novel idea 
that we would actually give people power in terms of programs and 
representation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my colleague speaking before me provided many 
recommendations on modernizing and improving the procedures of 
the House for the special committee to consider, I would like to 
briefly speak about an Alliance recommendation for improving 
democracy and it is recall.  Recall, a procedure that allows the 
voters to call their representatives to account before the end of 
their term, is but one step in many to putting power back into 
the hands of the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not know of any other job in Canada that will not allow the 
removal of a person from the job for improper conduct or for not 
doing his or her job, except for the positions occupied by 
politicians.  We on this side of the House believe the people of 
Canada should have the right to fire the people that they have 
hired. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As it stands now, elected officials cannot be fired by the very 
people who hired them, except at election time.  This leaves the 
impression that politicians are above the rules and the 
regulations that govern the average Canadian worker.  Allowing an 
elected official immunity for misconduct or incompetence is an 
absurdity that is added to the current level of political apathy 
as witnessed in the last federal election when only 51% of the 
electorate decided it was really worth coming out to vote. Author 
William Mishler says: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Political attitudes and behaviour are learned.  The political 
apathy and inactivity characteristic of large segments of the 
Canadian public are not intrinsic to man's basic nature.  They 
are neither inevitable nor immutable.  The decision to 
participate in or abstain from politics is to a substantial 
degree a conditioned response to the political environment. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our political system has bred the attitude that the government 
does not care what the people think or what the people want. 
Those elected to parliament have lost touch with the people.  The 
political environment has produced a nation of cynics who hold 
politicians in contempt.  Recall would force elected 
representatives to open the doors of communication with their 
constituents, thereby enhancing the dialogue between them, a 
dialogue that lies at the core of the representative process. 
Recall would also help restore mutual respect between the 
electorate and the politicians.  It would put in place the 
cheques and balances to remove the monopoly of power held by 
parliament.

to the wishes of their constituents not according to party line. 
We saw some of that on legislation that was been highly 
contentious, such as same sex benefits and firearm laws. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Swiss know that if democracy is to be meaningful, it has to 
be a bottom-up system of popular or grassroots government.  The 
Swiss have had a system of initiative, referendum and recall 
since 1874.  The value of this process is seen in the prosperity 
of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The official opposition encourages the use of national 
referendums to give Canadians the opportunity to voice their 
opinions on issues of a moral or contentious nature.  If all 
members of the House believed in democracy, if they truly 
believed that the majority ruled in this country, they too would 
support the use of national referendums.  They would support the 
establishment of a special house committee, as recommended today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to move forward in the House of Commons.  We need to 
move forward in a positive way, where the people would feel that 
they had better representation, that when they sent their member 
to Ottawa or to parliament he or she would speak their wishes. We 
can do that through taking a very comprehensive look at what 
parliamentary reform means.  I suggest that we have heard far too 
much of what it does not mean.  It is time to look at changing a 
system that is sadly in need of repair.

Speaker, I was interested to hear the member's comments, 
especially when he spoke about this subject of recall.  I am not 
sure what the member is thinking and how this would be triggered, 
because we have heard this before. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of his own members, as we all know, got himself into some 
difficulty this week.  That would be the member for 
Edmonton—Strathcona.  What would trigger that recall back home, 
for example, in Edmonton—Strathcona? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We might even take the example of the member for Edmonton North, 
who came into this House raging against pensions, then swallowed 
herself completely whole on that issue and is now a pensionable 
member of this House.  She railed against it in the 1993 
election, in the 1997 election and in the 2000 election, until 
she entered the House well after the election and completely 
reversed her position.  Basically she has violated the very 
people who elected her. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say those people would be subject to recall, if I am 
listening to the member correctly.  What are the rules of the 
game?  The only thing I agree with is the best recall in the 
world is an election every four years, where people can measure 
over that four year period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the cost to the voter.  If the member is serious 
in what he is saying, two of his members should leave this 
Chamber almost immediately if an election were held back in the 
ridings today.  Maybe Rick Mercer on <I>This House Has 22 
Minutes</I> can do a better job on this issue than we could. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Remember the difficulty his own leader got himself into in the 
election on an ill-thought out plan, in terms of referendum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a road that the populace have gone done for years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In all fairness to all members, we have to measured over 
something more than a month or two months. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other issue is that many of us come into this House elected 
with a good strong vote.  It is what we call a plurality not a 
majority.  For example, in the last election I won by something 
in the order of 6,000 votes.  That was about 49% of the vote in 
my riding.  It means, by definition, that 51% of the people back 
in my riding did not vote for me. 
That applies to at least 50% to 60% of the members in the House 
now with five and six parties running elected by plurality.  Has 
the member really thought through this issue to its ultimate 
conclusion?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Kevin Sorenson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  I honestly knew that that one was coming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that when we have policy that it is policy we stand on 
in the good times and in the bad times.  It is policy of which we 
can be proud.  It is policy that brings what we would call, and 
what perhaps is not understood in the House, accountability to 
every to every member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On this side we have a book that we like to term required 
reading.  It is called <I>On the Take</I>.  If the hon. member has 
not read it I would suggest he read it.  It is excellent evening 
reading.  In that book he will find countless examples in 1993 
and before 1993.  It reminds me of Erik Nielsen and his many 
concerns with the old Progressive Conservative times.  He 
absolutely felt betrayed.  He felt that those people should step 
down and move aside. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had another former leader from that party who got himself 
into some difficulty.  I think he spoke to a judge at the time. 
There are examples on every side of the House.  It would bring 
accountability back to this place.  All parties need it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am quite proud of our referendum that the member was referring 
to.  In areas of contentious debate, where issues have been 
brought forward, far too often we watched the Liberal government 
members stand up like puppets, look at their the Prime Minister 
and vote the way the he told them to vote.  The people back home 
said that was not the reason that they sent their member to 
Ottawa.  They sent the member to Ottawa to represent them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There were people in the back rows on the government side with 
tears in their eyes who they voted for the gun law when they knew 
that their constituents were against it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have seen this so many countless times on all sides of the 
House.  It is time we look at a policy that would bring 
accountability back to each member.  I am proud to stand here and 
say that this party believes in accountability.  We believe in 
recall.  We look forward to parliamentary reform with some 
substance and not the meandering kind that we have seen brought 
forward here tonight. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
it is certainly an honour to speak tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I came to the House of Commons as a student.  I was trying to 
understand how the country governed itself.  The way I understood 
it was national sovereignty was before us.  I must say the member 
for Davenport is a member of the party structure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I came in 1997, there was a speech by the then leader of 
the official opposition.  He announced his intentions today to 
resign and move on.  However he left a mark on me.  He said that 
this place was like a vessel, and we had a captain that guided 
this vessel on its journey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at national sovereignty and our place in this 
country as symbols.  If we look at this vessel, it came from a 
British parliamentary structure.  A depth of tradition came with 
this building.  All these materials, structures and design came 
from an honourable and noble intent.  It is to govern the people 
and their lands. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring with me here today two books.  The first book is the 
entitled “League of the Iroquois Confederacy”.  I spoke earlier 
this week on this.  It is very fortunate, Mr. Speaker, you are 
the one who was receiving the speech on Monday when I delivered 
it.  This existed before this building.

<A HREF="#LINKT110"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The governance of this land is in these words.  It is a story of 
the Iroquois confederacy on these shores.  It tells the story of 
aboriginal people living in harmony among one another and 
debating issues of the day for their survival on the land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second book is the treaties that the crown of Britain wrote 
with the aboriginal people.  All the numbered treaties are found 
in here.  That is what made the sovereignty of Canada.  These two 
stories created the story of our country.  Today we have to 
debate today where are we taking our children with the wisdom of 
our elders, with the wisdom of our treasured homelands and our 
connection to the land?  That is what makes our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We cannot create this out on the ocean.  This is created because 
of the territories, what we call North America.  It is called 
turtle island in many stories.  I look at it as a river system. 
Look at the basin of the mighty St. Lawrence River system, the 
Churchill River and the Hudson Bay, the Mackenzie, the Fraser and 
the Yukon river systems.  That is a vast tract of land.  How do 
we govern it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the big challenge we have before us in parliament.  How 
do we capture the vision of a nation, identify its goals and 
implement them?  This is our challenge as parliamentarians in 
this place and as parliamentarians in the other place, which we 
call the Senate.  In my view, that is the house of elders.  It 
plays a very honourable role in the tradition of the aboriginal 
people and in the tradition of the Westminster houses. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we have parliamentary structures and legislatures in the 
provinces, which came later.  How we relate to them is very 
crucial.  Last night the estimates were approved.   A lot of the 
finances are given to the treasuries of the provinces.  We enact 
them into the local and the municipal governments, the schools, 
health and the libraries.  They are all connected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is what sustainable development is about.  It is a belief 
that we can look at the resources, the land, the environment, the 
means, the food and the water of our people, our land and our 
nation.  We balance it with our thoughts of the people, the 
culture, the knowledge, the wisdom and the languages.  For many 
people all over the world Canada is their home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then there is the economy and money.  I still cannot believe 
where money comes from sometimes.  It is a means of transaction 
that exists today in the world.  At some point in time there were 
beavers piled up at Hudson Bay stores, which were used to 
purchase muskets, food, lard and bacon.  Today it is plastic 
cards in people's back pockets.  These are used for transactions 
and commerce. Three-quarters of our laws are based on commerce. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole context of a remarkable civil organization is 
required.  What do those three words mean?  It means we left our 
mark here and we were civil.  This is an organization.  A degree 
of influence is expected of us by our constituents, the people 
that we speak for.  We leave our marks in words and in gestures. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This whole challenge of restructure is a happy time.  I 
witnessed candour here that is very seldom seen between the 
member for Winnipeg—Transcona, a very noble statesman, heaped in 
the history of the House, and the member for Davenport.  The 
candour that took place between the two members is rarely seen in 
the House and it should be exemplified.  We should have a sense 
of humour, we should have a sense of appreciation of what we are 
trying to do, and we should support each other for what we 
believe in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Look at this building.  It is square.  We are meant to fight. 
They fight us, we fight them for this country.  Why?  We have 
cultures.  I have French blood in me.  I may also have English 
blood in me but I know I have Cree.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aboriginal person, I see it in a different light as well. 
I see that we need to bring that strength from this journey.  As 
this vessel continues, we need to bring all our peoples together. 
This is the time.  This is the challenge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House of Commons, as we call it, is a place that represents 
every corner of Canada.  Every person, every neighbourhood and 
every house should be represented here, every kitchen table.  We 
bring our thoughts and our ideas here and then we have the 
ability to research.  The parliamentary library is heaped with 
research materials.  If we have an idea, a specific challenge or 
a question, people will guide us.  In order us to make solid 
decisions we need the research service, the committee work that 
is done and the documentation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must thank the committee chairs who guided me in the previous 
parliament.  They showed me that we can all work together for a 
common purpose and that we can challenge each other. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The work of the MP is unfinished.  I would love to see a house 
of representation of this House.  Let us say that the 
Saskatchewan legislature has 200 seats.  Why could we not some 
day send representatives of our House to the Saskatchewan 
legislature, Quebec's national assembly or the Ontario 
legislature as Queen's Park in Toronto to debate the issues?  Why 
could we not move around?  This country is huge.  We should not 
try to govern ourselves like an island like England.  We are not 
an island that big.  We are huge.  We have to expand ourselves to 
the reality of this country.  That is why I beg for 
restructuring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look in a respectful way to a new relationship with each 
other.  Maybe the library, as the sacred symbol of our unity, 
should be a third House.  Maybe representatives of the original 
signatories of the treaties of the aboriginal nations should be 
allowed to sit in parliament and guide this country.  Maybe they 
should hold the sacred responsibility of sustainable development 
in the future.  While we would manage the affairs of the day to 
day issues, somebody would be taking care of the long term cycle 
of the breathing, living organism we call Mother Earth, and this 
country, Canada, is responsible for a big piece of Mother Earth. 
I challenge Canada to take that responsibility to heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish all parliamentarians well.  I recognize all the people 
who have taken their seats here and the history that is heaped 
behind us.  Let us not forget it as we challenge the future. 
<P><A NAME="LINK237"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, as a new 
member, I had not planned to speak tonight.  I had planned to 
just listen to the wisdom of others.  However my colleague 
brought in such new dimensions of interest that I would just like 
him to go on a bit further. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The advantage of our pluralistic society is that there are other 
systems that give us wisdom and knowledge.  There is nothing to 
say that our system has everything right, and I think we can 
learn from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a former president of Skookum Jim Friendship Centre, I was 
quite interested in the comments of my colleague.  I would like 
him to elaborate on a couple of areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the six first nations of Iroquois were originally warring 
among themselves and then they came together and organized a 
system of government, they often took longer to make decisions 
than we do today.  It was a different form of decision making 
that could also have its benefits. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. member could comment on whether that system 
of government or the systems of government of other first nations 
in Canada, through the clan systems or through consensus decision 
making, may have some type of models that we may incorporate in 
some of the systems that we use here in the House of Commons.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, at the outset I think I 
said I was a student.  A study to understand the whole concept of 
structure and symbolism must be looked at by this committee.  If 
we are going to strike a committee we must look at the basic 
structures and the purpose for those structures, such as why the 
House is designed this way.  We have to look at those basic 
needs.  We have a huge budget to renovate everything on this 
Hill, so we can afford to exercise exercise some wisdom and maybe 
some adventure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think the symbol of a circle is sacred.  It is unity.  The 
country needs unity in a big way.  We have to unite our 
communities and unite the country for the sake of our future. 
This building is not designed for unity.  It is designed to be 
adversarial.  We are designed not to get along.  We are two sword 
lengths away.  We are like little kids who do not want to hurt 
themselves.  We need to become a unified force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The territorial legislature of the Yukon transferred a new 
design to the Northwest Territories and now Nunavut called the 
new territorial governance legislature.  It designed a consensual 
form where everyone is elected with no party structure.  The 
Yukon is a little different, but in the other two territories we 
all get elected as members representing our ridings and then we 
decide who will be the government and the executive.  Maybe that 
is a challenge here.  Maybe this executive that is elected here 
should be accountable to the majority of the House.  Maybe that is 
where we should go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we should look at the symbol of a circle.  We have a 
sacred symbol in the parliamentary library.  It survived the fire 
of 1916.  Let us use it to keep the country together by putting 
it in its rightful place with the rightful history, from the 
Iroquois and all the nations of this country that existed here 
before.  If we put things in their rightful place, we will have 
the right provisions in our vessel to make that journey into the 
millenniums to come.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Neigette-et-la Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, in spite of the somewhat late hour, I am pleased to 
take part in the debate on Motion No. 3, tabled by the government 
House leader. The purpose of this motion is to create a special 
committee of the House to consider and make recommendations on 
the modernization and improvement of the procedures of the House 
of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion deals, among other things, with the committee's 
membership and powers, the unanimous agreement of its members on 
the report to be submitted to the House, and its power to make 
recommendations. The motion also provides that the committee 
shall present its report no later than Friday, June 1, 2001. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From the outset, I want to insist on the terms modernization 
and improvement. I hope these two terms will have the same 
meaning for all committee members, otherwise the unanimity rule 
might prevent us from having a parliament that operates like a 
parliament should in the 21st century. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois believes that any change to the standing 
orders should be made for the purpose of improving a democracy 
that can always be improved. These changes must be based on 
principles designed to promote useful and constructive debates, 
in a flexible framework where democracy takes precedence over 
everything else, and where no one is the possessor of the 
absolute truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At last we can say what changes we would like to see to the 
standing orders that govern Canada's democratic life. We must 
face a new reality and organize our parliamentary business 
accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has long had a biparty system. Sure, a third party would 
sometimes manage to make its way into the House of Commons, but 
the situation recently changed. Since the creation of the Bloc 
Quebecois and the Reform Party, which became the Canadian 
Alliance some months ago, regional Canada has made its way here. 
Opposition parties in the House of Commons have represented and 
continue to represent at least 60% of voters.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, unfortunately, the course of parliamentary proceedings 
does not reflect this situation.  In addition, it would appear 
that, for many members, something has to be done to save 
democracy largely compromised in the present context. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The changes sought must permit healthy debate and a constructive 
exchange of ideas in a flexible context where democracy holds 
sway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our parliamentary organization, the party winning the most 
seats forms the government and manages the affairs of state. The 
opposition, for its part, acts as watchdog to ensure public 
affairs are managed fairly and democratically. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government majority should not use its plurality of seats to 
impose the initiatives it is proposing every time the 
opportunity arises. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us take the example of government bills.  At second reading, 
each party expresses its opinion with respect to the bill under 
study and announces the broad lines of the changes it would like 
to make to the said bill.  When the bill is referred to a 
standing committee for study, the members hear public officials 
and witnesses, if necessary, before proceeding to clause by 
clause study of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I must regretfully inform the House that this whole operation is, in 
most instances, totally useless.  The debates are wasted. 
The amendments proposed are very rarely incorporated, although 
in many cases they would improve bills so they would 
benefit the greatest possible number of people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must not lose sight of the fact that the role of the 
opposition is to ensure that the legislation passed by 
parliament serves the public, and that the exercise of power by 
the government does not become a despotic tool for and by a 
minority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no denying that, since my arrival in the House of 
Commons, amendments to the standing orders, along with the 
Liberal Party's way of doing things, are far from advancing the 
cause of democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Time allocation motions pursuant to Standing Order 78, which are 
commonly referred to as gag orders, should be exceptional 
measures used as a last resort. 
It is good for parliamentarians to take the necessary time to 
discuss bills introduced in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the government does not want the media and the public to 
realize that a bill being debated poses a problem.  So gag 
orders have become the norm and the government regularly invokes 
them, because people must be objective enough to recognize that, 
in fact, this is the main tool the government has for limiting 
debate and the opposition's right to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Before putting a time allocation motion to a vote in the House 
of Commons, the Speaker should make sure that the motion does 
not constitute an abuse of House procedure. 
To help him reach a decision, the minister sponsoring a bill 
affected by a time allocation motion should come before the 
House and take part in a question and comment period not to 
exceed 60 minutes in length, in order to justify why the time 
allocation is worthwhile, if not actually necessary.  It must be 
kept in mind that this government has made excessive use of this 
standing order since 1993, and the practice has become 
commonplace. The government majority ought not to fear such a 
measure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is regrettable that the government got Motion No. 2 passed 
this last February 27, for that motion is totally anti-democratic 
in character and gives the government effective control over the 
opposition.  In fact, the government has given the Chair a power 
that is totally subjective, for it will henceforth be the one to 
decide on such things as whether an amendment is frivolous or 
too repetitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition is therefore losing a basic tool for improving 
bills.  Its ability to do so is reduced to a bare minimum.  This 
motion muzzles the opposition parties and limits them to a flat 
and toothless debate.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Moving on to another issue, in the early summer of 2000, I had 
the opportunity to travel to the United States, along with the 
House leaders of the various political parties present in this 
House, to observe the organization of the electronic voting 
carried out in Washington and Boston, among other places.  When 
I realize that electronic voting has been in use for more than 
30 years by our neighbours to the south, I tell myself just how 
far behind we are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government House leader would have served democracy better 
if he had shown some up to date thinking and proposed a way of 
speeding up votes, instead of acting as a big bully with his 
Motion No. 2 with just one object: limiting the introduction of 
amendments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The system in place in Boston keeps the significance of the vote 
and the responsibility of the politicians intact. It is even 
better than the system we use in the House when we want to speed 
up the voting process and ask our whips to rise and indicate how 
their party will vote. I do not doubt that, should electronic 
voting become a reality here, the Board of Internal Economy 
would ensure that such a system is absolutely reliable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also important to preserve the unique character of 
opposition days by providing that the motion that is debated 
cannot be amended by the party that proposed it. Therefore, 
Standing Order 85 should be amended accordingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the Speaker authorizes an emergency debate under Standing 
Order 52, the motion debated should always be voted on, for 
reasons of transparency and democracy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If it is deemed that a debate must urgently be held, then it is 
appropriate that parliamentarians vote on that urgent matter. 
The debate would then have a much greater significance than it 
currently does. The criteria to help the Chair rule on the 
admissibility of such a request should be made more flexible to 
allow more of these debates. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No changes to the standing orders should result in a reduction 
of the time given to members of parliament when reviewing 
government bills at second and third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The role of members of parliament is already quite watered down 
and must not be reduced even more with the introduction of 
measures that would allow, for example, the drafting of bills 
following the tabling of a petition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There would be many other points to mention or discuss. But 
unfortunately my time is up. I do hope that this debate will 
have a happy ending, that it will lead to transparency and a 
greater desire to promote and increase the participation of 
elected members to the democratic life of our parliament.

we see the technological change that is happening in our age.  It 
is like what the hon. member said before about the hare and the 
turtle.  There is the speed of the outside world while we are 
going as slow as molasses.  However, we are taking sure steps on 
some careful decisions that we have to make here. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the hon. member this:  what vision does she see in terms 
of leaving a mark from this time on?  We have our system of 
Houses, our parliamentary structure now.  What should we leave 
behind to keep the country vital for future generations? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay:</B> Mr. Speaker, now there is an extremely 
interesting question.  We have entered the 21st century, but we 
have brought all our old culture along with us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier, I heard the hon. member's speech, and I watched the 
opening of the new parliament in Nunavut on television.  I 
realized that their culture and organization were completely 
different from ours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder to what extent we would be capable, for instance, of 
simply transforming this chamber into a semicircle. 
How would we justify such an action?  We would certainly have to 
have a different vision of politics.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is often said that there should perhaps be a different 
approach to politics, that the confrontation and violence should 
be reduced, and that we should work more for the common good. 
This certainly bears some thinking about.  Although the 
committee does not have a lot of time, I hope we will be 
able to see evidence of this concern and that we will be allowed to 
give careful thought to what we want to become as 
parliamentarians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that each and every one of us was elected to 
represent the public. 
We belong to a political party but, once elected, our job is to 
represent all our constituents.  The 301 members of parliament 
represent the 30 million people in Canada, without exception. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously, a major change could be made by trying to come up 
with procedures that would allow us to work together, around a 
table, developing a bill for the betterment of our community, 
rather than having an authoritarian, majority government which 
thinks it has all the answers, which has its own way of looking 
at things, and which is completely insensitive to how opposition 
members might see them, even though we represent, this time 
around anyway, 60% of Canadian voters.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman (Surrey North, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, it has been a long day, and I appreciate the opportunity 
to speak on this very important issue of parliamentary reform. It 
is the backbenchers who are most affected by the way this place 
has been operating in the past while. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact that we are debating this issue at all is, I believe, a 
strong indication of the frustration that we are facing in 
attempting to represent our constituents in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an effort to place my individual concerns on the record, I 
would like to take a few moments to outline how I have been 
personally affected by what has been going on over the past few 
years while I have had the fortune and the honour to represent 
the constituency of Surrey North. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A couple of years ago, in carrying out my parliamentary duties 
and my responsibilities, I was developing a number of amendments 
to a government bill.  It was my understanding that I was working 
with the staff of the House of Commons in a confidential manner 
in an effort to bring forth proposed amendments and changes to a 
government initiative concerning its youth criminal justice law. 
I found it more than a little disconcerting to discover that the 
clerk of the Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights was 
in possession of my amendments prior to my submitting them to the 
committee for consideration. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I immediately embarked on a question of privilege in this place. 
To make a long story short, it appears that there had been a 
restructuring within the organization of the people whose 
considerable expertise and valuable assistance we rely on to do 
our jobs.  I also note that after much debate and deliberation 
the Speaker at the time ruled that my privileges were not harmed 
by what had occurred. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government side explained that the restructuring was 
necessary to enhance and promote the team concept of providing 
assistance to members of parliament.  Let me be clear that I 
certainly do not question the Speaker's ruling, as he could only 
decide on the basis of the information that was provided to him 
at that time.  I would be remiss if I did not add that there was 
subsequently quite an extensive debate and investigation by the 
procedural and House affairs committee into this operational 
change that had occurred without the consent or knowledge of the 
members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also note that while everyone involved in the decision making 
finally decided that nothing was wrong and the members of this 
place were not disadvantaged by the change, we have since 
reverted to our former status quo.  In short, although it was 
decided that nothing was broken, we decided to fix it anyway. It 
is my understanding that now when I as a member employ 
legislative counsel to draft proposed amendments, those 
amendments will no longer be placed on a database for numerous 
employees to use and potentially abuse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The listener may well question these comments.  One could 
wonder, I suppose, just why I am raising the issue when 
everything is back to normal and the battle appears to have been 
won.  My concern is that what should have been a fairly 
straightforward example of breach of confidentiality of 
lawyer-client privilege was never formally recognized as such. 
Politics had come into play.  The government, the ultimate 
controller of the staff in this place, refused to accept that 
harm had occurred and refused to hold anyone accountable for that 
harm.

<A HREF="#LINKT116"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had a manager within this institution who unilaterally 
changed the operation of the solicitor-client relationship 
between a member of parliament and House legal counsel.  That 
person was able to avoid censure, and through the failure to 
properly address what happened, I wonder when something similar 
will again occur and which member of parliament will be on the 
receiving end of it.  I have had my turn, but I do not wish 
anyone else to be similarly affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an aside, I should point out that my relations with the clerk 
of the justice committee at the time were somewhat negatively 
affected by that situation.  It was my sense that he took the 
position that I was attacking him and trying to cause him some 
grief for having access to my confidential amendments.  I assure 
members that nothing could have been further from the case.  It 
was the system as it was set up within the legal department of 
the House of Commons that permitted, and for that matter 
required, the clerk to become involved as he did.  The clerk was 
not responsible for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would suggest that the standing orders include the concept of 
solicitor-client privilege to protect the information that passes 
between individual members of parliament and their assigned legal 
counsel.  Members of parliament are entitled to an expectation of 
confidentiality with counsel in order to do their job, especially 
in the political environment that exists in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another concern I have and would like to discuss has to do with 
committee work.  We hear time and time again about the importance 
of our committees in threshing out the problems and nuances of 
all forms of legislation before it comes up for a vote in the 
Chamber. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take my committee duties seriously, as I am sure all members 
do.  I am present at the Standing Committee on Justice and Human 
Rights quite regularly.  I also understand the importance of 
presenting amendments through the committee so that its members 
are provided with the opportunity to review and debate those 
proposals.  It is, after all, the committee members who are 
tasked by parliament to conduct indepth review and analysis of 
legislation through witness testimony, debate, proposing 
amendments, et cetera.  The committee members gain a more 
thorough knowledge of the issues raised by the legislation and 
use that gained experience to assist the House with improving the 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is my opinion in the time that I have been here that some of 
the best work of the justice committee was accomplished during 
the time that the late Shaughnessy Cohen, rest her soul, occupied 
the chair.  While we did not always agree, as I am sure members 
know, she was a most determined individual.  I do believe that 
she always tried to do what was right and what was fair. The fact 
that the two parliamentary secretaries sat as members of the 
committee did not appear to intimidate Ms. Cohen.  She took 
control of the committee's work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Too often I can see that a committee chair can become 
intimidated by the presence of a parliamentary secretary.  Too 
often I can see that the committee's work becomes a mere 
formality.  It is the parliamentary secretary who gives the 
government members their marching orders on how to proceed and 
ensures that no one strays from the government's agenda. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I understand that this particular issue will be 
discussed further by others and perhaps even in another venue; of 
course I am referring to the Standing Committee on Procedure and 
House Affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My real concern over committee work relates to what happened 
during the last parliament with the Youth Criminal Justice Act, 
Bill C-3.  The committee conducted an indepth, extensive review 
and heard from many witnesses.  The committee members then 
presented a number of amendments, approximately 250 in all, of 
which about 150 came from the government itself.  Instead of 
dealing with those amendments, the committee sent the bill back 
to the House unchanged. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To my mind, the committee failed the House, as it did not fulfil 
its function.  It spent a large number of tax dollars to hear 
from witnesses.  It occupied parliamentary staff and tied up 
government officials for months on an important piece of 
legislation, but in the end it essentially accomplished 
absolutely nothing.  The House was deprived of the position on 
the bill from the very people it had tasked to review and return 
with their advice and experience. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Surely there is something wrong here.  Surely it is more than an 
inconvenience.  It is an abject failure.  I fully appreciate that 
there was a filibuster of sorts going on in the committee but 
filibusters are nothing new in this place or in the committees. 
They are addressed one way or another.  We do not run away from 
them.  The government had the same type of majority on committee 
as it does in this Chamber.  It had a number of ways in which it 
could have addressed that problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By abdicating its duties, the committee forced the 
reintroduction of all those amendments in this Chamber and we are 
all aware that the number of amendments then swelled, up into the 
neighbourhood of 3,000, which had to be addressed by all members 
of parliament.  The actions of the committee made a bad situation 
worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When members of the official opposition, the Progressive 
Conservatives, the NDP and yes, even the government itself, lose 
their amendments in the shuffle, so to speak, it is an injustice. 
For the members of those parties to be denied the opportunity to 
debate those amendments with their peers in committee is also 
just not right.

</I></B></P><P align=left>At times I left with the distinct impression that work done in 
committees was merely a game or a sham.  The government was going 
through the motions to make it appear as though legislation was 
thoroughly reviewed and analyzed.  I regret feeling compelled to 
adopt this attitude, and that is why I wanted to speak to this 
important matter of parliamentary reform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I implore all members to take a serious interest in improving 
the way we do things around here.  We have been elected to 
represent Canadian citizens.  At times the burden can become 
heavy, but we knew that or we certainly should have known it 
before coming here.  There is much work to be done but we need 
the right tools to do the job properly.  We need significant 
changes to our procedures to do just that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK241"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member on his remarks.  He brings 
a usual calm, deliberate approach to the debate.  He has made a 
number of graphic illustrations on how things have gone on a 
dysfunctional track in many instances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the hon. member is about debate in the House in 
terms of how we might improve the way we interact with one 
another.  We have had a number of occasions where we have looked 
to the Speaker to be more interventionist and to act a bit more 
like a referee if rules are being flouted, if closure is being 
invoked too soon, or if omnibus legislation is deemed to be 
improper.  We have seen the theatre of the absurd in question 
period with members of the government not answering questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When somebody is asked a direct question, particularly in debate 
where members tend to interact on a more one to one basis, 
sometimes the question is asked for partisan reasons but there is 
a point behind it.  The question is asked to illustrate something 
that is perhaps difficult to reconcile, given the circumstances. 
Does the hon. member favour having the Speaker try to keep 
members more on topic and force them to be more relevant in the 
way in which we interact in the Chamber? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Chuck Cadman:</B>  Speaking of referees, I imagine we 
could give you a whistle, Mr. Speaker, and we would have this 
place under control in a minute.  I would have to agree with the 
member for Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough that the Speaker 
should be given more control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I speak to lots of kids in high schools about their attitude 
toward each other.  I will use the same words that I use with 
them.  It boils down to having a bit of respect for each other in 
this place.  More than anything else, the bottom line is that we 
need more respect for each other in this place.  We can disagree 
because that is what this is all about, but we need more respect 
for each other.  It would make the Speaker's job a lot easier if 
we could bring that about. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the hour is late and we are approaching midnight.  The 
fact that so many members are present and anxious to continue 
debating this matter speaks a great deal to the passion and 
determination on the part of parliamentarians from all parties in 
the House about the need to change this place to make it more 
functional and to regain the golden age of true parliamentary 
tradition that many have spoken about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I feel an obligation this evening, no matter how late, to put 
forward my thoughts and to repeat some of the concerns expressed 
by my colleagues in the New Democratic Party.  I feel that 
compulsion in part because the seat I represent was held by two 
of the greatest parliamentarians this place has ever seen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I follow on the heels of Stanley Knowles and David Orlikow, two 
individuals who devoted their entire lives to service on behalf 
of the people they represented and in the interest of preserving 
parliament and all its traditions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2350"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT118"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those two individuals certainly taught me, and I am sure many 
other members of the House, the importance of preserving and 
respecting the role of the individual member of parliament and 
always coming back to that driving force which caused all or us 
to run for political life and to enter this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Stanley Knowles and David Orlikow epitomize the desire to serve 
public office in order to represent and empower constituents. The 
desire to pursue change, to devote our lives to using parliament 
to make society a better place, from whatever perspective we come 
from, from whatever political philosophy that is driving us and 
encouraging us in our chosen career, and the desire to empower 
the people we represent is surely the essence of the debate 
tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some have suggested in the course of today's debate that there 
are other motives, that in fact some of us are trying to grab 
more power for the sake of having more power.  Some have 
questioned individual motives and intentions.  I hope that is 
just an indication of the frustration members are feeling about 
this place in terms of it being a functional institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe there is not a person in the House who is seeking to 
change the rules, to push for parliamentary reform, just to have 
more power, just to wrest power from the government or just to 
have more avenues to embarrass the government of the day.  We are 
all seeking and striving for parliamentary change to allow us to 
be more effective members in doing what we sought to do when we 
entered this very difficult career path. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member for Winnipeg—Transcona said, this debate is 
all about getting some balance in this place, about giving 
members the ability to exercise the responsibilities they have 
embarked upon.  It is about living up to the notion of 
independent minded elected representatives.  It is about allowing 
MPs to play a decisive role on legislation and to pursue the role 
that electors expect of us, which is to be watchdogs of the 
public purse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are desperately trying to rebalance power in this place and 
to deal with the fact that power has shifted so much from 
individual elected representatives, from members of parliament, 
to forces outside the elected arena.  It has shifted to forces 
outside parliament, to forces with little accountability and 
ability on the part of people to know that they have some 
control, some power and some ability to influence the shape of 
their own lives and the destiny of the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate is surely about trying to ensure that we can 
participate in the democratic process to encourage the people we 
represent to be more active in democratic institutions, in the 
political process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we deal with the sense that people have of being helpless 
and hopeless in the face of many external factors when we start 
feeling helpless and hopeless in this place?  Could there be any 
among us who do not feel helpless and hopeless from time to time 
and sometimes more often than not?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I entered this place in 1997 with great expectations, 
anticipation and hopes about being able to exercise the 
responsibilities handed to me by the electors of Winnipeg North 
Centre.  I held out great hopes and aspirations about being able 
to influence the course of events and being able to pursue 
change, the very force which caused me to enter politics in the 
first place.  I am not discouraged and I have not given up, but I 
can say that my experience in this place has been much less than 
I expected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I made a deliberate decision to move from provincial politics to 
the federal arena because I believed that there were traditions 
and institutions, as a part of this place, that would allow me to 
be an effective representative and to give me the opportunity to 
pursue the kind of change that I thought my community needed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has been rather disappointing.  I especially expected that 
this place would offer an opportunity to pursue thorough 
independent research and investigation through our process of 
standing committees in the House of Commons.  I expected that 
because it is a process we do not have in the Manitoba 
legislative assembly.  We do not have standing committees that 
function on an ongoing basis which allow for independent research 
and investigation.  Needless to say I have been very disappointed 
by what I have experienced, at least with one committee in the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Not the health committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  My colleague says it for me, the 
health committee.  I want to say the health committee may be 
unique in terms of being dysfunctional.  However, based on what I 
have heard today, it is not that out of character.  We have a 
systemic problem in terms of our committee system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our committees, and certainly the health committee, are used and 
abused by the government of the day.  We have problems with the 
chairing of our meetings but our problems go much deeper. I have 
said this before in the House.  Our fundamental problem is that 
the committee system has become a tool of the government to shape 
its own agenda.  We are used to keep busy, to rubber stamp 
government programs without being allowed to pursue any kind of 
independent research and thorough investigation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not need to go into great detail tonight about all the 
difficulties we have experienced on the health committee. 
Suffice it to say, we have to change the system because we are 
not doing our job as parliamentarians.  We are not serving the 
public on some of the key issues of the day. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When it comes to the health committee we have been used by the 
government and directed in terms of our efforts as opposed to 
being allowed to pursue what is clearly at the top of the minds 
of Canadians.  That certainly has to be at the heart of what we 
do. We have to be allowed the ability and the resources to pursue 
the issues that are at the top of the minds of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of all the issues being discussed today, if we can do 
one thing, that is if we can reform the committee system and 
allow members of parliament to do thorough independent 
investigative research on issues that are at the top of the minds 
of Canadians and need to be explored by parliamentarians, we will 
have done parliament and the country a great service. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. 
Whereas it is now midnight, for all intents and purposes I wonder 
whether we could give permission to the pages, if they wish, to 
take their leave of this place.  I am sure we could manage 
without them for now and that they need to sleep so they can 
study. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  I do not see any opposition to the 
suggestion by the hon. member for Elk Island.  I suppose we could 
call it a day for our pages and we will carry on.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (parliament Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
believe the member who just spoke is too modest. She has a good 
reputation in the House, and it is well earned, for being 
prepared and doing the best that she can with the resources 
available.  I think all members would agree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us not be too full of ourselves, though, because we all know 
that 99.99% of the people in this place could never get elected 
as an independent.  Therefore, we cannot consider ourselves to be 
members of parliament elected to come here to do a bunch of 
things as members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe the member would concede that we are elected primarily 
as members of a parliamentary or political team.  We run under a 
banner with a leader, with policy.  In fact, what the people are 
voting for is a parliament.  They are voting for members as 
members of a team.  If their team forms the government, they 
expect them to work very hard to implement the platform they 
brought to the House with them.  If their team is not elected to 
government, their role will be the role of the opposition. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the official opposition.  We have the other parties of 
the opposition.  Their role is not to govern.  It is to be the 
opposition and to do it very well.  It is to seek accountability 
where there is none, to seek clarification where there is none, 
to seek information where there is none, and to point out 
deficiencies where there are deficiencies.  It is a very 
difficult job. Many backbenchers in a majority government would 
say the opposition members have a better job because they have an 
opportunity to become national figures.  They ask the questions 
they want to ask during question period. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition MPs are different.  Government MPs have a 
responsibility to support the team and the platform on which they 
ran and on which they were elected.  They have a constitutional 
obligation to follow through on the things they ran for.  If as a 
member of the government team I cannot support the government 
platform, if I cannot stand here to vote in favour of it, I 
should not be a member of that caucus.  I should withdraw from 
the caucus and sit as an independent or maybe even resign. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps the member would like to comment on anything I have 
said. In fairness, it is how I feel about the different roles of 
opposition members and government members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in case my comments 
were misinterpreted by the member, let me be clear that I was not 
by any stretch of the imagination suggesting we leave aside our 
political labels and forget about the party system.  I am a firm 
believer in responsible government and in the role of political 
parties.  I bring to this place my views as a New Democrat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to be clear with the member that when I talked about 
independent research at the committee level I was talking about 
work that is independent and free of political manipulation by 
the government of the day.  That has been the experience of those 
of us who have served on the health committee for the past four 
years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure if any other committee has experienced this, but 
each and every time our committee sat down to determine the 
agendas and the projects we wanted to undertake, the Minister of 
Health sent a letter to the health committee suggesting the topic 
of discussion and the Liberal members around that committee table 
sat and said “Yes, sir; no, sir; three bags full, sir”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of difficulty I am talking about.  I am not 
talking about giving up our party philosophy and our commitment 
to the beliefs that brought us here.  I am talking about a 
process, a system of committees that allows members to sit around 
the table and reach some agreement based on the priorities of the 
public and based on the issues of the day.  We have not been 
allowed to do that in the health committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the member for Mississauga South to work with us to end 
political manipulation and interference by the government in the 
work of a standing committee of the House.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal (Surrey Central, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise on behalf of the people of 
Surrey Central to participate in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament are supposed to be elected to come to this 
place, to provide solutions to problems and to contribute to the 
improvement of our nation's policies.  What we have seen over the 
last decade more than ever before is a significant growth in the 
concentration of political power in the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the executive branch of parliament gets stronger, our 
legislative branch, the House, gets weaker.  MPs find themselves 
with less meaningful roles to play in our legislative process. 
The opportunities for members of parliament to improve 
legislation and participate in policy development is decreasing. 
Members of parliament and Canadians become frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The long term objective of political parties is success in 
elections.  It is at the expense of or to the detriment of the 
work we are supposed to do here.  The government often chooses to 
pass legislation as fast as possible.  This thwarts the efforts 
of the opposition parties to ensure that the House passes the 
best possible legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opposition parties are not willing to let legislation pass 
quickly for the sake of passing it, so they tend to slow down the 
passage of legislation for the purpose of improving it.  The 
government uses time allocation and closure to curtail or even 
shut down debate in the House to prevent the efforts of 
opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The weak Liberal government has an abysmal record when it comes 
to using closure and time allocation to limit debate on the 
business of the House.  This results in a less co-operative 
atmosphere and produces a more confrontational environment in the 
House.  The media dramatize and promote that confrontation. This 
parliamentary battlefield prevents the House from pursuing its 
mandate to be a forum that improves legislation and forms or 
tests new policies.  It causes debate to be redundant and 
meaningless many times. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Very few members of parliament attend the daily debate in the 
House.  Most MPs leave the Chamber immediately after question 
period.  Debate in the House should allow for passionate 
arguments to provide political persuasion.  Debate should be 
free, open, fair and not subject to arbitrary limitations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The proceedings of the House have become no more than a formal 
exercise.  Members of parliament, the media and the public in 
general pay very little attention to debate in the House.  On the 
government side most of those speeches are scripted anyway. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Prime Minister never attends debate in the House, while 
cabinet ministers also very rarely— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I remind members not 
to reflect on the absence of members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, thank you for the 
intervention.  I will take your advice.  The purpose I was trying 
to communicate was that debate should be meaningful and more 
members should be listening and participating in debate in a 
meaningful way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing in the contributions during debate changes what cabinet 
has decided.  The ministers adopt none of the recommendations 
made by members of parliament in debate in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The outcome of the votes in the House can be predetermined 
because there are no free votes allowed by the government.  Not 
everything has to be a vote of confidence.  In other words, what 
I am saying is parliament has become a rubber stamp for the 
agenda of the Prime Minister's Office and the passage of 
legislation is reduced to a formality or a constitutional 
requirement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All MPs are in the House for question period anyway.  Why will 
the government not allow scheduled votes to take place 
immediately following question period?  It would save some time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Speaking of question period, the defining moment each day in the 
House is question period and it has become a circus.  There are 
virtually no informative answers given even to important 
questions asked during question period.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Private members' business is another example of where the 
influence of individual members of parliament has been 
diminished.  Virtually none of the private members' bills or 
motions are passed by the House.  The very few that are passed 
are usually killed in the Senate.  All private members' business 
should be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The resources available at the House of Commons to assist 
private members' business have either shrunk or dried up.  This 
includes legislative drafting lawyers.  Private members' business 
is just like a pacifier given to a baby.  The baby quietly keeps 
on working with it, in the hope that something will come out of 
it.  Despite a lot of hard work, nothing comes out of it.  That 
is what private members' business has become in the House. 
Nothing comes out of it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee system in this place has become more important 
than the work in the House because that is where the field of 
action has moved.  Even the committees are stifled because of the 
partisan nature in which they operate.  Their membership is 
dominated by a majority of government members who tightly control 
the work of the committees.  Government members often gang up on 
opposition members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The chairs of the committees are appointed or designated by the 
PMO.  They are not elected.  Future business of the committee and 
witnesses to appear before the committee are decided in a 
partisan manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government is also fighting to prevent committee hearings 
from being televised.  It knows that the way it runs committees 
is a farce.  Ministers just go there to introduce bills but do 
not hear the witnesses, the debates or the amendments to 
legislation with which the committees deal.  Debates in 
committees also become redundant and meaningless most of the 
time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians engage in a great deal of time and effort preparing 
petitions.  After the submission of petitions in the House by 
their representatives, the petitions are put on a shelf and a 
small reply, which is meaningless most of the time, is issued 
after a few months. The government takes no effective action on 
petitions.  Since I have been elected I have not seen any 
significant action being taken by the government on petitions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Whenever delegations from the Parliament of Canada travel 
abroad, it should be a team effort.  Many times opposition MPs 
are denied briefings and are left out of some of the events and 
meetings abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The ethics counsellor should be appointed by parliament instead 
of by the Prime Minister and only reporting to the Prime 
Minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An additional standing committee should be created and chaired 
by the opposition.  Its mandate should be to review and report to 
the House on all aspects of acts and reports of the privacy and 
access commissioners and of the ethics counsellor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The appointment of the clerk of the House, with due respect to 
the clerk who is a very nice person, by the Prime Minister 
defeats the purpose of election of the Speaker by the House.  The 
appointment of officers of parliament, for example the privacy 
and access to information commissioners and auditor general, et 
cetera, should receive a committee review before the motion is 
presented to the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Most of the time too many government bills are empty of content. 
They do not go far enough and are only window dressing.  I am 
talking about many bills.  Too many government bills are followed 
by a large number of regulations which are not debated in the 
House.  I consider that to be governing through the back door 
because regulations which control the whole intent of bills are 
not debated in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  You are speaking the truth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Absolutely.  The government prevents 
the House from dealing properly with the expenditures of the 
government.  The supplementary and interim supply budgets are 
hardly dealt with at all.  Even the scrutiny of money spent by 
the government, the real purpose of being here, does not occur in 
the House most of the time.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With the large number of MPs being re-elected and returning to 
the 37th parliament, the time is ripe for change.  MPs should be 
considered as a resource, capable of adding value to the 
legislation introduced by the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Committees should be used to test the soundness of policies in 
different parts of Canada.  This could help to bridge the gap 
between regional differences that we saw in the last election. 
Strengthening committees could also result in a more public or 
transparent legislative process.  It could also contribute to a 
diffusing of the confrontational environment in our parliament. 
This in turn would enhance the public's image of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The present parliamentary system is an assault on the rights of 
the elected representatives of the Canadian people in the House. 
This government must wake up to the needs of people in the new 
millennium. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it has come to light that members 
of the Canadian Police Association were just on the Hill to 
politely lobby all members of parliament to address some very 
serious concerns that the security personnel of our country, our 
front line enforcement officers, want to bring to the attention 
of all members of parliament in a very serious manner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To their surprise, they were advised that all the Liberal 
members of parliament were given speaking notes by the Prime 
Minister's office on what to say to them when they got here.  It 
is absolute nonsense when members of parliament cannot even speak 
their own minds or freely offer an opinion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talk about manipulation 101.  It is absolutely incredulous that 
the government would even attempt to do that.  I understand it 
happens all the time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would my hon. colleague from the Canadian Alliance Party comment 
on that, please? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the hon. member, 
who works very hard, like a few the other members in the House, 
for his valid question and valid concern.  It is not only of 
concern to members of the House, it is also of concern to the 
public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the highest Chamber in the nation and we are honoured 
and privileged to be here to represent our constituents. 
However, when we are muted not to say what our constituents are 
telling us to say in this Chamber, that is an affront to 
democracy.  In my opinion, it is not only anti-democratic, it is 
a dictatorship in the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member noted one particular occasion where members were 
given talking points and could not talk outside those talking 
points.  That is a shame.  We need parliamentary reform in the 
House so that members are able to speak their mind in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK246"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I particularly want to pay homage to the member for 
Surrey Central who, I suspect, if one were to analyze 
<I>Hansard</I>, speaks more frequently on bills and motions than 
any other member of this place, certainly of my party.  One 
exception might be the hon. member for 
Pictou-Antigonish—Guysborough who has to carry about four 
different portfolios. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Surrey Central is profligate in his contribution 
to debate here.  He makes those many interventions precisely 
because he does believe profoundly in the importance of the 
deliberative function of this body.  I know he has studied 
political science and has travelled and seen parliaments in the 
British system and other congressional systems abroad. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps he could reflect for a moment on whether he believes 
that other parliaments take more seriously the sort of debate to 
which he so frequently contributes than we do here in this 
parliament and how we could perhaps emulate the more sober use of 
parliamentary debate that other institutions use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gurmant Grewal:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
the hon. member for his comments and compliments.  He is a very 
articulate member of the House when he speaks. 
I always look forward to listening to him and to learning from 
him when he speaks.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about other parliaments in the world, even smaller 
democratic countries have made lots of progress. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was the co-chair of the scrutiny of regulations committee 
I noticed that the regulations in Canada that had been 
disallowed, were in the pipeline for the last 25 years.  When the 
committee contacted the ministers and other members of the 
government, they stonewalled the committee.  Those regulations 
have been in the pipeline for 25 years.  The number of those 
regulations is about 800.  That is one example of how the 
government stonewalls its own committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about private members' business in other parliaments, I 
have visited parliaments in other countries.  I was amazed at how 
conducive the environment in other parliaments was when free 
debate took place.  I even think the environment in Quebec's 
national assembly is more conducive for reasonable debate 
compared to any other legislature in this country.  The 
committees have also made a lot of progress in that field. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I concur with the hon. member when he says that the government 
should allow free debate in the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK247"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is case of who is going to tire here first, you or 
myself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think this is one of the few times when we could say that the 
tone in the House tonight was more conversational than what it 
normally is.  Maybe we are a little more reflective which is what 
comes, I guess, with the late night sessions.  However it has 
really been an interesting night. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a few comments that I want to make.  The member of 
parliament whom I replaced in the House was Fred McCain.  He had 
been a member of parliament for many years representing a riding 
called Carleton—Charlotte, a riding that I first represented. He 
was a great parliamentarian.  Before him, there was a member of 
parliament named Hugh John Flemming, the former premier of the 
province of News Brunswick.  I am following in some pretty big 
footsteps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things Mr. McCain mentioned to me early in my 
parliamentary career was that my constituents want to be proud of 
me.  That is so true.  I think we all have seen that they really 
do. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some obvious examples of that tonight here in the 
House of Commons.  We have a group of young Canadians with us.  I 
think every member who is presently here in the Chamber is or has 
been involved with the Forum for Young Canadians.  I know you, 
Mr. Speaker, have been involved in that program where young 
Canadians come to Ottawa and learn firsthand how parliament 
works.  They come to question period.  I know as Speaker, you 
have them come into the Chamber.  They take seats in the House. 
It is really educational.  I know their teachers look forward to 
having some of their students come to Ottawa.  It is a really 
well run program sponsored by certain corporations, as well as 
the Parliament of Canada.  Some very dedicated government 
officials make sure this program works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the pleasure of having supper with those students tonight, 
because they always have a supper with members of parliament.  I 
know the member from Winnipeg, the member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough and other members were also at 
the supper.  After supper we brought some of the young forum 
members over to the House to watch tonight's late night session. 
They were absolutely fascinated with the process of parliament. 
Some of us went to the control room where they do all the filming 
of the House with the cameras and all the technology that allows 
us to be broadcast across the country.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I actually took two of them into the East Block.  One of these 
young Canadians sat down in the very chair that our first prime 
minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, sat in.  The security guards 
were generous enough to let us in.  It was a real thrill for them 
to be here.  Truly, they are proud of their members of 
parliament.  It is something that I think we should do more of 
with Canadians.  We should engage Canadians in the process of how 
government works and how well it can work when we can focus on 
some of the big issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to specifically talk in terms of reinventing parliament 
and talk about some of the things that we can do in this 
institution that would help us a little.  I think we are all 
offering some advice here and there, some advice bigger than 
others, but one of the particular things that concerns me, which 
I guess our House leader often calls my hobby horse of the day or 
my little pet peeve, is the questions we put on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members of parliament are entitled to four questions and four 
questions only on the order paper.  For the viewing public, if 
there is anyone left out there watching us at this late hour, the 
reason we have questions on the order paper is because we cannot 
expect ministers, for example, to answer a very technical, 
detailed question on the floor of the House of Commons.  It is 
impossible for them to do that.  Some of the questions demand 
more than a 35 second response, as in oral question period, to 
which the ministers are restricted, so we put some of the 
questions on the order paper.  It is our belief, as opposition 
members of parliament, and even as government members who 
sometimes put questions on the order paper, that Canadians are 
entitled to know questions of concern to them.  They want the 
answers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an example of how flawed the system of putting questions on 
the order paper is, we are entitled to only four questions at a 
time.  Presently I have four questions on the order paper. 
Unbelievable as it may sound, two of those questions will be 
celebrating their first birthday in the House in the next 30 
days.  I can see the Speaker grinning.  It is hard to believe 
that a member of parliament could put questions to the government 
in written form which have gone unanswered for an entire year. As 
I said last week, I will be blowing out candles on their birthday 
cake very shortly.  It is very frustrating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that it is, in some cases, in the government's 
best interest not to answer those questions because sometimes it 
is an embarrassment to the government.  The government asks why 
it should be in a hurry to answer questions from the member for 
New Brunswick Southwest or the members from Winnipeg or South 
Shore because if it answers those questions, more will be put on 
the order paper.  It then stalls, and if it does not have to 
answer the questions, all the better because the member is 
limited to four questions.  That is the position I am in as a 
member of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The questions are very serious in tone.  One question has to do 
with the selling of 40 Huey helicopters by the Government of 
Canada.  This was brokered out to a firm by the name of Lancaster 
Aviation Inc.  Those 40 helicopters were actually purchased by a 
U.S. firm but our belief now is that these 40 Hueys have shown up 
in Colombia.  For what purpose? That is basically sidestepping 
the rules that we have employed as a peacekeeping nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In addition to that, I have a question on 10 Challenger aircraft 
that were auctioned off or brokered through that same company by 
the name of Lancaster Aviation Inc.  The question had to do with 
where those Challenger aircraft wound up.  Again, I think the 
Canadian people have a right to know the answers to those 
questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the British parliament, the government has two weeks in which 
to answer those questions.

answers to those same questions, would he have to wait a solid 
year for them?  I think he would have them in an hour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The parliamentary secretary in charge of this file is completely 
embarrassed, on a personal level, that members of parliament on 
this side of the House have to wait a solid year for answers to 
legitimate questions.  The Canadian public does have a right to 
know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is just one small example how this place could be reformed. 
Some of it is common courtesy to the people we represent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You could never get elected, Mr. Speaker, and you are a long 
serving member in this House, as a member of parliament if you 
went back to your constituency week after week for a solid year 
without answering some of the questions and concerns of 
constituents.  That is the situation we find ourselves in. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All the government has to do is say that there will be a change 
in attitude and in culture at the time, and it will not cost us 
anything.

great members of parliament who have served before them.  This 
gives me an opportunity to do something I have wanted to do for 
some time, in a non-partisan and co-operative way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like pay tribute to two of the great parliamentarians 
who were in my riding Yukon before me.  One person is Erik 
Nielsen, who commented on the House in a book entitled <I>House 
is not a Home</I>.  The other person is Audrey McLaughlin, the 
first woman to lead a political party in Canada. Those are two 
great parliamentarians who partly shaped the history and the 
changes in this House.  I think as former Yukoners, we should all 
pay tribute to them.

least given the perception that there is modern change to the way 
we do our jobs, does he believe that the percentage of vote will 
actually decrease even more and that more people will write us 
off, stay home and forget to exercise their most democratic 
right, which is their right to vote? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is a great question. 
I think that people have to be engaged, that they have to be part 
of a process, feel that their views are important and that 
individual members of parliament are empowered or have the 
ability to go on the floor of the House of Commons and present 
that point of view. 
I am not sure if I have answered that properly but I want to get 
it in before my time expires.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things in which I am disappointed is the election 
turnout.  We do not want to get into the situation we see 
happening south of the border where fewer Americans every 
election are voting.  It is now down to around 50%.  We are 
headed in the same direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously one of the things we did was go to a permanent 
elections list.  There were huge problems with that in the last 
election.  However, enumeration is still an important part of the 
process.  People are reminded one-on-one when enumerators knock 
on doors and say that their votes count, that they are entitled 
to vote and where they will vote when polling day takes place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to consider going back to that.  I know it probably is a 
step backwards in the minds of a lot of people.  It is a human 
touch to the whole process which I think has generated more 
interest in our electoral system than some other nations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Americans, for example, have a permanent voters' list which 
they have had for many years.  It has been one of the reasons for 
the lower turnout in the United States.  It may be a little more 
expensive to do it but it would be worth the price.  I hope that 
we can encourage more Canadians to vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a professional approach to this business of politics.  The 
openness and transparency that Canadians expect, would be the 
greatest way we could generate enthusiasm, excitement and 
interest that we would all like to see.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
thank you for staying with us here so late this evening.   Of 
course thanks also to the people at the table, the other staff 
who are here, including the interpreters and technical staff.  It 
is great that everyone here is participating in making it 
possible for us to keep up the reputation of this place as the 
place of many words. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was reminded of a friend of mine who went back to what he 
called his motherland.  I will not mention what country it is 
because it is not nice to pick on the people from Holland.  He 
said he went back to visit his relatives and there was one thing 
that amazed him.  Everybody spoke at the same time and no one was 
listening.  I hope that is not true here tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will be quite specific to the topic we are addressing tonight, 
and that is the change in the standing orders.  Right now it is 
only about 10.40 p.m. back home in Alberta and only 9.40 p.m. in 
British Columbia.  That is why some of us who are from the west 
are still feeling so energetic and ready to go for a couple more 
hours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if any of them are watching, and perhaps others, they 
should know that the standing orders are the rules which 
regulate, not only the debate in the House but also pretty well 
the management of committees, and the way things are done around 
here in terms of taking an idea through the process where it 
actually becomes legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my intervention I would like to reinforce a few things and 
perhaps come up with one or two ideas which members may not have 
heard during the debate today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I do not think this requires a change in the standing 
orders since they already permit the television broadcast of 
committees.  However, it was mentioned by several that perhaps 
there should be greater coverage of committees by television.  I 
would like to make a suggestion, and I am not sure it requires a 
change in the orders as they are. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing that occurred to me was that there are probably 
increasingly more people who have access to the Internet than who 
have access to cable or satellite.  With the new satellite 
dishes, perhaps that will change.  I do not know the exact 
numbers, but I would like to recommend that a very inexpensive 
way of making it possible for Canadian citizens to watch their 
parliament at work would be to have an Internet where people 
could go to the House of Commons.  There would be a place to 
click committees to view a committee. 
Then they pick which committee they want to see and there it is 
with the video streaming on the screen.  We could enable I 
imagine millions of people who would be glued to their computers 
watching.  Technically, it is quite possible to do that.  It is 
relatively inexpensive and does not cost any more.  I know we are 
putting up satellites in order to get Internet access to all 
the remote parts of the country now. It could be a tremendous 
unifying force for our country.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  Congress is already doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  My colleague said that congress is already 
doing that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, I would like to mention petitions.  Right now Standing 
Order 36 says a member can submit a petition.  As one of my 
colleagues said earlier, nothing is ever done with them. When we 
had the issue of child pornography in British Columbia, I believe 
we had we had over 500,000 names on petitions, yet that evoked no 
reaction from parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One thing we could do to connect Canadian citizens to parliament 
and increase the respect of the House, would be to have a plan of 
action.  If petitions came into the House in certain numbers, 
using a threshold say of 100,000, 200,000 or whatever, and of 
course would be up to the committee to decide, then it would 
necessitate a motion being put before the House and debated for a 
day with an action plan on how to deal with the petitioners' 
request.  I think that makes a lot of sense. Otherwise, the work 
that citizens do to gather petitions really becomes a meaningless 
exercise other than just to bring their issue to the fore and 
into the conscience of more people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my remaining time I would like to talk primarily about 
private members' business.  There are other topics too.  Many of 
my colleagues and people from other parties have mentioned them 
today so I will not repeat them.  I agree with much of what has 
gone on, but I want to talk about private members' business. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I happen to be one of those members who is not lucky.  The only 
time I have ever won anything in my life was when I was trucking. 
There was one place where we used to stop to eat in Alberta. It 
had what we call out west student scribblers or notebooks.  It 
had the numbers one to fifty written down the side.  We signed it 
whenever we bought a meal.  When all the numbers had been signed 
for, the restaurant would write one to fifty on pieces of paper, 
put them in a little bowl and pick one.  I won a free meal once 
in my life.  Other than that, I have not won a great deal other 
than winning the hand of a beautiful woman in marriage many years 
ago.  We have been married 40 years. That is a major win. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am not very lucky, and in this House I have bombed. I 
have been here for seven years going on eight.  I have not yet 
been selected on private members' business.  Therefore, I propose 
a small change.  Instead of having a random draw, I propose that 
all members elected to a parliament be put in a random order.  I 
would be willing to provide my limited computer skills to do 
that.  I have taught that sort of thing when I was teaching at 
the college.  It could be computerized and the members would be 
listed in order.  That means that we would go down the order and 
each one of those members would have the opportunity to have a 
bill brought before the House.  If they declined, that would be 
fine.  They would be moved to the bottom of the list and that 
list.  That list in that order would stay for the duration of the 
parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If members resigned, then of course their space would become 
vacant.  Any new members elected in a byelection would 
automatically be put at the bottom of the list.  If there were 
four byelections on the same day, then those four members would 
be put in random order at the bottom of the list.  At least then 
we would be able to move up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I did a rough calculation.  We could increase the number of 
hours per week on private members from the present five to 10. 
This could be accomplished, for example, by having another 
private members' hour from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.  If we had 10 hours 
per week, then in a parliament which lasted more than three 
years, of course with this current Prime Minister three and a 
half years is more or less the norm, every member could have 
their bill put forward and, if it were so arranged, there could 
be three hours of debate on each bill. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2445"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT130"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT130"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2445

<A HREF="#LINKT129"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I propose that every bill be votable.  It is useless to 
come up with a good idea and simply talk about it for one hour 
and then say it is dropped to the bottom of the order paper. 
Actually it is dropped into the garbage can.  It is dropped off 
the order paper.  Every member's bill should be votable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also would like to say that there is there are limited 
resources that are wasted here.  When we came back to this 
parliament I had a couple of bills that I wanted to get into that 
first draw to increase my odds.  I know all about this math 
stuff.  When there are fewer people, the probability of being 
chosen is higher.  I could not get them in because the staff were 
so overloaded they did not get to my bills.  I did not get in on 
that draw. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I propose is that each member be limited to no more than 
two bills or motions in the draw or at a time.  That is fair, 
because they can only pick one.  It goes through the whole 
rotation before there is a repeat of the list. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another consideration in regard to the standing orders 
that does cause a bit of a problem.  I propose that no member be 
allowed to move an amendment to a private member's bill or motion 
without the consent of the mover.  Sometimes the movers can be 
persuaded that they would have a better chance of getting it 
passed if they would agree to an amendment.  If that amendment is 
not offensive, a member can choose to accept that amendment and 
then the debate and the vote will be on the amended motion. 
However, we have had several instances where a member's motion 
has been totally gutted by amendment.  Then the government, with 
its majority, pushes it through and basically the private 
member's business is stolen from the member who proposed it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have more ideas here that I could talk about but I should 
respect the time.  I will just mention one more item.  I do not 
favour the suggestion that perhaps Fridays could become private 
members' days.  I am worried about Fridays around here.  I am one 
of the members who always makes it a point when the House is in 
session to be here the full week.  I am often here on Fridays, 
and without saying anything about anyone specifically, you and I 
both know, Mr. Speaker, that the place is not exactly crowded on 
Fridays. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would be a little worried about having private members' 
business relegated to Fridays, because its purpose is for the 
debates to occur in order for us to be able to persuade by 
reason, by argument and by good logic that a bill or a motion is 
worthy of support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will close my speech by giving the following bizarre 
suggestion, and that is that members' salaries would be paid for 
the week only if they actually showed up for private members' 
business on Friday. 
<P><A NAME="LINK251"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the hon. member for 
Elk Island.  I think it is fantastic that he waited over 10 hours 
to give his speech on this very important subject and I certainly 
commend him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very interested in his comments on private members' 
business.  It is interesting that many members spoke very 
generally about parliamentary reform while this member had some 
very specific suggestions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask the hon. member if he has even more 
suggestions to give to the committee in regard to what should be 
implemented to make the House truly more democratic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp:</B>  I am certainly pleased to do that, Mr. 
Speaker, and I thank my colleague for the opportunity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Yes, there are a number of other specific amendments.  There is 
one, but I do not know if it can be put into the standing orders. 
I asked a question earlier in debate about whether or not free 
votes can actually be put into the standing orders.  We have done 
a bit of that with respect to private members' business by 
changing the voting order.  This was done in the last parliament. 
Instead of starting with the frontbenches so that all of the 
members can take their cue from how the cabinet is voting, we now 
start the voting at the backbenches.  That goes for both sides of 
the House.  I think we should be careful to retain that 
particular provision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, we should have true free votes.  I would like to 
see that happen more often. 
I do not mind.  Let us say that I have a motion or a bill and put 
it forward as private members' business and state the strongest 
case that I can for my idea, which hopefully represents the 
wishes of my constituents back home.  I have a couple such bills 
in the hopper right now, which I cannot get to vote on and cannot 
even get to debate because they are not drawn.

<A HREF="#LINKT130"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us say that I put that bill or motion forward and present my 
strongest arguments in favour of it.  If afterward the 300 
members of the House of Commons say to me “hon. member for Elk 
Island, that is a dumb idea and we are going to vote against 
it”, well, I gave it my best shot.  In their wisdom the members 
said they would not vote for it.  That is fine and I will accept 
that.  I did not have a strong enough argument.  I did not 
express it well.  It is my problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if I am able to persuade them and they still vote 
against it because of some implied instruction from someone else, 
then I get a little upset, because I do not believe that our 
country, our democracy and our citizens are well served when we 
cannot, as a group of people in the largest council in the 
country, vote totally freely.  I would like to actually see a 
standing order provision that would make it illegal, a breach of 
the orders, for anyone voting against the wishes of his or her 
party to ever be disciplined in any way by that party.  I do not 
know whether that is possible.  It is something that perhaps the 
committee would want to tackle. 
<P><A NAME="LINK252"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I want to comment on the fact that 
if the government had really wanted to simplify the debate 
tonight, all it had to do was listen to the speeches from my hon. 
colleagues from Winnipeg—Transcona and Regina—Qu'appelle and go 
on the advice of what those two very learned gentlemen have 
brought forth to the House today.  Then the government would 
understand exactly what it needs to do to change the House of 
Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In earlier questioning I mentioned that 42% of Canadians, for 
whatever reason, did not exercise their most democratic right, 
which is their right to vote.  There is a myriad of reasons as to 
why they did that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, time and time again when I speak at schools or at a 
forum of young Canadians or legions, wherever I go, I tell people 
that although I was not born in this country I am very proud to 
be a representative of my party in the House of Commons and to 
represent the constituents of my riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are 116,000 reasons why people must vote.  Those are the 
116,000 brave men and women, many of them just a little older 
than some of the pages here, who are buried in over 60 countries 
around the world.  Those brave men and women fought and died in 
the belief that this was the number one country in the world and 
that our ideals, our viewpoints and our spirit of democracy 
should be shared and respected with all other countries around 
the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to what we can do specifically to change parts of 
the House, I want to mention five reports that I brought with me. 
I was on the fisheries and oceans committee from 1997 to 2000. We 
did 13 reports, 8 of them unanimous:  the Nunavut report, the 
east coast report, the central Canada fresh water fisheries 
report, two west coast reports, the seal report, the Prince 
Edward Island report, and so on.  The unique thing about these 
reports is that they were unanimous and produced not by three 
parties but by five political parties in the House of Commons: 
the old Reform Party, now the Alliance; the Bloc; the Liberals, 
the governing party; the NDP; and the Conservatives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, in committee we struggle for the preamble and for 
the recommendations.  In order to make it unanimous, we all put a 
little water in our wine and we all agree on what the report 
should say based on the evidence we have heard.  It takes an 
awful lot of time to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars doing these 
reports and going across the country listening to evidence from 
the people most affected by the concerns and the recommendations 
in these reports, only to have the government completely ignore 
all of the reports.  Every last one of them was ignored.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember very clearly standing in the House of Commons trying 
to move concurrence on the east coast report back in 1998.  I was 
shocked at what happened.  I am naive and I will admit that, but 
I did not believe that members of parliament could actually do 
what they did, being the honourable people we are.  When 
concurrence is moved on a report it means that the government has 
to move on those recommendations.  The Liberal members who put 
their names in the booklet and on the report stood up and voted 
against their own report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Just shortly before that we were in towns like Pouch Cove and La 
Scie, Newfoundland, in Goose Bay, Labrador, in Halifax, Nova 
Scotia, et cetera.  Everyone on that committee, including the 
government members, told those people who bared their hearts and 
souls to us in their evidence about the concerns of the fishing 
crisis they faced that we would go back to Ottawa, come up with a 
unanimous report and try to help them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Only a short while later, government members of the committee 
stood up and voted against their own report.  Why did we even 
bother doing it?  Why did we not stay in our little offices and 
do exactly what the PMO or the ministers directed us to do?  That 
was a shock.  I could not believe that could happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There was another thing that happened and again I base it on 
ignorance of what can happen.  If we really want to change 
parliament, we as members of parliament have to change ourselves. 
One of the better things we could do is to put a stop to this 
crossing of the floor if a member has a falling out with his or 
her party.  Many members in the last parliament crossed the 
floor. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I find it absolutely astonishing that I, as a member of 
parliament for Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern Shore, 
elected as a New Democratic member, could just decide tomorrow 
that I might want to join the Alliance Party or the Liberal 
Party.  All I have to do is go to the House leader of that party 
and tell him I want to join and I would be welcomed with open 
arms.  Then, bang, I would be a member of that political party. 
However, that is not what the constituents voted for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a bill in the hopper that has not been drawn yet, so I 
know what the member for Elk Island is going through, and it 
basically says that if a member has a falling out with his or her 
political party and wishes to leave, he or she would sit as an 
independent or quit.  A member would have to run in a byelection 
under the new political banner and let the people of the riding 
decide the member's political future.  That is democracy.  That 
is being honest with constituents.  If we are not honest with the 
people who voted us into this most honourable Chamber in the 
entire country, then we should not even be running for office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example is the police association that is here in 
Ottawa.  It has very serious, legitimate concerns about what 
police do for a living.  The association wishes to bring those 
concerns to the attention of each and every member.  The 
policemen and their association spend an incredible amount of 
money from their membership dues to come to Ottawa and address 
all members of parliament in a very formal manner about their 
concerns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What they do not want to have is 170 and some members all 
singing from the same hymn book.  They want to know exactly what 
the member from the Yukon is thinking or what the member from 
Mississauga is thinking and so on.  They do not want to come to 
Ottawa to see prepared speeches for all members of the government 
which tell them what to say to the police association when the 
police come to their offices to speak to them.  I was shocked. I 
beg the indulgence of the Speaker.  I am amazed that I could be 
so naive as to think that does not happen.  When I came to Ottawa 
to represent the constituency I did not believe that these 
shenanigans could happen, but they do.

</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the most shocking days I have ever had in the House of 
Commons was on the hepatitis C vote.  I know very well, through 
private conversations, that a lot of backbench Liberals said they 
did not support the government position and that the Prime 
Minister had no right to make it a confidence vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the more respected members, a doctor, a wonderful woman, 
ended up in tears after that vote.  Why?  Because one person 
decided to make it a confidence vote. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Thousands of people in the country suffer from the terrible 
disease of hepatitis C.  It was a good motion, brought forward by 
the Canadian Alliance. I believe it was the hon. member for 
Macleod who brought it forward.  We had a great debate to move it 
forward and help those people, only to be turned down because one 
person said no.  All the others followed in line like a bunch of 
sheep. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we truly wish to change parliament we need to change 
ourselves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I know a lot of Canadians are switching off Mike Bullard to 
watch this debate, so with that I would be more than willing to 
accept questions or comments from members. 
<P><A NAME="LINK253"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, of course they were switching channels during the 
commercials and just happened to run across CPAC, and there was 
an engaging speech so they stayed with it.  I concur with that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a specific question for the hon. member.  The theme that 
has come up over and over today is the whole question of free 
votes versus making every vote a confidence vote.  I am a little 
puzzled by it.  I know the standing orders probably as well as 
the next member and I do not really know how we can, by changing 
the standing orders, force the government to not put pressure on 
its members or on any other party.  I wonder if the hon. member 
has any ideas as to how that could be done in the standing 
orders. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To protect members, I suggested a rule that says if they vote 
against their party they will not incur sanctions from the party 
leadership.  For example, the party cannot send the person to the 
furthest office in the precincts as a form of punishment.  That 
is a rule I thought of.  I wonder if the hon. member has any 
specific concrete ideas as to how to handle that one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I believe confidence 
votes should only be on budgetary items or the throne speech. 
Everything else should be open. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we need to do is look at the former member for York 
South—Weston, Mr. John Nunziata, who stood with principle and 
voted against the government on the GST.  The red book promised 
to get rid of the GST.  Only one member of the Liberal party 
stood and said his constituents had sent him to the House, his 
constituents had told him to vote against the GST and that was 
exactly what he would do.  Mr. Nunziata's reward: to be kicked 
out of the Liberal caucus. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must bear in mind that Mr. Nunziata was a member of the rat 
pack, and that when the Liberals were down and the Conservatives 
were up he did an awful lot of fighting to bring his party's 
stature back up in the House of Commons and raise its profile. 
His reward years later was to be kicked out of the Liberal caucus 
because he voted with his conscience and with the wishes of his 
constituents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can still happen today.  The government has not learned 
anything from that example.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Larry Bagnell (Yukon, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is past 
1 a.m. here.  However as the member for Elk Island said, it is 
only 10 o'clock in the Yukon.  I would like us all to remember 
Yukoners in some of these individual differences.  I know they 
want to be heard, and I will try to keep trying to make them 
heard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In relation to the point the hon. member, a former Yukoner, made 
about police talking points, I do not know what he is talking 
about.  I have never seen such points.  I do not think that is a 
fair comment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other point I will make relates to the point the hon. member 
made that we are the best country in the world to live in, and 
that is why many people sacrificed for us overseas. 
I believe we have kept faith with them.  This body, like any 
body, reflects in its decision making processes complexities and 
human frailties, but it is always open to change.  We have had a 
tremendous debate tonight in the spirit of that change.  It will 
move on and be improved and become better as a result of this 
debate and of the continuing efforts of members.

which tries to get 301 people to agree on anything, Canada is 
still the best country in the world.  I am proud of that.  I 
think the members who are part of making Canada the best country 
in the world are proud of that.  I do not think we have broken 
faith, as John McCrae would say, with those who died for us.  I 
am proud that we still live in the best country in the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, I did live in Watson 
Lake, Yukon for nine years.  The hon. member for Yukon and I have 
many mutual friends in Whitehorse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, on his speaking notes I ask the hon. member to check with 
his staff because I have very solid information that every 
Liberal member of parliament received those speaking notes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the hon. member is absolutely right.  In my opinion, and 
I am sure the opinion of many others here from all political 
parties, this is indeed the number one country in the world. 
However if he wants to know about our veterans he should speak to 
merchant mariners about the battle they face in trying to get 
compensation from the government after 56 years of struggle. They 
have a lot of difficulty with what the government has been doing 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of this being the number one country in the world, 
there is no question about it. 
<P><A NAME="LINK255"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, let me say good morning to you.  I thank you 
especially for staying here during the debate and I thank all the 
House officers as well.  I know they are all looking at us and 
wondering what in God's name these parliamentarians are doing 
here so late. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here because this issue is supremely important.  It is very 
important to all Canadians but in particular to the people of 
Edmonton Southwest.  In the first week of March I had a town hall 
meeting in my riding.  This was the most prominent issue that 
came up again, again and again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People in Edmonton feel powerless over what happens here and 
over what the government does with their taxpayer dollars.  They 
want parliament to reassert itself, and private members to 
reassert themselves, over the spending controls exercised by the 
government.  They essentially want to take back their government 
and empower parliamentarians so that parliamentarians can act on 
their behalf.  However they want to empower themselves as 
citizens so they will have more direct control over how they are 
governed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will read the motion for the record.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That a special committee of the House be appointed to consider 
and make recommendations on the modernization and improvement of 
the procedures of the House of Commons; 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the spirit of fairness I congratulate the government for 
putting the motion forward and I would like to depart a bit.   I 
know we are not supposed to draw attention to members in the 
House, but I would like to commend the hon. member for Yukon for 
diligently partaking in the debate as a member of the government. 
It is very much appreciated on this side of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am hopeful, yet somewhat sceptical, that we will be able to 
make substantive changes to parliament so that we can more 
effectively represent Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the things that has caused me great concern, before I 
entered politics and certainly since then, has been the decline 
of public confidence in politics in general and political 
institutions in particular.  That is a very disturbing and sad 
trend.  It is disturbing to me for two reasons.  The first is 
more for intellectual reasons and deals with the whole nature of 
politics itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come from a political science and political philosophy 
background.  If one examines what the word “politics” means and 
where it comes from, it comes from the Greek word <I>polis</I> 
meaning city.  This means the city state, which was to 
philosophers like Plato and Aristotle the classical form of 
government.  It was a form in which Aristotle said every citizen 
knew the character of each and every other citizen.  What that 
allowed was a full and deliberative discussion within the city 
and the political community so that people were self-governed and 
governed better. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T2510"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT135"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT135"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 2510

<A HREF="#LINKT134"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This also points to the importance of rhetoric, the importance 
of discussion, the importance of what Plato called the dialectic 
between people who engage in a dialogue for the importance of 
serving the truth or improving the nature of the community.  That 
is what the whole parliamentary system is about.  We face each 
other across the aisle not to shout and scream, but because the 
government is supposed to propose and the opposition is supposed 
to critique and hold the government accountable.  It is that 
tension between the government and the opposition that truly 
provides for good governance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I learned another thing about politics after attending the 
dinner with the Forum for Young Canadians.  Many of these 
youthful people are very inspired with politics and want to 
pursue it as a career.  Unfortunately, there are fewer and fewer 
people who want to do that.  The very essence of politics and 
politicians themselves seems to be declining in public favour, 
and that is tragic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Referring to Aristotle, politics should be a noble calling.  He 
listed contemplation as the highest, but he had politics as the 
second highest noble calling.  We should all work toward 
restoring that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second reason I would list beyond the intellectual would be 
the personal.  I have enjoyed the debate tonight because people 
have relayed some personal stories, particularly the member for 
Elk Island.  My political mentor is really my father.  I learned 
politics at his knee.  It is interesting that I am a member of 
the Canadian Alliance today, yet he was a former Liberal who in 
1968 helped elect a member in Edmonton named Hu Harries.  He was 
a very independent minded and intelligent member who came to 
Ottawa.  The system here did not utilize that member's talents. 
That certainly disillusioned my father. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The more important lesson my father taught me was when he and I 
disagreed, whether it was over the kitchen table or wherever, was 
the importance of listening and of respecting someone else's 
point of view.  He taught me that we should not impugn motive to 
people who disagree us, we should challenge their ideas, policies 
and what they say, but not who they are. I think that sense of 
respect has to be restored to parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I have seen some incidents in the past week and a 
half that were especially disturbing to me.  I am not going to go 
into them, but those sorts of incidents destroy deliberative 
debate in the House and they must be dealt with severely. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the reasons I ran for parliament was to raise the level 
of debate in the House and the level of political discourse in 
Canada.  Raising the respect and decorum in the House is the 
first way we must do this.  We must ensure that arguments are 
carried and that decisions are made based on the reason of 
arguments rather than the loudness of our voices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to take some time to make some specific recommendations. 
The first one, and the government house leader mentioned this 
today, would be to have votes following question period on 
Tuesday.  I certainly encourage him to do that.  That is 
certainly one example of a recommendation that would improve the 
House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of question period, it was mentioned that the U.K. 
parliament had a thematic question period in one day.  From what 
I have heard from people who have observed the British 
parliament, it is certainly an improvement.  It allows for a more 
engaging discussion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of omnibus bills, we had a recent bill from the 
Minister of Justice.  Comparing our political system to that in 
the United States, Tip O'Neill was the master of this, he would 
throw everything into one bill.  It was a hodgepodge.  That is 
against the legislative process.  A bill should be limited to a 
specific issue and ideal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of committees, we should have the election of chairmen 
and vice chairmen by secret ballot.  We should also not have 
chairmen removed for a year by the Prime Minister or the whip of 
the party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another thing I recommend.  As new MPs, we were 
privileged to have an orientation by some past members of 
parliament.  One member in particular, Daniel Turp who used to be 
a member for the Bloc Quebecois, suggested having committees not 
sit when the House was sitting.  He said it would improve the 
number of people who could then attend parliament, as well as 
improving the attendance at committees. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of speeches in the House of Commons, I am going to make 
a suggestion that my former employer, Ian McClelland, made.  He is 
certainly a good friend of yours, Mr. Speaker.  He suggested that 
we possibly shorten the length of speeches in the House and 
lengthen the period of time for questions and comments.  It would 
improve the discussion and debate across the sides of the House, 
even between different opposition parties.

<A HREF="#LINKT135"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the power of appointment, all government 
appointments should go through a committee or a parliamentary 
review.  In terms of private members' bills, we must make them 
votable.   We referred to former member John Nunziata who stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let members bring their ideas forward. If it is not a good idea, 
that member will be held accountable for that bad idea by his 
constituents.  Let the House itself view this bill.  If it is not 
a good idea it will be rejected. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, the whole notion of the confidence convention is 
the most fundamental change that must be made here.  It was 
interesting listening to the government House leader when he said 
that he was not here to change the constitution and that he was 
not here to completely revamp Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The fact is that if we do not change the way the confidence 
convention is applied in the House we will not truly make the 
necessary democratic reforms.  We must ensure that a vote on a 
specific bill is just that, a vote on that specific bill.  The 
confidence convention must be removed so that if a particular 
bill is defeated we can then call for a confidence convention and 
the government can vote a second time on whether there is 
confidence in the government.  That seems entirely reasonable to 
me. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to refer to the relationship between parliament and the 
judiciary that was mentioned earlier by the member for 
Toronto—Danforth.  I know they are likely outside the scope of 
this committee, but I would like hon. members to consider that 
important relationship to ensure the House truly becomes the 
parliamentary institution it needs to be. 
<P><A NAME="LINK256"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter Stoffer (Sackville—Musquodoboit Valley—Eastern 
Shore, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, when growing up and studying 
history I always thought that Aristotle and Plato were social 
democrats, and now that has been confirmed by the hon. member 
from Edmonton.  I thank him for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member alluded to the behaviour of MPs in terms of respect 
for other MPs.  Speaking for my party and I, we tend to have a 
good rapport with all members of parliament and good working 
relations with other staff within the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would he not agree that in order to change parliament we as 
individual members of parliament need to change the way we 
interact with one another? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I should note that he was 
one of the first members to approach me as a new member and 
welcome me to the House, and I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He also said something very similar to what my father would say: 
discuss, debate and challenge each other on ideas but at the end 
of the day go together and have what he called a pop, relax and 
be friends.  If we all had that sort of attitude about our place 
here, the House would be a much better place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is so necessary and it is something that I know the Speaker 
is trying to encourage through increasing the assembly of members 
of parliament as people who represent Canadians in a less 
partisan way.  That would certainly be one way to improve the 
relationship of members in the House and the functioning of the 
House itself. 
<P><A NAME="LINK257"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, presuming the motion passes, and I am sure it will, you 
will be the chairman of the committee that will be looking at 
these changes, and I really welcome that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to present an argument in favour of something my 
colleague mentioned about saving time of the House by conducting 
votes whenever possible right after question period when all the 
members are already here.  I am sure the committee will want to 
look at whether there should be a change in how long the bells 
ring. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One very strong argument which I have not heard today with 
respect to changing the vote time is that it would not interrupt 
committees, particularly when we have witnesses.  I find it so 
disconcerting to have witnesses come from various parts of 
Canada, sometimes from far away, and lo and behold the bells 
start ringing and we give them the rush.  We tell them to hurry 
because we have to go and vote.  Then we do not go back to them. 
Many of them have had their presentations truncated because of 
that. 
That is a very strong argument for one of the things that my 
colleague presented.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the general decorum in the House, I agree with 
him 100%.  We should debate the issues, put forth our arguments 
and argue them in the way a lawyer argues in court.  I have been 
to court very seldom, and each time it was just to observe.  When 
I was there I never heard a lawyer yelling at a judge or at other 
lawyers.  They do not do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are there to present their case and to allow an opportunity 
for reason to prevail.  I really miss that in this place, as my 
colleague said.  Perhaps he wants to comment more.  My 
intervention is more a comment than a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is the key, letting 
reason prevail.  If there is no reason in what we do, we are 
irrational animals and the fact is that is what truly defines us. 
That is truly what enables us to achieve what we have certainly 
achieved in the history of humanity.  That is what we need in the 
House.  We need respect and decorum on both sides and we must let 
reason carry the day. 
<P><A NAME="LINK258"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney (Calgary Southeast, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for your forbearance in the chair.  I 
believe I am the last sheet to be hung here.  I commend you. I 
suspect you will be chair of the committee contemplated in the 
motion and I gather the deputy clerk is slated to be clerk as 
well.  Your presence late this evening indicates your commitment 
to this process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am also pleased to have seen the general quality of the debate 
and the spontaneity of most of the interventions contra the 
normal practice of too many members reading scripted speeches. 
Let me just say as a parenthetical remark that one parliamentary 
reform we ought to consider is the adoption of the rule of the 
Westminster mother parliament prohibiting verbatim reference to 
scripts for speech making in the House and allowing members to 
speak from their minds and not those of bureaucrats or their 
staff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wish to say at the outset that one of the reasons I chose to 
run, to represent my constituents and to serve in this place, for 
which I have enormous respect as something of an amateur student 
of parliamentary history, is precisely my great concern about the 
deterioration of democracy in Canada and the vitality of this 
institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been much commented on today but scholars such as 
Donald Savoie, a leading political scientist at the University of 
Moncton, three years ago published a book called <I>Governing 
from the Centre: the Concentration of Power in Canadian 
Politics</I> in which he quoted an anonymous member of this 
current government's cabinet as saying that the cabinet was 
nothing more than a focus group for the Prime Minister's Office. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said that the House of Commons was nothing more than a 
talking shop. In a sense he confirmed what we have always known, 
what the late Right Hon. Pierre Elliott Trudeau said, that 
members of parliament are nobodies 50 feet off the Hill.  I 
suspect that many people would agree that members of parliament 
outside the executive branch are essentially nobodies on the Hill 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I want to very pointedly argue that this has led 
to a kind of cynicism about this institution and, as my colleague 
before said, political institutions in general. Cynicism is a 
very corrosive thing when applied to institutions in a political 
culture that require trust and active involvement on the part of 
the citizenry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As long as people, voters, taxpayers and citizens regard this 
institution as a futile talking shop, a de facto electoral 
college for the executive branch, their faith in democracy and 
democratic institutions will be undermined and we will see the 
consequences of that.

<A HREF="#LINKT137"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In other words, we cannot take democracy for granted.  It is a 
system that has evolved.  This constitutional monarchy, with a 
democratic legislature and a representative legislature, is a 
system that has evolved over centuries of struggle.  It did not 
arrive overnight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is nothing to guarantee that it will exist in perpetuity. 
Neither a written constitution nor a judiciary filled with good 
intentions will preserve the democratic spirit of this 
constitutional monarchy.  All that will guarantee that in 
perpetuity is the will of the citizenry, and we corrode that with 
the kind of centralization of power which exists today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In an historical perspective, for centuries the commoners in 
this tradition fought the crown to obtain the power to represent 
their interests, particularly the power of the purse.  Over 
centuries, from the 14th century right through to the 20th 
century, that power was devolved from the crown into the 
legislature, into the Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the latter half of the last century in this parliament we 
have seen the delineation between the crown and the legislature 
blurred.  Essentially the ancient power and prerogatives of the 
medieval crown which were exercised with great authoritarian zeal 
in British monarchies have now been usurped by the prime 
minister. The prime minister, who acts in the name of the crown, 
has become a modern monarch for all intents and purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I am very concerned about the terms of reference 
and the title of this committee which calls for recommendations 
on the modernization and improvement of the procedures of the 
House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Virtually all changes in the standing orders over the years 
which have diminished the prerogatives and powers of individual 
members and the opposition parties to delay bills, to force 
further consideration of them, to add amendments, have occurred 
in the name of modernization, efficiency and improvement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The one mention in the throne speech of modernizing 
parliamentary practice was electronic voting.  What I heard was 
the government whip, a position with which you, Mr. Speaker, have 
some familiarity, wanting to reduce the time it takes for members 
to vote so as to remove from the opposition parties one of the 
few opportunities they yet have to filibuster government bills to 
which they are strenuously opposed, a tactic which has been 
employed by this and other opposition parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With electronic voting, a modernization, an efficiency measure, 
we would take less time to vote.  That is precisely the problem. 
Time is one of the very few levers at the disposal of the 
opposition to slow down the otherwise unrestrained juggernaut of 
government legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I send out a very strong caution to my colleagues at the outset 
of this committee.  We do not need to modernize this place.  We 
need to rediscover the ancient prerogatives which reside in this 
place that we have allowed to be diminished by the executive 
branch amending the standing orders year after year, decade after 
decade, and by convention centralizing power in the hands of the 
executive at the expense of this legislature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not need to modernize this place.  We need to reform it, 
and reform it in a radical way.  The Latin root of radical is 
actually roots.  We need to go back to our roots.  Radical reform 
means going back to our history, and that means understanding 
that we are individual actors, individual moral actors in this 
place as legislators, and not cogs in some wheel created by the 
executive branch. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the principal ways we could do this is by ending the 
absurd charade of the confidence convention.  I heard the 
government House leader say that it would require an amendment to 
the constitution.  That is absolute nonsense.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The topical issue even in today's <I>National Post</I> by

<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a mistake to believe the power of party discipline is 
carved in constitutional stone.  Parties were not mentioned in 
the original BNA Act of 1867.  For that matter, neither was the 
nature of the Cabinet, the powers of the prime minister, or in 
fact the basic principle of responsible government. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is absolutely no reason why the government could not, as 
previous governments have in the past 20 years, regard motions or 
bills defeated as simply motions and bills defeated, and not as 
measures of confidence in the government.  It is a ruse by which 
the whip maintains otherwise total control of his or her caucus 
and it is an aberration amongst the parliamentary forms of 
government, our sister parliaments in the Commonwealth.  Even our 
mother parliament allows far greater latitude in freedom of 
voting than we do in this place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My colleagues and the official opposition have outlined a whole 
series of potential reforms, 21 to be precise.  I will not be 
exhaustive in listing all those, except to say that the power of 
the free vote would be the most significant to wield. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I also hope that the special committee will not 
limit its purview so narrowly as to preclude consideration of 
broader democratic reforms which would require the involvement of 
the House, such as the adoption of recall measures, citizen 
initiated referenda measures and electoral reform, so that we 
could have a lower house that would actually reflect the 
plurality and diversity of political views in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we seize this opportunity with courage, we may actually be 
able to see a revival of the democratic spirit in this place. 
That is my hope.  Unfortunately, based on history, that is not my 
expectation.

of members opposite have mentioned their families and I would 
like to take this time to pay tribute to my mother, Mabel Evelyn 
Bagnell.  Without her I would not be here today.  I also thank 
members opposite for staying this late.  It is 1.30 in the 
morning and I will probably be the last speaker. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous speaker talked about pride in this institution and 
how important it is for our democracy.  I wish to go on record 
saying that I will always have pride in any contribution that I 
can make to this institution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The previous two speakers talked about a lack of power.  I will 
close by saying that, regardless of how many reforms we can get 
through, people should not lose faith or courage.  I remember 
back to what someone said tonight about the great parliamentarian 
Shaughnessy Cohen and what she accomplished under difficult 
circumstances.  We all have constraints in our lives. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of Joan and Doug Craig, who fought for years for a 
windmill, which now exists on a mountain in the Yukon.  I think 
of Ross Findlater and George Green who, without any authority 
created an anti-poverty coalition, which has done great things in 
the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of the thousands of volunteers who, with no paid job or 
any authority and in this year of the volunteer, have moved 
mountains and created great things in the Yukon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think of Mother Teresa who, without a seat in any parliament 
or without any legislative authority, created great things in the 
world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Finally, I think of the Chinese student who stood in front of 
that tank in the great film clip. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We in the House and all Canadians should take power because we 
can make a difference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am overwhelmed.  I do 
not know what to say, but I thank the member for his 
intervention. 
<P><A NAME="LINK260"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. James Rajotte (Edmonton Southwest, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I was very interested in what the 
member was saying.  I know he has very extensive knowledge of how 
parliaments work and parliamentary history.  I know he referenced 
the famous book <I>Governing from the Centre: the Concentration 
of Power in Canadian Politics</I> by Donald Savoie. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He and other parliamentary historians have talked about how, for 
the first 50 years of our nation, we had great involvement by 
private members.  It was really a parliamentary democracy at that 
point and then it moved into more of a cabinet democracy, 
particularly in the 1950s. 
Today, here and now in the 21st century, we basically have what 
he calls court government, which is exactly as the hon. member 
described.  We are almost back to having a monarch again.  We are 
almost in pre-Magna Carta times.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I fully agree that we should not modernize this place.  We must 
democratize this place.  I agree the confidence convention and 
the free vote are the most important aspects of democratizing 
this place.  Besides the confidence convention and the free vote, 
what other suggestions would the hon. member make to really 
restore this place to true parliamentary democracy? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jason Kenney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the notion of increasing 
the votability of private members' bills would tremendously 
empower MPs as independent legislators.  Yet again, because there 
is something of a convention of quasi free votes on those 
matters, I think we would see many good ideas coming forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I also think it is time for us to seriously consider 
complementing what is best about this institution and reviving it 
by taking power that exists in the Prime Minister's Office and 
giving it to people.  I am a cynic.  I am a pessimist.  We could 
change the standing orders of this place, but the conventions 
exist.  The centralization of power exists not because of the 
standing orders but because of politics and power and because of 
ambition and the desire of people to get into cabinet, to get 
parliamentary secretaryships or even to take trifling trips 
abroad.  As long as those carrots and sticks exist in the Prime 
Minister's Office I am afraid that amendments to the standing 
orders such as those contemplated by this committee will not be 
sufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For that reason I would like to empower directly the people 
through measures such as citizen initiated referenda, where the 
people could bring forward measures for the consideration of this 
parliament and the electorate as a whole which government or the 
legislature is unwilling or unable to consider itself.  That, I 
think, would also be an effective check and balance against the 
increasing centralization of political power in the hands of the 
courts, a matter which is of grave concern to myself and my 
colleagues as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  There being no further members 
rising, pursuant to order made Thursday, March 15, the motion is 
deemed adopted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>(Motion agreed to) 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Accordingly the House stands 
adjourned until later this day at 10 a.m., pursuant to Standing 
Order 24.
