gophers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They are calling on the federal government to amend regulations 
to permit the sale of concentrated liquid strychnine to 
registered farmers until an effective alternative can be found. 
Gophers are destroying hundreds of acres of pasture and grain 
land every year and to a great extent the farmers are powerless 
to stop them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The petitioners hope their petition will convince the federal 
government to relax the restrictions on strychnine poison so that 
farmers can get the gopher problem under control.  We appreciate 
the opportunity to bring this grave and serious problem to the 
attention of the House.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>QUESTIONS ON THE ORDER PAPER 
</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK15"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee (Parliamentary Secretary to Leader of the 
Government in the House of Commons, Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
ask that all questions be allowed to stand. 
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I rise on a point of order.  I have a number of 
questions that have been on the order paper in excess of 60 days. 
I should not have to remind the House that the answers to those 
questions are very important to individual members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Under Standing Order 39 we are allowed to put four questions on 
the order paper.  The questions I have on the order paper, which 
the government has been very slow and reluctant to answer, are 
questions that have to do with HRDC. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have been on my feet on numerous occasions but it basically 
boils down to the fact that if the government fails to answer 
those questions, it restricts my ability to do my job.  It is as 
simple as that.  I would like the government to recognize the 
problem and do something about it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point I made last week was that if a cabinet minister wanted 
those same questions answered, they would be answered within 24 
hours.  I and everyone in the House knows that the full resources 
of the government would kick into action to get answers to very 
important questions.  However, when it is on this side of the 
House, nothing happens. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I would request that you, just out of curiosity, 
examine the record.  Many members of parliament are not using 
questions on the order paper.  The reason is that they get 
frustrated and just simply give up waiting for the government to 
answer those questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The point of this is simply that it restricts our ability to do 
our jobs in the House when the government fails to co-operate 
with opposition members of parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, please do what you can to ensure that the 
government responds to those questions on the order paper. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Derek Lee:</B>  Madam Speaker, one would not be critical 
at all of the hon. member for urging a prompt reply to his 
questions.  However, he is a frequent intervener on this subject 
and we might as well use the time, in reply to his intervention, 
to point out again to him the provisions of Standing Order 
39(5)(b) which states very clearly that if the answer to a 
member's question has taken more than 45 days, he or she has the 
right and ability to transfer the matter for debate at 
adjournment proceedings.  That is a remedy of which the hon. 
member may wish to avail himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If he does not do that, I assure him that the government is 
doing everything in reasonably prompt fashion to obtain answers 
to the questions that he put in writing.  My records show that 
there are 10 questions out of approximately 50 where the reply 
has exceeded the 45 day window and his 1 or 2 questions are among 
those 10. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I acknowledge that the reply has taken more than 45 days but I 
do not accept the motive alleged by the hon. member that the 
government just does not care about providing answers.  It does 
and we will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Shall all questions 
stand? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—NATIONAL DRINKING WATER STANDARDS 
</H4><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK20"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC)</B> moved: 
<A NAME="LINK21">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should act 
with the provinces and territories to establish enforceable 
national drinking water standards that would be enshrined in a 
Safe Water Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Madam Speaker, before I begin my remarks I want to 
inform the House that I will have the privilege of sharing my 
time in this 20 minute spot with the right hon. member for 
Calgary Centre. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Essentially what the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada is 
advocating is that we pull out one plank of the election platform 
we presented to Canadians in the election campaign of this past 
November, and that was to enshrine into law national drinking 
water standards.  What we would be doing is sending a signal that 
wherever one resides in this country, the quality of drinking 
water to be consumed would be the same whether one is in St. 
John's, Newfoundland, St-Jean, Quebec, Fort St. John, British 
Columbia or even here in the House of Commons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to read the motion into the record: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should act 
with the provinces and territories to establish enforceable 
national drinking water standards that would be enshrined in a 
Safe Water Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is a finite resource.  There is no substitute for it.  Yet 
until recently, this precious necessity did not share the same 
level of public importance as other limited resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tragic events in Walkerton, Ontario and more recently in North 
Battleford, Saskatchewan have highlighted the consequences of 
taking this critical resource for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public confidence of Canadians has been shaken.  We have 
learned the hard lesson that water is the simplest tool for 
distributing infection and can create massive deadly epidemics. 
Yet today, a year after the Walkerton tragedy unfolded, there are 
no new federal laws enforcing minimum water quality standards in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1990 the former minister of the environment, the hon. Lucien 
Bouchard, launched Canada's green plan, an ambitious framework to 
help make Canada an environmentally friendly country.  In the 
ensuing framework for discussion on the environment document that 
was produced from that green plan, the Progressive Conservative 
government identified three gaps in Canadian environmental 
protection that needed to be addressed.  Canada was weak in its 
ability to protect species at risk or wildlife and there was a 
need to upgrade our existing pesticide legislation, which is 
still over 30 years old, and to provide a safe drinking water 
supply for all Canadians.  I point out that all three of these 
issues have yet to be addressed despite eight years of Liberal 
government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In contrast, when we look at the record of activities of the 
Progressive Conservative government, which introduced the green 
plan I just spoke of, it was the Progressive Conservative 
government that had the courage to negotiate an acid rain 
protocol with the Americans.  That same government led the 
international world in 1987 in what was called the Montreal 
protocol, which led the international community in the banning of 
ozone depleting gases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Perhaps one of the hallmarks of that government was the 
introduction of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, our 
principal piece of legislation for the control and use of toxins 
within our environment.  At the time it was categorized as a very 
pioneering bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we still have some gaps that need to be filled.  Today, 
some 10 years after that framework was released, the Liberal 
government has yet to pass a significant piece of new 
environmental legislation.  It has merely renewed existing bills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Prior to being elected in 1993, the Liberals flagged a very real 
concern to Canadians:  that the protection of drinking water was 
paramount.  I will now read from a document which I would be 
pleased to share a copy of with the House.  It was produced on 
June 23, 1993, by the then House leader David Dingwall on behalf 
the then opposition leader, now the Prime Minister of Canada, and 
the then whip, now the public works minister, a member of 
parliament from the province of Quebec.  In it they flagged quite 
clearly that it was paramount to ensure drinking water safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They even went on to produce a chart that they called Tory 
environmental mismanagement.  They said there was no legislation 
with respect to drinking water safety.  That was their position.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Madam Speaker, I am sure you have actually read some of these 
red books and other documents which we may actually want to refer 
to.  As we go through the historical references, perhaps one of 
the notes that is most shocking is on Bill C-76, a bill that was 
introduced by the government to protect drinking water in Canada 
and then re-introduced.  The press release produced by your 
government, which I am sure you are familiar with, stated: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This Act will provide enforceable national health standards for 
all materials that come into contact with drinking water...This 
Act goes a long way to maintaining and improving the health of 
Canadians. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada is now saying it would not want to make 
a foray into what it considers to be perhaps provincial 
jurisdiction.  The Progressive Conservative Party has always been 
very respectful of the jurisdictional boundaries that actually 
exist in this magical country we call Canada, but it is very 
revisionist to actually take that perspective in light of what 
was said only a few years back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know that the hallmark of the Liberal Party of Canada is 
revision.  That is characterized by the issue of free trade.  It 
fought us tooth and nail on it in 1988 and 1993 and now embraces 
the concept.  We welcome the Liberals on board on that particular 
aspect of public policy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With no new legislation on the books, the Progressive 
Conservative Party believes that the time to act is long overdue. 
All Canadians deserve access to a clean and safe water supply. We 
made this commitment in our last election platform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our nation is fortunate enough to claim one-fifth of the world's 
freshwater resources.  Thirsty nations throughout the world are 
trying, unsuccessfully, I might add, to buy our precious 
resource.  Instead we preach conservation and preservation and 
admirably invest millions annually into CIDA projects that 
improve water treatment, sewage, irrigation and pollution control 
systems.  Yet here at home Canadians find it shocking that we 
cannot guarantee to our own citizens the security of our water 
supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal-provincial subcommittee on drinking water, a branch 
of the federal-provincial advisory committee on environmental and 
occupational health, currently defines national guidelines for 
acceptable drinking water quality.  However, these Canadian 
guidelines are just that, guidelines.  They are not legally 
binding and they provide inadequate national protection for our 
drinking water. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the Progressive Conservative Party is attempting to 
demonstrate is that Canadians have concerns about the quality of 
their drinking water.  Recent events in Walkerton and North 
Battleford have added to those concerns.  My Conservative 
colleagues and I are here, therefore, to propose concrete 
solutions.  All Canadians need to be assured of the quality of 
the water they drink anywhere in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All my life I have had great respect for the diversity of our 
country. 
All during my political life I have had, and continue to have, 
respect for the jurisdictions of the provinces and of the 
federal government.  I was present when Bill C-20 was passed.  I 
voted against it.  I would like it to be known that I will 
respect other provincial areas of responsibility, such as 
education. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are certain issues that actually transcend jurisdictional 
boundaries.  In the perspective we advocate, we understand that 
there is a shared jurisdiction between the federal government and 
the provinces in the delivery of drinking water and the setting 
of guidelines or, what we are now advocating, standards for safe 
drinking water. 
We believe that these standards must be enshrined in law in order 
to guarantee quality drinking water throughout the country.  In 
addition, these standards should be revised on an ongoing basis.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, studies reveal that Canadian guidelines are far 
behind the U.S. in their level and breadth of protection.  There 
are substances prohibited by the Americans that do not even 
appear in Canadian guidelines.  In some instances, permissible 
levels of some identified dangerous substances are set much lower 
in the U.S. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One such example is cryptosporidium, the substance that is 
suspected of killing three residents in North Battleford, 
Saskatchewan.  The U.S. has both cryptosporidium and E. coli 
mandatory standards.  Canadian guidelines address only total and 
fecal coliforms, which includes E. coli.  The U.S. EPA requires 
filtration treatment for cryptosporidium while Canada has no 
mandatory treatment for eliminating this parasite from our water 
supply systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Jurisdictional matters do indeed complicate the control of our 
drinking water supplies, but this is not a barrier we should 
fear.  We have to pull together regardless of partisan lines so 
we can protect our drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why the Progressive Conservative Party has selected very 
benign language in its motion.  It is not partisan.  It is not 
provocative.  It clearly states that we have to be respectful of 
provincial and territorial jurisdictions.  It clearly infers that 
this is something all members of the House should embrace and 
support.  However, even though there are different jurisdictions, 
this should not deter the federal government from its leadership 
role in maintaining public health and safety in order to protect 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to note that the Progressive Conservative Party 
does not encourage overlap and duplication but rather seeks to 
harmonize its efforts with the provinces and territories while 
creating a minimum national standard for all Canadians.  If there 
is a provincial law in place, the federal law need not apply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I seek the support of all members of the House for our party's 
motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK22"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member who just spoke and the 
opposition party that has introduced this motion should be 
congratulated because this is an important issue and we should 
debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will put a very quick question to the member for Fundy—Royal. 
He is proposing national standards brought in by the federal 
government, which I presume he means should be legislated 
standards.  There is resistance in Ontario to any imposition of 
federal standards in just about any area of provincial 
jurisdiction.  Is he proposing that we should bring in 
legislation setting national standards for water quality and 
provide penalties that will force the provinces to comply? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, my response is threefold. 
First, the language in the motion says that we need to act with 
the provincial and territorial governments.  Second, I wish to 
inform the hon. member that I have been in contact with Elizabeth 
Witmer's office.  She is currently the environment minister in 
the Ontario government.  I told her office what we were advancing 
in the House of Commons and received no opposition in that 
regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also, we are looking to the federal government to provide some 
leadership and act with the provincial and territorial 
governments.  I am very appreciative of the hon. member's 
response to this.  He says it is a very important question. Given 
that our party wants to do this in a collaborative fashion with 
provincial and territorial governments, I genuinely hope the 
member would support our motion. 
<P><A NAME="LINK23"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I too want to congratulate the member and his party on 
this initiative.  I have been a supporter of this debate for a 
long time.  Using an opposition day to bring this issue to the 
floor of the House is something I totally support.  I will be 
voting in favour of this motion.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also bring to the attention of the House, because we are not 
the only House that is seized with this issue, that Senator 
Grafstein has Bill S-18 on the floor over there, an act to amend 
the Food and Drug Act for clean drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Using the language of the member about non-partisan 
collaboration, let us get on with it.  It may be a consideration, 
and I do not know the logistics of this, that the House could 
come together, because there already is proposed legislation, and 
somehow take the work of the great senator, bring it over here 
and pass the bill immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I compliment the member 
for the tenor of his response.  The work of Senator Grafstein has 
been incredibly constructive and is doing what private members' 
bills should do within the House and the Senate.  That is to be 
provocative and advance issues of public policy that require 
debate.  Senator Grafstein should indeed be congratulated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure of the road map and the proposal of Senator 
Grafstein in terms of how he wants to accomplish this end.  We 
can perhaps debate that later.  The spirit of what Senator 
Grafstein and the Progressive Party want is essentially the same. 
However we obviously have to include provincial and territorial 
governments in that equation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I again applaud Senator Grafstein for his initiative. 
<P><A NAME="LINK24"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark (Calgary Centre, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, 
I begin by congratulating my colleague from Fundy—Royal, not 
only for introducing the motion but also for the leadership he 
has shown on the environmental issue throughout his time in the 
House of Commons, working obviously as these recent questions 
have indicated, with other concerned members of the House of 
Commons of all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the interest of urgency on the bill, I would like to move an 
amendment to the bill.  I move: 
<A NAME="LINK25">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by inserting the word “immediately” 
after the word “act”. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That would simply allow us to move forward more quickly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  The amendment is in 
order. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, when we speak about 
clean water, we are speaking about the most basic expectations of 
our citizens.  This is not about some rare disease that may 
strike strangers in some far off place.  This is about what our 
children drink every day in every part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For most of our lives, most of our citizens have believed that 
our water would be clean, that it would be safe for our kids, for 
elderly Canadians and safe for all of us.  However the water that 
Canadians drink today is not as safe as it should be.  It is not 
as safe as it could be.  That has been demonstrated by two 
separate tragedies, one last week in North Battleford, 
Saskatchewan and the other a year ago in Walkerton, Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For years experts have warned of the need to improve Canada's 
water safety.  As long ago as 1990, as my colleague indicated, 
the green plan of the then Progressive Conservative government 
warned of “important gaps in the federal government's 
environmental legislation, particularly in regard to assuring the 
safety of drinking water”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was part of that government.  The minister who launched the 
green plan was Lucien Bouchard.  Ten years later those 
legislative gaps still exist.  The Liberal government has sadly 
not treated environmental safety as the priority it should have 
and now the headlines report that Canadians are dying because of 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a broad new fear that environmental health standards 
have fallen.  The fear is real because two things have happened 
together.  First, there are more threats to health.  Second, 
there is less protection for health. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1035"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT6"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The money that governments spend on protection has been cut and 
the factors that could contaminate water have grown.  What is 
certain is that the sources of danger will grow as communities 
become more crowded, as infrastructure crumbles, grows old and is 
not renewed and as new elements enter the environment.  If the 
threats to citizens grow so too does the responsibility of 
governments.  These are matters which most citizens cannot 
protect on their own.  Society has a clear responsibility which 
it is the duty of governments to exercise. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Undoubtedly, that issue compels us to ask ourselves, first, 
which government has to act and which one can take action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is a provincial jurisdiction in the first place, but the 
federal government also has a responsibility, which evolves from 
its more specific but equally important jurisdiction. As for the 
municipalities, they are called upon to manage several areas 
related to water quality and distribution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If those governments co-operate and work hand in hand, we will 
have adequate water quality and be able to maintain it. 
However, if the various levels of government fight between 
themselves over matters of jurisdiction, the quality of our 
water will be affected and our children will suffer from it. 
Still more deaths will make headlines in the news media. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So let us be clear with regard to jurisdictions. Let us be as 
clear as we would wish our water to be. The first jurisdiction 
in that area belongs to provinces, but the federal government, 
under its criminal law power, is responsible for health 
protection and public security at the national level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, there are only guidelines and these vary from 
province to province. In concrete terms, it means that the life 
of your children might be more at risk if they drink water in 
your province than that of children living in another province. 
We need to set common standards. 
We must ensure they are respected and we must do so by 
respecting both the rights of the provinces concerning their 
jurisdictions and the rights of the citizens concerning their 
health. This is the objective of this motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must start by recognizing that there are too many deaths, 
that the guidelines are too weak and that this is a shared 
responsibility. Thus, the different levels of government must 
work together at establishing standards and ways to ensure these 
rights are being respected. Only then will these weak guidelines 
transform into standards that the citizens can rely on. Where 
the jurisdiction is provincial, the means to ensure the respect 
of these standards may be provincial in nature. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one is more sensitive to constitutional issues than I. 
I have spent a major part of my life trying to find ways for the 
different levels of government of working together in a spirit 
of mutual respect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of these efforts, we have been able, for example, to 
launch the Francophonie. We have invited the provinces to 
participate fully in negotiations toward a free trade agreement. 
We have entered into an agreement on acid rain, as well as other 
environmental initiatives. Even through all these processes, we 
have firmly respected provincial jurisdictions, as well as the 
interests of the citizens of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, when the issue is the quality of the water that our 
children are drinking, are we going to hide behind the veil of 
jurisdictions or are we going to try to find solutions to allow 
governments to co-operate for the well-being of our children? 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion respects the federal partnership.  It allows 
enforcement.  It increases protection at a time when citizens 
feel protection is gradually falling away.  It forces the federal 
government, entirely within its limited jurisdiction, to stop 
hiding and to start leading.  It gives society a chance to send a 
strong signal through an enforceable commitment to clean water, 
an enforceable commitment supported on the floor of the House of 
Commons of Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I very much hope that Canadians who are concerned about the 
issue will take this opportunity to move forward on the motion 
and move Canada toward a situation where there will be no more 
deaths at North Battleford, no more deaths in Ontario and no more 
risk of death from the thing that Canadians should be able to 
count on above all else, which is the safety and the cleanliness 
of our drinking water. 
<P><A NAME="LINK26"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid (Lanark—Carleton, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I want to ask the hon. gentleman a couple of 
questions with regard to his eloquent speech. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He defended very eloquently the rights of provinces to be 
autonomous in their own areas of jurisdiction.  Of course that is 
not what the motion says.  I think the hon. gentleman may have 
reconsidered how he wanted to phrase his words before the House 
when he realized the Bloc Quebecois would not be supporting him. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Frankly, I look at the federal record on water in areas that are 
within the federal government's jurisdiction and it is 
deplorable.  We do not see that being addressed here.  This is 
one area where the federal government could act effectively, 
forcefully and could improve a standard which quite frankly is 
the worst in the country, not the best.  The federal government 
has shown no leadership.  On the contrary, the federal government 
has been the worst offender in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will make the point that will allow me to raise the question. 
Last Friday it was reported that Matthew Coon Come had observed 
that one in eight aboriginal communities, areas where the water 
supply was under the federal jurisdiction, had unsafe water.  A 
1995 report indicated that one in five aboriginal communities had 
substandard water of the 171 reserves across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another area that is under federal jurisdiction is the— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  What is your question?  It is a speech. 
Come on, a question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  There will be one 
Chair in this place.  I have permitted a lot of members at least 
a minute to put their question, so let us show the same respect 
to the hon. member.  Would the hon. member please put his 
question since there are other members yet to speak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Reid:</B>  Madam Speaker, the other area under the 
federal jurisdiction where there are problems is on military 
bases, for example at Valcartier.  The federal government has not 
taken action and did not take action for years with regard to 
pollution affecting the town of Shannon in Quebec.  We see a 
federal government which has taken no leadership action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why does the hon. gentleman's motion not focus on setting a 
federal leadership role in areas that are directly under the 
federal government's jurisdiction so that it can lead by example. 
Why is that absent from his motion? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, any fair reading of 
the motion will realize that it provides plenty of latitude for 
the kinds of legitimate questions with regard to federal 
jurisdiction raised by the hon. member.  I come from the 
tradition on the environmental issue of the acid rain treaty.  I 
knew when we were going to the United States to get agreement on 
the acid rain treaty that we had to have clean hands at home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no doubt that the federal jurisdiction we are talking 
about is of two kinds.  One is a specific jurisdiction under the 
criminal law power.  That is a narrow jurisdiction, but it is 
there and it is well established.  I know the hon. member, as 
someone who studies these things, recognizes that that 
jurisdiction is soundly founded and must be protected in the 
national interest. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other responsibility is for federal leadership.  This is the 
parliament of the national government.  This is the parliament 
that is able to persuade legislatures everywhere else in the 
country to assume their responsibility.  Can we do that more 
effectively if our hands are clean and if the conditions are 
better on reserves and in federal lands?  Of course we can.  If 
there is going to be a serious attempt by the national government 
to try to encourage that kind of action on all fronts, in all the 
places where jurisdiction or responsibility lies, then obviously 
we have to exert that kind of leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I welcome the hon. member's interest in these specific issues. I 
hope he will not confine that interest to those Canadians who 
live on reserves or those Canadians who live in Valcartier.  I 
hope he will share an equal concern about Canadians across the 
country who today are more at risk than they have been before 
because the communities are growing and pressures are growing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Not just me, but Canadians in general, the people who would have 
preferred not to be ill or who would have preferred not to have 
seen fatalities in Walkerton or in North Battleford, need 
stronger standards.

change and improve the standard of health and cleanliness of 
Canadian water.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  On just a point of clarity, Madam Speaker, I wish to 
understand from the member who just spoke:  Does he mean that if 
we set national standards we should force compliance on the part 
of the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, the way I would 
approach that and the way I have approached it in the past is to 
work out agreements with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member can shrug, and I understand that, but I have 
seen both ways work.  I have seen agreements reached when the 
federal government was prepared to go some distance on its own to 
clean its own hands going into those discussions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not believe we get very far by pretending there are not 
provincial jurisdictions and riding over them.  I think that 
becomes counterproductive.  It gets people's backs up.  It makes 
solutions less possible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe in a phrase used by a former leader of the hon. 
gentleman's party.  I believe in co-operative federalism.  I 
think it is the spirit of the country.  That is the kind of 
federalism that I would like to apply in this instance:  getting 
agreement, forcing agreement by the force of persuasion, by the 
force of example, and then writing it into law. 
<P><A NAME="LINK28"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, building on the point that the Canadian Alliance member 
touched on and as the right hon. leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party stated, if we use our jurisdiction on reserves 
to create a model water quality agreement then by example that 
could have an effect on provinces and municipalities and respect 
the provincial jurisdiction about which especially the province 
of Quebec is concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, that is a very 
constructive suggestion.  I believe it also falls within the 
ambit of the motion now before the House. 
<P><A NAME="LINK29"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, does the right hon. member not think that the water 
problems we are having are just the tip of the iceberg, an 
iceberg that probably started surfacing about 50 years ago when 
it came to the decline in Canada's infrastructure? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Truckers are telling us about bridges that were built in 1955 
which they are afraid to drive over.  We have sewage treatment 
plants that are archaic.  We have water treatment plants that no 
one seems to know whether or not they work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does he not think that this is just the tip of the iceberg, one 
that should have been addressed probably 30 years ago and now we 
are just starting to see the repercussions from this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Joe Clark:</B>  Madam Speaker, the short answer to 
that is yes.  The deteriorating infrastructure problem is a 
serious complication.  It has been aggravated in recent years 
because the drive to expenditure reduction has meant that 
investment which should have gone into infrastructure to keep 
things up to date has been delayed.  We are paying the price for 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The only thing I would add is that there are other factors here. 
More people are moving to small communities.  There is greater 
diversity of commercial activity in various communities, as the 
hon. member would know coming as he does from Red Deer.  That has 
environmental implications.  There are changes in the various 
environmental factors that can affect water, but there is no 
doubt that infrastructure is one important element of this and 
has to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would add in closing there needs to be a law on the books that 
encourages governments to act and not let these issues slip away. 
That is why we would propose to bring together the provinces and 
federal government to establish standards and then to enshrine 
them in a law on which Canadians could count and any government 
could not ignore.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister 
of Health,  Lib.):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I first want to say that I will be sharing my time with 
the member for Toronto—Danforth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion by the representatives of the Progressive 
Conservative Party provides an opportunity for a valuable debate 
not only on the quality of water, but on the organization of the 
Canadian federation and on the allocation of responsibilities 
among the various levels, the federal government, the provinces 
and the municipalities, in the management of a resource as vital 
as water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The opposition motion proposes national standards that would be 
not only directives or recommendations but requirements 
enshrined in a safe water act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nothing separates us from the Progressive Conservative Party in 
our concern for the need to protect a safe environment and the 
right to safe and quality drinking water throughout Canada.  I 
consider it a fundamental right, which we must help guarantee, 
at all levels of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we see the tragedies and problems occurring in Walkerton, 
North Battleford and other regions in Canada, I think it is high 
time we took a look at water quality, of course, but also at the 
way we manage our environment and our most precious heritage, 
which helps us survive each day, namely, our air, our water and 
our land, the various contaminants and categories of waste. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A debate on water quality is of interest to all Canadians.  It 
gives the government an opportunity to make known its share of 
the responsibility in the area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me first say that our government has promised to increase 
funding for research into the effects of toxins on our health, 
including research on endocrine disrupting chemicals, on heavy 
metals that pose special risks for children, on specific toxic 
substances and on the cumulative effects of all toxins on our 
health. This is a commitment that we made, and is one that we will 
fulfil. It is a commitment that will have a concrete impact on 
water quality across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, Health Canada will continue and enhance work on the 
drinking water guidelines. These guidelines are developed based 
on lifetime exposure to a specific contaminant, thereby 
addressing concerns with cumulative effects. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Health Canada's safe environments program acts as the technical 
secretariat to the federal-provincial subcommittee on drinking 
water, the entity responsible for the development of guidelines 
for Canadian drinking water quality. The guidelines establish 
health based limits for contaminants of drinking water. They are 
meant to apply to all drinking water supplies, both public and 
private, whether the source water comes from a lake or river, or 
from a well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The subcommittee, which includes representatives from all 
provinces and territories as well as the federal government, is 
a very good example of federal-provincial-territorial 
collaboration in place to ensure the safety of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is Health Canada's role in this subcommittee? Health Canada 
develops the scientific documents used by the subcommittee to 
establish acceptable concentrations for contaminants in drinking 
water. Health Canada provides provincial and territorial 
governments with the best scientific data on biological, 
chemical and radiological contaminants found in drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the past thirty years, this system has worked well and 
Health Canada has developed a strong working relationship with 
each of the provinces and territories. Health Canada 
provides the provinces and territories with the best scientific 
data available and co-ordinates the flow of information across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines are used in a number of ways. 
They are truly the cornerstone for all drinking water quality 
across Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provinces and territories use them as the benchmark for 
their own enforceable standards, guidelines and objectives. 
Each province and territory has developed its own method to 
incorporate the guidelines to best fit its needs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some provinces have developed regulations, based on the 
guidelines, while others require that all national health-based 
guidelines be met. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Guidelines are also used at the federal level with respect to 
areas of federal jurisdiction, such as in connection with first 
nations, or on federal lands, and so forth. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines also set the standard for the quality of 
bottled water and water used in food production. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These guidelines are very much a work in progress: as new 
research, monitoring data, analytical methodology or treatment 
processes become available, existing guidelines can be and are 
re-evaluated and kept current. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By definition, these guidelines are not mandatory.  However, I 
would like to take a moment to tell the House that to date 
this method has been very largely effective in safeguarding the 
quality of our drinking water.  Canada is the second largest 
country in the world, with an incredibly diverse geography, and 
there are many differences between the regions with respect to 
source water quality, availability and quantity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines developed by the joint committee must be applied 
appropriately in the various provinces and territories in order 
to be effective.  Risk management in this case is best done by 
the people who know their territory best. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government acknowledges that the provinces know 
their water best and that they can use the federal guidelines 
in the most effective way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government were to mandate that every province 
follow the guidelines, line by line, or face stiff penalties, 
some provinces would spend a lot of public money testing 
substances that are not even found in their territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By leaving it up to the provinces to interpret the guidelines in 
the way that makes sense and is appropriate for them, the 
federal government allows them to make the most appropriate risk 
management decisions, and also gives them an opportunity to 
assume their responsibilities in making the most judicious use 
possible of taxpayers' money by not testing for substances that 
might not even exist in their territory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It bears repeating that the provinces know their geographical 
territory best, and are best left to control the quality of 
their drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In summary, I wish to say that the safety of Canadian water 
requires a multi-layered approach, which includes the protection 
of the source water, the effectiveness of the water treatment 
process, the training of treatment plant operators, the 
distribution of the treated water and the safety of the 
materials that come in contact with drinking water throughout 
the entire process. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these elements cannot be the responsibility of just one 
level of government or of the federal government alone.  A 
division of responsibilities has become established over the 
years, which is also consistent with our constitution and which 
requires the provincial and municipal levels to play a role, 
with the support, as I mentioned, of the federal government 
through the work being done by Health Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am proud of what we have been able to achieve in collaboration 
with the provinces and territories.  I believe the steps we have 
all taken in light of the recent tragedies will ensure we 
maintain the safety of our drinking water supplies for all 
Canadians. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask for unanimous consent of the House to move the 
following amendment: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the motion be amended by replacing the words “to 
establish” with the following: “respecting their jurisdiction 
to ensure”. 
</UL>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  Is there unanimous 
consent? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  The tenor of the language that we utilized in the shaping 
of the motion was to provide a high degree of flexibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In keeping with that same tenor and trying to make the issue as 
non-partisan as we possibly can, I ask the member if a subsequent 
member could reintroduce the amendment while we have a chance to 
talk among our colleagues and reflect upon the wording. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Bakopanos):</B>  As it is, I would 
like to advise hon. members that there is a motion already on the 
floor that was moved by the right hon. leader of the Progressive 
Conservative Party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will have to take this amendment under advisement because we 
cannot have two motions to amend a motion on the floor at the 
same time. 
<P><A NAME="LINK31"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I wish to compliment the member for Fundy—Royal on 
bringing this issue to the floor of the House of Commons today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As many members will know, over the last few months a number of 
us have been seized with this issue.  We have been trying hard to 
work on terms of reference that would be acceptable to all 
parties for a special committee of the House that would move this 
debate forward.  We want to make sure that the security of our 
freshwater, the quality of our drinking water and all facets 
related to water are dealt with in a proper fashion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was particularly reassured today, and it is the reason I will 
be supporting the motion, that all members who have spoken to the 
motion have said that it is not a partisan issue.  It is an issue 
on which we all have to come together.   We all have to figure 
out a way to make sure that laws are put in place to ensure the 
quality of our drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that we first begin by acknowledging the 
work of Senator Grafstein in the other place.  He tabled Bill 
S-18, an act to amend the Food and Drugs Act dealing with clean 
drinking water.  I believe it is at second reading right now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to all members, their staff, other legislators, 
journalists, environmentalists and people interested in the issue 
to get a hold of Senator Grafstein's bill.  I am sure the 
research he has done in this area would be deemed acceptable to 
the point where we could move the bill from the Senate into the 
House of Commons.  Together we could create an historic moment 
where the Senate and the House of Commons, in the interest of all 
Canadians, would work together to ensure that we have clean 
drinking water in every part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health suggested 
an amendment to the main motion a few minutes ago that talked 
about making sure we are respectful of provincial jurisdictions. 
It is a very important amendment which hopefully the member for 
Fundy—Royal will accept.  It would be a tragic day in the House 
if we could not get together, because there was some unease by 
the Bloc Quebecois and other members who felt we were trying to 
interfere with provincial jurisdiction.

<A HREF="#LINKT12"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is not the essence of the motion.  We understand the 
provinces jealously guard their areas of jurisdiction and that we 
had a tremendous disaster in terms of water quality in Ontario. 
The world knows about it.  We are very sensitive because on an 
issue like this one Canadians do not want for a moment to be 
criticizing one another. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must get together to resolve the problem.  We must make an 
effort to put forward the collective will of all parties of the 
House to make drinking water better for everyone in the country 
and perhaps even a template for the world.  It would be awful if 
through a few words the spirit of good will were to fall apart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is very important that all members support the amendment and 
that we respect provincial jurisdictions.  It is no secret that 
traditionally I have a reputation for being a passionate 
centralist and interventionist.  This has been my political 
background.  The issue is so fragile and important that if we are 
to create a national will all of us will have to put a drop of 
water in our wine.  We will have to bend a little and park some 
of our traditional philosophical views.  Nothing is more 
important than the quality of our drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a nation we have a very special trust not only for Canadians 
but for the rest of the world.  I hope the debate will lead to 
the next part of the discussion on water technologies.  As a 
nation we have some of the best water purification technologies 
on the planet.  We have a responsibility to take that technology 
and make sure other parts of the world that are disadvantaged get 
to share it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The whole area of water purification technology will end up as 
another issue for debate, which is very important.  On this issue 
we cannot just think about our own constituents and our own 
country.  We have to reach out to the rest of the world and share 
the technology. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the next little while another issue will be water and our 
trade agreements.  There is no mistake about it.  In 1995 I spoke 
to Mr. Nelson Riis' private member's bill banning bulk water 
exports.  I supported his bill, but when we get into the area of 
water eventually we come to issues that are explosive and 
sensitive for us and the House of Commons must deal with them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the spirit of today's debate will continue.  When our 
House leaders get together tomorrow I hope they will put the 
special committee of the House on track so that it can move ahead 
on these issues.  We need to deal with them in a constructive way 
by bringing in some of the best minds in our country and in other 
countries to talk to us about all facets of water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I should like to make one final point which I touched on in my 
question to the right hon. leader of the Progressive Conservative 
Party.  It has to do with water quality on Indian reserves.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development has done 
a tremendous amount of work on this issue.  I believe, without 
causing any problems with our provincial or municipal friends, 
that if we started working on the quality of drinking water in an 
area where we have constitutional jurisdiction such as on 
reserves this would be a great beginning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we could have the best quality of drinking water on our 
Indian reserves, it could be a template or a model which other 
municipalities or provinces could voluntarily pick up.  It would 
save some of the potential for disagreement or interference. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I appeal to the House that we urge the Minister of Indian 
Affairs and Northern Development to put that file on a fast 
forward track to a jurisdiction where we have nobody holding us 
back.  We should make sure that our reserves have the best 
drinking water in Canada and then we could build from there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate the hon. member for Fundy—Royal on the motion 
today.  I hope that it leads to a long and vigorous debate on all 
facets of the security of freshwater in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Lebel (Chambly, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I wish to 
congratulate the hon. member for Toronto—Danforth for his recent 
conversion to the virtues of fully complying with the 
constitution. This is a great novelty, and I do hope it reflects 
a new Liberal tendency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we are dealing today with drinking water, the Liberals are 
suddenly determined to fully respect the areas of provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the hon. member giving us a scoop and telling us that the 
government is now dropping the infamous millennium scholarship 
program so vigorously condemned, particularly by Quebec but also 
by other provinces, as interfering in provincial responsibility 
for education? Is he announcing, for the Prime Minister, that 
the Romanow commission on health care is a thing of the past, 
that it is over and done with, that the government will not 
interfere with Quebec's health care sector? Should we now 
conclude from the member's speech that these are the new 
tendencies of the Liberal Party, the party in power? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the member to explain his position. Members will 
agree with me that it is surprising to hear the member for 
Toronto—Danforth repudiate the federal government's interference 
and its centralizing power in areas under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B> Madam Speaker, my conversion is limited to 
water. My interventionist passion continues unchanged as far as 
other issues are concerned. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would give a very specific example.  I do not want to take 
away from the issue of water that we are dealing with today. On 
that issue I will bow to the provincial jurisdiction the Bloc 
Quebecois guards so dearly, but I will not bow and I will 
intervene with vigour in any province that is not living up to 
its requirement to provide more affordable housing.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I would ask the hon. member if he does not think the 
issue of drinking water is serious enough to warrant an all party 
committee to examine it.  This would include not just drinking 
water but all aspects of water, everything about it.  Is it not 
time we put the interests of Canadians ahead of party interests? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, I totally support the 
view of my colleague, who is an educator, a biologist and the 
chief environmental critic for the Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hope the House leader of the Conservative Party, the House 
leader of the Canadian Alliance and our own House leader will 
come here tomorrow and say that now is the time to move forward 
on the security of our freshwater.  All the goodwill we can 
muster here today can be a moment of special hope for all 
Canadians, not just on drinking water but on all aspects of 
water. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK34"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I find it 
incredible to hear the member state that only water is 
sufficiently important for standards to be set and provincial 
jurisdiction to be respected, including that of Quebec.  This is 
incredible.  Besides, there is nothing more important than 
water, and it is basically the jurisdiction of Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I would ask the hon. member is whether he believes this is 
a matter of respecting jurisdictions by calling for standards 
that, while possibly different, will respect provincial 
jurisdiction, and will Quebec or any other province not be 
forced in any way to adopt standards that may not even be any 
better than its own?  This is already the case in Quebec and 
besides, Bernard Landry is already preparing to bring in a new 
drinking water bill and regulations far superior to what they 
want to establish as standards here in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, this gets me into 
trouble from time to time in the House.  If someone in the House 
comes up with a good, constructive idea that will make life 
better for Canadians I do not care where the idea comes from.  If 
the premier of Quebec has the model for drinking water we will 
look at it.  Maybe it will end up being the model for all of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There can be philosophical differences on certain issues.  If I 
understood the motion of the member for Fundy—Royal, the best 
formula or plan for drinking water should become the national 
standard regardless of who proposes it.  One either opts in or 
one does not.  If the province of Quebec has the best standard 
then Ontario and the rest of the country should follow it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  Obviously I am passionate about this issue.  I would seek 
unanimous consent of the House to rescind the amendment put forth 
by the right hon. member for Calgary Centre and to permit the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Health to table 
another amendment.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I will be splitting my time with the member for 
Battlefords—Lloydminster.  It is fitting that we talk about this 
important subject today.  We should have been talking about it a 
great many years ago. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is looked upon internationally as a pristine, pure, clean 
place.  However Canada is sliding and has been sliding for a 
considerable time in terms of infrastructure.  This is true of 
more than just water, but water is what we are talking about 
today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have general regulations but do not enforce them. Canada has 
no standard for water safety.  Nor do we understand whose 
responsibility it is.  As a result we saw the Walkerton incident, 
the North Battleford incident, and I am sure we will see a great 
many others. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is sliding into third world status when it comes to 
water.  It is safer to drink bottled water than tap water in 
Canada.  Both sides of the country are dumping raw sewage into 
the ocean.  That is not a G-8 phenomenon; it is a third world 
phenomenon.  We put our garbage into landfills where they seep 
into our water table.  It is a time bomb waiting to explode.  It 
will cost us a fortune in the future to take care of those 
garbage dumps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada has thousands of toxic waste sites.  Our roads and 
bridges are decaying.  Our health care system is rated 23rd out 
of 29 by the OECD.  Our dollar is now worth 60 plus cents.  We 
are suffering from a brain drain.  These are symptoms of what is 
happening to our country, a country of which we are proud and for 
which we came to Ottawa to fight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the tip of the iceberg.  It is the canary in the coal 
mine in terms of our infrastructure problems.  We need a vision 
and an action plan.  We need a government that is not afraid to 
show leadership. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has the government done?  It likes to stay in the centre 
and appear shocked that we have a water problem.  It likes to 
pass the buck and blame someone else.  When I questioned the 
government about the 5 and 6 year old girls who were forced to 
visit their sex offender father in prison, the justice minister 
told me to go to the province because it was its fault.  The 
province told me to go to the feds because it was a federal 
prison. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is called passing the buck, and Canadians are sick and 
tired of it.  They do not care whether an issue is federal, 
provincial or municipal.  They want it fixed.  Ultimately the 
government throws money at the problem.  It throws money at 
infrastructure.  What do we get for that money?  We get golf 
courses, statues, canoe museums, ski hills and fountains in the 
middle of rivers.   We need our sewage, water and garbage 
problems taken care of.  That is not what we are getting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has put aside $4 billion for water between now 
and the year 2005.  Little or none of the money has gone to 
communities.  Most of it seems lost in the bureaucracy. 
Municipalities say they need $16.5 billion to address the water 
problem.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What are the responses?  Everyone cares about health.  When we 
talk about water, air or garbage we are talking about people's 
health.  If there is one thing people care about more than 
anything it is health.  It does not matter how many material 
things one has.  Without health one has nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we need to do?  First, we need to co-operate with the 
provinces and territories.  The people do not care who deals with 
the problem.  They just want us to deal with it.  The federal 
government's job is to show leadership.  Let us get rid of the 
turf warfare that seems to plague the whole issue and most other 
issues in government.  Let us show leadership.  Let us show that 
we care about the issues that affect Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, let us do a complete water inventory.  Let us look at 
our aquifers, find out what we have and make a map of them.  Let 
us see if we are in a positive or negative position in the 
recharge of those aquifers.  Let us evaluate the water sources in 
the country.  Let us look at the contamination levels of our 
water tables.  That is where we get into landfills and that sort 
of thing.  Let us look at watershed management.  Let us work with 
the provinces.  This is not a turf war between provinces.  It is 
about fixing a very important resource, our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As the hon. member mentioned, we will need to talk about the 
whole issue of water export.  The south west U.S. needs a lot of 
water.  In Libya, Mr. Khadafi has built a $32 billion pipeline 
that is 1,900 kilometres long and 5 metres in diameter.  He is 
using it to pump water out of the Sahara Desert.  If they can 
pump water out of the Sahara Desert we had better believe that 
someone in the south west U.S. will say why not pump it out of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us at least know what our resource is.  Let us talk to 
Canadians and ask them what they think about the issue.  Let us 
not put our heads in the sand and be afraid to deal with 
difficult issues such as water.  That is exactly what we seem to 
be doing and that is why Canadians are so frustrated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, let us set standards.  Let us work with the provinces and 
territories to set standards.  Let us set the bar high.  We are a 
G-8 country.  We are a highly industrialized country.  If we 
cannot set the bar high what country can? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talk about water technology.  We are selling water treatment 
technology to Beijing that we have not even used in Canada.  We 
have 12 to 15 companies selling technology around the world for 
sewage and water treatment but we do not use it in Canada because 
we cannot afford it or are not committed to water quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us change that.  It is negligent that we did not set and 
enforce standards long ago.  It is government negligence.  Who 
cares whether the federal, provincial or municipal governments 
are at fault?  It is negligence on the part of governments not to 
have done something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, we need money for infrastructure.  That is always a 
tough one.  We need to train people and acquire technology. Where 
do we get the money?  I have been here long enough to think I 
could find it within the budget of planet Ottawa.  So much waste 
goes on here in terms of unnecessary programs that do not help 
people that we could list page after page of it.  There is money 
for important issues like health, water, sewage and garbage.  The 
federal government should show leadership in working on the 
problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lastly, we need leadership.  Canadians are looking for 
environmental leadership.  Environmental issues are not unique to 
one province or region; they are a universal Canadian problem. 
Who better to take leadership on such an important issue than the 
federal government?  I urge the government to take leadership on 
alternate energy, water, sewage, garbage and clean air. 
I have been working on the Fraser Valley situation at Sumas and 
the power project.  I am shocked how little concern the federal 
government has about air problems that are potentially going to 
hurt that area.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, I quite agree with the previous speaker 
that the infrastructure program is not delivering federal money 
directly to this type of infrastructure, sewage or water 
treatment.  The reason is the infrastructure programs has always 
been set up so the municipalities have the primary decision 
making on how the money will be spent.  If a municipality decides 
to infrastructure money on their arena for example, or in my 
riding on a nature path, instead of on sewers or water treatment, 
then always the federal government has bowed to the right of the 
grassroots, shall we say, to determine how federal money is 
spent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that perhaps we should deviate from 
this practice, we should turn our back on it and propose that the 
federal government impose or require the municipalities and the 
provinces, for that matter, to spend money, the money they should 
be spending in co-operation with the federal government, on clear 
drinking water? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It seems to me, Madam Speaker, you cannot have it both ways.  We 
cannot say that the federal government is not doing its job, if 
the decision making is left to the provinces and the 
municipalities and they are not making the right decisions. 
Surely the answer is for the federal government, if it is using 
federal dollars, to impose upon the provinces and the 
municipalities to spend money on good water for Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam  Speaker, there is something really 
wrong with that approach.  Impose or force are the words being 
used.  I am talking about words like co-operate, understand and 
work with.  That is how we do it.  We need a new approach to 
federalism to make it work, not the forced, clamped down and tie 
the provinces up.  That is what we have had for so long. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us face it, it is not very sexy to say that we will build a 
new sewage treatment plant, or that we will change our landfill 
site or whatever.  However I believe more than anything, if we 
sit down with the provinces they will do what is right.  What is 
right is to protect the health of Canadians.  That is what they 
want us to do. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK39"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, once again 
from another party we are hearing the argument, as we always do 
when concerns are expressed about jurisdictions and when we are 
looking out for Quebec's interests, that we are raising party 
differences and being militant.  That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jurisdiction is ours.  Underground and surface water is 
indeed the property of Quebec or the provinces.  Enough of these 
accusations of being partisan just because we want certain 
things or do certain things.  That is not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I am saying is that what we are doing right needs to be 
looked at.  Quebec already has in place the strictest standards 
for drinking water. 
As hon. members are aware, we have been working to improve those 
regulations since June 19, 2000 and the bill has almost reached 
the cabinet stage.  The final version has been drafted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So we do not want to hear any more about our not being concerned 
about water quality, or not looking after it properly.  Perhaps 
there are some places where the job is not being done as well as 
it might be, but the responsibility is there.  This is another 
attempt by the federal government to trample over provincial 
jurisdiction, no matter for how noble a cause.  It must be known 
that water quality is the responsibility of everyone, Quebec 
included. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can the hon. member again suggest such an incursion, 
especially since he comes from a party like the Canadian 
Alliance?  I am sure his province too has programs or 
regulations.  Areas of provincial jurisdiction must be 
respected. 
Let the necessary transfer payments be made and let us stop 
cutting back on the funds that have to be passed on to the 
municipalities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, as well as turf wars, we 
have to get rid of the paranoia that is involved. We have to 
start talking about what is good for Canadians.  What is good for 
Canadians is that water needs to be pure.  We have lots of heavy 
duty restrictions in Alberta on water quality.  I believe we have 
one of the best in water quality, but I would hope that any 
Albertan politician would be prepared to sit down with members 
from every other province and try to improve the whole situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why duplicate bureaucracy province by province by province? Why 
duplicate research or duplicate development of technology?  Why 
would we do that?  We are one country.  We should be working 
together to fix the problem, and that is dirty water. 
<P><A NAME="LINK40"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, I want to salute the member for Red Deer who has taken 
an early lead on this issue over the last few months, and even 
before that with his history as a biologist.  I believe he 
touched on a very important point in his speech when he linked 
health with this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Could the member say a few words on whether or not he believes 
that linking the issue of health with clean water and food might 
be the way we could capture the imaginations of all members in 
the House and that this issue should be put on the front burner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills:</B>  Madam Speaker, environment is linked to 
everything.  It is linked to agriculture, it is linked to health 
and it is linked to trade.  It is linked to everything we do 
because we must have a pure environment in which to function. Let 
us put as paramount importance the health, welfare and safety of 
Canadians.  We have to do that. 
<P><A NAME="LINK41"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz (Battlefords—Lloydminster, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise today as the MP who covers 
the area of North Battleford where we are having our latest 
outbreak of problem water.  I will read the motion that my 
colleague from Fundy—Royal put forward for people who have just 
joined us.  It states: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should act 
with the provinces and territories to establish enforceable 
national drinking water standards that would be enshrined in a 
Safe Water Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I look at this motion, I have a certain amount of 
trepidation in voting positively for it.  People at home are 
crying out.  There is a demand and a need for safe water across 
the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a myriad of standards at this point.  There are over 79 
guidelines in the Canadian drinking water quality, 54 of which 
are health based, 17 are based on aesthetics, which is colour, 
taste and so on, and another 8 have a combination of the two.  As 
I said, I talk about this with some trepidation.  This is a 
provincial jurisdiction.  We really have to get beyond the 
politics and look at the end of the day to what is best for the 
common good of ordinary Canadians who are demanding safe and 
secure water supplies across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a myriad of examples where there are problems.  Senator 
Grafstein has a bill in the Senate at this time.  He has 
identified 700 communities, and he says there are probably more, 
that have problems with water.  At any given time there are 5,000 
communities across the country that have boil water advisories 
out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to look at the concentrations of livestock and some of 
the weather related problems.  Part of the problem in North 
Battleford is that the river content is very low at this time. 
Compound that with the sewer pump that is on the wrong end of the 
town and there is a recipe for disaster. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A tremendous amount of studies have been done.  Currently we 
have national standards but they are not binding.  The problem as 
I see it is that there is a tremendous disconnect between the 
standards we have and the testing that is required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with the testing is that it is very expensive.  The 
procedures are very costly.  The fancy name is cryptosporidium, 
which is the little bug in the water in North Battleford. 
Testing for that requires tankers of water to be taken to the 
provincial lab, which is 300 or 400 kilometres away.  That is 
done on an ongoing basis.  It is cost prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other option is to have a chemical engineer or a biologist 
on staff, which of course for a community of 15,000 again is cost 
prohibitive.  There has to be some sort of national, provincial 
and municipal co-operation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Transport made a comment the other day.  He 
stated “The government believes the improvement of our drinking 
water supply and sewage treatment is an utmost priority.”  That 
is what he said. 
The health minister, in a comment to my question to him yesterday 
in this place, said that there was nothing more important than 
public safety, that we really had to spend money on our crumbling 
infrastructure and that $56 million had been allocated to 
Saskatchewan.

<A HREF="#LINKT19"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>To replace the sewage plant alone in North Battleford, we are 
looking at $20 million.  That is a third of the total allocation 
to Saskatchewan.  It will handle the output for 15,000.  There is 
roughly a million people in Saskatchewan, so members will see 
that the $56 million will be a couple of dollars short and 
probably a day or two late in this instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of heavy weights at the cabinet table saying 
that they realize there is a problem.  It really begs a question. 
Moneys have been allocated to the Canada infrastructure program 
with the focus on water and sewer.  We have a tremendous problem 
with crumbling infrastructure in water and sewer related areas. 
One member cited the problems on first nation reserves.  He is 
absolutely right.  We see that at home on the reserves.  However 
it is also hitting our towns and communities that pay huge taxes 
are looking for security in their water and sewer supplies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not seeing it happen out there.  As the federal 
government cut the funding on the health and social transfers, 
that got off-loaded to the provinces.  What did the provinces do? 
They cut support and so on to the municipal governments, the 
lowest level of government, which led to problems that we see 
today.  They cannot do the testing that is required because the 
dollars are not there.  Staffing has been cut, and it has been a 
compound action all the way down.  I guess we all share in the 
disgrace in our safe water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are being asked today to support the idea that the federal 
government should get into the business of clean water.  That is 
an argument unto itself.  If we look at what federal governments 
have done over time with health care, employment insurance and 
other programs like that, we see that they have become 
bureaucratically heavy and have not delivering the germ we need 
out there in the real world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Clean water is and will continue to be a complex issue.  We have 
geography.  We have climate.  We have floods and all sorts of 
things that happen.  We need access to source.  Then we have the 
crumbling infrastructure.  The Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities said we need $16.5 billion just to get everybody 
back to a benchmark that would give us relatively safe water and 
sewage handling.  The whole Canada infrastructure program over 
three years is $4 billion.  That will not even supply 
maintenance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will have to take a lot harder look at this issue. 
Government spending is all about priorities.  We saw an 
announcement of $560 million to the arts.  Then people say that 
they need safe water. Where do we suppose they vote?  Which one 
would they ask for?  We have a long gun registry that has eaten 
up $600 million, and we do not have safe water.  Which one would 
the ordinary citizen want to put the money into?  It is all about 
priorities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The impact of the water crisis in North Battleford goes away 
beyond money and regulations.  People on the street are concerned 
about their health and the future safety of the water supply. 
There is a problem out there about when it will be safe.  When 
the people who were in charge when the problem hit say the water 
is safe, will these people take their word for it?  Probably not. 
A whole supply system has to be flushed out and that can only be 
done after rigorous testing has been done at both the sewage end 
and the pump intake end.  There is a combination there of wells 
and surplus water that is used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been a tremendous outpouring of support for North 
Battleford's situation from across the country.  A lot of other 
communities, which were in that same situation to a lesser 
degree, have come forward with ideas.  As was mentioned before by 
my colleague from Red Deer, tremendous gains have been made on 
the applications of cleaning up our water supply.  We are 
marketing those across the world.  If North Battleford wants the 
upscale, high tech equipment, it will have to go to Beijing to 
buy it from a Canadian source.  We just do not seem to have that 
communication system in this country which puts the buyer and the 
seller together.  In a lot of cases it is very cost prohibitive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are a couple of options available to clean up the 
cryptosporidium that is in the water in North Battleford.  One 
involves a complete ultraviolet light filter system, which is 
very expensive and high maintenance.  It needs to be maintained 
on almost a daily basis because of the volume of water that would 
go through it.  The summer capacity is like 3.4 million gallons a 
day, so that adds to the problem.  The system is very dry right 
now, so it could even go higher than.  That is the average. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Other people have come forward.  Canadian Tire did an excellent 
job of getting bottled water to the people. 
The line up has been as long as two kilometres and those folks 
have risen to the challenge.  They have committed to 1,500 
gallons a day to be brought in.  They have given fantastic 
support to a small community.  The Canadian Tire store is 
probably the best loved store out there right now.  I really 
commend it for its efforts.

everything.  The only thing Culligan wants is for the province to 
waive the enviro charge, which would be about $1,200 on what it 
is planning to ship in.  I was on a conference call yesterday 
with the new premier, Lorne Calvert, the mayor and the council, 
and I am sure the province will step up to the plate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone is looking for solutions.  We are way beyond trying to 
condemn anyone.  We need to find the answers and move along with 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The crisis over water in Canada is becoming a crisis over 
government.  People are looking to their municipalities that 
provide these services.  They then look to their provinces and 
ask them for their support.  Lastly, they look to the federal 
government that made the decision to make the huge cuts in health 
and social transfers.  They are telling the federal government 
that the cuts were for the deficit, which is gone, so we should 
now prioritize some government spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians want the government to look at putting money back into 
safe resources like water and sewers.  They want the 
infrastructure system, which is so sadly lacking across the 
country, to be built up again.  It is not systemic to one 
particular area.  Every province has problems.  No one is 
blameless.  Five years ago we were slashing funding and now it is 
time to step up to the plate and put some of it back. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have been asked today to support the idea that the federal 
government should get into the business of clean water and the 
safety of supply.  I guess in a vacuum where that does not exist 
someone has to come forward.  I have a real problem voting for 
the federal government to get into a situation like this but of 
course the money rests with the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are looking for today is the federal government to 
commit the $20 million that will be needed in North Battleford to 
bring its sewage system up to standard so it can get back to 
doing ordinary business.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Dennis Mills (Toronto—Danforth, Lib.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on behalf of all of us here, our thoughts are with the 
hon. member and the challenge he faces as the federal leader for 
the community right now in dealing with this issue.  In my humble 
opinion this is precisely an area where the national government 
must address the emergency immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to remind members about the foot of snow we had in 
downtown Toronto about three years ago.  Our mayor declared a 
national crisis and called the Prime Minister to ask for the 
army.  Within hours the Department of National Defence was 
plowing the streets of Toronto.  I think there may have been 
eight or ten inches of snow on the streets and everyone thought 
this was a great national crisis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we are sensitive about intervention and trampling on 
rights of municipalities and provinces but, in a case like this, 
I do not think it is inappropriate for the municipal leaders to 
reach out to the local member and to the national government to 
ask for help.  I think as members of the House of Commons we 
should all be there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I thank the member for 
Toronto—Davenport for his intervention.  He is of course on the 
record as trying to spearhead a national drinking water 
committee.  I think it would be very important to do that.  I 
think it should be an all party committee.  I think it must 
confer with the provincial ministers, the Federation of 
Municipalities and so on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is time for the drinking water concerns to be addressed in a 
systematic fashion, not an ad hoc series of programs.  We need to 
look at the big picture, break it down into components and 
address each one of those: the sewer, the water distribution 
system and so on, and it needs to be done through research and 
development.  It is also very important to stress the 
co-operation and conditions that would be placed on provincial 
jurisdictions.  This is their area of expertise and they really 
need to be brought to the fore.  I know my colleagues from Quebec 
will certainly stress that issue, and I fully support that.  The 
federal government is really trampling on provincial jurisdiction 
in doing this but let us take a look at it in a systematic way.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member mentioned the snow storm in Toronto and the help it 
received.  A couple of years ago, when an ice storm hit this 
region, lower Quebec and so on, the federal government was there. 
If we look at the floods in Manitoba and other areas of the 
country, we see that the federal government had a role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask the members opposite today to keep crisis and 
disaster in mind as my community of North Battleford applies for 
extra funding to get its water back under control. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A new sewage plant has been committed for the year 2003.  We 
would like to bring that forward by a year or a year and a half. 
The problem we are seeing is that the green funds that have been 
announced are a little tough to access when the forms are not out 
yet.  They are a little tough to administer when the guidelines 
say that anything planned needs to have the planning done, the 
site selection done, the environmental assessment done, the 
contract let and the building built and tied into the system in 
less than a year.  That is physically impossible when we look at 
all of the concerns that have to be addressed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us have a look at those regulations.  North Battleford sits 
in the middle of a large agricultural area.  It is certainly 
aware of federal government programs, such as AIDA, and how 
difficult they are to manage and maintain.  It is also aware of 
the green funding.  However, when it looks at the funding it sees 
it as a public relations spin that really does not address the 
issue in a practical or common sense way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to get beyond the partisanship and the politics and 
address this across the country.  We have a lightning rod in 
North Battleford.  We had one in Walkerton.  We need to seriously 
look at this issue.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Madam Speaker, the member opposite was the first one 
so far in the debate who has said that the national standards 
should be binding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of my problems in the debate, as I have heard it thus far, 
is in Ontario the provincial government withdrew from the 
programs that provided free water testing for Canadians and 
withdrew from many other programs that guaranteed good water for 
people in Ontario. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Should we, when we consider legislation for guaranteeing clean 
water for all Canadians, be considering ways in which we can 
prevent provinces withdrawing their support for clean water when 
they have the responsibility to provide the funds to maintain 
clean water? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Gerry Ritz:</B>  Madam Speaker, I guess the point that is 
being made is withdrawing funding; kind of a carrot and a stick 
attitude.  I think we draw more flies with honey than we do with 
vinegar.  Certainly no one out there on the ground wants to 
destroy the water system that feeds their families, friends 
communities and so on.  They all want to do a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talk about the free testing that was available, I guess 
there is testing and then there is testing.  It is like doing a 
litmus test and doing a couple of things for specific areas in 
the water.  The problem is we have gone way beyond that with a 
lot of the pollution and so on that we are seeing generated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need tests for this crypto.  However, as I said, it takes 
tankers of water on an ongoing basis to a provincial lab.  The 
costs are just prohibitive.  We need to somehow come up with 
ideas where the testing can be refined and done in a way that is 
affordable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Madam Speaker, I 
am delighted to have this opportunity to speak to this motion by 
my Tory colleague pertaining to an issue of great concern: our 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I will read the motion, and then we can develop together 
the whole theme of drinking water.  The motion reads as follows: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should act 
with the provinces and territories to establish enforceable 
national drinking water standards that would be enshrined in a 
Safe Water Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, I would like to say that we are not against high 
standards for the monitoring and quality of drinking water.  It 
is all the more essential in the light of recent events, such as 
what happened in Walkerton or what is going on right now in 
western Canada, or even the risk of contaminant migration on 
federal lands for instance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Take military bases like Bagotville or Valcartier, where, 
according to some Department of National Defence reports, the 
contamination could have a major impact on the individual wells 
of residents in municipalities like Shannon and La Baie, in the 
Lac-Saint-Jean area.  I think this is a matter of concern both at 
the Canadian level and at the Quebec level.

<A HREF="#LINKT22"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We agree about national standards, and I remind hon. members 
that on June 19, the environment minister announced a regulatory 
project, currently before Cabinet, to tighten standards on the 
quality of drinking water in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is therefore a priority not only in Canada, but in Quebec as 
well.  Water has long been a matter of concern to Quebecers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I recall the major symposium we held in Quebec in December 
1997, where environmentalists, academics and industrialists met 
to discuss the question of water and drinking water, of course, 
and the whole issue of Quebec's water resources, how to promote 
them and how to manage them more effectively in order to protect 
public health and the environment and to ensure better municipal 
management of this resource. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This symposium, held in Montreal, led to key findings.  The 
first conclusion was that Quebec needed to establish a policy on 
water for itself.  That was fundamental.  It was so fundamental 
that the whole issue of water was re-examined a month later in 
Quebec by the Bureau d'audiences publiques sur l'environnement, 
which we call the BAPE. 
In May 2000, after considerable public consultation, it issued a 
report that provided clearly, on various matters, that Quebec 
should establish a water policy in the near future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The wish was also expressed, and I mention this because it also 
concerns the issue of water, that the issue of water be considered 
in the free trade agreements, that water not simply be 
considered a commodity and that it be excluded from trade 
agreements being negotiated, such as that of the free trade area 
of the Americas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is another aspect to recall. 
Moreover, Quebec adopted its own water preservation act. That 
act, which is currently in effect and which was unanimously 
passed by the Quebec national assembly, specifically seeks to 
preserve and protect drinking water and to include this 
protection in an act, not a safe water act, but an act on the 
preservation of our drinking water. Again, this legislation was 
unanimously passed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned that we support national standards. Why? Because, as 
I said earlier, Quebec has already proposed a number of measures 
through draft regulations tabled in the national assembly, on 
June 19, 2000. 
These measures, which basically seek to improve those already in 
effect in Quebec under the water regulations passed in 1984, 
would ensure the effective management of drinking water, while 
always keeping in mind the protection of public health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These regulations were adopted in 1984 and in June of last 
year the Quebec government announced amendments and draft 
regulations. What is the purpose of these draft regulations? 
First, they are aimed at improving turbidity standards to ensure 
that the particles in suspension in our drinking water are of 
acceptable quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a few months, Quebec will adopt, and I am absolutely convinced 
of that, standards that are twice as strict as the current 
Canadian standards. 
This is quite something, considering that some people think that 
Quebec does not manage its water properly and that its standards 
are less strict than elsewhere. Yet, we have standards that 
are twice as strict as the Canadian ones. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1200"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT24"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT24"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1200

<A HREF="#LINKT23"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The standard for acceptable turbidity will be reduced from five 
to 0.5 NTU the year immediately following the coming into force 
of the regulation. The new proposed standard would therefore be 
twice as strict as the Canadian recommendation for the quality 
of drinking water, which is, in the other provinces, the same as 
the standard applied by the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, with these draft regulations, we will put into place 
stricter standards, in terms of turbidity as well as quality. 
These standards will be twice as strict as Canadian standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We will also increase the number of substances that must be 
assessed through sample testing. 
The number of substances to be assessed in sample tests will be 
increased from the current 46 to 77. Consequently, more 
substances will be subject to tests. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must recall that in certain municipalities, tests are 
presently conducted, for example in waterworks or individual 
wells, for certain substances only while others are ignored. 
Nitrate is one example. In many sample tests, the level of 
nitrate is not analyzed in standard tests to assess drinking 
water. The number of substances assessed in Quebec will 
increase from 46 to 77. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, and this is significant, these regulations will provide 
for mandatory controls, which will mean more frequent sample 
testing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Need I remind the House that, when samples are taken in 
Quebec, for example when E. coli, which is well known from the 
Walkerton case, is detected, would we have one of the most stringent 
sets of regulations requiring that municipalities be notified 
rapidly in order to ensure that public health and safety are 
safeguarded and that people are well informed.  We will 
therefore be increasing the number of mandatory controls both 
for E. coli and for other substances. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Also important is the frequency of testing.  As we discovered in 
the cases of Shannon, La Baie and the Bagotville base, it is not 
enough to take samples annually. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is essential to ensure that if a contaminant enters 
individual wells, which is most often the case, being a rare 
occurrence in water supply systems, we can increase the frequency 
of sampling.  This is what will be accomplished by the draft 
regulations which have been introduced in Quebec and which will 
be adopted in a few weeks or months. 
The number of samples taken will be increased to eight a month 
from two a year.  This sampling will be mandatory.  The 
frequency will go from the present two samples a year to eight a 
month.  This is the provision in the government of Quebec's 
draft regulations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We had water quality regulations in 1984.  We will improve on 
them with draft regulations which can be described as 
innovative.  They are the most stringent regulations a province 
can enforce. They are so rigorous that, even though the quality 
of water in Quebec is considered to be the best in Canada, 
Quebec has decided to improve them.

<A HREF="#LINKT24"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that Quebec has the best quality of water, I refer to 
what the Sierra legal defence fund has said. This environmental 
organisation, which is not an advocate of industry,  has given 
Quebec the highest mark, ahead of all other provinces, in terms 
of the severity of its requirements regarding drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a scale of A to F, Quebec got a B, like Alberta. Nova Scotia 
got a minus B. I will not mention the others but I will only talk 
about Quebec. This environmental organization, which is well 
known and very rigorous in terms of its evaluations, recognized 
Quebec as having the best quality of drinking water in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another important aspect is the issue of infrastructures. This 
is fundamental. 
We cannot raise our environmental standards if we do not have 
operational sewer and water supply systems to treat water 
effectively. This is fundamental. I will simply refer to the 
case of Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years ago, the city of Montreal published a report. It was 
a green book on the evaluation of the sewer and water supply 
system. According to this report, and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>At present, the city estimates the operation costs associated 
with the management of drinking water at $118 million and the 
costs associated with the treatment of wastewater at $83 
million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was for the city of Montreal alone. 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those costs did not take into account the spending on  system 
improvements. However, the present condition of the system would 
not necessitate spending of $1 billion but rather between $157 
and $225 million. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that the federal government must act 
as quickly as possible within the existing infrastructure 
program. However, this is not going to be enough in view of the 
fact that the sewer and water treatment system of the city of 
Montreal needs to be improved. 
The system needs to be improved to ensure there will be no 
leaks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we develop drinking water quality standards, while our sewer 
system is leaky and is not working properly, my colleagues know 
what I mean, because we have evaluated the cost of a municipal 
sewage system malfunction, then the outcome would be contamination 
of the groundwater and the drinking water would inevitably be 
contaminated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Union des municipalités du Québec and the mayors have all 
stressed the need for adding to the envelope earmarked for water 
infrastructure renovation.  We need concrete action to get the 
federal government to invest more in infrastructure 
improvements. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another aspect concerns the entire issue of crown land 
contamination, which has a connection to water quality.  In 
recent weeks I revealed that two military bases are the 
sites of high levels of contamination: Bagotville and 
Valcartier. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1210"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT26"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT26"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1210
<A HREF="#LINKT27"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT25"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Reports released under the Access to Information Act clearly 
indicate that the land at Bagotville is contaminated with 
nitrate, which is liable to end up in the individual well system 
of nearby municipalities.  I am not making this up, I am not 
being alarmist, I am merely quoting what the National Defence 
reports say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This demonstrates that it is all very well to have 
standards and laws but if the sites are not decontaminated 
immediately there are health risks.  The risks of exposure to 
nitrate are high.  Exposure to nitrates in drinking water can 
lead to what is termed blue baby syndrome.  Action must be 
taken, therefore. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the base at Valcartier, not one but a number of sites are 
polluted.  The Jacques-Cartier River was for many years a 
munitions depot.  This situation inevitably creates problems. 
At Shannon, there is a very high risk that this pollution will 
migrate into the wells of some 30 homes.  The federal government 
must therefore do something about this and manage its own land 
before it tells the provinces what standards they should adopt, 
especially since Quebec's standards are higher than what the 
federal government wants to recommend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec is setting standards for itself that are higher than what 
the government of Canada is recommending.  It is not 
decontaminating its land, which is polluting the drinking water 
wells of cities, and it wants to tell us what to do.  I think 
the provinces must be respected. 
If Quebec wants to establish tighter regulations, can it do so? 
Can the government honour Quebec's areas of jurisdiction? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as I know, water is a provincial matter.  It is 
especially insulting for a province that has standards imposed 
on it to have the federal government taking the lead in setting 
these standards.  It is rather insulting for a province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People wonder what business it is of the federal government. 
Should it not get on with managing its own land?  Should it not 
control the quality of the water on its military bases? That is 
the issue.  No, the federal government prefers, generally, to 
create a law and standards and tell the provinces what is to be 
done, when it are not about to give lessons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, I will say simply that we need higher standards on 
the quality of drinking water. 
Clearly, stricter regulations are required, but provincial 
jurisdictions must be respected, especially when the provinces 
are the leaders.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Since I was elected in 1997, I have been arguing very strongly 
for full funding of basic infrastructure, such as roads, water 
and sewers.  The tragedies that we see happening now are due to 
the fact that small towns and cities cannot tax their people 
enough in order to build the infrastructure that is required for 
basic human needs.  Clean water is certainly one of those needs.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What does the member believe the priorities should be?  There 
are many examples.  I believe that federal and provincial 
governments should not be in the business of deciding who should 
or should not be getting government money for business.  They 
should be dealing with what the public needs, and that is basic 
public infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The massive use of moneys for gun control is an example.  We 
also had an example in Manitoba where a person was paid $15,000 
to hang up dead rabbits in the trees south of Winnipeg as an 
artistic endeavour.  That was bad and the people of Manitoba 
complained.  This year that person received another $5,000. To me 
that is not priority spending. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does the Bloc member believe that public infrastructure needs 
more money?  We know we have an infrastructure program in Canada 
right now partially funded by the federal government. Should the 
level of funding from the federal government not be increased 
from $3 billion to $4 billion for public infrastructure?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, I am 
in full agreement with the findings of my colleague from the 
Canadian Alliance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should indeed increase the infrastructure budget. Our 
position on this has always been clear. We should be the voices 
of the municipalities in the House. We should ensure that the 
federal government puts in the money that is needed in 
infrastructure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The experience has been tried in Quebec. If we set higher water 
quality standards, municipalities will see their costs go up. 
Public policy choices will have to be made. 
Setting standards is not enough. We need the means to enforce 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That happens very often in the environment sector. A prime 
example is the Environmental Protection Act. We have some fine 
legislation, but we do not have the investigators and inspectors 
to enforce it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Three things are needed. First, we must improve our 
infrastructure system to ensure that there are no leaks, as I 
said earlier. Second, we need to improve water quality standards 
in Quebec and other provinces. Third, we should provide whatever 
resources are needed for the optimal implementation of these 
standards, in other words, provide the money to hire inspectors 
and investigators.

acknowledged, through the amendment, that we would be respecting

</I></B></P><P align=left>The member just said that we need to speak for municipalities in

acknowledgement that infrastructure is needed, that we do have 
some challenges to meet on our crown lands and that these issues

They are saying that Canada needs Quebec to adopt national, 
higher standards. The hon. member for Bourassa knows very well 
that in Quebec we have the highest standards and the best 
drinking water in Canada.  If the Canadian government wants to 
adopt higher standards, to copy the standards we have in Quebec, 
nothing is preventing it from doing so. We will present it with 
the draft regulations so it can have them adopted wherever it 
wants.

or the provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, he talks about adopting Canadian standards?  Could the 
hon. member also indicate whether this would not lead to 
conflicting expert advice? Would this not be a new case of 
duplication? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like the hon. member for Rosemont—Petite-Patrie to answer 
these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras:</B> Mr. Speaker, the hon. member understood 
correctly. I am talking about Canada, including the provinces. I 
did not talk about the federal government adopting standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada, through the provinces, could indeed adopt regulations 
similar to those passed by Quebec in 1984. It could also adopt 
stricter regulations regarding water quality, including 
standards. Would this result in conflicting expert advice? The 
important thing is to have high standards, both in the provinces 
and in the lands under federal jurisdiction. I am thinking, 
among others, of military bases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If standards as high as those that Quebec is about to adopt were 
in effect on military bases, we would probably not have a risk 
of nitrate contaminating the drinking water wells of the town of 
La Baie, and of water contamination in Shannon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is free to adopt standards for federal 
lands, and the provinces can certainly adopt the same draft 
regulations as the Quebec government. What will be the result of 
such measures? We will finally have quality drinking water which 
will probably be classified as B water, as is currently the case 
in Quebec. We will not merely have standards, we will have 
better drinking water and a better quality of life.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year in Ontario 274 communities had boil water advisories. 
Last weekend 37 Saskatchewan towns were being advised to boil 
their water.  These are all after Walkerton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The need for government action is very obvious.  We will see 
that today in terms of the response we get from the various 
political parties in the House.  It seems to me and to my party 
that to a great extent the motion is only window dressing unless 
there is action that flows from it.  I have great reservations 
that will happen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had a vision of a federal budget that recognized the urgency 
and the crises we are faced with in terms of the treatment of our 
water.  We did not see that in the fall budget and we will not 
see a budget for perhaps another year that would take this issue 
into account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear the Minister of Health saying that we cannot snap 
our fingers and solve the problem, he is right. It begs the 
question of where he and the government have been for the last 
year since Walkerton and where successive governments have been 
for the last 30 to 40 years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It all comes down to money, as is often the case.  We could set 
up a co-operative effort between the provinces and the federal 
government, but the reality is that the municipalities deliver 
these services.  They are responsible for treating our water and 
our sewage.  We cannot divorce those two issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not sure about the Bloc, but if we passed the motion 
everybody would be in favour of it.  Then, tomorrow, do we just 
do nothing as we have for these last number of years?  Or, do we 
deal realistically with it?  Do we reach into our collective 
pockets in the form of tax dollars and pass those down to 
municipalities?  They have told us that what they need over the 
next 10 years is a minimum of $16.5 billion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The vast majority of those dollars have to come from the federal 
government because most of the provinces are either in no 
position or a very weak position to be able to fund that. At this 
point we have a commitment in the last federal budget. 
Over the next six years we have $2.65 billion committed for all 
types of municipal infrastructure, not just water or sewage 
treatment.  That includes roads and any number of other items. 
That $2.65 billion comes nowhere near dealing with the problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have?  We have a situation where, from what I am 
hearing, I expect we will pass this motion.  We will probably not 
do anything more.  That is a sham we are perpetuating on the 
people of the country.  If we do not take action we should all be 
ashamed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We no longer can say, as some of the other political parties in 
the House would say, that we still must have this thrust of 
having tax cuts.  We are seeing the costs of those tax cuts in 
Walkerton and in North Battleford.  We will see it again and 
again across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to get real.  We have to dig into the pockets and use 
the revenue being generated, not to turn back as tax dollars but 
to flow through so that municipalities across the country can 
build the proper sewage treatment plants, can treat the water and 
can do the testing and monitoring that needs to be done, all of 
which will cost a lot more money than any of those municipalities 
have. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unless we are serious about it, as I said earlier, we will 
simply perpetuate this sham.  That is not something any of us 
should be proud of.  All I can say on behalf of the New 
Democratic Party is that over the next weeks and months we will 
continue to press the government to develop an appropriate 
infrastructure program for the municipalities.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I listened with interest to the remarks of my 
colleague from the NDP.  He speaks of window dressing.  I am 
curious as to whether he would agree that what we are seeing at 
least initially in this debate is an indication that the 
government will in fact vote in favour of the motion this evening 
in a very clever and Janus-like fashion, that it will support the 
motion and indicate in some detail it is already doing what the 
motion calls for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government just as erroneously and disingenuously did the 
same thing when it came to the sex offender registry, indicating 
that it was already taking steps.  The government continuously 
denies and distracts and delays.  These are very much the 
trademarks of the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a specific note, and I know it is an issue my friend would be 
aware of, there is this fundamental issue of health that stems 
from clean air and clean water.  There is a specific example, 
perhaps the most extreme example in the country today, and that 
is the ongoing titanic environmental disaster of the tar ponds in 
Sydney, Cape Breton.  What was once a very pristine body of water 
in that community has now become a chemical pool from steel plant 
chemicals and treatments that have gone into that water supply. 
Just outside our Chamber there is a hunger strike taking place in 
regard to this by Elizabeth May.  With Maude Barlow, she has 
written a book called <I>Frederick Street:  Life and Death on 
Canada's Love Canal</I>. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the context of this debate, I am wondering if there are 
specific recommendations.  My friend touched upon the aspect of 
the money that is required, but is there not a need for 
leadership from the government and a need for a specific plan to 
address situations like the Sydney tar ponds where the health 
risks are phenomenal and are documented?  The cancer rates and 
the rates of other serious illnesses are startling in comparison 
with other communities in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Though we have Walkerton and we now have North Battleford, this 
is a looming disaster for an entire community in Sydney, Cape 
Breton.  Would my friend share with us any thoughts or advice he 
might have for the government in order to finally address this 
huge embarrassment and environmental disaster in Sydney, Cape 
Breton? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have been following 
rather closely for the last two years the issues surrounding the 
Sydney tar ponds and the impact that is having on human health, 
both from the perspective of my position as environmental critic 
for the NDP but also, and more important at this time, in regard 
to the impact that is having on human health.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The statistics that come out of there are just horrendous and 
bring us back to the issue.  What has happened there, I am very 
afraid, will just be repeated by the government, because it has 
had in place a committee for going on five or six years, I 
believe, and there was a preceding committee.  The committee 
really has not accomplished anything.  I think everybody agrees 
with that.  It is almost moribund in its lack of activity and has 
had no effective results at all, so while nothing is going on 
there, in the meantime we have people literally suffering serious 
health problems and there have been a number of deaths that I 
think can safely be attributed to the toxins that exist in the 
air, the soil and the water in that region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hunger strike that Elizabeth May is conducting at this point 
just highlights the level of frustration that people are feeling 
in Cape Breton over that issue and over the lack of any serious 
results being achieved while people are suffering major health 
problems.  We believe that very serious numbers of deaths will 
ultimately come from that.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this debate and join with 
my colleague, the member for Windsor—St. Clair, in expressing 
the support of the New Democratic Party with respect to this 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We want to thank the Conservative Party for bringing this matter 
to the House and we wish to comment on the fact that there seems 
to be, based on the first couple of hours of debate, considerable 
support for the motion.  That is a good sign.  If at the end of 
the day we can unite around something as fundamental to the 
health and well-being of Canadians as a safe drinking water 
supply in our country, then we will have done a great service and 
we will have fulfilled our responsibility as members of 
parliament representing a level of government that is required to 
act on health protection matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What I think is so important today is to acknowledge that health 
protection is a fundamental responsibility of the federal 
government.  It was obviously very disconcerting to hear 
yesterday from the Minister of Health that in fact standards, 
laws and guidelines in terms of quality of water are not 
necessarily the solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>An hon. member:</B>  It was shameful. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, as one of my 
colleagues just said, that was a shameful response.  In fact, 
when it comes to health protection it is the law that we turn to, 
it is tough regulations that we require, and it is leadership 
from the federal government that is so imperative on all fronts. 
The government has failed to uphold its responsibility to act 
under even existing legislation to ensure that a national health 
safety system is in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem we are dealing with today is not just that we are 
trying to get the government to move away from a position of 
inaction and passivity.  It is also an attempt to get the 
government to reverse almost a decade of catering to individuals 
and organizations with a vested interest in seeing privatization, 
deregulation and off loading of responsibilities so that in fact 
there are few standards to adhere to and there is unfettered 
access in terms of marketplace endeavours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sense today that there is a shift in the political climate in 
this country, that in fact the pendulum is swinging.  Given the 
facts that this motion was initiated by the Tories and seems to 
have support from at least some Alliance members, it suggests to 
me that we are finally, as a collective, coming back to the 
realization that government must play an active regulatory role 
in health protection. 
That means setting standards, national policies and mandatory 
guidelines when it comes to something as basic as the quality of 
our water supply.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hear some acknowledgement on this whole issue from members 
across the way on the Liberal benches.  That is heartening, 
because over the last little while we have witnessed a government 
that has been prepared to evade its responsibilities on 
fundamental health protection matters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the government was elected in 1993, it began a process of 
moving our health protection capacity within government from a 
precautionary model, or one that said the ultimate responsibility 
of government is to ensure that the do no harm principle is 
maintained, to a risk management model where in fact private 
industry would set the standards and government would monitor and 
do its best.  In fact, when it came down to it, it was a buyer 
beware model that had to be followed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today we are feeling the consequences of that kind of approach 
and we are realizing that it was wrong.  We are paying the price 
now.  We have to catch up on many fronts.  We have talked in the 
House about food safety, about adverse reactions from drugs and 
about the quality of air.  Today we are talking about probably 
the most fundamental issue when it comes to health and 
well-being, that being the safety of our water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do we have today in terms of federal action to deal with 
the fallout from Walkerton and North Battleford and all the other 
centres that my colleague from Windsor—St. Clair referred to? 
Not much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should have learned from the Walkerton tragedy a year ago. At 
that time many organizations and members of parliament were 
calling for the government to put in place a national water 
policy with mandatory standards and with the financial resources 
to deal with infrastructure difficulties.  Nothing has really 
happened in that whole year.  Back then in the spring of 2000 
numerous organizations and members of parliament talked about how 
our water management laws were outdated, how they went back to 
the fifties.  They talked about how our general anti-pollution 
laws were outdated and needed to be revised.  They talked about 
unenforceable policies, guidelines and objectives of varying 
vintage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What has happened since that period in our history?  What good 
came out of the Walkerton tragedy?  Why do we have to deal with 
North Battleford today when in fact all the lessons were there 
for us to learn one year ago or more?  That is the travesty of 
the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, we all know that it is never too late to learn from the 
mistakes of our past and today is an opportunity to move forward. 
Today we call upon the government to actually take action, in 
whatever form it wants.  It could be, as a senator has 
recommended, to amend the Food and Drugs Act to include mandatory 
standards and programs dealing with quality of water.  It could 
be a separate, safe, national water safety law, as other groups 
have recommended.  It could be the establishment of a special 
committee with resources to get moving on the problems 
immediately.  The bottom line is that we need action today. 
Canadians need action today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think any of us want to hear from constituents who are 
worried about whether the water they have to access is safe. With 
something as vital and as essential as this, which we require on 
a day to day basis, we cannot allow people to live with that kind 
of uncertainty, worry, fear and anxiety about their health and 
safety.  There is no reason for the government to delay on this 
matter.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Yesterday the Minister of Health referred briefly to a bill he 
introduced back in 1997, Bill C-14, an act respecting the safety 
and effectiveness of materials that come into contact with or 
treat water destined for human consumption.  I remind members of 
the House that bill only dealt with a tiny portion of the issue 
of water safety.  It dealt with the questions of water filters 
and water plumbing.  It was pulled suddenly from the agenda of 
the House and not returned, and no action has been taken since. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many members in the House expressed concerns at that time about 
whether or not the government was truly serious about addressing 
water quality, or whether it was just another attempt to respond 
to international trade agreements, to harmonize standards 
globally.  We questioned whether or not there was a real 
framework in terms of dealing with a national safety system.  We 
were anxious to see that debate continue.  We call again on the 
government to bring forward a piece of legislation or a set of 
recommendations that will allow us to move further immediately. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In closing, let us remember Walkerton a year ago and North 
Battleford this week.  Canadians are feeling particularly 
vulnerable in terms of being exposed to contaminated drinking 
water.  All these events underscore the need for safe drinking 
water legislation and mandatory guidelines on the quality of our 
water.  We must act now.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have asked this question several times 
during the debate and almost everyone has prevaricated in their 
answers, so I would like to put this very simple question to the 
member who just spoke. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is it the federal government's responsibility to impose national 
water quality standards on all provinces so that all Canadians 
are guaranteed that the water they drink is safe to drink 
anywhere in Canada?  It is a simple question. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my answer is yes. 
<P><A NAME="LINK53"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Peter MacKay (Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough, PC):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I commend the hon. member on her thoughtful 
commentary.  I know she has been a strong advocate and a strong 
voice on health issues for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to her is equally simple.  Given the rash of severe 
cuts we have seen imposed by the government since 1993, taking 
billions of dollars out of provincial transfers, does she not 
agree there has been a cascading cost down to provinces and 
subsequently down to municipalities that to a large extent could 
be pointed to as part of the responsibility for failing 
infrastructure that has left Canadians vulnerable to the types of 
situations we have seen in Walkerton and North Battleford?  Does 
she agree that there is a responsibility directly attributable to 
the federal government? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the short answer is 
yes.  Just to elaborate very briefly, the cuts by the government 
since 1993 in terms of transfer payments for health and other 
social programs are cause for the load provincial governments are 
now feeling. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think, though, specifically of the cuts to the health 
protection branch, the dismantling of the drug safety bureau, the 
erosion of the food safety lab, and the inaction on contaminants 
and toxins in consumer products.  All those cuts have meant that 
provincial governments, in order to act in the best interest of 
their citizens and to ensure a health protection system and a 
safety system are in place, are left to pick up the pieces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Obviously they cannot do it on their own.  We cannot continue to 
have a patchwork of systems across the country.  We cannot 
continue to evade federal responsibility for something as vital 
as safe drinking water. 
<P><A NAME="LINK54"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>   Mr. Speaker, I think Mr. Harris would have 
something quite different to say in terms of the cascading 
effect. 
It was he, after all, and his Conservative government in Ontario 
that took a big bite out of water safety and security and, more 
to the point, privatized.  This had a net impact of making it 
difficult for the good folks in Walkerton, which is very close to 
my area.  When I was mayor we put in place the first groundwater 
protection security system in Canada in the region of Waterloo, 
the very municipality in which I was mayor.  It is very important 
water.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wanted to ask the member opposite the following question. 
Given her zest for this area, which I think is rightfully placed 
and quite correct, would she use the same kind of enthusiasm, 
shall we say, in picking up on the Sierra legal defence fund's 
report card on Saskatchewan getting a C, Manitoba getting a C 
minus, and British Columbia getting a D when it comes to water 
safety and security? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not know if I 
can actually point to many differences between the present 
federal Liberals and the Harris Conservatives in Ontario in terms 
of an agenda of privatization, deregulation and offloading.  Both 
levels of government bear responsibility for the current critical 
situation we are facing and both must take measures to act in the 
best interest of common good and public safety. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of his last comment around the Sierra club's report 
card, let me say from my vantage point that the provincial 
government in Manitoba is certainly working hard on environmental 
issues.  As the Conservative member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough just said, it is pretty hard for 
provincial governments to deal with the cascading effect of 
federal cutbacks and downloading on to provincial governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Every provincial government would probably welcome the notion of 
national standards when it comes to water quality and would 
welcome some support and leadership from the federal government 
to try to address a very serious and systemic problem in society 
today. 
<P><A NAME="LINK55"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I pay 
tribute to the hon. member from Winnipeg on her contribution in 
terms of protecting human health.  Quite simply, the Liberal 
Party of Canada prior to the election in 1993 called upon the 
federal government to have safe drinking water legislation in 
place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal red book 3 said that clean air and water were 
Canada's birthright.  Does the member agree with the Progressive 
Conservative Party that clean drinking water is the birthright of 
all Canadians? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I think the answer 
to that is obvious.  Based on my speech today and the work my 
colleagues and I in the NDP have been doing over many years, we 
believe that access to safe water is a right as members of a 
civil society, a civilized nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government has a responsibility to ensure that the 
food we eat, the drugs we must take for health reasons, the water 
we drink to survive, the air we breathe, the medical devices we 
must use, and the blood transfused must be safe beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  The government should always act in terms of 
the precautionary principle, ensuring that no harm comes to 
Canadians through these vital essentials of life.

the member for Brandon—Souris.  I am sure that you will wait for 
the end of my speech in order to hear what he has to say. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today, we are talking about drinking water, because problems 
exist. Water is primordial.  It is life.  Except that now it can 
also mean death or illness.  It is something we must therefore 
talk about.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the opportunity in an earlier life to be the mayor of a 
municipality and the reeve of an RCM for 11 years.  As such, I 
had to deal with two water contamination problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Between you and me, we were not prepared.  The first time, the 
problem involved ammoniacal nitrogen, and I will not give a course on 
chemistry.  What is ammoniacal nitrogen? It is a mixture of dead 
leaves, detritus and fecal coliforms from both animals and 
humans which completely unbalances the filtration system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic filtration system in a small or medium size 
municipality is not complicated. 
Water is drawn from a river or a well, and sodium hydroxide, 
alum and chlorine are added.  That is it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When things are out of balance, they increase the chlorine to 
kill the bugs.  However chorine cannot kill all the bugs in the 
water.  So some people got gastro-enteritis but, thank God, 
nothing more serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A few years later, another problem arose.  This one was due to a 
spill: liquid manure got into our main reservoir and, once 
again, threw everything out of kilter.  Again, we had problems 
with the public.  Following theses disasters, there were a number 
of them throughout the country, people changed their way of 
doing things.  They evolved. They adapted.  They 
created new regulations, new laws, except that they were not 
uniform. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec, for instance, the regulations are not applied the 
same by all municipalities.  Why?  Because they do not all have 
the same means.  The government of Quebec has probably been one 
of the most active governments, producing new regulations and 
new statutes, although there has been a bit of a delay because 
of the applicability of this legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The municipalities are told “This is what you have to do”. 
However 
they lack the expertise and means the major urban centres have. 
Some provinces are not as advanced as others.  The comment is 
often made to the federal government “What are you doing messing 
about with drinking water?  That is a provincial jurisdiction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People's health is not provincial, not federal, not municipal, 
not the responsibility of a school board.  When there is a 
public health problem, we as elected representatives have a duty 
to assume our responsibilities and to do something. 
This does not mean overstepping jurisdictional rights.  If 
people are not putting the interests of those they represent 
foremost, it is the role of this parliament to let them know and 
to take the appropriate steps. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If a province is in line, that is fine.  Debates may, however, 
be raised at some point.  Provinces are starting to set up 
commissions.  Quebec, for instance, held a symposium on water a 
few years ago.  It even declared a moratorium on all water 
bottling plants in Quebec.  Major commissions of inquiry are 
cropping up in the various provinces.  If there are a few 
fatalities, a few cases of illness, a commission is struck. 
There is no uniformity, and the information is not even shared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that the federal government must be in a 
position to bring together all partners in order to put criteria 
in place, standards for across Canada.  There is nothing 
dangerous about a standard for all of Canada.  It will be a 
minimum, one that will need adjustment, of course.  It is not 
good for 30 years; adjustments will need to be made within a 
certain timeframe.  This is an evolving situation, and so 
standards will have to be adjusted as we go along in order to 
keep our water drinkable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The greatest reserve of drinking water is in Canada.  People 
drinking Canadian water have been dying.  Although the situation 
does not really lend itself to such a comparison, if we were the 
top beef producer in the world and people were dying from eating 
beef, a whole industry would be at risk. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What do people do when there are problems with their 
drinking water? Instead of putting pressure on all levels of 
government, including the federal and provincial governments, 
they walk over to the convenience store and buy bottled 
water, because they have no choice. 
This does not solve the drinking water problem in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are saying is that time has come for the federal 
government to assume its responsibilities. We are not 
necessarily talking about a bill like those that used to specify 
which screw, hose or pipe to use. We are not talking about 
hardware; we are talking about global issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ask our partners in confederation to assess the 
situation and to take action. This is a public health issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am telling my colleagues from Quebec “Do not be afraid, this 
is not a Liberal motion”. I know that the Liberals are in 
office. I know it is disturbing and tiring. It is upsetting to 
see the government introduce bills. It is always messing 
around with the grey areas, in terms of jurisdiction. 
However this is a motion from a political party that is respected by 
the regions and provinces. We need help to push the government 
in the right direction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This motion does not jeopardize the jurisdictions of the 
provinces. If they want to do the job, let them do it. Are we 
not part of a country? The federal government has a role to 
play. It must contact its partners, so that they can find 
solutions together. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do not start a war, do not start fighting over provincial 
jurisdictions. We know all about that. In any case, the supreme 
court is there, should the federal government get involved in 
provincial jurisdictions. Under the constitution, an appeal is 
possible. The problem is that there are some grey areas in the 
constitution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that people must get together. 
Drinking water is under provincial jurisdiction, but its export 
is a federal matter.  In this House alone, is there a minister 
responsible for water in general?  Is there one?  No.  Five or 
six ministers at least are involved: the ministers of health, 
public works, intergovernmental affairs, the environment, 
fisheries and oceans, and so on. Everyone has a say on 
water issues, and more specifically, on drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My provincial colleagues, including those from Quebec, should 
not be afraid to support such a motion.  They should tell 
themselves one thing, which comes from the civil code of Quebec, 
and that is, we have to act reasonably, according to the spirit 
of the civil code.  If we act reasonably, we can avoid many 
problems when they arise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We invite the members to set a course, to look in partnership at 
the best solutions and standards.  Standards change.  If there 
is ever a problem, we in the Progressive Conservative Party 
cannot be accused of doing nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is only a motion, and we are an opposition party.  This is 
why we hope that both the government and the opposition will 
work together to ensure respect for jurisdictions.  It is time 
to stop getting our knickers in a twist.  I know it is difficult 
with the government opposite.  We must stop and recognize that 
there is a real problem.  If one province does its job, so much 
the better.  If there is one that does not, or if public health 
is at risk, no one better come to me saying it is a 
jurisdictional issue.  It is an issue of accountability, and 
that starts here in parliament.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lynn Myers (Parliamentary Secretary to Solicitor General 
of Canada, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I agree with a number of the 
points made by the hon. member.  About six years ago when I was a 
councillor for the region of Waterloo there was an outbreak of 
cryptosporidium.  It is not a pleasant thing to go through. 
Fortunately for us we had an alternate water supply and other 
ways of coping.  However it was nothing like what the people of 
Saskatchewan are going through and what the people of Walkerton 
went through. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a very important motion, one of great concern to 
Canadians.  It behoves us as parliamentarians to review the 
things Health Canada has been doing in this area in terms of 
setting out guidelines and publications, researching the effects 
of water on human health, and looking at different treatment 
additives and devices.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>People are looking into the issue in a meaningful way, 
especially the people at Health Canada.  Can we do more?  We can 
always do more on such an important health related issue.  In 
budget 2000 the government committed $2.65 billion over the next 
six years to infrastructure, green projects and other things 
commensurate with what we are talking about today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was interested in the member's comments on jurisdiction. There 
are always sensitivities relating to federal, provincial and 
territorial discussions.  There are sensitivities when it comes 
to who is doing the work and who is mandated to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to hear the member explain a little more how he 
thinks the process could and should work.  Perhaps he could use 
Quebec, his home province, as an example and explain how best to 
make sure jurisdictional squabbles vis-à-vis water supply are set 
aside in this case in the best interest of Canadians wherever 
they live in this great country.  I would be interested in the 
member's opinion on that. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  Jurisdictions are part of our everyday life in 
government.  They must be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That being said, a jurisdiction shared by everyone is called 
leadership.  We are saying that it is not because there is a 
jurisdictional problem that the federal government does not have 
a unifying role to play. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning, our leader, the member for Calgary-Centre, said 
that this was what co-operative federalism was all about.  The 
fact that there is a problem in a jurisdiction does not mean 
that I will not help it. One does not leave someone to rot 
because one is not supposed to be on his sidewalk. One gives him 
a hand, while respecting jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are saying that it is not a case of setting norms or 
standards, call them whatever, and then imposing them on the 
provinces.  That is not what this is about.  There must be 
consensus with our partners.  Once this has been obtained and 
created, then yes, a national standard can be drawn up. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the issue of drinking water, there is no getting away 
from it.  It is a matter of life and, unfortunately these days, 
a matter of death.  The federal government must play a unifying 
role, all the while respecting jurisdictions.  For us in the 
Progressive Conservative Party, respect for the provinces is 
probably the most important, because it also involves respect for 
the regions and the people who live there. 
<P><A NAME="LINK58"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question will be very brief. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a little trouble with the statement that they will 
respect jurisdictions and that that is what must be done.  I have 
a problem with that because it involves the consensus just 
mentioned.  They come along and step in and we have a national 
standard.  When it comes time to raise these standards or change 
them, Quebec will have its hands tied in its own jurisdiction. 
Would the member for Richmond—Arthabaska comment on this? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. André Bachand:</B> Mr. Speaker, when regulations are set by 
consensus, they have built-in mechanisms that come in handy when 
it is time to modernize these regulations. Any analogy is lame, I 
agree, but the five main principles of the Canada Health Act are 
pretty vague. Provinces can do almost anything they want as long 
as they maintain a minimum level of service. The problem with 
this legislation is that it is not reviewed on a regular basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as public health is concerned, we should have 
shared national standards. Of course, these would be implemented 
by the provinces, which would be done again by consensus or under 
an agreement with the federal government. Jurisdictions clearly 
have to be respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The constitution is very clear on this issue: court challenges 
are always possible. Quebec has not gone much to the supreme 
court recently to get an opinion on a constitutional matter. 
Still, all the provinces and even the federal government have 
the power to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, I do not think it is really a problem. Maybe we just need to 
change the players on the other side. If we all agree to work 
together, I believe that we can get the people opposite untwist 
their knickers, so to speak.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik (Brandon—Souris, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, the member for Fundy—Royal, who moved our 
opposition day motion today. 
It is rather timely and certainly rather topical.  The member for 
Fundy—Royal has been working on the issue quite a while, even 
before the current problems in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. 
The issue was on the minds of Canadians even before the terrible 
happenings in North Battleford.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate my other colleague, the hon. member for 
Richmond—Arthabaska, who as we all know was the previous mayor 
of Asbestos. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will deal with two areas.  One relates to my previous 
municipal experience.  I will also touch briefly on the area of 
federal responsibility, as the federal government has a large 
responsibility for first nations people in Manitoba and 
Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We accept the motion and hope members of the government and 
other opposition parties accept it.  No commodity in our world, 
our country and our municipalities is more sacred than water.  If 
we do not have food, clean air and water then what we know as 
life cannot exist.  We must put our priorities in perspective and 
water is one of them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the federal government and the Federation of Canadian 
Municipalities put an infrastructure program into place.  It was 
a tripartite arrangement between the federal, provincial and 
municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention that for specific reasons.  First, co-operative 
federalism has worked in all provinces.  All levels of 
government, municipal, provincial and federal, got together and 
said they had needs which could best be served by working 
together.  We all work for the same people.  Our constituents are 
the constituents of all three levels of government.  It is 
therefore important that we work together to provide the best 
services we can. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The infrastructure program was about dollars.  We are talking 
about standards.  We can, through compromise and consensus among 
all levels of government, put proper standards into place that 
benefit all provinces and peoples throughout the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 my community had access to millions of dollars and I 
played a role in decision making.  We put the majority of those 
dollars into the sewer and water infrastructure our constituents 
needed to be able to work and live in the community.  We put most 
of the money into water.  As mentioned, single source communities 
like North Battleford are running into serious issues of 
contamination.   My community spent millions of dollars to find a 
second water supply.  We spent those dollars knowing full well 
our constituents needed an uncontaminated water source. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also put millions of dollars into the sewage treatment plant 
which sends sewage into the rivers.  It was necessary to treat 
the effluent so people downstream would not suffer problems.  I 
say with great pride that we spent those dollars in the right 
places. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federation of Canadian Municipalities says Canadians are the 
second highest users of water.  It says Canadians use 300 litres 
of water per person per day.  That is a huge amount.  It is 
something we have taken for granted.  We must put standards into 
place to make sure those 300 litres are of proper quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A member of the government mentioned that $2.6 billion over six 
years had been identified by the government to go into 
infrastructure.  The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has 
indicated that infrastructure to ensure quality water for 
Canadian citizens would require some $16.5 billion.  When $16.5 
billion is needed, $2.6 billion over six years is but a drop in 
the bucket. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I suspect we can work together, provincially, municipally and 
federally, to put the necessary standards into place. 
We have a substantial number of first nations people in Manitoba, 
particularly in Saskatchewan.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote from an article in which Chief Matthew 
Coon Come said: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>“Walkerton made news across Canada,” the national chief of the 
Assembly of First Nations said.  “But about one out of eight of 
our aboriginal communities are threatened by unsafe water, which 
each year kills our newborn and our elderly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These deaths don't make the front pages of Canadian 
newspapers... 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This accurately sums up the problems that are evident in our 
water supply in our aboriginal communities.  One out of eight 
aboriginal communities today do not have proper water quality for 
the people they serve. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The national chief's statement is also supported by a 1995 
Health Canada report that found that 171 reserves, or one in five 
at that time, had water systems that could affect the health and 
safety of the community if the problems were not addressed. Those 
problems were not addressed.  Today there is still one in eight 
communities that still suffer through an inadequate water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Drinking water became so bad a few years ago that aboriginal 
residents were told by health experts to give only bottled water 
to their pets because the quality was so bad.  The assembly of 
first nations recently reported that 79 communities or 12% had 
what Health Canada called potentially dangerous drinking water. 
These statistics demonstrate the severity and the extent this 
issue has impacted those communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>National water safety standards must take into account not only 
what is happening in our rural urban centres across Canada, but 
also in our aboriginal communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I say that there is a need for us as Canadians to identify 
the need for water purification, I cannot underestimate the 
seriousness of that statement.  The motion before us today sets 
those standards.  We currently have guidelines that can or cannot 
be followed dependent upon how the jurisdiction wishes to follow 
them.  We have no specific standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>You have the opportunity, Mr. Speaker, to travel across the 
country as I do.  I go from Manitoba to Alberta, to British 
Columbia to Quebec City or to the maritimes.  When I take a glass 
of water I believe that, as a Canadian, I should be convinced 
that that water is of sufficient quality to drink and should not 
be afraid for my health, welfare and well-being.  That is where 
we have to set the standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Right now in Canada we do not have a standard or guideline set 
for the testing of cryptosporidium, that very little parasite 
that is causing all that trouble in North Battleford.  There is 
no need by our guidelines to test for that.  That is utterly 
insane.  The United States has a requirement, a guideline and a 
standard to test for cryptosporidium.  When I go to my friend's 
in Alberta, I expect that the water supply not to be contaminated 
with cryptosporidium.  However right now I do not know that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is why we are here today suggesting that the government, 
with the co-operative federalism, that wonderful buzzword, work 
in concert with provincial governments, as well as municipal 
governments, to put forward the standards which could be 
accepted. so that when I and my family travelled across Canada we 
would not have the possibility of encountering a water quality 
that would not be good for our health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative party did not put forward this 
motion simply because of what has happened in the last number of 
days.  In our policy statement and during the last election we 
indicated that this was a very serious issue.  The PC party said 
that if we were in government we would introduce a safe water act 
which would legislate and ensure safe drinking water quality 
standards for Canadians.  That would be harmonized with the 
provinces and territories. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Everyone across Canada should have that same security in knowing 
their water is safe.  That comes from an election platform back 
in the year 2000.  We put our money where our mouth was.  We put 
our water where our platform was.  I suspect that the government 
should embrace what our platform was. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Conservative party also said that we would enshrine into law 
and harmonize with the provinces and territories Health Canada's 
guidelines for drinking water. 
As a result, any municipal water source in non-compliance would 
be immediately disclosed to the public.  Transparency concerning 
the water supply would build the confidence that Canadians 
deserve.  We had that policy in our platform, so we speak from 
the heart and from a policy that was put into place that speaks 
to this very issue.

what I consider to be one of the most, if not the most, important 
issues facing Canadians today. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK60"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Robert Lanctôt (Châteauguay, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, as I 
explained in the House earlier, Quebec has been working on draft 
regulations since June 19, 2000. A final draft designed to make 
standards far exceed those being proposed for Canada will be 
submitted to the Quebec cabinet. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has already been proven that Quebec has the best water 
management system. What scares me about this motion, as noble as 
it may be, is that programs already exist. Again it will look 
like duplication. Even experts will not know where to turn, and 
we will be dividing this concentration of expertise. Who will be 
the looser in all this? The environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also heard the member for Toronto—Danforth tell us earlier 
that the government wanted to respect this jurisdiction, because 
water was too important. Something else is important, however, 
and I am talking about respecting jurisdictions provided for in 
sections 91 and 92 for over 100 years. These jurisdictions have 
already been divided, I am supposed to believe that there is 
no danger of opening the door to encroachment when water is a 
provincial jurisdiction, therefore Quebec's jurisdiction, and the 
establishment of national standards is being proposed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How are you going to convince me that these national standards 
will not create the same situation we saw in other areas, such as 
the millennium scholarships, education and health? How are you 
going to assure me that the government will respect this 
jurisdiction? I do not believe it will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of what I just said, what do you think about these 
remarks? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B> Before I give the floor to the member for 
Brandon—Souris, I would like to remind the member for 
Châteauguay that any comments, questions and interventions must 
be addressed through the Chair, and not directly to the member. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I know the member for 
Châteauguay was actually working through the chair.  He was just 
looking at me and that is why his comments may have seemed a bit 
more pointed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I say to the member for Châteauguay that the Bloc is losing its 
raison d'être.  We do know that there are certain provincial 
jurisdictions in the provinces.  Having been in another level of 
government, I recognize that those jurisdictions are selfishly 
guarded, as well they should. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member for Châteauguay said that there would be standards 
set within the province of Quebec.  Good for the province of 
Quebec. I hope those standards would be set at a higher level and 
a higher bar than perhaps the standards would be set at a federal 
level because they would then take precedence.  Those standards 
would take precedence within the provincial government and those 
would be the standards they would try to achieve.  I say good for 
the hon. member.  I hope he does have the highest standard of 
water quality within our country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there are other provinces that perhaps may not set those 
same standards.  What I am saying is that when I go to Quebec 
City, one of the most beautiful cities in the world, I expect to 
have water quality that I can depend on.  I expect also when I go 
to Winnipeg, Manitoba or Dauphin, Manitoba that the level of 
standard, that bar, should be attained.  I see the member for 
Dauphin—Swan River, whose area had some serious water quality 
problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the jurisdiction, absolutely.  Co-operative federalism is 
a buzzword we have heard in the House so often.  I wish we could 
finally put it into effect.  We should have co-operation among 
the provinces, the territories, and I have even thrown in the 
municipal governments.  It is necessary that there be a 
tripartite co-operative relationship and a tripartite funding 
relationship.

Mr. Speaker, congratulations to my colleague and to all members 
who have taken part in the debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to the question from the hon. member for 
Châteauguay's question, I say to my friend from Brandon—Souris 
that there is nothing which would in effect harm Quebec's 
standards to adopt and accept the motion that has been put 
forward.  In fact it would very much embrace a situation that he 
has quite rightly pointed out.  If Quebec has legislation 
pending, and I take him at his word, which would try to set a 
higher standard in the province of Quebec, that is perfectly in 
keeping with the notion of co-operative federalism.  In fact, I 
will be the first to acknowledge that in the area of criminal 
justice with young offenders Quebec set a very high standard 
which other provinces can strive to match or exceed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Does my hon. colleague from Brandon—Souris not see that the 
motion is consistent with Quebec's approach, that is to always 
strive to put water safety, in terms of Canadians' health first 
and we should be trying to match if not exceed Quebec's example? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Borotsik:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member for 
Pictou—Antigonish—Guysborough was absolutely correct in 
reconfirming what I had said earlier.  We hope and wish the Bloc 
Quebecois and its members will support the motion for the very 
fact that they on behalf of their constituents would now be 
setting a benchmark and standard throughout the country which 
would have water quality as its raison d'être.  If the province 
of Quebec wants to raise that bar even higher and set those 
standards higher, we would applaud that.

am back home.  I have been away the last weeks attending to the 
my new son, Cade Andrew, who was born on April 17. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is very important on the heels of the recent tragedy 
at North Battleford and certainly last year's tragedy in 
Walkerton.  It is critical to the health of all Canadians, and is 
something that is very close to my heart. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a parent with a 22 month old and a newborn and knowing that 
contaminants have a more serious effect on the newborn and the 
elderly, I am very concerned. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Having been an alderman in the Village of Perth-Andover, I am 
also familiar with the issues from a municipal perspective.  They 
are very serious, and all municipalities take them very 
seriously. In funding crunches, I also understand the 
administration and construction of the municipal facilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As an engineer for the last nine years, I worked in the 
environmental sector, specifically in the area of water quality, 
water and waste water quality.  For the last five years, I have 
been president and/or vice president of the New Brunswick 
Environment Industries Association.  One of its goals is 
educating the population of New Brunswick on environmental 
issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also add that as part of that association I was allowed 
to see a lot of the Canadian technologies, as far as drinking 
water goes.  Companies such as ADI in the riding of Fredericton, 
Zenon and Trojan Technologies in Ontario have internationally 
renowned technologies on clean water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last June I also helped initiate and co-chaired a clean water 
conference in Fredericton, New Brunswick, entitled “Your 
Drinking Water: Ensuring Its Safety”.  Three hundred people 
attended from across Atlantic Canada to talk about drinking water 
issues.  The goal of that conference was to educate the people on 
the perils of unsafe drinking water, how to remediate unsafe 
drinking water if they ran into that situation in their 
communities and how to protect their communities against unsafe 
drinking water.  It was very much an educational conference, and 
I am proud to announce that I will be doing it again this 
September. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As members can see, from a parent's perspective, from a 
municipal politician's perspective, from a professional 
perspective and certainly from a personal perspective, this is 
one of the issues I feel very strongly about and have some 
background in.  In fact part of my platform during the last 
campaign was clean water issues.  One of the reasons I came to 
Ottawa was my strong beliefs in clean water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the specific motion, I do not agree with the honourable 
intent of the motion.  It is an excellent motion but I have some 
concerns.  The hon. member's goals are very honest and productive 
for society in Canada.

</I></B></P><P align=left>As recently as last night, at, I assume, a multiparty dinner, 
the leader of the PC Party mentioned that one of the policy areas 
on which he would like to co-operate with the official opposition 
was specifically in the area of a renewed or healthy federalism, 
which he said was to respect the rights of the provinces.  Some 
would see it as flying in the face of a renewed federalism, which 
is respecting the rights of provincial jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will turn to our Liberal record on water quality and some of 
the initiatives that we have undertaken.  In the 2000 Liberal 
election platform, <I>Opportunity for All</I>, we committed to 
addressing the issue of safe drinking water by funding 
improvements to municipal water and wastewater systems through 
the infrastructure Canada program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also committed to working with provincial, territorial and 
municipal governments to create the first building code for 
municipal water and wastewater facilities.  Such a code would 
help improve the ability of municipalities to meet water quality 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the 2000 budget the Liberal government committed $2.65 
billion over six years to fund improvements to infrastructure 
across Canada.  We created the $25 million green municipal 
enabling fund and the $100 million green municipal investment 
fund to help municipalities improve energy efficiency, water and 
wastewater treatment, solid waste treatment and public 
transportation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government is providing leadership on the protection 
of clean drinking water through the Canadian Council of Ministers 
of the Environment.  As recently as May 1, council members agreed 
that the protection of surface and groundwater quality was a 
priority.  The council agreed to collaborate on water research, 
to share best management practices, to accelerate the development 
of water quality guidelines and to link existing water quality 
monitoring networks to provide comprehensive access to timely 
information. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has shown a commitment to safe drinking water for 
all people in Canada by focusing on stronger national guidelines 
for water quality and by strengthening the role of the National 
Water Research Institute.  The institute has an excellent well 
water monitoring and modelling program, that it is working on 
now, by funding improvements to municipal water and wastewater 
systems, and by investing in research and development on better 
land use practices. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One of the major issues is the healthy federalism that I spoke 
about.  We have to consult with the provinces to see if they 
support us in taking the lead on this issue.  Do they want us to 
establish enforceable national drinking water standards? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand the need to address this issue and I respect the 
sincere intent of the motion.  I commend the hon. member for 
Fundy—Royal for his quick action and for his attempt to find a 
quick solution to the serious situation.  We must consult, liaise 
and ultimately, in the words of his own leader, respect the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I have concerns regarding the healthy federalism in 
consulting with the provinces, it is an important enough 
solution.  I am proud to say to my constituents and to my family 
that I will vote in support of the motion.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard (Chatham—Kent Essex, Lib.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I too, as most members of the House, wish to thank the 
member for Fundy—Royal.  When it comes to a health issue that 
affects the lives of every person in the country, it is 
imperative that we put aside partisan politics and work toward 
the best interest of everyone in the country.  The motion does 
that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion respects all members in the House and it tries to put 
an issue forward that would be fundamentally helpful for the 
whole system.  It would help the federal, provincial and 
municipal governments to work together to make certain that these 
kinds of tragic incidents that happened in Walkerton and North 
Battleford do not repeat themselves time and time again. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was first told that there was a boil water order in the 
municipality that I live in, I found it difficult to accept here 
in Canada.  We talk about boiling water or not drinking water 
when we travel to some third world countries but not many of us 
thought about that situation happening here in our own country. 
It did bring shock but it also brought awareness.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Everybody in the country must be made aware that we have to do 
all we can, at all cost, to ensure we have safe drinking water 
and a safe supply of other items such as food and so on.  It is 
clearly an issue that affects the lives of everyone.  The barrier 
to this point has been that public opinion has not moved forward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I was the mayor of Kingsville much of the municipal fund 
was spent in trying to improve the water system.  Our small 
community was looking at $1.5 million year after year to separate 
the water system so that raw sewage was never pumped into the 
Great Lakes.  A great deal of work was done on the water system 
to make sure that safe water was available. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We now find that systems are getting older, but we can now test 
the systems to find bacteria or micro-organisms that create 
somewhat of a problem.  Places like Walkerton and North 
Battleford raise our awareness of what is happening.  It is 
important that we have standards across the country to make 
certain that no one can be threatened under any circumstances by 
our systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is extremely important we make sure that frequent sampling is 
done on a regular and consistent basis.  The national guidelines 
structured between the federal government and the provinces show 
us a good direction to head in.  They point out where we need to 
go. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The issue is to ensure that those national guidelines are 
enforceable.  That is what the debate is about today.  It is 
about ensuring that water pollutants are treated properly so that 
our water is safe, that the aesthetic concerns about water which 
Canadians demand are met, and that we test water on a frequent 
basis to make sure it is safe for all Canadians.  As I understand 
it, the national guidelines have been accepted in Alberta, Quebec 
and Nova Scotia.  Hopefully that program will continue and cover 
the rest of the provinces as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By making sure that all provinces move in an appropriate way to 
correct the systems that need correcting is the important issue 
of the day.  Yes, the Liberal government did take action.  No, we 
cannot correct all things in one quick sweep.  I do not believe 
many people 5 or 10 years ago would have thought that we would be 
faced with the dilemma we now have with our water systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the Walkerton incident there was a great deal of 
discussion about water safety across Canada.  As an election 
platform the Liberal government looked very carefully at the 
infrastructure in the country.  The government may not do all the 
things that need to be done, but by working in co-operation with 
the provincial and municipal governments and by directing $2.65 
billion toward infrastructure it will go a long way in the next 
few years to ensure that the needed safety factors are in place. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important we also realize that we as the federal 
government do not do things alone.  As our minister said 
yesterday, passing a law is not the only way to resolve a 
problem.

</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we have consultations with the provinces,

take their expertise, technology and their advances into 
consideration so that we build a system that would be workable 
and safe for all Canadians.  We must ensure that municipalities 
spend what is required to make certain that the municipal water 
systems and waste systems are state of the art technology. Canada 
must go in that direction to make sure that we are there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment on May 1 
put an agreement in place to protect surface groundwater quality, 
making sure that it was a priority for all governments across 
Canada.  It agreed to collaborate on water research.  That means 
we can bring together the experts who know systems that are 
workable and the solutions available and  who can make certain 
that all municipalities and all provinces have all the 
information required to use the best technology possible to work 
on this problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It also agreed to share best management practices.  Oftentimes 
training and management practices are not necessarily as they 
should be.  It is important to realize that under proper 
management systems it is possible that the Walkerton situation 
may have been averted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard testimony from Walkerton.  We are all aware that 
there were some very difficult situations in their management 
system.  That should not happen and we must make sure that anyone 
operating a system maintains it at the best possible level.  We 
need to accelerate the development of our guidelines.  They would 
be structured to make sure that we have a system where everyone 
could share in what needs to be done and share in the monitoring 
of all systems across the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we look at the issue it is critical to support the motion 
which has a tremendous amount of merit.  It can take away 
partisanship in the House.  It can make certain that we are all 
working together to ensure that Canadians have a system that is 
workable, that is better for everyone than some of the systems of 
today, and yet takes into account all the technology, costs and 
resources required to move forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK64"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom (Selkirk—Interlake, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, my question is quite simple.  Does 
the hon. member believe there should be more money put into basic 
infrastructure in the country and, if so, how much more than is 
presently going into it? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that as 
we move along as a society there is a definite requirement for 
money to be put into infrastructure.  We have a problem today in 
water systems, perhaps many water systems across the country, but 
new guidelines are being structured and set.  New goals and 
targets are being worked on.  It is important the experts sit 
down to look at what is the most cost efficient and yet 
achievable goals to make certain the system works. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Chlorination was a system used in the past.  Today new systems 
in chlorination and other systems have been developed.  I do not 
know what those costs are.  For me to suggest that putting in 
more money would resolve the question is naive, to say the least. 
It is also naive for me to say that we do not need more money, 
but what is clear is that we need a safe system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need experts to look at the costs.  We know that costs in the 
past have traditionally been shared by the municipalities and the 
provinces.  We know that the federal government has tried to come 
into the system with a program of infrastructure.  Since first 
elected in 1993 until now the Liberal government has provided 
infrastructure dollars to assist municipalities and provincial 
governments to achieve the goals that need to be achieved.

<A HREF="#LINKT44"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe it is extremely important to look into what the costs 
are, at how those costs could be shared, at what the role of each 
level of government is and then make the decisions there. It is 
not just a simple matter of money.  It is a matter of safety, a 
matter of technology and a matter of what needs to be done in the 
systems before I could possibly make that commitment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Howard Hilstrom:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I take the comments 
with a grain of salt.  Members of the military did training 
exercises in my area before they went to Bosnia.  They had a 
portable water treatment system.  They went to the sewage lagoons 
at one of our local towns and pumped the water out of the sewage 
lagoon into that system, and out came potable water.  I do not 
buy into that statement that Canadians can wait for studies, 
government bureaucracy, cost effectiveness or technology.  We 
cannot wait for that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The systems available now are state of the art, but 
municipalities cannot afford them.  We need a commitment from the 
federal government for money for basic water system 
infrastructure.  As well, as far as roads are concerned there is 
no special engineering need for roads.  They are a disaster 
across the country.  We need infrastructure money for our 
municipalities, our cities and our towns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jerry Pickard:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I could agree with my 
colleague across the way if we had to sit back and wait. However, 
I also believe that many municipalities have looked very 
carefully at problems if they have had problems.  They have had 
people working at it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mentioned my union system.  I was shocked.  The administrator 
for the municipality of Leamington chaired a committee to look at 
what needed to be done with that system and at what corrections 
needed to be made.  The committee made certain suggestions within 
technology.  Chlorination was one of the recommendations, not 
only at the source where they are pumping water out but in 
different areas in the municipality, where they do injections of 
chlorination in order to resolve the problems in the system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe each system has specific problems in specific areas, 
which we must deal with.  As a result, I would suggest that every 
municipality has its own area to struggle with and work with.  I 
am not saying it is a blanket, but it is something that has to be 
dealt with system by system by system.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Forseth (New Westminster—Coquitlam—Burnaby, 
Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be splitting my time. 
The motion before us, including the amendment, would read: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should act 
immediately with the provinces and territories respecting their 
jurisdiction, to ensure enforceable national drinking water 
standards that would be enshrined in a Safe Water Act. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I support this motion, for certainly clean drinking water is a 
trust for basic public safety and standards must be ensured 
across Canada.  Due to local jurisdiction, there must be a 
national will for co-operation.  All must work together with the 
provinces and the municipalities in setting standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must engage in a full assessment of Canada's domestic 
consumer water supply, the state of municipal infrastructure, 
source water protection and land use planning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sadly, the misplaced priorities of poor Liberal management are 
revealed again.  Money targeted for infrastructure goes to golf 
courses rather than water safety.  Other bad spending happens 
when essentials are ignored, such as the HRDC boondoggle and in 
other ways. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The water is polluted because we pollute it.  Standards will not 
solve the problems in themselves:  water, water, everywhere and 
some not fit to drink. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although water quality is a provincial responsibility, 
municipalities operate water treatment plants and have direct 
contact with the customer.  This is why the Federation of 
Canadian Municipalities may ask the federal government to help 
establish mandatory national drinking water quality standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could require a constitutional challenge and an act of 
parliament to enable the federal government to apply enforceable 
standards nationwide.  Overall unfortunately, many provinces do 
not give sufficient support to municipalities for local water 
systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not calling for the federal government to assume all 
responsibility for water standards. 
The first step is to have provincial and territorial governments 
legislate guidelines for drinking water and include enforcement 
and mandatory testing.  Until provinces take positive action, we 
can expect more needless deaths from drinking water.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, there is a federal role. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the case of North Battleford, Saskatchewan, how could it 
possibly be that a modern city in an industrialized country 
builds a water treatment plant's river intake downstream of its 
sewage treatment discharge? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, this incident would not have occurred if we had the 
political will to insist on tertiary sewage treatment.  How can 
we possibly find it acceptable to be discharging dangerous sewage 
into waterways given the obvious environmental and water crises 
that the world is heading toward?  The days of dilution being the 
solution for pollution are long gone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians who enjoy a high standard of living need to wake up to 
environmental reality and demand that more of their earnings of 
today go to preventing disaster in the future.  Every province 
should be implementing tertiary wastewater treatment policies and 
zero toxic industrial discharge. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Water is without a doubt the single most important natural 
resource of Canada.  We must protect it.  Water is supplied as 
part of municipal services, yet when there is a drinking water 
crisis people are advised to boil their water or use bottled 
water.  No one seems to even want to notice that the bottled 
water comes from private companies.  Private citizens and 
government officials apparently trust the quality of privately 
supplied bottled water and then rally against privatizing the 
nations supply of tap water.  What we do not pay much for 
directly, we do not value or protect. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public health crisis in North Battleford shows signs of 
easing, but questions about who to blame are getting louder.  In 
a city with a drinking water intake downstream from a sewage 
treatment plant outflow and dozens of residents sickened by 
waterborne parasites, there could be plenty of blame to go 
around.  Three deaths have been linked to the cryptosporidium 
outbreak in the city of 14,000.  The number of confirmed 
infections is expected to rise as lab results come in.  Reports 
from doctors and emergency room staff suggest that the outbreak 
is stabilizing, as health officials said on the weekend. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is clear that the provincial environment department, 
Saskatchewan Environment and Resource Management, has been 
worried about the city's water system since late summer last 
year, but it took no immediate action.  As well, the city said it 
complied with the provincial guidelines in its water operations. 
However, in September the city issued a drinking water advisory 
because of bacteria in one section of its distribution system. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The city has already acted on some of the recommendations, 
including some improvements to the water treatment facility, but 
some findings were a surprise.  One surprise was that the sewage 
treatment plant was operating over capacity.  The North 
Battleford sewage plant is two kilometres upstream from a 
drinking water plant built in the 1950s that draws water for part 
of the city from the North Saskatchewan River.  The plant was 
built by a nearby psychiatric hospital to provide for its own 
needs after the sewage plant was in place and was eventually sold 
to the city. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, if the plant is properly run and operated it should be 
able to deal with any effluent that may be discharged upstream. 
The city plans to build a new sewage treatment plant, but it will 
not be in place until 2003 without any financial assistance from 
the provincial and federal governments to speed up the schedule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Gerhard Benade, the medical health officer for the Battlefords 
Health District, faced questions on the weekend about his 
apparent delay in acting on a warning about a possible outbreak. 
A local physician, Geoffrey Lipsett, said that he called Dr. 
Benade at home on the evening of April 12, just ahead of the 
Easter long weekend, after one of his patients tested positive 
for the parasite and the patient's family began displaying 
similar symptoms. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Dr. Lipsett said that he began to think the problem was more 
widespread when he discovered that a local pharmacy kept running 
out of diarrhea medicine.  “It suddenly clicked” he said.  “I 
told him I think we might have a problem”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Regional health authorities did not launch a full investigation 
until April 17, the Tuesday after Easter, when they began 
checking local hospital records for evidence of other cases.  A 
boil water advisory was issued on April 25 and hardened to a boil 
water order on April 27.  “It was not possible over the Easter 
weekend to get all the emergency room statistics” said Dr. 
Benade. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said there are typically between two and five isolated cases 
of cryptosporidiosis each year. “We investigate every single 
case” he said.  “You can't issue an advisory based on a single 
case.  A single case of cryptosporidium is not a public health 
crisis”.  Dr. Lipsett agreed that his case did not necessarily 
indicate an outbreak “but that, plus the selling out of the 
diarrhea medicine, is what made it click in my head” he said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The motion calls for the public to be informed of results that 
fall below federal guidelines.  Fear that contaminated water is 
flowing from Canada's faucets has brought calls for national 
standards and the vote in the Commons should draw attention to 
this priority.  Right now there is no legal requirement to inform 
the public whether the water is safe or not, even if there is a 
test that actually says the contrary.  I do not think Canadians 
would think that is responsible leadership.

spring during an outbreak of cryptosporidium, a parasite from 
manure that invaded the city's water supply.  Last spring, a 
virulent strain of E. coli bacteria killed seven people and made 
thousands seriously ill in Walkerton, Ontario.  Water warnings 
have been issued in every province in the past year. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Federation of Canadian Municipalities is to call on Ottawa 
later this month to endorse national standards on drinking water 
that could see repeat polluters fined or even jailed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Freshwater is a scarce resource, even where it seems plentiful. 
The issue is as much about water quantity as quality.  We need to 
focus on managing our excessive demands for this scarce resource 
first before we run off to look for more supply.  We must 
consider water as a resource in its full cycle, not just when it 
is supplied to us from nature, fresh and free of charge.  Clean 
and usable water is not free and we will get what we pay for. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More infrastructure will mean more costly supply lines to extend 
our gluttonous demands even further.  Stricter standards to 
mandate cleaner water will set even more obstacles in the path of 
the recovery and reuse of wastewater.  Throwing more subsidies at 
the problem will further insulate consumers and corporations from 
the real costs of the present excessive demand. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need to look at the health of whole watersheds and what is 
regionally going into the water table for wells.  It is a 
lifestyle choice.  It is municipal land zoning use.  Pollution is 
deficit spending, wherein we all pay.  National standards would 
help reduce the shifting of costs and would create a level 
playing field that all must live up to with significant 
preventive investments.

Mr. Speaker, in the document entitled “Guidelines for Canadian

jailed.

is a harmful practice with consequences that extend to future 
generations.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

</I></B></P><P align=left>The House has heard the word leadership over the last couple of

I can tell the hon. member that in the most recent of the two 
infrastructure programs the government has invested in, we have 
committed $56 million to Saskatchewan alone, and that was just 
our share.  That was one-third of the total outlay to put in new 
water and sewage treatment plants, and new infrastructure in 
cities and towns. It comes to a total of over $150 million when 
all three governments' contributions are combined.  I believe 
that is a very significant contribution.  We are prepared to

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday the industry minister said in the House 
that a $32 million loan to Buhler Versatile Inc. was a simple 
transfer of an existing loan.  Wrong.  The truth is the new loan 
has a lot more zeros: zero interest rate owing, zero security, 
zero jobs, zero respect for the Canadian taxpayer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The political criteria for the loan was that it delayed layoffs 
in a Liberal riding until after the last federal election.  What 
other criteria if any must a company meet in order to receive a 
gift like this from Industry Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK153"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the former Conservative, former 
Reform and now Alliance member is wrong, wrong, wrong.  This 
loan, which had no guarantees attached to it, was given in 1987 
by the former Conservative government. The premier and industry 
minister of Manitoba wrote to this government asking them to 
support the transfer. 
<P><A NAME="LINK154"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, there is incredible ignorance on that side of the 
House on this issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since the member obviously does not know, nor do any of the 
other members it seems, I would like to inform them that BVI is a 
wholly owned subsidiary of Buhler Industries.  It was created 
solely for the purpose of assuming a $32 million loan.  BVI never 
owned the plant or the plant assets.  The plant assets cannot be 
taken back as payment if BVI cannot pay the loan.  At the time 
BVI received the unsecured loan, totally unsecured, it had total 
assets of $100.  I have to ask on behalf of the Canadian 
taxpayers and the members of the Canadian Alliance, why did—

one that will be determined over the next few months in terms of

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
there are three things.  First, this is the minister who shut

</I></B></P><P align=left>While many past employees of the Virginia Fontaine treatment

was a lack of trained staff and helpful programs in place to do 
anything about the problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The past employees with whom I spoke on the weekend compared it

across the country.  For example, some of them are now treating

discount airline market by the back door. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Discount carriers like WestJet and Canada 3000 could now face

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David Collenette (Minister of Transport, Lib.):</B>  Mr.

choice on all major city fares in Canada and prices have come 
down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with Roots Air is indeed distressing to all of us

bureau has said that he will treat this as a full merger and will 
look into it.

</I></B></P><P align=left>This morning the standing committee on transport heard testimony 
from the competition bureau that Air Canada did not currently 
face effective competition on a national basis and that the

cabotage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However let me say this.  The United States government, the 
United States carriers and the United States air unions are not 
interested in serving point to point within Canada.  There is 
some limited interest on the part of Virgin Atlantic to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Once we allow any of those foreign carriers in, we know what 
they will do.  They will run on the main trunk routes where the

rates than police or firefighters and are more likely to miss 
work due to illness or disability.

<H4 ALIGN=CENTER>ALLOTTED DAY—NATIONAL DRINKING WATER STANDARDS 
</H4><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK212">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion and of the 
amendment. 
<P><A NAME="LINK213"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark (Dauphin—Swan River, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise today to take part in the 
debate on water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me begin by commending the member for Fundy—Royal on his 
motion.  I believe it is long overdue.  Unfortunately, it takes a 
tragedy to bring attention to this most basic of human needs.  I 
find it almost unbelievable that after the tragic experience in 
Walkerton, we are now experiencing the same kind of problems in 
North Battleford.  What we see demonstrates that we require more 
leadership, certainly on the part of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to take us back to pre-Walkerton history.  As the 
former mayor of Dauphin, I had to live through the same kind of 
experience, so I will speak from my experience as a municipal 
leader who had to shepherd a community through an outbreak in 
giardia back in 1995. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the records in 1993,  Milwaukee, Wisconsin had a 
cryptosporidium outbreak which took many lives.  We called it 
legionnaires' disease.  Then on we go to Waterloo.  An hon. 
member across the floor mentioned this morning the problems that 
Waterloo had with cryptosporidium and giardia around the 
mid-1990s.  In Kelowna there was an outbreak in 1996 of 
cryptosporidium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not new.  We have known about the problem for at least a 
decade.  What has the government done about it?  Not an awful 
lot.  It has pointed the finger at the provinces because it is a 
provincial jurisdiction, but it needs to show more leadership. 
Canadians expect their health to be protected.  Consumption of 
potable water is part of that health and safety need. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our water systems and water treatment plants, for those 
communities that have them, go back to the 1950s vintage.  That 
was when most of them were built.  There are a lot of communities 
that do not have water treatment systems.  They rely on surface 
water or well water.  In fact inclusive in the topic of debate 
today, we really should be looking at the whole issue of sewage 
treatment because sewage facilities built back in the 1950s and 
the early 1960s are all falling apart today.  In other words, 
they will and have become a problem to the environment just as 
much as to potable water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1995 a boil water order was issued for Dauphin, which is 
where I come from.  At that time I was the mayor.  Obviously when 
people cannot drink the water what can they do?  Little does one 
realize that without water there is not a lot one can do. However 
when people have to boil the water to use it, it creates a lot of 
difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine a community being under threat of not having potable 
water for a period of almost two years.  That is why I believe 
there needs to be an emergency funding provision put in place by 
the federal government for communities, such as North Battleford, 
that need it. 
In essence, one of the key responsibilities for the federal 
government is to provide tax dollars to build these facilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT61"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Building water treatment facilities are not ordinary mundane 
activities at the municipal level.  It takes huge amounts of 
dollars.  In the case of Dauphin, Manitoba, we were very 
fortunate, through the PFRA and through the co-operation of a 
fellow by the name of Erminio Calagary, we managed to get the 
support of the federal government, the provincial government and 
the municipal government to put the dollars together and built a 
brand new water treatment plant.  It amounted to something like 
$9 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That $9 million to a community of about 10,000 people is a huge 
tax load.  It is easy for the federal government to say that it 
will throw some money here and there through its infrastructure 
program and hopefully then tripartite agreements will get some 
money to build water treatment plants or sewage plants. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was very deeply involved with the 1993 infrastructure program. 
That money was distributed on a per capita basis, which did not 
account to very much especially when we knew the cost of water 
treatment facilities.  The federal government has to ante up. 
After all that the money does belong to the people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I agree with the FCM, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, 
and its lobby to ensure that fresh or potable water is always 
available to all communities.  There are over 4,000 
municipalities.  The FCM resolution number 26, which was adopted 
in the year 2000, states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—reaffirm its commitment to the protection of public health in 
all aspects of the provision of water for human consumption, 
including the protection of drinking water or drinking water 
sources. 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Further to this statement, perhaps it is time the federal 
Liberal government recognize and acknowledge the legitimacy of 
the municipalities of this country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I still remember in 1996 listening to the Prime Minister in 
Calgary.  He stated that the municipalities played a huge role in 
this country, that they were very important, that they were the 
first level of government and that they were closest to the 
people.  I am still waiting for the Prime Minister of the day to 
recognize the legitimacy of the municipalities.  Until that 
happens, the municipalities will always be bantered about between 
the provinces and the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As we know, the provinces always say the municipalities are the 
children of the provinces and that the federal government has no 
business dealing with them.  It is long overdue, when it comes to 
health care and water issues, that the municipalities be at the 
table.  It is no different than if the topic of discussion was 
roads. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, water is essential and it impacts all of us.  It is 
time the federal government recognized that water should be 
treated the same way blood is treated.  When we get a transfusion 
most of us think the blood is safe.  Likewise, when we pick up a 
glass of water we should not question the safety of that glass of 
water.  As we know, that is not the case at this point in time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to talk about the lack of support for potable water 
development for aboriginal reservations.  In my riding I have 13 
reservations and I know that they are in dire need of 
infrastructure development.  In fact, when will the federal 
government move on this?  Hopefully it will not wait for someone 
to lose their life before it makes some concerted effort to deal 
with the deplorable conditions of drinking water on many of the 
reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have many Metis communities in my riding.  Health Canada has 
to put its foot down and be more assertive in making sure that 
funds go to water and sewage infrastructure development in those 
communities, rather than just handing the money over to the Metis 
provincial organizations and letting them give out the money. 
In many cases basic issues like water and sewage are left out 
altogether.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We need specific programs for water and sewage.  The government 
should avoid the word infrastructure.  In the last round of 
debate the definition of the term was wide open and 
infrastructure dollars were used in many areas.  A government 
that wants to lead and be accountable should set up water and 
sewage programs.  If we do not do it at this point it will be the 
tip of the iceberg in terms of the problems that confront 
Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK214"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
commend the hon. member on his remarks.  He is on a similar page 
with the Progressive Conservatives on the issue.  Last week at 
the immigration committee we were more often than not on the same 
page as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He touched on the need for the federal government to protect 
water quality on Indian reserves.  The hon. member for 
Toronto—Danforth said in the House today that we could make a 
model for Canadians based on how we handle water on reserves. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Yellow Quill Indian reserve in northeastern Saskatchewan 
close to Kelvington has had a boil water advisory since 1995.  As 
the reserve is under exclusive federal jurisdiction, I ask the 
hon. member if he believes the Government of Canada should clean 
up its own act and address the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for his 
question.  I lived in a community that had a boil water order for 
two years and could not imagine what it is like to have a boil 
water order for six years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a lack of commitment on the part of the government.  If 
the government sees a problem it must deal with it and not make 
excuses.  People on reserves need to be treated no differently 
than people off reserves.  Until the government takes its 
responsibilities seriously nothing will change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the whole country it is the same thing.  If the 
government understands the need for potable water and good sewage 
facilities across the nation it must change its current position 
and approach.  It needs to take action, not put money into fancy 
programs for political purposes.  If the government understands 
the importance of the issue it must do the work that is asked of 
it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That can only be demonstrated through action.  The government 
must make long term commitments.  It must have plans in place. It 
must sit and talk to people to find out what their needs are. The 
government has sole responsibility for Indian reserves and it has 
no excuse for not dealing with problems that affect them. 
<P><A NAME="LINK215"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ken Epp (Elk Island, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the member has been involved in municipal politics and 
we are talking today about municipal water supplies.  I have a 
difficult question for him about jurisdiction.  These issues 
should be dealt with primarily among municipalities and perhaps 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To what extent does the hon. member want the federal government 
involved in organizing municipal water infrastructure?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Inky Mark:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank the member for Elk 
Island for his question.  The issue with both water and sewage 
facilities is money.  Application of the act falls under 
provincial jurisdiction.  Most provinces have their own water 
acts.  However the cost of facilities is out of reach for 
municipalities which do not have the resources. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we deem water and sewage an essential health and safety issue 
we should treat it no differently than public health.  The 
responsibility therefore lies with the federal government. 
Municipalities do not have the tax base.  We cannot expect 
communities to boil their water for decades if they cannot come 
up with the money for infrastructure. 
<P><A NAME="LINK216"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock (Minister of Health, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I say at the outset that I intend to share my time with the hon. 
member for Mississauga West.  I welcome the opportunity to take 
part in the debate today and I thank the member for Fundy Royal 
for framing it by tabling his motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin by expressing, I know on behalf of all members of the 
House of Commons, our concern and sympathy for the residents of 
North Battleford who this week are dealing with an unexpected and 
what must seem an overwhelming burden.  Health Canada is working 
alongside municipal and provincial officials in North Battleford 
to provide what assistance we can to that beleaguered 
municipality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I intend to vote in favour of the motion as amended, but I will 
make some comments explaining why.  I will also respond to the 
suggestion which has underlain most of the discussion from the 
opposition benches that in some way the Government of Canada is 
not fulfilling its obligation to ensure clean drinking water. 
That is simply not true. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has fulfilled completely its obligation 
as a partner in the federation to work with those who have 
responsibility for delivering fresh, clean water.  We have taken 
a number of steps and are active in a variety of ways.  We are 
working with provincial and municipal governments in that effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will identify five of these steps in the few moments available 
to me.  First, we are contributing to the cost of maintaining 
appropriate water and sewage treatment facilities so that local 
municipalities, rural and urban, have facilities to treat water 
and make it suitable for human use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last year the federal budget identified $2 billion to be 
available over five years through the infrastructure program to 
help provinces and municipalities in this effort.  When that 
money is leveraged by matching funds from the other two levels of 
government it will total over $6 billion in the coming five 
years.  That money will be spent on infrastructure that will make 
the difference between water that is fit to drink and water that 
is not. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We heard today from the member for Saint Boniface that $2 
billion of that $6 billion will be spent in western Canada and 
that he has already received proposals for 600 projects that 
relate to water and sewage treatment in western Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, we have made a commitment, in working with provinces and 
municipal governments, to create the country's first building 
code for municipal water and waste water facilities.  The code 
will improve the ability of municipalities to meet high standards 
for water quality and ensure that Canadians from coast to coast 
have access to comparable facilities for producing potable water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, we committed in the Speech from the Throne to making 
clean water one of our top three environmental priorities along 
with clean air and conservation.  We also recognize that as 
trustee of one of the world's largest supplies of freshwater 
Canada has a particular responsibility to preserve that legacy 
for future generations, and we shall.

<A HREF="#LINKT64"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, in the Speech from the Throne we committed to developing 
stronger national guidelines for water quality by enhancing 
scientific research and continuing to work with provincial 
partners.  As part of that we promised to strengthen the role of 
the National Water Research Institute whose world class work 
provides the basis for our action in sustaining freshwater 
ecosystems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, we committed to investing in advanced information systems 
to make better use of our land and protect surface water and 
groundwater from the impact of industrial and agricultural 
activity.  Such systems would help monitor what happens on the 
ground and measure the impact of agricultural and industrial 
activity on the underlying water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those five measures the government has demonstrated that it 
is doing its part to help provide safe, clean water for 
Canadians, a responsibility all governments in the federation 
must share. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been talk opposite about the need for a national 
standard.  Since 1983 the Government of Canada has met twice a 
year with provincial officials, scientists, chemists and 
environmentalists.  Together they have developed a consensus on 
the level of purity for Canadian drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That consensus is reflected in national guidelines that are 
reviewed twice a year.  The guidelines are provided to the people 
on the ground who inspect water and provide, furnish, maintain 
and operate the equipment which purifies it.  The guidelines 
apply to all public and private water sources across the country. 
While the approaches taken by provinces might vary, the 
guidelines reflect a Canada-wide consensus on water quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is unfair and wrong to suggest we do not have national 
standards.  The guidelines reflect those standards.  The process 
by which the guidelines are developed reflects how the country is 
organized and who is responsible for what.  We share part of the 
responsibility.  We do not deny that.  We accept it and meet it 
by working with partners every year, year in and year out, to 
make sure the guidelines are appropriate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Government of Canada has clear responsibility for drinking 
water on first nations lands.  Since 1995 my colleague, the 
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, has invested 
over $400 million in first nations communities throughout Canada 
to make sure facilities are in place to provide fresh water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>More generally, Health Canada maintains national surveillance 
for infectious diseases including those linked to contaminated 
water.  In Walkerton, Health Canada scientists led the 
epidemiological investigation which identified the extent of the 
outbreak and the sequence of events leading up to it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last July, Health Canada consolidated the various components of 
our emergency response capacity into a single entity, the Centre 
for Emergency Preparedness and Response.  Through the centre 
Health Canada is positioned to respond more quickly and 
effectively in an emergency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I mention these responsibilities because I want my colleagues in 
the House to know that we are actively doing our share, not just 
today or this week but continuously. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members should be careful before they say the issue of safe 
drinking water can be resolved by the adoption in parliament of a 
federal statute or by the imposition of a federal law even if it 
contains penalties.  The hard reality is that life is not that 
simple.  The hard reality is that all of us must work together 
and do our share if we are to produce the results we want.

Government of Canada pass a law to improve primary or grade 
school education and take over that field of endeavour.  The 
solution, as in any successful federation, is for governments to 
work well together in good faith.  That is what motivates Health 
Canada and the Government of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must continue that work.  I welcome the motion which I will 
vote in favour of.  I undertake to the member for Fundy—Royal 
and to the House to raise the issue with my provincial 
counterparts the next time we meet in order to determine their 
willingness to work toward establishing a safe water act.  If 
they believe it would be helpful we shall be there to do our 
part. 
<P><A NAME="LINK217"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Judy Wasylycia-Leis (Winnipeg North Centre, NDP):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I appreciate the indication of the Minister of Health 
that members on the government side will be supporting the 
motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However I want to express concern about the minister's tentative 
and very modest support for the idea of national guidelines, 
standards, and legislation on the matter of clean and safe 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister talks about hard reality in terms of ensuring an 
adequate supply of safe drinking water.  I want to say to him 
that the hard reality today is that people are dying from the 
failure of our water supply and the quality of our water in the 
country today.  People are worried about contamination, sickness 
and problems associated with inadequate standards and 
legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the minister concede that in a time of crisis when the 
public good and the public need are clearly at stake, it is 
necessary to have legislation, guidelines and standards that are 
enforceable and must be lived up to in order to ensure that the 
public good— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  The hon. Minister of 
Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member speaks of a 
national strategy.  There is one.  That strategy is found in the 
very elements I described today, namely working together with 
provincial and territorial governments, helping to finance from 
all levels of government the construction of appropriate 
facilities, and a continuous review of the guidelines.  The 
member speaks about national standards.  I suggest that those 
guidelines are national standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member goes a step further and says to legislate them, have 
them in a federal statute.  I assume she would say that if the 
statute is not complied with, the offender would face a criminal 
sanction.  I assume she is referring to the criminal law power. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member has failed to demonstrate whether the provinces are 
supportive of that approach or whether it would help.  She makes 
a leap of logic by asserting in the House that which she does not 
know, namely that the problems in Battleford arose because we did 
not have federal legislation.  A commission of inquiry has just 
been announced.  It will look into the question of causality.  I 
would be very much surprised if the problem were caused because 
of the lack of federal legislation.  I suggest that we shall find 
it was something far more local and practical than that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is one thing to have federal legislation and another thing to 
follow through, to have the facilities in place, operate them, 
and maintain them to ensure that we produce the result we want. 
Everyone in the system has to do their part for it to work well. 
<P><A NAME="LINK218"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I wish 
to applaud the Minister of Health for his support of the motion. 
The tenor of the debate was to try to have language that could be 
accepted by all members of the House regardless of partisan line. 
I understand the government's concern with respect to 
federal-provincial jurisdiction.  That was how we shaped the 
question in our election platform last November. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal Party of Canada has always been a little 
trepidatious around this issue since the national energy program, 
which we all remember.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that the wording says “to begin the process of developing 
national standards on drinking water immediately”, what is the 
first step the Minister of Health plans to initiate? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Allan Rock:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I have taken the first 
step.  I spoke with the health ministers from Alberta and Nova 
Scotia this morning.  I will continue those discussions and 
explore the possibility of the approach the member described. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to make something clear.  I happen to be, by my 
political philosophy, very much in favour of the Government of 
Canada being an active government and fully asserting its 
constitutional authority in this federation.  The country will 
not hold together or succeed unless it has a strong Government of 
Canada that does its full part. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am not sure, in this particular field, that equates 
with federal legislation mandating standards with penal 
consequences if they are not obeyed.  I do not know of a province 
in the country that does not accept and tries to put in place the 
guidelines that we have all agreed upon.  I do not know of a 
municipality in the country that does not do its best.  The 
answer is not as simple as that, and that is my point today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of 
order.  During question period, in response to a question I 
asked, a member opposite revealed a desire to understand more 
about the nature of a loan agreement between Industry Canada and 
a company in my province.  I have obtained some documents and, 
with the consent of the House, would like to table them for the 
member and other members of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B>  Does the hon. member 
have unanimous consent to table the documents? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B> No. 
<P><A NAME="LINK219"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney (Mississauga West, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
we are having an interesting debate this afternoon.  In addition 
to the minister, I suspect there will be substantial support on 
this side of the House for the motion.  I certainly intend to 
support the principle of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, some things need to be put on the record as a result of 
this kind of reaction where perhaps the NDP will use 
fearmongering by asking if we are going to wait until more people 
die.  We also have a reversal by the official opposition, an 
opposition that was opposed to government interference and 
involvement in provincial jurisdictions and which is now changing 
its mind as a result of its constituency undergoing some pressure 
in the area of clean water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are seeing some rather substantial flip-flops in positions in 
party policy.  Given the difficulty that the opposition is going 
through on that side of the House, I am surprised it can even 
spell the word policy these days. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What we are seeing here is a move that I would call 
constitutional reform by attrition.  I will explain what I mean 
by that.  Provincial governments across the land, most notably in 
Ontario, have been bailing out of areas that have for a long time 
been considered to be areas of provincial jurisdiction and 
responsibility.  I will cite the example of Ontario.  Premier 
Harris has succeeded in turning the entire relationship between 
governments upside down. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I served for almost 10 years as a municipal councillor.  In 
those days, 1978 to 1987 and a bit, municipalities always went 
after the provinces to support them in certain areas, such as the 
provision of funds and transfer payments, because the 
municipalities were creatures of the province. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What the government of Ontario has done now is it has passed a 
law entitled the fewer municipal politicians act.  All of a 
sudden it has managed to make municipal politicians look like the 
bad guys. Through amalgamations it has reduced the number of 
municipalities in Ontario from approximately 850 to 450.  On the 
surface that seems like a good thing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we were to talk to people on the street I think they would 
say that if the overhead of carrying government bureaucracy was 
reduced and consolidated, that would be a good thing.  In the 
city of Toronto, for example, if we were to amalgamate six fire 
departments into one I think the people would say that also 
sounds good. 
However the results can be summed up in the words cause and 
effect.  For every action there is a reaction.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Provinces have been saying that they are not in the business of 
providing social housing.  It should fall to the municipalities 
and they downloaded it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All we have to do to experience firsthand the impact on 
infrastructure is to drive along Highway 401 in the greater 
Toronto area.  People would think they would lose their vehicles 
at any moment.  The roads are deteriorating on a daily basis. 
Why?  It is because the provincial government has decided to get 
out of that area.  It has passed the entire cost of the public GO 
Transit in the southwestern sector of Ontario on to the municipal 
sector.  How does that relate here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not hear my friends from the Tory Party, who moved the 
motion, talking about the provincial Conservative government. 
Many people think they are more a reform style government.  Did a 
cause and effect occur when the provincial Conservative 
government slashed the environment ministry, when staff was 
dramatically reduced in Ontario, when municipalities were told 
that it was now their responsibility to send their water out to 
private laboratories, in many cases 100 kilometres or 200 
kilometres away, and wait for some technician in the facility to 
test the water and get back to them on whether or not there was 
an E. coli problem or any other kind of problem? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Somehow the Ontario provincial government seems to have washed 
its hands of responsibility.  Walkerton happened in my personal 
opinion as a direct result of the provincial Conservative 
government deciding that less government was better, that a 
smaller ministry of the environment would be more efficient, that 
fewer staff to inspect would be beneficial.  It could then send 
out $200 tax rebate cheques to everybody in the province saying 
“Look at me, am I not wonderful?” 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is cause and effect.  There is no question there was some 
personal culpability in the reports that came out, but one was 
dealing with people who were not trained properly on the job. Why 
were they not trained?  It was because it was left up to a small 
rural municipality that did not have the sophistication or 
technology to deal with it and as a result people died.  Now we 
see it spreading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I personally believe it is a problem.  One of the reasons I 
support the hon. member's motion is that it could be the tip of 
the iceberg.  I agree that the federal government has to get 
involved.  It must put in standards and ensure that provincial 
governments are not simply passing on tax cuts in the name of 
some form of fiscal responsibility while they put the safety of 
their residents in jeopardy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an example of utmost irresponsibility.  Members know 
full well that the ministry of the environment at the provincial 
level works with local municipalities to provide safe water.  It 
has not been a responsibility of the federal government because 
we have had trust and faith under the terms of the constitution. 
Under the terms of our relationship we would never question 
something as basic and simple as clean water being put at 
jeopardy because of a political right wing agenda that simply 
wanted to find ways to get re-elected.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In reality that is a trend that has occurred.  It may be 
somewhat different in North Battleford, but the result is a sense 
that someone else will take care of it, a malaise, a sense of 
complacency.  It is most unfortunate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have heard members opposite say that the government should 
stop doing this or the government should stop doing that.  As a 
result of cause and effect people are now saying that there is 
actually a role for government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the number one responsibility of any government?  I 
submit it is to provide good health, safety and quality of life. 
Everything else falls from that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The jurisdictional battles will occur.  The provinces want to do 
this and that.  Who should regulate this or who should regulate 
that?  The bottom line is that if collectively as governments we 
are unable to provide something as basic and fundamental as safe, 
clean water and safe sewage disposal in Canada in 2001, then 
shame on all of us at every level of government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must do it.  Our government is committed to it.  If it means 
entering into new agreements, whether it is through the 
infrastructure programs we have talked about or a new kind of 
national standard, that is what we will do.  The government 
believes it is our responsibility to provide health, safety and a 
good quality of life for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK220"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the hon. member for the intention to support the Progressive 
Conservative motion.  From the human health perspective it is 
time we had national drinking water standards so that we know the 
quality of the water we consume is of the same quality, whether 
in Saint-Jean, Quebec, St. John's, Newfoundland, or Fort St. 
John, British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A key word in the motion is the word immediately.  Canadians 
demand action and leadership from the government.  It is quicker 
for us to actually provide legislation for a poet laureate than 
to provide standards for drinking water.  How fast does the 
health minister have to move to his satisfaction to address this 
very critical issue? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I do not want to play 
games, but I am looking for the word immediately.  Maybe the 
member has a different copy of the motion than I have. 
Regardless, the point is what the motion calls for is that we 
should act with the provinces and territories to establish— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron:</B>  Immediately is in there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  It does not say immediately.  It 
states: 
<UL><UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>—to establish enforceable national drinking water standards— 
</UL></UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I see members of the Tory caucus and members of the 
Canadian Alliance caucus parading around on the nightly news in a 
joint fundraiser, trying to somehow come together to resolve 
their problems, what concerns me is the party that put this 
motion before the House is being sucked into the vortex of the 
extreme right wing of the Canadian Alliance.  The Canadian 
Alliance was opposed to it.  It was opposed to a committee.  I 
suspect it will continue to be opposed to it in some form of 
trickery that it may use. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think it should occur but it must occur with quality 
negotiations with our territories and our provinces.  This member 
knows it.  Any time the government tried to be heavy handed in 
dealing with the provinces, there were screams and howls of 
outrage from the opposition benches. 
<P><A NAME="LINK221"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am interested to know from the member why two 
government bills going back to 1993 were allowed to die on the 
order paper.  Specifically I mention Bill C-76 first read on 
December 11, 1996, and Bill C-14 first read on October 30, 1997.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Why were those bills allowed to die, given the fact that the 
government does and did have a majority? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Steve Mahoney:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I guess we could all ask 
each other questions like that.  Why did members opposite not put 
a similar motion when Walkerton occurred?  Were the deaths in 
Ontario somehow not of as great concern to members opposite? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Certainly there has been a responsibility with the provincial 
and the municipal governments to resolve these problems.  We have 
had charges of interference.  We have been told to stay out of 
the jurisdictions that belong to the provincial governments by 
members opposite, although not necessarily the NDP.  The NDP 
would have us go after everything we could.  We would have 
national standards for everything we could possibly conceive and 
probably eliminate provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other side of the extreme is these people say that the 
government should cut back, should slash, should burn, should 
reduce, should do nothing to provide good quality health, safety 
and quality of life for Canadians.  We will not allow that to 
happen.  We will make sure we provide those items.

<P><A NAME="LINK222"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau (Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, BQ):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, after such a passionate flight of oratory, which seems 
right out of left field, I hope we will be able to come back to a 
much calmer, serene and enlightening debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We, in the Bloc Quebecois, recognize at the outset that water 
quality in our communities is a very important issue. Recent 
events in Saskatchewan and also the problems we saw in Ontario a 
few months ago make the elected representatives of the people of 
Canada aware of the importance of providing their fellow citizens 
with a safe and clean water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I do not like the way the Conservatives are trying to 
politicize this issue, and I will explain why. Only yesterday, 
the Conservatives were asking members on this side of the House, 
mainly members of the Alliance and the Bloc Quebecois, to join 
them in proposing a new form of decentralized federalism that 
would respect the jurisdictions of the provinces and the 
specificity of some of them. Today, on the day after their plea, 
they bring forward in this House a motion calling explicitly for 
Canada-wide national standards in areas of exclusive provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me give my Conservative friends a warning “You cannot have 
your cake and eat it too. You cannot claim to be promoting a 
decentralized Canada and then want to implement Canada-wide 
standards in areas that do not come under federal jurisdiction”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebecers will not be fooled. One cannot serve them this kind of 
double talk without having to live with the consequences at some 
point down the road. That was my introduction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have some problems with the motion in its current form. 
First, there is the fact that water is a provincial jurisdiction. 
The first problem is a matter of principle: water is not the 
responsibility of the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Moreover, our position is influenced by certain elements that 
have to do with current circumstances. For example, in the 
inaugural speech, the premier of Quebec, Bernard Landry, 
announced the imminent implementation of a national, meaning 
Quebec-wide, water management policy. It is a very laudable 
initiative, particularly since we know that Quebec is already 
known as the best province, in terms of the quality of its 
drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 19, 2000, the government of Quebec announced new draft 
regulations on the quality of drinking water. The draft 
regulations are being finalized and have been submitted to the 
Quebec cabinet. The final version should be released soon. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1555"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT71"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT71"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1555

<A HREF="#LINKT70"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, these new regulations would change quality standards 
according to Canadian recommendations as well as drinking water 
quality standards currently in place in the United States, which 
would result in proposed standards that would go beyond the 
Canadian recommendations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, they would increase substantially the number of systems 
subject to mandatory controls. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, they would establish the minimum frequency for bacterial 
analysis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, they would provide for a periodic review of the 
standards. 
Last, they would require operator qualification, which would be 
renewable every five years and which would take experience into 
account. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With these new standards, and we are not the only ones saying 
this, even the Sierra legal defence fund rated Quebec first among 
the provinces, in terms of having the strictest drinking water 
standards in Canada. So, we have no need for more standards, at 
least in Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However there is a problem. Liberals have come up with an amendment 
to the motion that says “respecting their jurisdictions” or 
something like that. The government cannot have it both ways. 
It cannot have, on the one hand, national standards enshrined 
in legislation and, on the other hand, respect for provincial 
areas of jurisdiction, because it is, in fact, an area of 
provincial jurisdiction. It is a bit like appreciating open doors 
as long as they are closed. It is nonsense. Because of the 
Liberal amendment, there is a deep, inherent contradiction in 
this motion, which no longer makes any sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is also interesting to see the federal government getting 
involved in this area, since the cuts it made in transfer 
payments to the provinces, among other things, have caused 
several problems. The provinces are stretched to the limit; they 
have just enough money to keep their heads above water, but then 
the municipalities have had to take the brunt of it. Although they 
were getting a lot of money from Quebec, they were hard hit by 
the federal cuts. The federal government has some gall to 
interfere when it is partly responsible for some of the problems 
a number of communities are having. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to ask ourselves how a federal system would help 
improve things? For most people, the federal government is far 
away. 
The federal government's habit of interfering in matters that are 
far removed from it reduces it's efficiency, because those who 
are accountable for such things are much more remote in the 
federal government than they would be at the community or 
provincial level. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is also the fact that, because things are not going too 
well in certain provinces, they use that to justify duplicating 
something that works well in other provinces. We are still 
talking about duplication and, as far as I am concerned, that is 
also a problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will move an amendment to the amendment that the House would 
support I believe. The Bloc Quebecois could vote in favour of the 
motion thus amended. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I move : 
<A NAME="LINK223">&nbsp;</A>
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That the amendment be amended by 
adding between the words “jurisdiction” and “to ensure” the 
following: “, while allowing for full opting-out by any province,” 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If this amendment to the amendment were agreed to, the Bloc 
Quebecois would support the motion. We could be unanimous in the 
House in saying that provinces willing to abide by Canada-wide 
standards could do so. Also, those who would not want to, who 
want to protect their turf, their jurisdiction, would be free to 
do it.

a few comments that I would like make. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a lot of respect for the hon. member and in the approach 
he has taken in the House.  He also knows that the tradition of 
the Progressive Conservative Party is to be very respectful of 
jurisdictional concerns between the federal government and the 
provinces.  We would support an opting out provision, if a 
province had a piece of legislation that was equal or higher. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to speak to the history of this issue.  In 1990 the 
then minister of the environment had concerns about three 
legislative gaps that were not in existence in Canada.  They were 
our capacity to protect species at risk, the need to renew our 
pesticide legislation and the need to have a safe drinking water 
act.  The then minister was the hon. Lucien Bouchard.  Mr. 
Bouchard was right then, and that piece of legislation is right 
now in this regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is a shared jurisdiction.  However does the member 
understand that the jurisdictional component, as it applies to 
the federal government, is the Department of Health when we 
legislate toxicity with pesticides, chemicals or exposure 
therein?

from the Conservative Party, for his question. He is someone 
with whom I get along well and agree to disagree. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to his preamble, I will say this. He stated that 
throughout history the Conservatives have always been very 
respectful of jurisdictional boundaries. First, it is my opinion 
that the motion says the reverse. Second, during the first 
election campaign I ran in, in 1997, the Conservative platform 
under the leadership of Jean Charest explicitly mentioned 
national standards for education, which is very clearly an area 
of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Furthermore, with all due respect, I must disagree with the 
member when he says that this is a shared jurisdiction. Water as 
such is local in nature. 
Under section 92 of the Constitution, I want to pull out, but in 
the meantime we might as well abide by it, everything listed 
there is a provincial responsibility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member's premise is completely wrong. This is an area of 
exclusive provincial jurisdiction. Again I question the need for 
the federal government to stick its nose into this.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bernard Bigras (Rosemont—Petite-Patrie, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
congratulate my colleague for his speech on this important 
issue. I remind the House that not only does the Quebec 
government believe it would be wrong to set national standards 
on drinking water, but also this is what was reported yesterday 
regarding Sylvain Laramée of the Réseau environnement du Québec, 
and I quote: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Earlier in the day, the head of the Réseau environnement, 
Sylvain Laramée, said publicly that he wished that Ottawa would 
not intervene for reasons that were not partisan, but technical, 
adding that Quebec and the provinces in general were better 
equipped to deal with drinking water problems in co-operation 
with the municipal governments, taking into account the 
geographical context. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe we are on the verge of reaching a consensus in Quebec 
on this issue. Is it not true that what our Conservative 
colleague is saying shows how little is known about the way 
things are in Quebec in this particular area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Richard Marceau:</B> Mr. Speaker, I agree with the member for 
Rosemont—Petite-Patrie that the Conservative member's motion 
shows a misunderstanding of Quebec's specificity, but that is not 
all. It also shows a lack of common sense. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We must ensure that those responsible for something are as close 
as possible to the people they serve. The closer, the better. In 
Europe, this principle is called subsidiarity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here, we should ensure that those responsible for a program are 
as close as possible to the people so that, if people have 
something to say, they have access to that person and are able to 
hold him or her accountable. 
<P><A NAME="LINK226"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier (Manicouagan, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, if I 
rise in the House today, it is first and foremost to support the 
amendment to the amendment moved by my colleague from 
Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier, whom I want to congratulate and 
thank for his excellent work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment to the amendment moved by my colleague totally 
changes the motion of our Conservative colleagues. I truly 
believe that, once again, the federal government is trying to 
gain public support in an area that is not its responsibility. 
However that is nothing new from the federal government since it does 
that in several areas, such as parental leave and education, to 
name just two. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is there, under the Canadian constitution, an area that is more 
clearly under provincial jurisdiction than education? Yet, the 
federal government insists on interfering in that area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I hear this government say that it wants to establish 
national standards, I find it absolutely scandalous. I have here 
a Transport Canada document, an inventory of contaminated sites. 
It says that a single department has contaminated 41 sites in 
Quebec. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So if we take one department of the Government of Canada and 
we multiply that by 10 provinces, it means that about 400 sites 
would have been contaminated by that department throughout the 
country, unless it only contaminated sites in Quebec because it 
likes us so much. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my riding alone, there are about five sites that are totally 
contaminated and for three years now the Bloc Quebecois and the 
member for Manicouagan have been urging the federal government to 
assume its responsibilities, that is to apply the polluter pays 
rule. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How can we trust a government that continues to pollute, that 
does not assume its responsibilities and that is trying to preach 
to the provinces by saying: “We will set national standards”? 
Before lecturing anyone, I think the federal government should 
assume its responsibilities.

<A HREF="#LINKT73"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why the amendment to the amendment put forward by my 
colleague from the Bloc Quebecois is very important. I am 
confident that all the members in this House will support this 
amendment to the amendment, which will make it possible for us to 
vote in favour of the motion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that the motion before the House is a legitimate one 
because what could be more legitimate than to want to provide the 
public with drinking water. As usual, the government has decided 
to infringe upon areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. The 
federal government is trying to demonstrate to Canadians that the 
provinces cannot handle it without its help, when we know that it 
was the federal government that created this problem in the first 
place by cutting, as it did, transfer payments to provinces and 
funding that would have helped provinces to provide these 
services to the public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now the federal government is getting ready to spend money in 
provincial areas of jurisdiction because, as we say in Quebec, it 
has the cash to do it. It cut the funding to the provinces in 
order to better control them afterwards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Well, Quebec has news for the federal government. Water 
management is an area of provincial jurisdiction and the Bloc 
Quebecois is opposed to any federal involvement in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some may say that the Bloc sounds like a broken record, but this 
is the root cause of the problem we have in this country. The 
federal government is always trying to interfere in provincial 
jurisdictions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the issue at hand is concerned, it is clear, since we 
are talking about water, we could say as clear as spring 
water, that water quality and availability come under provincial 
jurisdiction. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why would the federal government want to get involved? The 
problems in provinces like Ontario and Saskatchewan do not 
justify duplicating a system that is working just fine. We have 
seen the standards established by Quebec and Ontario, and, as my 
colleague indicated this afternoon, Quebec ranked first. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quebec emphasizes prevention more. The standards on byproducts 
of water disinfection are stricter in Quebec than in any 
other province. Parasite removal requirements are also more 
stringent. With the standards in the new draft regulations about 
to be passed by the Quebec government, its water quality 
standards will be the highest in any province. Why would the 
federal government want to interfere in a situation that is so 
clear? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois objects categorically to federal involvement 
and maintains that the only thing the federal government should 
do in that area is to correct the problems of its own making, 
when it has contaminated the water table and thus deprived people 
of safe drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This, as members will have guessed, is part of the numerous 
representations I have made, with the support of the Bloc 
Quebecois, to have the government solve the problem of the 
beaches area in Sept-Îles. Time and again, we have heard the 
government say “We did everything that had to be done to correct 
the situation”. Today, we are once again asking for a real 
solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On June 19, 2000, the Quebec department of the environment 
announced new draft regulations on the quality of drinking water. 
These regulations are being reviewed by the provincial cabinet 
and, as I mentioned earlier, are about to be adopted. Instead of 
trying to copy what was done in Quebec, the federal government 
must do all it can to correct the situations for which it is 
responsible. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since Quebec ranks first, emphasizes prevention more and has 
stricter standards for water disinfection byproducts, as I said, 
the Bloc Quebecois supports the initiatives of the Quebec 
government and objects to the federal government interfering in 
this area in such an unacceptable fashion.

<A HREF="#LINKT74"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>It has to correct the situations it itself caused.  I mentioned 
these at the beginning of my speech.  They include the pollution 
of the beaches at Sept-Îles and even at Havre-Saint-Pierre, in my 
riding, where the airport site was affected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the federal government wants to look after drinking water the 
way it is looking after decontaminating the beaches water, that 
will be just great.  We have been asking the federal government 
to decontaminate the beaches for three years.  There are other 
sites we are demanding they decontaminate as well.  Now it tell 
us it is going to adopt national standards.  Just because 
certain provinces have problems does not mean that the federal 
government has to charge in where it has no business. Once again, 
it is interfering and duplicating provincial responsibilities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since my time is running out, I hope that, once again, members 
of the House will support the amendment to the amendment of the 
member for Charlesbourg—Jacques-Cartier and that we will all 
finally be able to vote in favour of a motion which will improve 
the public's drinking water. 
<P><A NAME="LINK227"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Yvon Charbonneau (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Health, Lib.):</B> Mr. Speaker, we heard the member for Manicouagan 
say that he supports the amendment to the amendment proposed by 
his party because it totally changes the motion before us. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is a problem there because, in principle, an amendment to 
an amendment should only change the amendment and not the entire 
motion. However let us not dwell on that. He said it changed 
everything. Well, I think he said something that calls for 
comment at this time. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The basic proposal before us, not everybody has been following 
the debate since this morning, is that the federal government 
should join with the provinces in establishing national 
standards. We brought forward an amendment, which was agreed upon 
with the Progressive Conservative Party, to ensure that 
provincial jurisdictions are respected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So far, so good. All the parties who spoke seemed to support the 
idea of working together to establish national standards if 
provincial jurisdictions were to be respected. Then an amendment 
on the amendment was put forward, saying that any province that so 
desired could opt out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A province that so desires, that could be a province that has 
not met the standards or it could be one that has met or exceeded 
federal standards could opt out. This means that members of the Bloc Quebecois 
are simply saying no to national standards because they want to 
allow any province that so desires to not to endorse such 
standards. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the member for Manicouagan is this: Does he 
realize that the wording of his amendment to an amendment leaves 
the door wide open for a province that would not have met the 
federal standards to opt out? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Mr. Speaker, when I said that this 
changes everything, I just wanted to say that this unequivocally 
clarifies the amendment put forward by my hon. colleague for 
Anjou—Rivière-de-Prairies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Liberal government and the members opposite, who claim to be 
people concerned with clarity in issues related to acts and 
regulations, find some clarity in the amendment to the amendment 
put forward by the Bloc Quebecois. It is clear that we know where 
we are going. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for the question asked by my hon. colleague, the answer is 
no. I think we have to trust provincial governments. As for the 
Quebec government, I fully trust it. Besides, if my hon. 
colleague has read the regulations on the environment and 
drinking water that will soon be adopted in Quebec, he will see 
that the federal government has nothing to teach the Quebec 
government in this regard.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we all remember the consultations held by the Bureau des 
audiences publiques sur l'environnement or BAPE. Paul Begin had 
then invited all Quebecers to put in their two cents worth on 
water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to quote a comment made during the hearings: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to the quality of the water in Quebec, it is “generally 
good”; it is in the southwest, in the farmlands of the St. 
Lawrence Lowlands that the quality is at its lowest level. The 
St. Lawrence River, which supplies water 45% of the Quebec 
population, is still suffering contaminated, particularly 
downstream from Montreal. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>As to water quality, which is an important issue, and I am still 
quoting: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>From 1989 to 1995, more than 800 people were affected by 24 
epidemics related to the drinking of surface water. These figures 
could represent a mere fraction of the actual numbers, because 
several cases were never reported. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the Lower St. Lawrence and water quality, can the 
member, who comes from a remote area, tell the House if it is 
possible that nobody has been affected by water problems in 
Quebec in the last few years? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ghislain Fournier:</B> Mr. Speaker, first, my colleague 
referred to the BAPE. I would tell him that indeed the BAPE 
recommended that Quebec develop its own policy on drinking water 
and environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would also remind him that in my riding, there is no 
contamination attributable to Quebec, to the government of 
Quebec. None whatsoever. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is contamination in Sept-Îles and in my area, for example 
in the beaches area, where 1,000 people are without water, but 
this contamination is due to the government that my colleague is 
a member of. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Serge Cardin:</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In 
the heat of political debate in the House, especially during 
oral question period, we sometimes get carried away. I have to 
admit that it happened to me today, when the member for Chambly 
was putting a question to the public works minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I hummed a song that was inappropriate in the House of Commons. 
I would like to apologize to anyone I might have hurt, 
especially to the public works minister. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> Your message is clear and 
your apology is accepted. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK229"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden (Ancaster—Dundas—Flamborough—Aldershot, 
Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I will be sharing my time with the member 
for Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This particular debate is an excellent occasion that illustrates 
the kind of conflict and ideology that political parties get into 
from time to time, because what we have, Mr. Speaker, is a motion 
calling on the government to act essentially in an area of 
provincial jurisdiction.  I think we would all agree in this 
House, on all sides of the House, that the right to clean water 
is something that should be shared by all Canadians.  All 
Canadians should be entitled to obtain clean water, to use clean 
water anywhere in the land.  It is fundamental in the same sense 
that every Canadian should expect the same standard of justice, 
the same standard of safety and the same standard of health care. 
The government over the years has provided in those areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in fact, when it comes to the safety of water, this has been 
something that has been mostly under provincial jurisdiction.  We 
are now faced with the problem where we have had several tragic 
incidents where the water supply in communities has been 
dangerously polluted and it has led to some deaths.  Quite 
rightly, in my view, we have a motion before us calling on the 
government to be in the forefront of establishing enforceable 
standards of water quality. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1625"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT76"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Here is the rub.  Three of the opposition parties who have been 
stressing the need for enforceable national standards for water 
quality today, those three parties, when you press them, are not 
willing to have those standards imposed upon the provinces 
because those three parties, part of their ideological structure 
is that they believe that fundamental political life should begin 
with the lowest common denominator, normally the provinces, 
certainly in the case of the Bloc Quebecois, but also in the case 
of the Canadian Alliance and the Conservatives with the 
municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Ontario, and I cannot speak for all of the nation on this 
issue, but in Ontario I can remember when the average citizen 
could test his water for free.  Mr. Speaker, you would take it 
from a tap, take it to your local medical officer of health who 
would have given you a proper container, and that water would be 
tested.  Indeed for many, many years in Ontario the province was 
responsible for ensuring that municipalities had their water 
tested properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But in 1996 the current Conservative government in Ontario 
basically downloaded the obligation of water quality on the 
municipalities, on the one hand, who had to look after 
maintaining such standards as there were, and the province 
basically privatized the testing of water and took away the free 
program of water testing through municipalities that up until 
1996 led to I think 400,000 tests per annum in Ontario of water 
quality.  All that disappeared. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with this motion and particularly with the amendment 
to the motion, particularly the amendment that is indeed 
supported by our side, is if you cop on national standards to 
protect citizens, then you have to have a way of guaranteeing 
that those national standards are acted upon. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In response to a question I posed earlier in this debate, the 
leader of the Conservative opposition said well, yes, we can have 
enforceable standards, but he believes that we can come to 
agreements with the provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mr. Speaker, I ask you, what if you cannot come to an agreement 
with a province?  What if a province decides it does not want to 
spend the money on water quality?  What if you have a case, as 
you have in Ontario, when the province downloads the 
responsibility of water quality to the municipality? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We talked for a little bit about infrastructure.  This is not 
just a question of drinking water.  This is a question of the 
proper treatment of sewage and that kind of thing.  What we have 
in my own municipality, we have a situation where the province 
downloaded the responsibility for sewage treatment and that kind 
of thing to the municipality and it has privatized it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Hamilton a private corporation runs the sewage treatment 
plant and there is a lot of anecdotal evidence indicating that 
that sewage treatment plant is in a lot of trouble.  The problem 
is because the province downloaded to the municipality who 
privatized it.  No one knows whether that sewage treatment plant 
is functioning properly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I submit that all across Ontario and indeed all across the 
country that no one knows for sure that the water treatment 
plants in communities like North Battleford or communities like 
Collingwood or other communities across the country, that they 
indeed are looking after their water quality to a standard that 
guarantees the safety of the people using it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other thing that is overlooked in this debate is we have 
talked only about municipal water supplies.  I do not think I 
have heard a single person mention the tens of thousands of 
Canadians who get their water from wells.  Again, Mr. Speaker, in 
Ontario it used to be possible to test water in your well.  As a 
farmer or a cottage person, you could take it to the local 
officer of health and you could have that water tested.  That no 
longer exists. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Now that we have the industrial farm where there is an increased 
risk of truly deadly bacteria getting into the water table, we do 
not have free water treatment even though two decades ago or 15 
years ago we did have.  So we are regressing, not progressing. My 
difficulty with this motion is not the original motion.  It is 
the amendment to the motion that says that we must respect 
jurisdictions.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are afraid in the House to stand up as members of parliament 
and say that when it is a case of national safety, when it is the 
safety of Canadians, whether it is a criminal code, a justice, a 
law or a medical issue, we are afraid to stand up in this House 
and say that we should have national standards for water quality 
across this country, and we have to impose them upon the 
provinces if they are not willing to do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do not think that is going to happen.  Today I heard the Prime 
Minister say in the House that we had to respect provincial 
jurisdictions.  It is going to be very difficult to turn that 
around considering what we have heard from the opposition.  I 
note that only the NDP was prepared to suggest that the water 
quality standards that were being proposed should be mandatorily 
enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we are not going to intrude on provincial jurisdictions, then 
I suggest this national government has to do something, and it 
has to do something practical.  Quite frankly, this is a feel 
good motion and does not do a darn thing.  It just makes it look 
as though we MPs on both sides of the House are taking action 
when in fact I do not believe real action is being taken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Therefore, I would like to suggest something to my own 
government.  The government should invest in free testing for all 
communities and individuals across the country.  If we cannot 
enter into provincial jurisdiction to fix the water treatment 
plants, then at least give Canadians, whether they are on a farm 
or in a municipality, an opportunity to test their water to see 
whether it is safe.  If they find the water is unsafe, then they 
can go to their local politicians, be they municipal or 
provincial, and demand action.  However right now it is a 
complete darkness, a complete void.  People are drinking water 
and have no idea whether it is safe, and of course they are 
unwilling to test it themselves and often cannot afford to. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My suggestion, my contribution to this debate is that as far as 
the motion is concerned I am not at all happy with it.  I just do 
not think it goes anywhere.  However I am delighted to at least 
have had the opportunity to offer what I think is a constructive 
suggestion to the government, and that is to institute a 
nationwide free water testing program. 
<P><A NAME="LINK230"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson (New Brunswick Southwest, PC):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I listened intently to the member.  For the most part 
his remarks were certainly on target. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I understand his reservation with the federal government trying 
to enforce their wishes on the provinces.  If I heard the member 
correctly, I believe he was referring to leadership at the 
federal level where sometimes the federal government has to 
exercise its power to force the provinces to do something. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the member suggesting that maybe the government or the Prime 
Minister should do that or are we not acting simply because we do 
not want to get into a tug of war or head-butting with the 
provinces? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I just want a little clarification on that.  From time to time 
the federal government has to spend some of its political capital 
doing things which may prove to be unpopular in the short term, 
but obviously the right thing to do in the long term. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is precisely what I am 
proposing.  I think the federal government should meet with the 
provinces and set the standards.  Once the standards are set, 
then they should be enforceable, and the federal government 
should ensure that they are mandatory and enforced. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The difficulty is that in any province there may be a change of 
government that has a mantra of tax cuts, for example.  This is 
precisely what happened in Ontario.  Because of the desire to cut 
personal income taxes, spending on the environment, water quality 
and all these things was slashed overwhelmingly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I believe that we have to give the provinces the opportunity to 
work in their jurisdictions.  Where we go wrong is when we allow 
the provinces or the municipalities to take actions that actually 
affect the safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that yes the government should do what is unpopular. 
However the reality is, the opposite side and the member who 
spoke for his party have suggested that the federal government 
should not intrude into provincial jurisdiction in this matter if 
there is reluctance on the part of provinces.  I say it should, 
although I do not hold much hope that that is what is going to 
happen.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Greg Thompson:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the member mentioned in 
his speech, which I was delighted to hear, the reference to the 
millions of Canadians, including myself, that had their own 
wells. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When we talked about rural water supplies, some of these 
communities are rural and have a central water supply supplied by 
the village which is still considered by definition rural.  There 
are millions of Canadians who depend on their own well water.  It 
is a much bigger problem which goes to the care and the concern 
for the environment.  Some deed that we might do might 
contaminate our neighbour's well water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Maybe the member could talk about the responsibility of 
individual Canadians in ensuring that our water in those rural 
areas is kept safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Bryden:</B>  Mr. Speaker, in my region the local 
municipality is allowing developers to group houses together, 
drill their own wells and maintain their own water supply in 
their neighbourhoods.  There is no scrutiny on this at all.  They 
are required to meet an original or basic standard, but then it 
is up to that small neighbourhood or community to maintain that 
water quality and keep testing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is no good.  Whether it is one of these small 
neighbourhoods or individual farms scattered across the country, 
this is really the enormous problem.  Unless we come up with a 
program whereby the federal government actually requires or 
provides the funds for free water testing, we are always going to 
have this danger. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This debate has only been about communities.  It has not been 
about the millions of Canadians who get their water from private 
sources.  This is where the government could act and should act. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Bélair):</B> It is my duty, pursuant to 
Standing Order 38, to inform the House that the questions to be 
raised tonight at the time of adjournment are as follows: the 
hon. member for Vancouver East, Health; the hon. member for New 
Brunswick Southwest, National Defence. 
<P><A NAME="LINK231"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien (Abitibi—Baie-James—Nunavik, Lib.):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to take part in this debate on water 
quality. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and the Canadian Food 
Inspection Agency both play a crucial role in ensuring that 
Canadians have a safe and clean drinking water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Protecting water against agricultural runoff is a challenge that 
our government is taking very seriously. Most of Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada's initiatives in this area focus on prevention, 
that is on ways to prevent problems from arising. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, as many Canadians know, municipalities and provinces 
are mainly responsible for providing drinking water to Canadian 
families. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Local governments must first find suitable water sources to meet 
present and future needs of the community without endangering 
the environment. Then they must treat the water to eliminate any 
trace of impurities or contaminants. Finally, municipalities 
must build and maintain a system to supply water to the 
consumers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The last stage, and not the least, consists in building 
treatment and evacuation systems to make sure that wastewaters 
do not harm the environment. In short, it is a complex process 
in which the margin of error is very small. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While water supply systems are being developed and are in 
service, municipalities and provinces often need scientific data 
on the farming and agrifood sector. 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has undertaken a research 
project on nutrients in fertilizers and manure, to 
reduce the risk of water contamination by these nutrients. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This task is not easy as Canada is a huge country with many 
different ecosystems. Moreover, every community has specific 
needs and challenges. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another example of scientific data supplied by Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada is the development of a series of agricultural 
and environmental indicators, several of which are linked to 
water quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These indicators, which track environmental trends over the 
years in various regions of Canada, make it possible to identify 
areas and resources still at risk. Moreover, they serve as a 
starting point to focus action on areas where risks are the 
highest.

<A HREF="#LINKT79"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>For example, when provinces and municipalities are considering 
using some lands for agricultural purposes, the indicators and 
background data help scientists determine if farming might 
involve the risk of nutrients or other substances contaminating 
water. The indicators help in developing measures to evaluate 
and reduce as much as possible the risk of water contamination 
due to farming. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everybody knows, the semi-arid prairies present unique 
problems with regard to water supply. Ensuring supply in these 
areas is often a bit more difficult. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I am proud to mention that the Prairie Farm 
Rehabilitation Administration supports the main part of the 
research and technology transfer the Prairie communities need to 
manage their water supply. The administration is currently 
conducting numerous projects relating to water supply, 
conservation and protection of water resources and improvement 
of water quality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For instance, the rural water development program provides 
technological support for projects to develop wells and improve 
water quality. The administration also works together with its 
rural clients and local producer groups to promote better 
practices to protect surface water and ground water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the area of research, scientists with Agriculture and 
Agri-Food Canada are looking into other means of protecting 
drinking water against contaminants. Numerous Canadians are now 
aware of the dangers associated with bacteria like E. coli. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the fight against E. coli and other pathogenic 
agents, researchers at the Lethbridge research centre have 
discovered and tested several promising solutions which could 
help to check and eliminate those organisms at all points in the 
food chain, from the farm to the consumer. The Canadian beef 
industry, our partner in research, plays a major role by 
financing this initiative in the hope of finding a solution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am pleased to inform hon. members that producers are playing 
an active role in the protection of the environment. 
Many of them took the trouble to prepare and implement an 
environmental plan for their operations. For some time now, 
Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been providing them with 
financial assistance to do so. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In co-operation with Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, farmers 
have developed many other initiatives, so that Canadians may 
enjoy a cleaner environment and cleaner drinking water. Those 
initiatives are financed through the Canadian adaptation and 
rural development fund and implemented with the help of the 
provinces. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environmental stewardship initiative in agriculture, which 
is part of the Canadian adaptation and rural development fund, 
will make $10 million available to farmers over the next three 
years to help them launch projects dealing with water quality 
improvement, soil decontamination, wildlife habitat and 
biodiversity conservation in agricultural areas and the use of 
farming practices that will help prevent climate change. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Another activity funded by the Canadian adaptation and rural 
development fund is the environmental stewardship initiative in 
livestock production. It has a $1.3 million budget for research 
and technology transfer to assist producers in adopting 
environmentally friendly practices. This initiative will also 
help to create an environmental certification system for the hog 
industry. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are some of the measures taken by Agriculture and Agri-Food 
Canada and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to help protect 
Canada's water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Members will have to agree that we have accomplished a lot with 
the provinces and the producers, our partners. However, we will 
continue to do more and to work relentlessly because we take our 
responsibilities seriously. Canadian farmers and the public 
expect no less from us.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Herron (Fundy—Royal, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to talk about another aspect of 
water protection that Canadians may find of interest.  To be 
quite square, this was in the Progressive Conservative platform 
in the election this past November.  The issue originated from 
work done by the provincial Progressive Conservative government 
and the minister of environment, Kim Jardine.  She made a very 
progressive approach to water stewardship for which she should be 
commended, and I think the nation should do that.

<A HREF="#LINKT80"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Would the hon. member subscribe to what we are advocating, that 
new guidelines be drawn up in a co-operative fashion by 
provincial, territorial and federal governments that determine 
which activities can take place next to municipal wells, water 
sources, lakes or whatnot?  The most profound example might be to 
prohibit gas stations or laundromats from opening within a 
protected perimeter around municipal wells.  Would the hon. 
member support such an initiative? 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Guy St-Julien:</B> Mr. Speaker, before answering the question put 
by the hon. member, I would like to review what has been 
happening, especially in the last two years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The waterborne diseases we saw in Ontario last year and in 
Saskatchewan recently have brought to our attention the issue of 
access to safe drinking water in Canada. We know that these two 
tragedies are not isolated incidents. Several people have died 
and thousands got sick. I share the grief of all the people and 
the families who were affected by this. This situation is 
becoming all too common in Canada. As parliamentarians, it is 
not easy for us to find out that some people have died from 
drinking contaminated water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is something else that must be taken into consideration. 
If we talk about wells, we know that, in Quebec, many lakes are 
near some municipalities. For several years now, only one lake 
has been constantly monitored by the Quebec Department of the 
Environment, only one lake out of more than 500,000. Who is 
looking after the other lakes in Quebec? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same thing goes for wells. The federal government is not 
monitoring all the wells in all the provinces. It is not easy, 
especially in remote areas. We have the same problem with ground 
water. In Quebec, 20% of the people living outside urban areas, 
as well as hundreds of businesses and farm operations, use 
ground water as their water source. However we know almost nothing 
about where they are located. That is what is happening right 
now in Quebec. 
We do not know how renewable these water reserves are and we 
know nothing about their users. Only the municipalities that use 
that water source or water bottlers are accountable for their 
water management. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In answer to the member's question, I am not familiar with the 
report he is referring to. He would have to provide me with a 
copy. However, we know that there is a considerable lack of 
knowledge in the provinces, in Quebec for instance, on the state 
of their water supply. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Canadian 
Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a great honour today to speak 
to the motion.  I compliment the Progressive Conservative Party 
and its leader for raising this very pressing issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If there is one thing of critical importance to all human beings 
it is the quality of our water.  Access to potable safe water has 
been a given in society for a very long time.  Canadians over the 
years have come to expect and perhaps take for granted that a 
country with a population of 32-odd million, which possesses some 
11% of the world's reservoir of freshwater, would have safe 
drinking water.  As we have seen, however, circumstances in 
Saskatchewan and in Walkerton have shown something very 
different. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will quote a senator from the other place who said very 
poignantly that lack of access to safe water has become a clear 
and present danger to society. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How have we come to ignore that which is the essence of life on 
our planet?  A document put out in 1987 set very clear guidelines 
for water quality in our country.  The document said there could 
and must be co-operation between the federal and provincial 
governments in developing national standards to allow every 
person in Canada access to safe and potable water.  Have we seen 
any action since 1987?  No, we have not. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1650"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has been in power since 1993.  Surely it has had 
an opportunity to address the issue, bring forth national 
standards and give Canadians confidence in the water that comes 
out of their taps.  We have not seen that.  It is now 2001 and we 
are sitting here trying to shake up the government to work with 
the provinces and develop national standards so that our drinking 
water is safe for everyone from coast to coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How bad is it?  Recent reports estimate that 357 of 645 Ontario 
drinking water systems fail to meet even provincial standards. 
Twenty-five per cent of Newfoundland's water systems have serious 
problems, to such an extent that boiling water and relying on 
bottled water has become the norm.  Let us imagine a province 
where 25% of the drinking water is unfit for human consumption. 
It is completely absurd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian drinking water guidelines set out safe recommended 
limits for various polluting substances in raw, untreated 
drinking water, recreational water and water used for industrial 
or agricultural purposes.  The guidelines are designed to protect 
and enhance the quality of water in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However the guidelines apply only to inland surface water and 
groundwater and not to estuary and marine water.  There are large 
holes in the system.  Those holes need to be plugged and they 
needed to be plugged yesterday.  Failure to do so will result in 
more deaths such as we have seen in Walkerton and Saskatchewan. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately this is only the tip of the iceberg.  It is only 
by the grace of God that it has not happened more often.  It 
quite surprises me that we have not seen more outbreaks of water 
borne diseases in Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The guidelines limit the concentration of pollutants according 
to their potential health effects or aesthetic appearance. 
However are they reasonable?  Has anyone questioned whether the 
guidelines are safe?  Should the limits be higher or lower?  We 
do not know. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Even if the guidelines are violated and water is high in 
coliform, pesticides or other substances, what is the penalty? 
Nothing.  There is no penalty because there is no mechanism to 
enforce the guidelines.  We desperately need enforceable 
guidelines.  What is the point of guidelines without a mechanism 
to enforce them? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is not an academic issue, as we have heard today.  The 
issue is fundamental to the health and welfare of Canadians.  As 
a physician I know that some water borne diseases do not affect 
healthy adults but they certainly affect the most vulnerable in 
society.  Water borne diseases selectively take out the most 
vulnerable such as children and the elderly.  They are the ones 
who pay the price in an outbreak. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadian drinking water guidelines are used by provincial, 
territorial and federal agencies to assess water quality problems 
and manage competing users of water resources.  However the 
guidelines are not law. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government's response to this has been to put a bit of money 
forward.  That is easy to do.  It is easy to stand and devote 
money, but there must be a plan.  We know the municipalities and 
provinces are responsible for this.  However there must be a 
co-ordinated effort by all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In our country, whether in regard to water quality, health care 
or other issues, we have fractured jurisdictions and often the 
left hand does not know what the right hand is doing.  The 
ministers have a great opportunity.  They can bring together 
their provincial and municipal counterparts and develop a 
co-ordinated system of enforceable guidelines, based on science 
and fact, that will protect our society.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue of the future.  Make no mistake about it.  The 
lives of millions of Canadians will rest on it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the last 10 to 15 years we have seen disturbing things in 
the ecosystem.  There has been a massive die-off of amphibians 
not only in our country but around the world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The scientific evidence of late points to a direct correlation 
between the die-off of amphibians and the use of pesticides.  In 
addition to the die-off there are massive and grotesque 
deformities.  There are frogs with eyes on the top of their 
heads, amphibians with multiple legs or two heads, and fishes 
with gross deformities.  These are very serious problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason this is a bellwether, the proverbial canary in the 
mine, is that the skin or outer covering of amphibians is very 
permeable.  It is not like our skin which is tougher.  The skin 
of amphibians is permeable and absorbs substances much easier. 
This makes them the canary in the mine.  Amphibians tend to 
visibly manifest the cancer causing, teratogenic and mutagenic 
capabilities of the substances they absorb. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We ignore that to our detriment.  Epidemiological studies have 
shown clear health risks in communities that are close to areas 
with high concentrations of pesticides.  Pesticides, fungicides 
and fertilizers are necessary but they must be used in an 
appropriate way.  We are now seeing grave health risks in some 
communities near the areas where they are used. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Higher rates of birth deformities, teratogenicity, neonatal 
morbidity and mortality are all being observed.  They are red 
flags waving in front of us but we are not responding.  That is 
very serious. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A number of substances are being released into our environment 
that will be here not for a few days but for years or hundreds or 
even thousands of years.  Large amounts of nucleotides or 
radioactive material from Russia are being bioaccumulated within 
our ecosystems in the north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a result, Inuit people and many large aquatic and terrestrial 
mammals have large amounts of radioactive, cancer causing and 
teratogenic substances within them.  We see higher rates of 
cancer, birth deformities and neonatal morbidity and mortality in 
the north than in other communities.  Science clearly indicates 
that individuals in the north are suffering because they eat 
mammals that bioaccumulate these dangerous substances in their 
bodies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what is happening.  We and others have warned the 
government for some six years about this but have seen no action. 
The government knows about this.  It is very aware.  Perhaps it 
feels impotent to deal with it, but it is not.  The only way to 
deal with these issues is to work with the international 
community.  We must deal seriously with the release of these 
substances into our environment. 
On the issue of fertilizers, we have seen changes in the pH 
levels of our water quality and acidification of the water as a 
direct result of pesticides being leached into it.  As a result, 
a number of water tables have been polluted.  If we measure the 
outflow of water into larger basins, we see that the 
concentrations are very high.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We know our farmers need good fertilizer and pesticides to give 
us the food we require.  We have to allow them to work by using 
these fertilizers, fungicides and pesticides in a reasonable way. 
However we do not see enough studies nor action on the side of 
the government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In fact, the environment commissioner has repeatedly mentioned 
to the government the ways in which it is falling flat on its 
face with respect to being the guardian of our environment.  The 
environment commissioner, like the auditor general did with 
finance, has waved the flag many times.  He has given specific 
solutions on what the government could do, and has a moral 
responsibility to engage in, to improve our environment.  It is 
there in black and white. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment commissioner's reports have come out in black 
and white.  They are good reports, fair reports and are 
constructive.  We can only hope that the government will push 
hard and listen to what has been said in these reports and to the 
other signs, so it can build an environment that will be fairer 
and cleaner. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>An issue that is very important on the west coast of British 
Columbia, because a large number of people rely on salmon, is 
what is happening to our salmon stocks, which have been 
decimated. We believe part of the reason for this decimation is 
the conditions and changes taking place with respect to the 
water. The water temperature is going up.  As a result, there has 
been change in the mackerel population which is eating the 
salmon fry and the fingerlings.  That is in part contributing to 
the very small numbers which are returning.  It is decimating the 
fish populations, particularly the salmon populations, on the 
west coast. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Do we know why this is happening?  No.  We certainly have some 
theories that it is related to global warning.  In fact the 
oceans are now believed to be a CO2 sink that is taking up a lot 
of the unrecognized carbon dioxide being released. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is incumbent upon the government, and indeed the Minister of 
the Environment, to work with his provincial and municipal 
counterparts across the country, rather than have a balkanized 
system of environmental standards which benefits absolutely no 
one, to develop safe water for all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Potable water is essential.  It is our life blood.  I can only 
encourage the government and say to it that we as a party 
together with the Progressive Conservatives and others will push 
hard to make sure that the government lives up to its 
responsibility to ensure that all Canadians will have access to 
potable water, such as the type we are all drinking. 
<P><A NAME="LINK234"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Casson (Lethbridge, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I just want to take time to pose a question to my 
colleague. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my other life I was the mayor of a town in southern Alberta 
of 1,700 people.  The quality of the water and the concern about 
supplying safe water was always paramount in our minds.  We had 
to go through different scenarios with different standards being 
presented.  The standards would change and we would have to 
increase our ability to treat our water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In subsequent years there was a problem.  The mayor at the time, 
the council, the staff and others worked very hard to correct it. 
I still live in that town of 1,700, and it is spending over $1 
million in upgrading the water treatment plant to meet standards 
for supplying safe, secure water for the community.  That is just 
one community that is spending spending well over $1 million to 
upgrade its facility. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The idea of standards that are binding is one thing.  We support 
the motion brought forward today by the Conservatives to have 
something put in place to deal with that.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to ask my colleague a question about the science 
needed to test the systems which are in place and the funds 
required to come up with a water study in Canada which would 
absolutely place, in some parameters, the condition of our 
present drinking water systems in Canada.  What emphasis does he 
think should be placed on the science, as well as the standards 
needed to supply that safe water? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, it is a pertinent 
question.  Whatever we do, the guidelines we put forth have to be 
based on good science.  Science would give us the basis upon 
which we could have guidelines that were reasonable, that were 
safe in terms of health care aspects and guidelines that were 
doable. Sometimes we set standards that are not attainable.  We 
need to have attainable standards that are safe for the public 
and that are imminently doable, and we can do it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A lot of the science has already been done.  One very 
interesting thing is that a number of new water achievement 
capabilities have been discovered around the world.  We need to 
extract the best information from around the world, and on a case 
by case basis utilize water purification mechanisms appropriate 
for given communities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my area of Victoria sewage is dumped out after only primary 
treatment.  To my knowledge, that is not much of a problem 
because of where the water is and the velocity of the tides.  I 
am sure that it would give comfort to people in Victoria to have 
a secondary water treatment system where we could remove a number 
of other substances that are bioaccumulating in our environment, 
the likes and consequences of which we do not know at this point 
in time.  The bottom line is base the guidelines on good science.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
cannot think of an issue that could come before the House where 
Canadians would have a greater sense of resolve, purpose and be 
of a common mind, than the issue of clean drinking water in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The debate today has been very interesting.  I thank the member 
for Fundy—Royal and the Progressive Conservatives for bringing 
the issue forward.  It is important that we have this debate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I listened very carefully to my hon. colleague from 
Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca.  It seems to me there is an agreement 
that we all want to see clean water, but the issue before us is 
whether or not the federal government is willing to take a stand 
and show the leadership to provide enforceable national drinking 
water standards, and to do that now, not at some point in the 
future.  I heard my colleague say that he supports that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On a related matter, it seems to me that he also raised the 
question of the use of pesticides and how they can contaminate 
our water systems.  He gave some very alarming examples of what 
can happen.  We have to remember that in the environment 
committee a very excellent report was issued on the use of 
pesticides, particularly for cosmetic use.  My understanding is 
that the Canadian Alliance issued a dissenting report.  It did 
not agree with the main report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to be very clear about the positions being put forward. 
Either we agree that there should be clean water for Canadians, 
and that it should be backed up by enforceable national 
standards, or we think that somehow various jurisdictions such as 
the marketplace would take over.  I believe the former. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the position of his party on the use of pesticides? 
Would it agree that it is a central point in whether or not we 
have a clean water system?  Would he agree that we need to have 
strong enforceable standards, not just for the water but for all 
of the stuff that goes into those water systems, like pesticides?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin:</B>  Mr. Speaker, my hon. colleague has 
asked a very important question.  It is important to remember 
that the government is using a federal water policy from 1987, 
which is obsolete.  We have to deal with this issue now. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are in support of the motion put forward by the member for 
Fundy—Royal and his party to develop enforceable guidelines 
based on science. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With respect to pesticides, there are pesticides and there are 
pesticides.  For us to have access to safe food stuffs and enough 
food to eat, there is little doubt that pesticides are required. 
However it is important that we use pesticides wisely and 
whatever pesticide is utilized, it is used on the basis of 
science not on the basis of emotion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would encourage the House to continue to look at whether we 
need to use pesticides for cosmetic reasons.  If so, what kind do 
we need to use?  I would encourage the NDP member to work with 
the rest of us, as I know she will, to develop those kind of 
standards, which we would support. 
<P><A NAME="LINK236"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to rise in the House today to speak in support of this 
motion.  I know that other members of the NDP caucus have spoken 
in strong support of this motion from the Progressive 
Conservative Party.  We consider this to be a very critical issue 
facing Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The confidence of Canadians has been very severely shaken given 
recent events in both Walkerton and now in North Battleford, 
Saskatchewan.  This raises the question as to whether or not any 
Canadian can rely upon our water system.  It is something that 
many Canadians over the years have taken for granted. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We live in a country of immense natural resources with a huge 
abundance of freshwater.  Canadians believe that our water 
resources are protected, clean and safe for drinking.  Yet the 
events that have unfolded in the last year have seriously 
undermined what it is that we believe in in terms of clean water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This leads me to the question of the motion before the House. 
While there needs to be negotiation and collaboration between the 
federal jurisdictions, provinces and territories, the critical 
issue is to arrive at a place where we have enforceable national 
drinking water standards that are enshrined in a safe water act. 
If we cannot agree on that in the House, then why are we here? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are talking about a basic necessity of life.  We are talking 
about the provision of a resource for human consumption that 
should be safeguarded at all cost.  I do not think it makes a 
difference whether one lives in a small or rural community where 
reliance is on well water or whether one lives in a large urban 
centre where reliance is on very complex water filtration and 
chlorination systems.  No matter where people live, they should 
have the assurance that the water is safe. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my community in Vancouver there have been significant issues 
about water quality through the greater Vancouver regional 
district.  We have fought many battles to try and stop logging in 
the watersheds where the reservoirs are to ensure the quality of 
that water.  This has been a very hotly contested local issue. 
Many activists have taken it on over the years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we had a safe water act and enforceable standards along with 
a federal government that was willing to put that into law and 
provide a guarantee to every Canadian, then it seems to me that 
we would not have the severity of the problems that we are facing 
in Canada today. 
Along with my colleagues I wholeheartedly support the motion, as 
I hope every member of the House does, that we act in the public 
interest to uphold the public interest in terms of the provision 
of clear and safe drinking water.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC)</B>  moved: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, in the opinion of this House, the government should 
immediately commit its one-third share of the funding for the St. 
John's harbour cleanup 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He said:  Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on my private member's 
motion I submitted for debate here in the House of Commons 
concerning St. John's harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Why, hon. members may ask, is St. John's harbour worthy of 
special mention here in the House of Commons?  How is St. John's 
harbour special in the context of the business here in the House 
of Commons? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me tell all hon. members here in the House that St. John's 
is not just another city.  It is one of the oldest cities in the 
new world.  It is the most easterly city in North America and, as 
such, is Canada's easternmost gateway.  It is a capital city 
where responsible government took root long before there was a 
nation called Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. John's is history and it is culture personified.  This year 
we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of Marconi's wireless 
speech.  The site of these celebrations is up on Signal Hill, 
just above the harbour. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. John's harbour is the recipient of 120 million litres of raw 
sewage every single day.  That is more than 43 billion litres per 
year. 
The narrow entrance to the harbour prevents the sea from 
effectively flushing the harbour of pollutants.  As a result, the 
Sierra Club in 1994 gave St. John's harbour an F on the national 
sewage report card.  In 1999 it downgraded that F to an F minus.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1993 the St. John's harbour ACAP committee was formed.  ACAP 
stands for Atlantic coastal action program, a program set up by 
Environment Canada to assist Atlantic Canadians in restoring and 
sustaining watershed areas in adjacent coastal towns. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to the St. John's harbour cleanup, the ACAP 
committee is doing a very good job in keeping the harbour 
pollution issue in the public eye.  It is a problem that the 
mayor of the city of St. John's and the adjacent municipalities 
of Mount Pearl and Paradise are working overtime to cure. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The mayor of the city of St. John's is in the gallery here 
today.  He held a press conference in Ottawa today in an effort 
to draw national public attention to what is a very serious 
environmental issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The leader of the opposition in the house of assembly in 
Newfoundland, Mr. Byrne, was in the gallery today.  He travelled 
here to show his support for this particular issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One might ask why the federal government should be involved in 
the cleanup of St. John's harbour.  The federal government must 
have placed a priority on these projects at one time because the 
Atlantic coastal action program is a federal program.  I do not 
understand why the federal government would set up a program like 
that if it were not prepared to help out financially in the 
process of environmental cleanup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government is already involved in that project in 
that it did commit a paltry $1.5 million to the project. However, 
those token gestures on the part of the federal government are 
not enough.  We need the federal government to kick in its 
one-third share of that $93 million project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Federal funding has been applied for but to date there has been 
no response.  There has been no indication from Newfoundland's 
federal cabinet minister that he is even remotely interested in 
this project.  We should not need a special program to deal with 
a $93 million project like harbour cleanup.  From a multibillion 
dollar national infrastructure program, Newfoundland gets only a 
minuscule amount simply because these funds are distributed on a 
per capita basis. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Some 93% of Canadians who are serviced by sewer systems have at 
least primary sewage treatment.  Less than 50% of the people of 
Atlantic Canada have any kind of primary sewage treatment. We 
have much less than that in Newfoundland.  We probably only have 
5%, 4% or 3%.  The bottom line is that our need is much greater 
than the rest of Canada and that fact should be reflected in the 
amount of funding we get. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>A Memorial University economist by the name of Dr. Wade Locke 
did a cost benefit analysis of this project.  If we consider the 
tax revenues to the Government of Canada during the construction 
and over the 25 year lifespan of that project, the analysis shows 
that the government would take in more than twice the $31 million 
cost of that project.  In other words, in terms of the national 
treasury, over the long run the federal government would be money 
in.  If the Minister of Industry is unable to take anything else 
to the cabinet table, he is able to take that fact to convince 
his colleagues to make money available for this project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This was a big issue during the national federal election 
campaign.  During the dying days of that campaign, the Minister 
of Industry, flanked by his two St. John's candidates, called a 
news conference on the waterfront of St. John's.  The people of 
St. John's held their collective breath expecting the minister 
would make a financial commitment to the harbour cleanup project.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Instead, all we got from the Minister of Industry, as usual, was 
bafflegab and a firm promise that he would work very hard on 
making money available for the St. John's harbour cleanup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister is now back in Ottawa and all we have heard from 
him on the harbour cleanup project is dead silence.  The Minister 
of Industry has done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Because of that inaction, I submitted the motion today for 
debate in the House of Commons.  Since it has been several months 
since the federal election, I would ask the minister today what 
he has done to advance the cause of the St. John's harbour 
cleanup. Obviously the minister has done nothing. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Minister of Industry is an individual who loves to deliver. 
Since the federal election he has made the rounds of the entire 
country announcing hundreds of millions of dollars worth of 
projects in every conceivable industry in city after city, 
everything from genetic research to building airplanes, but still 
not a single penny for the St. John's harbour cleanup project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sorry to be continually yapping at the heels of 
Newfoundland's industry minister.  I know it must be an awful 
distraction from his leadership ambitions.  However, let me say 
that he might as well get used to it because as long as I am in 
the House the Minister of Industry will not get off the hook on 
this one.  He made the promise and he will have to deliver.  This 
is a very serious environmental issue for the city of St. John's 
and it will not go away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me also say that this is a minister who has taken on the 
senior and leading role in the government.  However, in the 
Newfoundland context, so far at least, he is no Don Jamieson, no 
John Crosbie and no Jim McGrath.  These gentlemen not only stood 
tall in the nation, they delivered at home as well.  This 
minister is not delivering the goods to fix the problem that is 
an environmental hazard and a major deterrent to tourism in North 
America's oldest city and one of the most beautiful cities in our 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What will the minister do to advance the cause of the St. John's 
harbour cleanup? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the beginning of the last election, the Prime Minister and 
the industry minister contributed about a half billion dollars to 
give Toronto harbour a facelift.  I supported that.  However, the 
reason they made that contribution was to make Toronto harbour 
more aesthetically pleasing and to get it ready for an Olympic 
bid. Again, I support that.  The Olympics are very important to 
Toronto, fine and dandy, but, I ask members of the House, where 
is the fairness in that kind of approach?  It was a half billion 
dollars to a harbour in Toronto to make it more aesthetically 
pleasing for an Olympic bid and thumbs down on St. John's that 
has a very serious environmental problem. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The environment minister was recently mentioned in his local 
paper for getting $4.5 million for Victoria harbour, Canada's 
most westerly capital city.  I support that.  It is a good 
project and it should have money.  However, it looks like the 
ministers from Ontario and B.C. know how to deliver the goods. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is wrong with our minister?  Why can he not deliver? 
Perhaps he has other ambitions or priorities.  I hope he does not 
because he has a duty to his province and to his province's 
capital city.  He loves to use the jargon “we are working on 
that file”.  Let me say to him that he should get to work.  This 
file needs national attention.  It is time for the minister to 
keep the promise he made to the people in November on the 
waterfront in the city of St. John's.  The minister is not good 
at keeping his promises but he had better start because this one 
will not go away.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>If Newfoundland's minister feels lonely at the cabinet table 
when he is looking for money for St. John's, he should remind his 
mainland colleagues that Newfoundland became part of Canada back 
in 1949.  If Canada wants our fish, paper, iron ore, hydro power 
and oil, it should treat us like we are part of Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are not being treated like we are part of this great nation. 
We have made our contribution to the nation and it is time that 
the nation came to our aid on this issue.  When we are faced with 
a group of Newfoundlanders being forced to live among sewage, we 
are faced with a group of Canadians that are being forced to live 
among sewage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When a German tourist looks over the rail of a cruise ship at 
the mess floating in St. John's harbour, he does not ask how 
Newfoundlanders put up with that.  He wonders how Canadians put 
up with that kind of mess. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. John's is Canada's easternmost city.  It is a gateway.  Due 
to the history and culture of the place, and being a port of call 
for the American and European cruise ships, tourism is a very 
important industry; it is a growth industry.  The mayor of the 
city of St. John's and his council have done a fantastic job in 
attracting cruise ships.  They have doubled the number of cruise 
ships coming into St. John's.  They deserve a great deal of 
consideration and compliments for what they have been able to do, 
but they do not have the federal government and the Ministry of 
Industry at the moment helping out with their great effort. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This harbour is a health hazard.  Studies have shown that 
sediment on the bottom of the harbour is laced with chemical 
pollutants and heavy metals.  St. John's harbour is a septic soup 
that is an environmental time bomb.  What has the Minister of 
Industry, Newfoundland's federal cabinet minister, done about it? 
He has done absolutely nothing.  He has given no indication that 
he even cares.  It is about time the minister came to the aid of 
this very important project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The harbour cleanup project is not an optional nicety.  We are 
not looking to dress up our harbour to grease the wheels of an 
Olympic bid.  We want to lessen the health risks to our people 
and at the same time help to develop a fledgling tourism industry 
that the mayor of the city of St. John's and his council are 
working very hard on. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>St. John's is North America's oldest city and it plays a very 
historic role in the country.  Newfoundlanders should not have to 
get down on their knees begging, scratching and pleading with the 
federal government to make money available for this project.  The 
federal minister representing Newfoundland should be front and 
centre on this issue.  He should go to the office of the mayor of 
the city of St. John's and to the various municipalities in the 
province and offer help on this project because they are doing 
such a good job. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister has done nothing on this project.  He refuses to 
even be in the House today to talk about this issue and to hear 
what is being— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Order, please.  I was listening 
attentively as all other members were and I would remind members 
that we cannot refer to the presence or, more specifically, the 
absence of members.  We all know our time requirements and that I 
do not want to take anything away from the passionate and strong 
feelings of the hon. member and other members who might join in 
the debate. 
<P><A NAME="LINK262"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Bob Mills (Red Deer, Canadian Alliance):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
this is another environmental issue.  There have been many during 
the last eight years I have been here.  Again we look at promises 
and at the politics being played with the issue of the 
environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I had the privilege of going to St. John's during a byelection. 
I saw the harbour and the history of the place.  It is a 
beautiful spot.  One of the things that I was shown in the 
harbour was the emission of raw sewage into the ocean. 
At first I did not understand.  I could not imagine that in a G-8 
country, in an advanced country called Canada, we would be 
dumping raw sewage into the ocean.  I would expect that in 
developing countries.  They have little choice.  They have no 
resources to take care of sewage, but I did not expect that in 
Canada.

<A HREF="#LINKT94"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then I found out that it is not the only place where we are 
dumping raw sewage.  We are dumping raw sewage into the ocean in 
the beautiful city of Victoria.  When we say we have a problem 
and there is too much sewage lying around on our beaches, the 
answer is that we put the pipe out a little farther into the 
ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is hardly sewage treatment.  That is hardly something hon. 
members would expect in a country like Canada.  As I mentioned 
earlier today in the debate about water, we sell our technology. 
We sell water treatment plants and sewage treatment plants to 
developing countries.  In Canada we have at least two cities 
where we are putting raw sewage directly into the ocean.  That is 
a disgrace. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In St. John's harbour, 120 million litres per day of raw sewage 
are dumped directly into the ocean, letting the tides carry it 
away and becoming someone else's problem.  All members should be 
shocked by that kind of information.  We should be reacting to it 
immediately.  There are bacteria, pathogens, phosphorous, 
nitrogen, heavy metals, visible pollutants lying everywhere, and 
baby diapers, condoms and needles lying on the beaches. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member who raised the issue talked about the numerous 
cruise ships going by.  What do they think about Canada when they 
see and hear about that sort of thing?  There is not only the 
health hazard the hon. member has mentioned, but the shame and 
the embarrassment that we as Canadians have to live with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see the money that is wasted in planet Ottawa and some of the 
programs that are funded.  It is shocking that we would even need 
a private member's motion on an issue as basic as water and 
sewage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I see how politics are played.  I do not say I understand 
politics in Atlantic Canada all that well.  I hear how people are 
told at public meetings that if they vote a certain way the money 
will be made available for a sewage treatment plant.  That is not 
the way the government should play with environmental issues.  It 
is not a partisan political issue.  Taking care of sewage is a 
basic thing that a country does.  Whether Canadians vote Liberal, 
NDP, Conservative or Alliance should not matter when it comes to 
putting raw sewage into the ocean. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also looked at the Sydney tar ponds, which our party has been 
looking at for eight years now.  Again we see how little is being 
done and how much politics is being played.  There is a face-off 
between the industry minister and the environment minister for 
who can have the dirtiest harbour.  That is not something I would 
like to say I represented if I were either the industry minister 
or the environment minister.  I certainly would not want to list 
on my credentials that my city's raw sewage is going into the 
ocean.  It is certainly not something we would want to talk 
about. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How do we deal with environmental issues?  Obviously the list 
could be very long.  What we do or what we expect from our 
federal government is leadership.  It should not pass the buck. 
It should not say that it is this level of government or that 
level of government.  It must recognize that environment is a 
provincial issue and in many cases is a municipal issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What should be the role of the federal government?  Its role 
should be one of leadership, of providing research money and 
expertise to the provinces and territories to help them help the 
municipalities.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We do not even know what our aquifers are and whether or not we 
are polluting them.  We do not have nor do we use the technology 
to look at our water supply. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sewage is another matter.  We really do not use the most modern 
technologies in many cases.  We do not have a set of standards 
for testing. Some have primary treatment, some have secondary, 
some have tertiary and some have none.  Obviously, that is not 
the sort of Canada that most of us want environmentally.  The 
federal government should provide leadership and initiative to 
deal with these kinds of basic problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The matter of garbage is a favourite of mine.  I have been 
visiting garbage landfill sites in different countries to see how 
they deal with garbage for probably 35 years.  I remember sitting 
next to the mayor of Vienna.  I asked him casually over dinner 
what his city did with its garbage.  I told him that I had looked 
at the garbage facilities in Frankfurt, Amsterdam, London, Miami, 
New York and a lot of Canadian cities as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>He told me that he would show me what they did.  At 11 o'clock 
at night we drove downtown and came to a building that looked 
like an apartment building.  Inside was a recycling facility and 
an incinerator. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Vienna's biggest problem is that it cannot get enough garbage. 
It is now purchasing garbage from surrounding communities and 
bringing it in train loads so that the plant is kept fully 
functional. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the kind of thing that Canadians should be promoting and 
utilizing whether for recycling, composting or incineration.  The 
technology is there.  The technology to handle the sewage problem 
in St. John's harbour is not rocket science.  It is just a matter 
of getting the job done and being committed to doing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We should also look at our air situation.  I will give an 
example that is similar to St. John's harbour or Victoria.  There 
is an area in the Fraser Valley that is the second most polluted 
air shed in Canada.  Southern Ontario is the most polluted and 
this area is the second. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>California is short of energy.  It cannot build power plants 
there because they pollute.  Washington does not allow high 
tensile lines to go over the top of populated areas.  Guess what 
they are going to do?  They have decided to build power plants 
along the border on the Washington side.  California gets its 
power and Washington gets the profit. Canada gets the pollution 
and the high tensile lines. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is the sort of thing that Canadians cannot allow.  We 
cannot allow raw sewage into the oceans.  We cannot allow 
pollution to come across our border without raising a fuss about 
it.  We have to deal with our sewage problem and modernize our 
garbage disposal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada's environmental record needs to be improved.  At the 
present time it is dismal.  We need to stop playing politics with 
the environment and get on with the job of creating a cleaner 
environment for all Canadians. 
<P><A NAME="LINK263"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Cannis (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this is a very important issue 
for each and every Canadian no matter where they live.  I would 
like to respond briefly to the member for St. John's East who 
spoke with such passion about this very important issue. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1830"></A>

<A HREF="#LINKT96"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I find it very unacceptable and disheartening when a 
member in the hon. House tries to destroy a member by saying that 
he does not care and that he has not participated. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, you were a member of the House at 
that time and you remember very well when he was the minister of 
fisheries.  He went to bat for the province and the Atlantic 
provinces.  He brought the issues front and centre and got 
results and spoke with passion. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The hon. member knows that very well.  It is unfortunate that he 
did not stick to the issue at hand but tried to politicize.  As 
the hon. member from the Alliance said, let us take the politics 
out of it, and I agree with him.  This is not an issue of 
politics. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me point out that the Government of Canada has made and will 
continue to make serious commitments to the protection of our 
environment and to the reclamation of our threatened lands and, 
of course, waters. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The current situation, whereby untreated sewage empties into St. 
John's harbour, is unacceptable to me, to the minister, to the 
Prime Minister, to the government and I know to the country as a 
whole.  It is important that the situation be addressed in a 
manner acceptable and feasible for the city of St. John's, the 
province of Newfoundland and Labrador and the Government of 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am fully aware that the municipal and provincial governments 
have committed to cost sharing the necessary cleanup.  I believe 
that this approach will expedite our efforts to address this most 
important issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For this reason, we are working to identify an appropriate 
mechanism for funding this kind of undertaking.  The estimated 
cost for the construction of a required primary treatment plant 
is $93 million.  The only program currently in place to 
facilitate federal contributions to municipal infrastructure is 
of course the Canada infrastructure program, which is cost shared 
with provincial and municipal governments. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The existing Canada-Newfoundland infrastructure works program 
has committed funds totalling $153 million over five years. These 
funds were allocated to assist in building and improving 
infrastructure in more than 400 communities, incorporated areas, 
of course, and the local service districts in Newfoundland and 
Labrador.  The municipal infrastructure requirements in this, 
Canada's fourth largest province, are broad based, pan-provincial 
and in some cases very urgent. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are, for example, as many as 240 boil water orders in 
effect right now on any given day in areas that do not enjoy the 
basic advantage of reliable, safe drinking water. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On October 13, 2000, the Canada-Newfoundland infrastructure 
agreement was signed, with an allocation of $51 million in 
federal funds for Newfoundland and Labrador.  I would like to 
point that out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately the existing program, while substantial, cannot 
meet the existing demand.  For the current fiscal year alone, 
$250 million in water and sewer management projects have been 
proposed for the province.  The $93 million required to put an 
adequate sewage treatment facility in place in the capital city 
of St. John's is not included in that sum. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canada-Newfoundland infrastructure works program has a 
specific mandate to provide assistance in the ongoing development 
of appropriate and essential infrastructure in communities 
throughout the province.  It would be inappropriate to commit in 
excess of half of that funding to one project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This in no way diminishes the importance of finding a solution 
to this unacceptable situation in St. John's harbour.  It would 
be inadvisable and counterproductive, let me say, to make short 
term, reactive promises in response to an issue of this 
importance. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to assure the hon. member, members in the House as 
well, and of course the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, that 
the minister will continue to work with his cabinet colleagues 
and municipal and provincial partners to find an appropriate long 
term solution to the problem.

Speaker, I am pleased to take part in the debate on this motion 
by the hon. member for St. John's East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The position of the Bloc Quebecois, and mine by the same token, 
is based on the opportunities cities had in the past and which 
they lost over the last few years. They are slowly getting them 
back, but they are far from meeting all the needs of Canadian 
municipalities in infrastructure, and waste and water treatment.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In a not too distant previous incarnation, just last year, I 
quit as president of the Union des municipalités du Québec. I can 
say that Canadian cities have been hard hit by the deep cuts in 
federal transfers to the provinces made in 1992. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1998 alone, Quebec municipalities have contributed $730 
million to the Quebec government to help erase the deficit and 
meet the needs in health care and education. Since 1992, with a 
government of the Liberal Party in 1992 and of the Parti 
Quebecois in 1998, Quebec municipalities have had to make a more 
significant contribution. 
In Quebec, this was a bill that was paid in part to the 
government of Quebec, but the municipalities saw their budgets 
cut by $730 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am sure that a similar situation exists right across Canada, 
with the federal government's cuts in health and education. Let us 
not forget that in 2001 federal transfers to the provinces for 
health care will only he as high as they were in 1993. No miracles 
are made with the taxpayer money and we all know that people do 
not want more tax increases. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What did the provincial governments do? They reduced in turn 
their transfer payments to the lower levels, basically the 
transfers and support they were providing to the cities for 
various programs, including the water purification program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am not surprised to see that in 2001 the City of St. John's, 
Newfoundland is faced with a sewage problem, which it has not 
yet found a way to solve, and a horrendous $30 million bill.  The 
problem is simple. The level of government funding for the 
tripartite infrastructure program is insufficient. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The speech that the government member just gave proves it. What 
he said was that there was not enough money to respond to the 400 
demands in the province of Newfoundland alone. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem is much larger amounts need to be earmarked for 
infrastructure programs. Since 1992, cities have had to 
contribute to the higher levels of governments' deficit reduction 
efforts. 
The federal government started things off by shifting the deficit 
burden to the provinces and provinces then dumped their problems 
partly on the municipalities and partly on various other health 
and education institutions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are just coming out of a large operation to put public 
finances back in order, but let us not forget that municipalities 
provide frontline services to the population. We tend very easily 
to think that this costs nothing, but when we get up in the 
morning and flush the toilet or turn on the faucet, we must never 
forget that the quality of life we enjoy in our beautiful 
provinces and also in Canada is largely due to the municipalities 
that take care of water treatment, wastewater treatment and 
garbage collection. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Those are things we often forget. People too often forget that 
there are costs involved and that the municipalities have to meet 
them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sympathize with the mayor of St. John's, Newfoundland. That 
city should have the resources needed to treat its 
wastewater. It should have, in the year 2001, the amounts 
required to deal with what is now one of life's 
necessities, wastewater treatment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this regard, we could recommend that the government be 
receptive to all municipal applications regarding the needs 
identified as a result of studies. A major study had to be 
conducted by municipalities across Canada before they could 
submit their applications under the tripartite program. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Quebec municipalities need $10 billion 
to deal with infrastructure problems of all kinds. The $10 
billion will only be spread over the next ten 
years. 
They need $10 billion dollars to maintain their water systems, 
sewage treatment systems and transportation systems in reasonably 
good shape. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The tripartite infrastructure program announced in its last 
budgets by the federal government will only 
give Quebec $1.5 billion over the next five years, which is 15% 
of what Quebec municipalities need. I am sure the situation is 
the same across Canada. It is too little, and in the case of St. 
John's, Newfoundland, it is too late, because considerable damage 
is being caused to the environment by not dealing with such a 
serious problem as water purification. We are always waiting for the 
federal government because that is how we are able to calculate 
investments made by the provinces and municipalities.

<A HREF="#LINKT98"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would even go as far as to say that, on top of that, all 
municipalities along the St. Lawrence River, along the St. 
Lawrence Seaway and along Canada's entire coastline need a 
specific envelope for decontamination and cleanup to repair the 
damage caused by nature and man in the last few years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These municipalities need special assistance. There should be a 
special envelope for municipalities along the coasts of Quebec 
and Canada, including along the St. Lawrence Seaway, in order to 
meet this urgent need to fight pollution and to be 
environmentally correct, if we want our country to be at the 
forefront of the fight against pollution. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Bloc Quebecois will support all municipalities and cities 
that try to take charge of their own destiny and need money to 
compensate the big revenue loss caused indirectly by the federal 
government since 1992. Cities had to part with billions of 
dollars to help provincial governments and Quebec deal with 
health care and education problems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is inconceivable that in 2001 federal transfers to the 
provinces are at the 1993 level. When health care was 
implemented in Canada, the federal share of the costs was 50%. 
It stands now at 25%, while costs keep rising for the provinces. 
In Quebec health costs will double over the next five years. 
Obviously, federal transfers will not increase at the same rate, 
even if we are told that agreements have been signed. True 
enough, the provinces have signed agreements on infrastructure 
programs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are supposed to be glad with everything that is being signed. 
Of course, half a loaf is better than no loaf. Premiers sign 
agreements with the federal government because it is better than 
nothing and because it will help their communities and 
citizens. However we should not forget that Canadian cities need 
much more. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will say it again, St. John's deserves this federal 
investment. It deserves to have the federal government pay one 
third, and the provincial government and the municipal 
government will also each pay one third. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK265"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Joe Comartin (Windsor—St. Clair, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I think it is appropriate that this private member's bill is 
being brought forward today given today's debate in the House on 
water and the obviously detrimental effect it has on the citizens 
of this country and on their health when it is not adequately 
protected. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That, to a great degree, is what the bill is about.  I would 
like to thank the Progressive Conservative member for St. John's 
East for having brought forward the bill and giving us this 
opportunity to debate it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will take this opportunity to quote some material.  One of the 
quotes I found is from the <I>Telegram</I> newspaper in 
Newfoundland from October 24 of last year.  This is how the 
harbour was described:  “The harbour, a noxious stew of feces, 
condoms, tampons, rubber gloves and everything else that gets 
flushed down the thousands of toilets in the metro area, has long 
been an environmental embarrassment”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is interesting is the date that the article appeared in 
that paper because of course it was not long before the last 
federal election.  The present Minister of Industry was quoted at 
that time as saying that he would “work as hard and as smart” 
as he could to bring sewage treatment to the region, 
appropriately so, as we also have the Minister of the Environment 
in the government—again I am paraphrasing but reflecting the 
positions he has taken—on the record, recognizing that the lack 
of sewage treatment is a serious threat to the sustainability of 
coastal communities, affecting human health, constraining 
economic development and compromising ecosystem integrity through 
the release of toxic substances into freshwater and marine 
ecosystems.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>He should also be working as hard and as smart as one of his 
other fellow ministers, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans who 
went further than the Minister of the Environment in his 
threatened legal action against those poisoning the waters of the 
Atlantic by the discharge of raw sewage.  I am talking about the 
city of St. John's which the fisheries minister is to sue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>After all the work that has been done and the history in terms 
of the amount of pollutants being released into the water in that 
area, we still have no involvement of any consequence by the 
federal government.  It is important to recognize the amount of 
work that has been done by both the province and the municipality 
in terms of their one-third shares.  They have to be acknowledged 
in that regard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the legislature of Newfoundland yesterday Mr. Harris, a 
member of the New Democratic Party in that house, asked the 
premier what was happening in terms of the cleanup of St. John's 
harbour.  Basically he received this response: 
<UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unfortunately, I do have to report that we have no definite 
commitment from the Government of Canada yet with respect to 
their one-third share.  We have made a firm request, repeatedly, 
that they participate with a special fund, and a separate fund, 
for an initiative as important as the clean up of the St. John's 
harbour. 
</UL>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then he indicated they would continue to do that and were 
expecting at some point that the federal government would come 
through.  He went on to acknowledge the comment that Mr. Harris 
had made earlier about the fact that the provincial government 
and the municipality involved had committed their one-third 
shares.  Yet there has been no action by the federal government. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I come back to where we were today in the debate on water and 
the motion we passed earlier in support of setting national 
standards.  It is typical of the federal government that it is 
willing to support that type of motion but when confronted with 
the reality of the necessary action we see no response. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have the municipality kicking in its $31 million.  The 
provincial government in Newfoundland is kicking in its $31 
million.  They are prepared to do so and ready to go.  They even 
have a design of the plant and the piping required to make the 
system work appropriately and safely for the protection of the 
environment and the health of the people of St. John's. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have done all that work and the only missing piece is a 
commitment from the federal government.  They still do not see 
it.  If the federal government were serious when it supported the 
motion that was passed earlier, it would act when an occasion 
like this one comes forward.  We are in strong support of the 
motion and of the needed action and would vote accordingly.

the hon. member for St. John's East respecting the proposed St. 
John's harbour cleanup. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It always behoves me to remind the hon. member for St. John's

Newfoundland and Labrador.

some time.  I would have liked to have as well included in this 
motion in terms of its context and wording a more all inclusive, 
a more encompassing debate and a more encompassing discussion 
written right into the text of the motion itself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This being a debate, we are allowed to go the full gambit of 
basically how it will proceed.  I would like to provide some 
discussion about priorities and about expanding the mandate.  The 
House engaged in a discussion just this afternoon about 
priorities.  This is an opposition day on which we discussed at 
length the need for national regulation on clean, clear drinking 
water as a priority matter.  It was put forward by the 
Conservative caucus, by the Conservative Party as the priority. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If we look at the recent round of infrastructure programs put 
forward in my home province of Newfoundland and Labrador, we did 
respond to what our people, the people of Newfoundland and 
Labrador, said were their priorities, as would be noted by the 
hon. member from the Conservative caucus.  We invested literally 
tens of millions of dollars into clean, clear drinking water in 
communities and as a matter of fact in rural communities.  This 
is something of which I am very proud and has to be explored. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On the issue of harbour cleanup, the hon. member has put forward 
that the municipality of St. John's has put up $31 million.  The 
rubber is ready to hit the road.  The pedal is ready to be put to 
the metal.  The province has also put up $31 million.  A total 
$62 million is committed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to pose a question.  Is it possible with $62 
million already sourced that the project could now begin?  Given 
the fact that it probably would be initiated over a 10 year 
period, an extended period of time, that the commitment is 
genuine and real and that the need is there, which I think the 
hon. member opposite has proven quite effectively, could the $62 
million be put into play immediately? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We determine our priorities and our commitments and put forward 
money for municipal infrastructure that provide for clean, clear 
water.  We put money forward for municipal sewer systems in rural 
communities.  If St. John's harbour cleanup is the priority, as 
the hon. member says, and I agree with him, we have an 
opportunity to put $62 million in play, not tomorrow, but today, 
right now, on the floor of the House if the hon. member consents.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Brian Pallister (Portage—Lisgar, Canadian Alliance):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, it is a pleasure to rise in the inadequate time that 
I have been given to address this very important issue.  I offer 
my support and congratulations to the member for raising the 
issue in the House.  I would also like to pay some deserved 
tribute to the mayor of St. John's for his continued efforts on 
behalf of the constituents that he shares with the member. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is an issue which has been treated in an excessively 
partisan way by the government opposite in that during the 
federal election campaign it made eminently clear to the people 
of St. John's when the industry minister travelled there that the 
project was one he supported.  That was borne out by the fact 
that as premier of Newfoundland he supported the project himself. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>During the federal election he went further than that and 
encouraged the people of St. John's to vote for the Liberal 
candidates, arguing that would give him allies and encourage him 
in his ability to generate funding support for the project.  That 
is where we step over the line.  That is when we make 
partisanship blatant.  When we do that we remove any credibility 
to argue that fairness is the basis upon which funds are 
allocated for projects such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This does not need to be a partisan issue.  This is an issue of 
a dirty harbour that needs to be cleaned up.  I know the member 
opposite would agree that is the issue we should be talking 
about.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I raised a simple question in the House with the environment 
minister in question period.  I asked him why he would tell the 
mayor of St. John's that there were no funds available from his 
department and subsequent to that announce that funds were 
available for a project in his own riding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I thought it was a very fair and reasonable question.  An 
opportunity was provided for him to respond.  All he did was 
launch into personal attacks about me.  That was not fruitful. It 
did not lend any credibility to the government's rationale for 
its criteria and priorities on issues such as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Opportunity was provided today for both ministers to rise in 
their places to participate in the debates by saying what are 
their priorities and how they determine the criteria for 
allocating funds to these kinds of projects.  Rather they give 
the mayor of St. John's the runaround and waste his valuable 
time.  As hard as he wants to work for the people of St. John's 
he would like to have a partner in the federal government.  I can 
understand that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only one taxpayer out there.  We have heard many times 
that one taxpayer pays provincial tax, municipal tax and federal 
tax.  One taxpayer expects to get services from government.  It 
is a shame when government seems to insist on being partisan to 
an excessive degree and interfering with the basic co-operative 
approaches that should be taken on infrastructure projects such 
as this one. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That is what we are seeing with this project.  We are seeing a 
willingness to put partisan self-interest ahead of fairness.  It 
is clearly evident.  The Liberal candidate in St. John's East was 
asked on the night of the election whether St. John's would be 
punished by its refusal to send Liberals to the House of Commons. 
His answer was that it had nothing to do with punishment but with 
reality. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If that is the reality of government members opposite, they 
should stand and be honest about it.  If this is about 
partisanship and rewarding ridings that vote Liberal, the 
government should say so.  It seems clearly evident that is the 
case.  That is most unfortunate, because the project is deserving 
of support.  I stand in support of the member and encourage the 
government to take action on this resolution so it can go 
forward. 
<P><A NAME="LINK268"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Norman Doyle (St. John's East, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
thank all of my colleagues for their submissions on this very 
important issue.  I thank the Alliance members, the NDP members, 
the Bloc members, members of the backbench and the Liberal caucus 
for their remarks as well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is too bad that we have to come to the House of Commons to 
make a case for a project that is very basic and vital to the 
development of one of North America's oldest and most beautiful 
cities.   However we have to come here because of the inaction of 
government.  We have to come here because politicians make 
promises during election campaigns that they have absolutely no 
intention of ever keeping. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is getting all too common that this type of politics is 
infiltrating the country.  People stand and make promises.  They 
have no intention of ever keeping them.  They want to get through 
a couple of weeks or months in an election campaign.  They hope 
the public will have a very short memory and that it will all go 
away. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The public does not forget.  We cannot let the industry minister 
forget the promises he has made to the people in St. John's to 
get this project moving.  This project deserves to be moved 
along.  Some 120 million litres of raw sewage a day is going into 
one of the most beautiful harbours in the world.  If we do the 
mathematics, 43 billion litres of raw sewage per year go into St. 
John's harbour.  Is it any wonder that in 1994 the environmental 
watchdog, the Sierra club, gave this project an F and in 1999 
downgraded it even further to an F-minus?  I do not know how much 
further it can go than that.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to make a comment about the Parliamentary Secretary to 
the Minister of Industry who came here with a prepared text 
today.  I am really surprised that he did not even run the 
remarks by his boss before he came here, saying that we could 
take advantage of the Canada-Newfoundland infrastructure program 
to fund the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is only $50 million from the federal government over a 
five year period.  There are hundreds of small municipalities for 
that $50 million over five years or $10 million a year.  The 
Minister of Industry himself has indicated that we cannot apply 
under that program to have St. John's harbour cleaned up.  It has 
to be a separate side agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let me say to the other Newfoundland member, the member for 
Humber—St. Barbe—Baie Verte, who said that since we have $60 
million committed to it now why would we not proceed.  We cannot 
proceed.  There is an agreement involving the municipalities of 
Mount Pearl, Paradise, St. John's and the provincial government 
and it cannot kick in until the federal government comes up with 
its share of the funding. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is conceivable to say that the project will never move ahead 
unless the federal government comes up with its share of the 
money for the project. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to compliment the people who do so much work on this from 
year to year and who do not get discouraged.  The city of St. 
John's has been working very hard on it, along with the mayor. 
There are the ACAP people who put their backs into it on a daily 
basis as well and try to keep it in the public eye.  They are the 
people we should be complimenting for the work they have put into 
it, not the politicians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>If the Minister of Industry has any feeling that getting the 
money would somehow give some credit to me or the member of the 
Alliance or NDP for the very limited submissions we have made, he 
can forget about it.  That is not the case at all.   Making money 
available for this project would be saying thanks to the people 
who have made such a difference, people like the mayor of the 
city of St. John's, the people on the St. John's city council and 
the ACAP people.  They are the people who deserve the real credit 
for the effort that has gone into this so far. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I sincerely hope that the Minister of Industry is back in his 
office somewhere listening to this and will take it into account, 
into consideration, step up to the plate and make money available 
for what is a very good project.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Libby Davies (Vancouver East, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome the opportunity to again rise in the House of Commons to 
speak to an issue of utmost urgency concerning the people of east 
Vancouver. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On several occasions in the past two months alone, including 
today, I have pressed the government on its lacklustre response 
on the health crisis of drug use, overdoses and safety.  In fact, 
for four years I have been raising this and will keep on until I 
am satisfied that the federal government and the Minister of 
Health are doing all that can be done to save lives, improve the 
health and safety of my community and stop the criminalization of 
injection drug users who are dying at an alarming rate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are now so many expert reports, including that from the 
city of Vancouver, that it boggles the mind that leadership and 
action are so slow to follow.  One of the most recent studies 
shows that female drug users are twice as likely to be infected 
with HIV-AIDS as men.  This is the first time that this has 
happened in the developed world. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since 1997 I have been pushing for a comprehensive strategy.  I 
have called on the Minister of Health to adopt multicentre heroin 
prescription trials, safe injection sites, better housing and 
social support to users.  All of these things will significantly 
improve the health of injection drug users as well as safety in 
the community.  It will also reduce crime.  If there is any doubt 
about this we have only to look to Europe to see the success of 
such an approach.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>I do want to acknowledge that the federal government has 
provided some response.  I am glad that the minister has 
responded to some of the concerns and has provided support for 
drug users, for example, by supporting the drug resource centre 
which unfortunately has yet to open.  It has been mired in 
development permits and appeals in the city of Vancouver.  Also, 
there is now talk of a feasibility study on clinical trials for 
drug maintenance.  In my several meetings with the minister, I 
have always found him to be knowledgeable and sympathetic. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Up to now the RCMP has been opposed to safe injection sites and 
clinical trials for drug maintenance.  Therefore it is very 
significant that the chief superintendent of the RCMP's drug 
enforcement program is now saying that the government should 
consider safe injection sites.  This is a significant development 
and cannot be ignored, but it would require federal approval from 
the Minister of Health. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to say to the government today, for heaven's sake, let us 
get on with it now.  I ask the government to be courageous and 
listen to what its own experts are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Australia the first legal heroin injection room opened a few 
days ago.  Canada can be next.  Canada can and must move on this 
issue.  We can prevent needless deaths.  We can prevent crime, 
which causes so much distress in my community and other 
communities across the country.  We can stem the flow of wasted 
resources in law enforcement and judicial systems.  We can change 
Canada's drug laws, which are badly in need of reform.  What it 
takes is political will. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I ask the Minister of Health to stand tall, to be resolved to 
take this issue on and to listen to what his own experts are 
saying.

raised by the member for Vancouver East regarding clinical trials 
to assess the effectiveness of heroin in treating heroin 
addiction and HIV/AIDS in injection drug users. 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mayor Owen has met with Health Canada to discuss Canada's drug 
strategy and continued collaboration between Health Canada and 
the city of Vancouver.  Health Canada is also a formal partner 
with the city of Vancouver and the province of British Columbia 
on the Vancouver agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Mayor Owen's report on the injection drug use situation goes 
beyond any one initiative.  A comprehensive response is required 
and the issue goes far beyond Health Canada.  I am pleased to 
report that federal and provincial-territorial officials 
representing issues related to drugs, AIDS, hepatitis C, 
corrections, enforcement, justice, aboriginal peoples and 
population health have been working together to develop 
strategies to reduce the harm associated with injection drug use 
in Canada. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With regard to HIV/AIDS infection rates, the study results 
mentioned by the member in her original questions were 
preliminary. Health Canada takes into account the vulnerability 
of community members with a higher risk of infection, by working 
with other federal departments and public administrations within 
the framework of what is known as the Vancouver agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With this in mind, Health Canada has just funded two projects in 
Vancouver downtown east side. One deals with alternate ways of 
providing counselling and education in order to help women get 
off the streets. The other targets the network of drug users in 
Vancouver and is aimed at providing advice and services to drug 
addicts.

preceded me and I appreciate that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am here tonight in relation to a question regarding Lancaster 
Aviation which I have asked the Minister of National Defence on a 
number of occasions. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1910"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT105"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT105"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1910

<A HREF="#LINKT104"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lancaster Aviation, for the benefit of the general public and 
those who are interested, was awarded a contract by the federal 
government in 1997 to sell surplus military equipment spare 
parts.  The concern is that the spare parts contract grew to 
include, without a tender process, 10 Challenger jets and 40 
helicopters, far exceeding the original contract. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>How could a company such as Lancaster Aviation go from selling 
spare parts to selling 10 Challenger aircraft and 40 helicopters? 
It is very obvious.  There was an escape clause in the contract 
that allowed the government to do this.  I guess it did it to 
reward its friends, if it wished. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of concerns on this file, one of them being 
that the Challenger aircraft, which were Government of Canada 
aircraft, were sold on the international market by a company 
called Lancaster for less than 50% of their value.  The 
helicopters were sold in the same fashion.  How is something like 
that allowed to happen? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then we found out that Lancaster Aviation closed its doors in 
Milton, Ontario.  It took the equipment, up to $70 million worth 
of Canadian goods owned by the Government of Canada, and housed 
it in Florida in a warehouse owned by a convicted felon who is 
under contract with Lancaster Aviation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our concern is how and why those spare parts were allowed to 
leave Canada.  Lancaster Aviation closed up its operations, 
closed its warehouse in Canada, only to move goods owned by the 
Government of Canada across the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Incidentally, the individual has not yet been sentenced, but he 
is up on money laundering charges and on leading an international 
prostitution ring.  We do not consider the individual to be a 
good corporate citizen. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question to the parliamentary secretary is simple.  Why would 
the Government of Canada allow this to happen?  What security do 
we have on the assets now lying in a warehouse in Florida owned 
by a convicted felon who is awaiting sentencing?  The laundered 
money was through the selling of drugs.  What happens to his 
assets?  What happens to the contractual agreement between 
Lancaster Aviation and the individual in Florida?  How much at 
risk are the parts owned by the Government of Canada? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have a second part to my question.  When did the Government of 
Canada realize that its goods were stored in a warehouse owned by 
a convicted felon?  When did the minister know, how much did he 
know, and what action is the government taking today to secure 
the assets owned by the people of Canada and in a warehouse in 
Florida?

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Paul Szabo (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of Public 
Works and Government Services, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to respond to the erroneous statements made by the hon. 
member tonight. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government has had a competitive arrangement in place with 
Lancaster Aviation since 1997 for the disposal of surplus 
aerospace assets, not just spare parts as the hon. member has 
said. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The solicitation process was a rigorous one.  It made sure that 
the successful bidder met three criteria: first, that it had the 
knowledge to sell such assets; second, that it could market the 
assets worldwide; and, third, that it could achieve the best 
return for taxpayers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The contract was competed for in June 2000 and Lancaster 
Aviation was the successful bidder.  How could the hon. member 
refer to it as an escape clause to help friends when it is the 
same company that won the competition?

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Allegations that the contractor disposed of Twin Huey 
helicopters and the Challenger aircraft were sole sourced are 
false.  It was a competitive process.  The 1997 RFP contemplated 
special projects such as the sale of the planes.  When such a 
need arises the process calls for an amendment to the contract to 
legally bind the parties.  That is what we did with the sale of 
the Twin Huey helicopters and the Challenger aircraft. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I want to assure the House that the sale of the surplus aircraft 
was conducted to the letter of the law and in the interest of the 
Canadian taxpayers.  Lancaster was paid a fair commission, as per 
the terms of its contract.  It had an incentive to sell the 
aircraft at the highest possible selling price. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Lancaster Aviation has warehoused these assets in Florida and 
that is true.  They are not owned by a convicted felon.  They are 
owned by Air Spares Inc., a company in Florida.  The member 
should know that the assets are in Florida because that is where 
the market is.  Lancaster Aviation is using a facility in Florida 
strictly for warehouse purposes.  It remains solely responsible 
for the marketing and sale of those assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The assets are not in danger.  They are the property of DND. 
They are only in the custody of that contractor.  No parties 
other than the crown have any right to those assets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>With those facts, clearly the member has presented to the House 
a set of erroneous statements and facts, which he should know 
better.
