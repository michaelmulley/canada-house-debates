ACT</A></H3>
	The House resumed from April 26 consideration of the motion 
that Bill C-22, an act respecting certain agreements concerning 
the redevelopment and operation of terminals 1 and 2 at Lester 
B. Pearson International airport, be read the second time and 
referred to a committee; and of the amendment; and of the 
amendment to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. John Williams (St. Albert):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak 
on Bill C-22 which is the Liberal government response to the 
Pearson airport fiasco it inherited from the previous 
government.
<P>
	We all know that over the last number of years the previous 
government tried to address itself to the cost and administration 
of regional airports in this country. One of the things it tried to 
do was follow through on a different policy regarding its budget 
management by setting up local airport authorities and 
quasi-independent authorities.
<P>
	The administration and financing of airports were moved off 
the government's balance sheet and therefore away from the 
government's deficit. This allowed these independent 
authorities to borrow on their own although the loans were 
guaranteed by the federal government. Because the federal 
government guarantees a loan it allows them to avoid bringing 
forth documents to show that the budget would have been that 
much larger, yet the amount of money borrowed by the 
government and its institutions would nonetheless remain the 
same.
<P>
	This was part of the smoke and mirrors used by the previous 
government to deceive the Canadian public as to the true 
situation of this country's finances. The previous government 
should be ashamed of that approach. Of course the election 
showed that Canadians had lost complete faith in its approach to 
the situation.
<P>
	Because of the magnitude of Pearson airport and because it 
was the only profitable airport in the country, the Conservatives 
decided they would take a different approach. They entered into 
negotiations which were behind the scenes and not public tender 
to lease, sell and give away property belonging to the taxpayers.
<P>
	It seems ironic they would choose their friends and those of 
other political parties to come forth and negotiate with the 
government behind the scenes. The agreement would allow 
them to take charge of one of the prime federal assets in this 
country, hundreds of acres of property close to downtown 
Toronto. They would have a sweetheart lease on it for many 
years which guaranteed them income, all at the taxpayers' 
expense.
<P>
	When the situation blew up in their faces during the last 
election this government decided it was time to do something 
about it and said to stop the deal from going forward. Of course 
the government did not heed the cries and concerns of the 
electorate and the last government in its dying days signed a 
deal.
<P>
	Now we have the present government's response to that in Bill 
C-22. It is going to kill the deal signed by the former federal 
government. It was a sad day for Canada, for government and for 
administration in this country when the previous government 
entered into the contract. However, it is an equally sad day when 
the government presents Bill C-22 in which it is going to use its 
force and power to override a signed agreement.
<P>
	The phrase force majeure means if someone of a higher 
authority exerts their power to kill a legitimate transaction that 
is already in agreement, it is perfectly acceptable in law. But 
when the federal government enters into a transaction with the 
private sector and then changes its mind, no one in the private 
sector can do that without recourse. Nonetheless the federal 
government has used its power, the ultimate power in this 
country, to cancel the agreement which has already been signed.
<P>
<B>(1010 ) </B>
<P>
	Our position in the Reform Party is that we do not like the bill. 
It gives compensation to some people who knew that the 
Canadian taxpayer disagreed and knew the Canadian taxpayer 
was being taken to the cleaners in this situation. We do not like 
the bill because the minister, in the sum of millions of dollars to 
be determined, is going to compensate them for the costs they 
incurred in the negotiations on this contract. They knew it was 
contrary to public policy and contrary to the desires and benefits 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3692"> 3692 </A></B>
<P>
of the Canadian taxpayer. Now they feel they are entitled  to 
compensation because they entered into that type of a 
negotiation.
<P>
	The taxpayer is being taken to the cleaners. The Canadian 
taxpayer is being insulted by this bill. In our opinion the people 
on the other side should not be entitled to any compensation 
whatsoever. They knew when they signed the contract there was 
a very good chance if the Liberals won the election that the 
contract would be gone. For them to wait another week or two 
for the outcome of the election would have prevented them from 
being in a position to claim any money from the government 
whatsoever.
<P>
	Therefore, being responsible to the taxpayers and being 
concerned about taxpayers' money, our position is that this bill 
should be defeated and voted down. No compensation 
whatsoever should be paid to the group that signed the lease.
<P>
	I mentioned on a wider topic that the whole local airport 
authority concept as it was envisaged by the previous 
government was an attempt to move some borrowing off the 
balance sheet and off the budget. We disagree with that as well. 
The Auditor General has looked at these situations over the past 
number of years. He has been quite critical of the way the 
government has approached the method of financing and 
administration of the airports.
<P>
	It is time this government that is so new in its mandate 
decided to review the whole area of administration and 
financing of this country's airports. It should develop a clear, 
concise policy to ensure this type of boondoggle does not 
happen again, to ensure that the taxpayers are respected and that 
their money is spent wisely and fairly for the benefit of all 
Canadians in the transfer of people moving around in this 
country.
<P>
	That is the position of the Reform Party. I hope that the 
government will take that into serious consideration and if this 
bill does go forward, when it comes time to negotiate with the 
other parties that the amount is kept if not to nil, to an absolute 
minimum.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Paul Crête (Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, the bill before the House today has a very evocative 
title: the Pearson International airport Agreements Act.
<P>
	Pearson airport has become a symbol of all the old partisan 
practices and the more or less above-board lobbying that goes 
on in a parliamentary system when elected representatives do 
not have sufficient control.
<P>
	It is also a test of the present Liberal governement's approach 
to such practices. I agree that they inherited a deal that had been 
``negotiated'' by the Conservatives, but it seems that, although 
Prime Ministers have changed, their friends remain the same. 
On the list of lobbyists who were involved in this deal, we find 
as many friends or contributors on both the Liberal and what 
used to be the Conservative side.
<P>
	The point I would like to make this morning is that we often 
try to rationalize the lack of development in the regions by 
pointing to a lack of initiative in these regions or similar 
arguments.
<P>
<B>(1015) </B>
<P>
	I would like to say that perhaps the real reason is that these 
regions are not part of the more or less legal, sometimes 
``shady'' networks of lobbyists. As a joke, I said to one of my 
colleagues: I wish there was a bill on certain agreements 
concerning the development of eastern Quebec. This might give 
us some insight into why our projects, which are prepared by 
development agencies, local contractors and regional 
authorities acting in good faith, or even by citizens groups, are 
seldom successful in attacking the dollars they need.
<P>
	In other words, spending $250,000 in my region has always 
seemed more complicated than spending $250,000 on the 
Pearson airport deal, where $250,000 is a drop in the bucket 
compared to what will be paid just to the lobbyists, for instance.
<P>
	So what we have here is a double standard. In the case of 
Pearson airport, the big bucks network makes sure everyone 
around those who set up this deal gets their share.
<P>
	We would have liked to see this bill specify exactly what form 
of compensation, if any, will be provided for a given part of the 
contract and how it will be awarded, so that there is an open 
process.
<P>
	One might also ask how we got into this mess. What is it in our 
system that lets people who are not elected have more clout than 
those who are? When we look at the list of people involved in the 
Pearson deal, those who lobby the government for a decision, 
why do we see so few elected representatives and so many what I 
would call powers behind the throne?
<P>
	I think we have a system that has lost control over the way it 
operates, and I heard the same comment from voters during the 
election campaign. It does't take a genius to see that, in our 
current federal political system, there is a lot of waste, a lot of 
money going down the drain. So why is this happening?  Of 
course we should always allow for some margin of error in the 
way we do things, but there is no excuse for this kind of 
behaviour, and I think that the Liberal government which was 
elected on a promise of transparency will be judged on how it 
settles the Pearson question. As I see it, what is in this billfalls very wide of the mark and there is certainly a lack of 
transparency.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3693"> 3693 </A></B>
<P>
	What the government proposes is a bill with a kind of 
fragmented authority, a bill so full of holes that all parties can 
get what they want out of it. Another reason why this kind of 
arrangement was tabled is the fact that the political parties 
which have formed of government in Canada since this 
country's inception were always financed, more or less openly, 
by people who do not vote. By this I mean companies, unions 
and other organizations which, in the final analysis, do not vote 
and thus do not give a mandate to our elected representatives. In 
this connection, I would like to mention the public financing bill 
in Quebec, which has caused a significant shift in the behaviour 
and authority of elected representatives and lobbyists.
<P>
	In Quebec, and the same applies to the Bloc as far as party 
financing is concerned, the only lobbyists who can influence us 
are people who contributed to our fundraising campaign as 
citizens and individuals.
<P>
<B>(1020) </B>
<P>
	In the case of federal parties, and this applies to the current 
government in particular, funding is provided by these very 
same people who, merely by changing hats, become lobbyists. 
They sign on to lobby for a given company, thereby placing the 
government in a very difficult situation. It can hardly say no to 
someone who, more as a corporate citizen than as an individual, 
has made a major financial contribution.
<P>
	Next week, we will likely proceed to debate a motion on the 
funding of political parties. I find it totally logical that this 
motion was introduced by the member for Richelieu and that it 
ties in with the debate on Pearson airport. I think the government 
should take a lesson from the opposition in the case of Pearson, 
take a good hard look at its motives and determine how, in 
future, it can avoid a recurrence of situations such as this.
<P>
	Regarding the sub-amendment moved by the Reform Party, 
my initial impression was that it was a technical amendment. 
However, on further consideration, since it adds the words ``in 
Canada'', it reflects more accurately the Canadian reality.
<P>
	Why has Ontario always benefitted more from economic 
development in Canada? Is it because there are more 
entrepreneurs or more leadership in this province? I do not 
believe this is the reason. I think it is a question of networks and 
of contacts people have with political parties. In this respect, the 
Reform Party's sub-amendment is interesting because it proves 
to us that, in Canada, some people are more equal than others.
<P>
	We want the government to take this principle of equality to 
heart either by amending or withdrawing the bill respecting 
certain agreements concerning Pearson International airport. In 
its place, we would like the government to introduce a bill 
entitled an Act respecting the Pearson airport agreement. This 
bill would shed light once and for all on whether friends of the 
government benefitted from this agreement. It would also give 
us an  indication of whether in future the Liberals intend to take 
a different course of action.
<P>
	Considering that, during the election campaign, a $1,000, 
$2,000 or $3,000 a plate dinner was held-I am not sure exactly 
which it was-this could be viewed as a warning sign of the 
direction which the government intends to take. In my view, it is 
important that a clear signal now be sent out that, in Canada and 
in Quebec, it is possible to have development issues addressed 
without having to resort to parallel circuits. What matters 
should be the relevance of the project, not whether a company is 
an influential friend of the government.
<P>
	In this respect, it is important that all Canadians be made fully 
aware of the situation and that this debate uncover the whole 
truth about this transaction. All aspects of the deal must be fully 
explored.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Val Meredith (Surrey-White Rock-South Langley):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, having read through the Nixon report and 
previewed statements made by the Minister of Transport and 
other government members, it is very clear to me that the 
government and the leader of the Liberal Party were wise in 
raising concerns during the election about this agreement that 
was struck between the previous government and the Pearson 
airport authority.
<P>
	It brings to mind how this deal came about. It was signed 
October 7 in the middle of a general election. When the deal was 
signed it was made very clear by the Leader of the Opposition, 
who it was evident was going to be the next Prime Minister, that 
when he became Prime Minister the deal would be reviewed and 
perhaps rescinded. The people who came together and invested 
in the Toronto Pearson deal knew in advance that it was a risky 
venture. They knew at that time there was a very real possibility 
that the deal would be struck down. We applaud the 
government's decision to revoke this agreement by bringing 
forward Bill C-22. I quote the minister on the reasons why he 
felt the need to revoke this deal: ``The deal was surrounded by a 
reliance on lobbyists, by backroom dealings, by the 
manipulation of bona fide private sector investors and the lack 
of respect for the impartiality of public servants''.
<P>
<B>(1025) </B>
<P>
	We can appreciate the reasons why the minister made this 
move, why the government made this decision. It causes me 
concern and it causes the Reform Party concern that anyone 
would expect to get reimbursed for having put together a 
proposal for government to consider, and for any out of pocket 
costs that it might have incurred after submitting the tender.
<P>
	It causes me concern that the government is asking the House 
to give it a blank cheque to compensate for out of pocket 
expenses those investors when the investors knew it was very 
risky in the first place. My experience with government 
contracts and tenders is that a cost is involved in preparing 
documentation for a proposed  contract, and that for all those 
many people who put proposals forward before government, 
they 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3694"> 3694 </A></B>
<P>
never get reimbursed for the expenses incurred in putting the 
proposal together.
<P>
	I am concerned in this instance that we have a clause in the bill 
that allows for compensation to be paid. We have to continually 
remember the date that this contract was signed, which was 
October 7, in the middle of a general election. Is consideration 
being given for out of pocket expenses prior to that date or are 
we talking about after October 7, after the contract was actually 
signed? It is very important that the government remember that 
companies making a proposal for government do so at their own 
risk and at their own expense. They should not be compensated.
<P>
	I would suggest that anybody who was made well aware by the 
media and by the statements of the soon to be Prime Minister 
that the investment was very risky, going ahead and spending 
more money after October 7 did so at his or her own peril.
<P>
	This government, if it is truly committed to rejecting the 
previous government's way of doing business, the Tory way of 
doing business, will send a loud and clear message today that if 
you involve yourself in a questionable arrangement with a 
government in the dying hours of its mandate, you do so at your 
own peril. If the government wants to show this group and others 
in the lobbying business that it was wrong and that government 
has to take a firm stand, half measures will not do. I would like 
to suggest to the government that it take out any concept of 
reimbursing the private sector for doing business with the 
government.
<P>
	The minister went on to say that the Minister of Transport 
may, with the governor in council, approve appropriate 
payments to the partnership for its out of pocket expenses. I 
mentioned before that it sounds like a blank cheque. We have no 
idea what these out of pocket expenses might be. It is definitely 
going to be in the millions of dollars. I do not think that 
Canadian taxpayers owe anything to a group of investors that got 
involved in a risky venture at best.
<P>
	Canadians want their government to reject the type of 
patronage that was shown in this instance. If it pays this group, it 
is completely undermining the message that it is trying to send 
to Canadians. I do not think this bill should provide a 
consolation prize.
<P>
	When one gets into the discussion of the appropriate place for 
government to be, there are other options of how government 
can remove itself from direct control of airport operations. It has 
done so successfully in the Vancouver International airport, the 
Edmonton International airport, the Calgary International 
airport and Montreal by establishing local airport authorities, 
non-profit organizations, with the ability to provide the service 
that Canadians expect with no consideration for making money 
for themselves.
<P>
<B>(1030) </B>
<P>
	Although I am not an expert in civil aviation, I am a frequent 
customer of the Vancouver airport. It is not because I want to be, 
it is because I have to be. From a consumer's point of view I am 
really quite impressed with what the private sector is doing at 
that airport.
<P>
	The Vancouver airport is the second largest airport in Canada. 
It is undergoing major expansion. A second main runway is 
being built. The terminal is being greatly enlarged. The local 
authority there is planning ahead to capitalize on the ever 
increasing Pacific rim market. While this expansion is actually 
taking place, the Vancouver International airport appears to be 
running smoother than ever before.
<P>
	The services in the existing terminal are better and more 
accessible than they were in the past. Despite some early 
objections to the airport improvement fee, which is payable by 
everybody using the airport, it is being used for expansion of the 
airport.
<P>
	Canadians are quite prepared to see a user pay system come 
into play so that the people who are actually using the services 
are the ones who are paying for it, not the general taxpayer who 
if ever or very seldom uses the airports under consideration.
<P>
	The airports have to provide a service but it is best left in the 
hands of the private sector. The government has to consider this 
as an option when it is finished with the contract for the Pearson 
airport. The government has to remember what the role of 
government should be in the operation of an airport. I feel the 
government's role is to ensure that the flying public has a safe, 
affordable and convenient means of travel. It is not to make 
profits or have politics as a priority.
<P>
	The non-profit airport authorities appear to be a good way to 
ensure that public interest comes first and that the service is 
there for the public.
<P>
	If the previous government had taken this approach we would 
not be in this mess with Bill C-22. If the current government 
wants to avoid problems in the future it should do two things. 
First, it should scrap any payments to the Pearson Development 
Corporation and second, it should carefully examine the 
effectiveness of a non-profit authority running Pearson 
International airport.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate this opportunity to rise today on Bill C-22 tabled by 
the Minister of Transport, a bill that cancels the agreements to 
privatize Pearson airport. This whole affair can certainly not be 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3695"> 3695 </A></B>
<P>
held up as an example to follow. It is to me-and to the majority 
of Canadians, I am sure-a total mess in all respects. A mess 
founded on blatant patronage on an unprecedented scale.
<P>
	It is an enormous cloud behind which the players, who are 
certainly no angels, worked to reach their goal: get their hands 
on the No. 1 airport in Canada, a profitable and promotable 
facility, under certain terms of the agreement.
<P>
	I think this case could be described as anything but 
transparent and open. Every step is surrounded by very troubling 
facts. The way this case was handled is no way to promote the 
role and image of governments and elected representatives.
<P>
	The Pearson agreement, signed in the midst of the election 
campaign and whose cancellation was announced by the Prime 
Minister on December 3, requires a thorough examination. This 
whole affair must be cleared up quickly and in broad daylight.
<P>
<B>(1035) </B>
<P>
	This was not done by the Nixon report, which was conducted 
in private-again, demonstrating a lack of transparency and 
openness, and which the Prime Minister commissioned and used 
as a basis to cancel the agreements. Instead of Nixon's quick and 
superficial look, people want an in-depth public enquiry to 
really determine the facts surrounding the negotiations on the 
agreement, in particular whether the firms involved should be 
compensated. I remind the government that several members 
from the Toronto region have demanded such a public enquiry. I 
hope that the little they got, namely the Nixon report, will lead 
them to continue to press their case. Let us hope that their 
party's gag order will not turn them into sheep.
<P>
	Commissioning the Nixon report shows a real lack of will and 
courage. They wanted to look at this case and keep it under 
covers. The Liberals, led by the Prime Minister, preferred not to 
make waves to avoid splashing anyone. However, many 
questions remain unanswered. People have a right to know every 
detail of this case.
<P>
	In this affair, decision makers were surrounded by many 
people called lobbyists. As we all know, especially the ministers 
opposite, various groups call on lobbyists to defend their 
specific and well defined interests. These lobbyists, that the law 
divides into two classes: professionals and employees, haunt 
lobbies, pay visits to decision makers, and communicate with 
public officials and ministers to influence their decisions.
<P>
	In the airport case, it is clear that lobbyists played a crucial if 
not predominant role. At every step of the way, including the 
Nixon report, the close links between the players produced 
results. If we look at the parties involved, it is easy to establish 
close connections between them and the decision maker; we can 
even picture a big spider web where everyone got caught in the 
end. Conservatives and Liberals found themselves mixed up in 
this case. Former ministers, organizers and chiefs of staff, and 
old friends of the old parties, they all worked together. They 
used their knowledge of the system, the people and the situation 
to influence decision makers to their advantage or that of their 
clients.
<P>
	One wonders whether these people are not more influential 
now than when they used to work right in political circles. They 
have the financial resources they need to achieve well defined 
objectives.
<P>
	Faced with all this systematic and well-organized influence, 
we must question our governments' decision-making process 
and wonder if our political system and its supporters are preyed 
on by lobbyists. Are our decision makers independent? Do they 
make allowances? Are they vulnerable to all this pressure? Do 
they keep a good measure of realism?
<P>
	There is no getting around it: the causes worked on and 
promoted by lobbyists are mainly economic and financial. 
Lobbyists are paid by big business and, in the end, they exist to 
make a profit. According to the annual report on the Lobbyists 
Registration Act, the most popular issues are: international 
trade, industry, regional economic development, government 
contracts and, in fifth place, science and technology. All these 
issues are strictly economic in nature.
<P>
	The first social issue listed in this report comes in 40th place. 
Youth issues, 40th place; housing, an issue I deeply care about, 
41st place; women's issues, 42nd place; seniors, 43rd place; and 
in 52nd and last place, human rights.
<P>
	There is no doubt that lobbyists try to influence decision 
makers on profit-related economic issues. Social and 
humanitarian causes lag far behind and stay on the back burner.
<P>
<B>(1040) </B>
<P>
	The results are obvious and denounced more and more. 
Everyday reality is the best proof. Poverty which is becoming 
more entrenched and the unmet basic needs of a growing number 
of individuals and households clearly show that the decision 
makers have given up social causes.
<P>
	Nevertheless, many organizations work in the community and 
demand thorough changes. Are they heeded? Their power is 
very small compared to that of big corporations and industries. 
Nor do they have the same means to exert influence. The big 
shots have dollars and the little people have cents. The big shots 
know many friends in high places, and the little people know 
little people.
<P>
	For some, it is cocktails, business dinners and fancy meetings. 
Others have to march in the street, occupy offices and hold hasty 
meetings with decision makers so that these officials can have a 
good conscience and get rid of the few reporters who are 
interested.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3696"> 3696 </A></B>
<P>
	The effects are there. The evidence is quite clear. 
Governments are disconnected from the grass roots and have 
been for a long time. Considering all the clout wielded by 
lobbyists and large political contributors, there is very little 
room left for ordinary people.
<P>
	Seniors' groups, associations of the unemployed, community 
groups, housing committees, women's shelters, day care 
centres-none of these gives thousands of dollars to the old 
parties.
<P>
	The Liberals are caught in this system of lobbying and large 
donors. The Martin budget is a perfect illustration of this. The 
lower and middle classes are affected and the rich are allowed to 
breathe easy.
<P>
	The Pearson issue also shows very clearly all the influence 
and pressure exerted by the wealthy. We sense that the 
government is ill at ease and that it is reluctant to get to the 
bottom of the issue.
<P>
	The political system and politicians owe it to the people to be 
open and aboveboard. Secrecy and intrigue are no longer in 
order. The government absolutely must deal with the present 
system of influence and also the financing of political parties.
<P>
	Lobbying must be examined very thoroughly. Who is doing 
what? Who is working for what? Who is meeting whom? Why? 
With what results? Voters and taxpayers are entitled to know 
everything because they are the ones who pay the government. 
As for the financing of political parties, I call on the old parties 
to show moderation. I call on them to follow our party and adopt 
the Quebec formula. Governments must at last be free and 
independent.
<P>
	Let us hope that the system will soon be completely open and 
let us give everyone equal access to decision makers. 
Democracy can only gain by it.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Stéphane Bergeron (Verchères):</B> Mr. Speaker, I usually 
rise with enthusiasm in this House to speak to various bills 
introduced by the government. In fact, I often open my remarks 
by saying it is with pleasure that I will rise in this House to speak 
to such and such a bill.
<P>
	Today however, it is without enthusiasm and even with 
disappointment that I do. I am taking part in this debate with no 
pleasure, but with the conviction of carrying out my duties and 
obligations as a parliamentarian.
<P>
	It is indeed my duty to stand up in this House and publicly 
denounce the bill now being debated. The debate on Bill C-22 
opened last Tuesday has brought to light an absolutely 
outrageous business. The contract to privatize Pearson airport 
entered into by the previous Conservative government has 
turned out to be an exercise in distributing presents to the 
friends of the system, the whole thing being engineered in an 
atmosphere of scheming and secrecy.
<P>
	Allow me to recall a number of flaws that led eminently 
serious observers to come to that conclusion.
<P>
	In 1993, Pearson airport generated over $23 million in profit. 
Under the contract passed with the Conservative government in 
the middle of an election campaign, Pearson Development 
Corporation was to operate Terminals 1 and 2 for an annual fee 
of $27 million.
<P>
	At first glance, it looked like this transaction could be 
profitable to the taxpayers.
<P>
<B>(1045) </B>
<P>
	The picture changes completely once you know that the 
corporation with the winning bid was planning a 350 per cent 
hike in passenger fees, which would have resulted in a net 
increase in earnings totalling over $100 million annually, 
airport users footing the bill, naturally.
<P>
	Air Canada publicly challenged this decision. To sugar the 
pill, Air Canada was also given a little bonus in the form of rent 
reduction, another cost to be absorbed by the taxpayers, 
naturally.
<P>
	The reason given by the government to explain why it was not 
increasing fees itself and pocketing these substantial profits was 
the necessity to finance major redevelopment work in Terminal 
1, to the tune of $100 million. Yet, in a huge fit of generosity, the 
government granted Pearson Development Corporation a 40 per 
cent rent deferral for 1994, 1995, 1996 and part of 1997.
<P>
	While these amounts were to be eventually reimbursed with 
interest, the fact remains nonetheless that the government was 
reneging on its promise not to finance the modernization of 
Terminal 1 by accepting that rent be deferred over four years. 
Also, it is stunning to see the obvious lack of financial analysis 
in the development of these privatization agreements. No 
financial viability study was done, and Paxport, to which the 
contract was originally awarded, was faced with serious 
financial difficulties and decided to team up with its only 
competitor, Claridge Inc., thus creating a monopoly situation.
<P>
	Yet, for some obscure reasons, the contract was not cancelled, 
even though it should have been. It must also be pointed out that, 
because the contract was split in two periods of 37 years and 20 
years, the owners do not have to pay provincial tax, which would 
have amounted to ten million dollars if the contract had been 
awarded for a period of 50 years. Even if you include the cost of 
work paid by investors, the taxpayer is still the big loser in this 
transaction.
<P>
	I also want to mention briefly that several newspapers have 
reported that the rate of return of about 14.2 per cent after tax 
given to Pearson Development Corporation was too high for this 
type of transaction. The media, the Ontario government, public 
opinion, and even the Liberal Party at the very end of the 
election campaign, have all voiced their opposition to that 
outrageous deal. Common sense dictates that the government 
should have gone to the bottom of this issue.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3697"> 3697 </A></B>
<P>
	Unfortunately, this is not the case at all. Bill C-22 is not the 
beginning of a new era. It is a smokescreen to cover the dealings 
that took place. The government wants to avoid at any cost 
having to go to the root of the problem, which is first an acute 
lack of transparency in the privatization process, collusion 
between the old federal parties and certain private businesses, 
and also a lack of appropriate legislation to regulate the 
activities of lobbyists.
<P>
	Last October, the government appointed a former Ontario 
Liberal minister, Mr. Robert Nixon, to conduct an <I>in camera</I> 
inquiry to find out about the dealings which led, as Mr. Nixon 
said in his report, to ``an inadequate contract arrived at through 
such a flawed process and under the shadow of possible political 
manipulation''.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I remind the government that you rarely shed 
light on an issue when you look at it behind closed doors. Also, a 
former Liberal minister, regardless of his personal credibility, is 
certainly not the best choice to inquire about a transaction in 
which some key players are directly linked to the Liberal Party 
of Canada.
<P>
	Following that inquiry, and in a moment of clear-mindedness 
and common sense on its part, the government decided to fulfil 
its election promise and cancel the formal agreement with 
Pearson Development Corporation. Unfortunately, the 
government did so in such a way that everything leads us to 
believe that it has every intention of paying off its political debts 
to its friends. When I say its friends, I mean those of both the 
Conservatives and the Liberals, since the people and companies 
involved in this mysterious transaction are very closely related 
to one or the other of these old political parties.
<P>
	While it is true that section 9 of Bill C-22 provides that no 
compensation will be given in lieu of unrealized profits, or for 
monies contributed to lobbying activities in connection with 
public office holders, the fact remains that, in section 10, the 
government gives the Minister of Transport the arbitrary right to 
pay to people of his choice such amounts as he deems 
appropriate.
<P>
<B>(1050) </B>
<P>
	Does not that open the door wide for some more abuse? Under 
section 10 of Bill C-22, the government can compensate and 
even reward individuals and corporations involved in a rather 
sordid deal which not only went against public interests, but also 
bordered on something criminal.
<P>
	Last Tuesday, the Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Transport said that the Liberal government had learned from the 
mistakes made by the previous government. I am not so sure 
about that. There is something fishy about the government's 
refusal to get right to the bottom of this nebulous deal, but the 
government adds insult to injury by giving itself <I>carte blanche</I> 
to hand out very generous compensation to the loyal 
contributors to the war chests of the old political parties. The 
government, which not so long ago solemnly  promised to abide 
by such principles as openness, integrity and sound management 
of public funds, was quick to turn its back on its pious wish and 
to revert to its old habits. As the old saying goes: what is bred in 
the bone will not out of the flesh.
<P>
	By allowing big corporations to generously contribute to the 
parties' election coffers, the Canada Elections Act certainly 
does not help to restore the credibility of federal politicians and 
political parties. By refusing to change the legislative 
framework under which such a deal was made, the current 
Liberal government is asking the public to make another 
profession of faith and to believe that it is totally impervious to 
the financial and corporative interests supporting it and to the 
pressure coming from its good friends.
<P>
	All of this disgraceful incident just goes to prove how crucial 
it is to act as soon as possible and pass an act concerning the 
financing of political parties, something similar to Quebec's 
current legislation. This would release federal political parties 
from any obligation to the big financial interests and make 
politicians accountable to those they are supposed to represent, 
that is the people of Canada.
<P>
	The other major problem stems from the fact that the 
legislation concerning lobbyists is full of holes and does not 
define specifically enough the nature of lobbyists and the nature 
of their activities. The identification of the individuals who are 
subjected to pressures raises also serious ethical problems.
<P>
	The Nixon Report speaks of dealings by members of the 
political staff who got too much involved in the transaction. It 
seems that lobbyists are directly responsible in the case of 
several officials who were reassigned and others who asked to 
be replaced. The promoters behind the privatization proposal 
knew very well that a future Liberal government would revoke 
the privatization contract, so they decided to take a risk. The 
government should not have to compensate for investors' 
miscalculations. The reform of the Lobbyists Registration Act 
would greatly contribute to prevent such muddle which, I must 
say, borders on something illegal.
<P>
	I urge the present government to do its utmost to avoid 
making the same mistakes as the Conservatives. It was a 
mistake, for example, to entrust the airport management to 
private interests while everywhere else in Canada and in Quebec 
it was agreed that the best solution was to establish a non-profit 
group composed of local interests. It was also a mistake to deal 
with this issue without taking into account the will and the 
choices of the province concerned.
<P>
	To conclude, I will join the opposition leader in asking for the 
establishment as soon as possible of an independant royal 
inquiry commission to get right to the bottom of this nebulous 
privatization deal so that never again organized and 
well-funded interests may influence the decision-making 
process in such a big way. This public inquiry could pave the 
way for the reform of the  Lobbyists Registration Act. At the 
same time, it is imperative that the government amends the 
Election Act so that 
<P>

<B><A NAME="3698"> 3698 </A></B>
<P>
Canadians begin again to trust their political institutions as well 
as politicians.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
with its Bill C-22, the Liberal government is reviving the debate 
on what is now commonly known as the Pearson affair. 
However, the provisions contained in this bill take the debate 
one step further than a mere discussion on the sale of Pearson 
International airport. They bring to light one of the biggest flaws 
in the Canadian political system.
<P>
<B>(1055) </B>
<P>
	The Pearson airport issue, which may only be the tip of the 
iceberg, is a perfect example of the influence of lobbyists and 
various pressure groups on government decisions, which have 
the unfortunate tendency of always favouring special interests 
rather than the public interest.
<P>
	It is important that Canadians finally realize what goes on 
behind the closed doors of their federal Parliament. In fact, it is 
the whole decision-making process that must be called into 
question. Right now, the most effective way to make your 
grievances known to the federal government is to hire a 
lobbying firm which, for a few thousands dollars a day, will put 
you in touch with the highest government authorities. Needless 
to say, only large corporations and very rich people can afford to 
hire a professional lobbying firm.
<P>
	There is another effective means of establishing contact with 
the government in office, and it is, of course, by making a 
substantial contribution to the election fund of the party that will 
form the government. As for ordinary Canadians, after having 
had their say in the federal elections, they must now sit and wait 
to see how the government will manage its resources. People do 
not always realize that their vote does not carry much weight 
compared to the powerful corporations and the rich friends that 
the government will support during its term. The Liberals and 
the Conservatives have certainly helped to reinforce the image 
of lobbying as an obscure phenomenon.
<P>
	But what is a lobbyist? The image that most people have is 
that of a mysterious individual who, in a dark corner, hands over 
a big envelope to a minister or a senior official to obtain some 
favour from the government. Unfortunately, reality is much 
more subtle than that since very often, the lobbyists who are 
active today behind the scenes are former ministers, deputy 
ministers or lawyers of political parties who, thanks to their 
contacts inside the government, are able to make the case of 
those who hired them.
<P>
	Their work is made easier by the fact that, most of the time, 
their bosses contributed richly to the campaign fund of the party 
in power. The lobbyists' task is to remind the government of its 
political debts towards those interest groups. In fact, the real 
elected  representatives, that is the hon. members of the 
government side as well as those from the opposition side, 
collectively get less of a hearing from ministers than any of 
those obscure professional lobbyists. That tells us a lot about 
their clout in the decision-making process of government.
<P>
	About fifteen years ago, political analyst Stanley B. Ryerson 
argued that the Canadian federation had been formed in 1867 in 
response to the demands of some interest groups. If you allow 
me, I would like to quote what he said: ``Macdonald and Galt 
were representing the general interests of English Canadian 
business circles''.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> It being eleven o'clock, pursuant to Standing 
Order 30(5), the House will now proceed to Statements by 
Members, pursuant to Standing Order 31.
<P>
	I will add, dear colleague, that you still have five minutes left 
to finish your speech when we resume after question period.

	Canada played an active role during the 1980s mobilizing 
world opinion against apartheid and supporting sanctions. Our 
effort in South Africa includes the participation of some 57 
Canadians in the observation groups of the UN mission. We have 
sent electoral experts, NGO sponsored observer missions as

inactive groundfish licence and to the seal licensing policy is a 
step in the direction of economic viability in the groundfish

	<B>Mr. Elwin Hermanson (Kindersley-Lloydminster):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Reformers have been telling the government for 
months that it is possible to do more with less.
<P>
	This morning several Canadian newspapers reported how 
much each party paid for its seats in this House. It should come 
as no surprise to anyone that the party that sank the nation so 
deeply into a sea of red ink was the Conservatives, spending well 
over $10 million for two seats. That is over $5 million per seat. 
The NDP was also extremely wasteful, spending more than 
$825,000 per seat. The governing Liberals fared a little better, 
spending $56,000 per seat.
<P>
	If the government wants to see how real fiscal responsibility 
is practised it should take note of the party that spent less than 
$1.5 million for 52 seats. That party is Reform which kept the 
cost per seat down to only $28,000, half of what the government 
spent and miles ahead of the others.
<P>
	Canadian taxpayers are very concerned that much of their tax 
money is wasted. Federal party spending in the last election 
illustrates that the Reform Party would be the best stewards of 
taxpayers' money because the party also completed the election 
campaign in the black.

	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the Minister of Industry. Despite the 
unsettling effect that his hasty, irresponsible statement about 
reviewing the drug patent legislation has had, the Minister of 
Industry reiterated yesterday his intention of going ahead with a 
review of the legislation. Already, the review is jeopardizing 
important investments in Quebec.
<P>
	Does the minister intend to follow up on the request of his 
Quebec colleague and put to rest his concerns, as well as those of 
the multinational which this week decided, further to Ottawa's 
hasty announcement to reopen Bill C-91, the drug patent 
legislation, that it was holding off on a $50 million investment 
in Quebec?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
want to say a word about this because the opposition is truly 
exaggerating.
<P>
	It is really very simple. A bill was passed by Parliament and 
the pharmaceutical industry made a commitment to the 
Canadian public. It undertook to invest money and to refrain 
from increasing the price of drugs. The government therefore 
has a duty to ensure that the promised investments have been 
made.
<P>
	If the industry believes that it has fulfilled the obligations set 
out by Parliament, then it has nothing to fear. However, if it has 
not fulfilled its obligations and made the investments, the 
opposition should be telling us to take steps to ensure that these 
investments are indeed made. But if we do not carry out a 
review, we will never know.
<P>
	We have an obligation to carry out this review, pursuant to the 
legislation passed by Parliament. As the whip stated earlier, a 
industry spokesperson said he was not in the least bit worried 
and that this was nothing more than a tempest in a teapot 
whipped up by the Bloc Quebecois. On the one hand, Bloc 
members rise in the House and ask us to protect this industry, 
while on the other hand, they want us to go along with their plans 
for Quebec independence, which will create even more 
instability for potential investors in this country in the years to 
come.
<P>
<B>(1120) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as usual, in response to serious questions, questions dealing 
with Quebec's economic interests, the Prime Minister and his 
ministers talk nonsense.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Some days are more trying than others and we 
had hoped not to hear words like the ones just used by the hon. 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3703"> 3703 </A></B>
<P>
member and those I have already asked another hon. member to 
withdraw. I hope the hon.  member can understand why I ask him 
to withdraw the word ``nonsense''.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I withdraw the word ``nonsense'', but I simply used it to indicate 
that, when we talk about vocational training for example, we are 
told that it is nothing but one of Quebec's whims, and when we 
talk about drug patents, we are told that we are getting excited 
over nothing. Just last evening, Minister Tremblay called for 
government intervention and I reiterate minister Tremblay's 
request in that respect.
<P>
	Could the Minister of Industry deal directly with the company 
that reconsidered a $50 million investment it was about to make 
in Quebec? Do you not think this would be a good way to 
reassure the pharmaceutical industry as a whole? These 
companies are seriously concerned at present, Mr. Speaker, 
about the irresponsible remarks the minister has made. So, I put 
the question to him.
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Did you hear 
that? He just described the remarks as irresponsible. As for the 
hon. member's own remarks, insult being the weapon of the 
weak, as the saying goes, it is only natural that he would want to 
insult everybody.
<P>
	We have said, and the people in the industry themselves said 
yesterday that they were not concerned about what is going on 
right now. The industry itself said so. However, if the industry 
wants to invest, it should go ahead and invest! The legislation is 
in place, it was passed and investments have been made under it 
in past years.
<P>
	Why is it all of a sudden that one of them has become more 
nervous than the rest? Those who made investments last year did 
so under the same legislation. I imagine that these people who 
have invested so far were familiar with the provisions of the 
legislation. This company should read the law and follow the 
same reasoning as the ones that invested last year and the year 
before. That is the way to do it. It is nothing to make a fuss 
about, and our position is that we will abide by the law in the 
interest of investment and in the interest of the patients who 
have to buy drugs.
<P>
	That is one of the objectives of this legislation and we will 
enforce it because either the patients pay or the governments 
have to pay for them, when the pharmaceutical industry goes too 
far.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Yvan Loubier (Saint-Hyacinthe-Bagot):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
I hear the Prime Minister talking about a review of the prices 
charged and investments made by the pharmaceutical industry. 
It is also provided for in Bill C-91. We do not need to re-open 
that bill, a review is already planned. A body has been set up to 
monitor these things, so I put the question to the minister again.
<P>
	Does the minister not agree that his intention to review the 
law has already hurt investment in research and development in 
Quebec and that his intended review has a much broader purpose 
than checking the prices of patented drugs or investments, 
which are already  controlled by a body reporting to the 
Department of Health?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
already indicated in the House yesterday that we intend to 
conduct a review, as the Prime Minister promised during the 
election campaign, but as the Prime Minister just said, the 
proposed review is not what is causing uncertainty. I can tell the 
hon. member that I have two press releases here, the first from 
Merck Frosst, issued yesterday, announcing that they have 
completed their engineering study and have begun the design 
work for the plant in question, and I quote: ``We will honour our 
commitment because we are sure that the Canadian government 
will honour its commitment''.
<P>
<B>(1125) </B>
<P>
	Also, I have a letter from Astra Canada.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Excuse me, Mr. Speaker, the hon. member is having-
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> Perhaps the hon. Minister of Industry could 
bring his answer to a close.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Manley:</B> Mr. Speaker, if the Bloc is genuinely concerned 
about assurances on these things perhaps it could listen to the 
assurances I can offer.
<P>
	This is Astra Canada: ``I understand there has been some 
indication that an unnamed pharmaceutical firm has indicated 
that their $50 million investment has now been cancelled. I have 
had some calls inquiring as to whether or not that company is 
Astra. Please be assured that we remain fully committed to the 
establishment of our basic drug discovery facility in the city of 
St. Laurent. This is a very significant investment involving 
about $33 million in building and equipment and an annual 
investment of over $10 million in research''.
<P>

pursuing its political goal of separation for Quebec.

	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe): </B>Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs. The 
Prime Minister says that the Bloc Quebecois is stirring up a 
tempest in a teapot. Yet, he seems to refuse to listen to several 
comments and interventions made by Quebec ministers.
<P>
	The Quebec minister of employment has been trying 
unsuccessfully for several months to convince the federal 
government to reach an agreement on the manpower training 
issue. Yesterday, he sent out a real alarm over the state of 
relations between Quebec and Ottawa. Speaking of malaise, the 
minister said that several of his Cabinet colleagues have been 
coming up against Ottawa's centralizing designs.
<P>
	Are we to understand from that statement, and contrary to 
what the minister said in this House, that the negotiations 
between Quebec and Ottawa over manpower training are more 
than ever in a deadlock because of Ottawa's refusal to give 
anything to Quebec?
<P>

<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, since I have been involved in interprovincial relations 
for several dozens of years, I evidently do not have the same 
blood pressure as the hon. member when it comes to a problem 
such as manpower training, which has been going on for many 
years.
<P>
	Our position in the negotiations is clearly not the same as the 
one of Quebec. We are pursuing our discussions with Quebec; it 
is possible that we will come to an agreement, but it is also 
possible that we will not come to an agreement on this issue at 
the present time. That is part of the way federal-provincial 
relations have been working for many years in this country, and 
there are not more problems today than there were at any other 
time in our history.
<P>
	<B>M. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, so the 
minister is confirming that the negotiations are deteriorating 
and that we are in a deadlock.
<P>
	Is the Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs confirming, and 
will he have the courage to admit, that relations between Quebec 
and Ottawa have been deteriorating in several areas, particularly 
in education, youth programs, readjustment programs for 
fishermen, the review of Bill C-91, health financing and the 
high-speed train, to name just a few, and that, finally, Ottawa's 
intentions are aimed at centralization?
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I find that questions and answers are perhaps a 
bit long. I would ask everyone to please make it shorter.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Marcel Massé (President of the Queen's Privy 
Council for Canada, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 
and Minister responsible for Public Service Renewal): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, the answer is no.

	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, my question is for 
the Prime Minister.
<P>
	Yesterday the Minister of Health said that the government 
would not reopen the Canada Health Act ``in the short term''. 
She said: ``There is no question that there will have to be some 
changes and change is always difficult''.
<P>
<B>(1130 ) </B>
<P>
	In light of these comments, could the Prime Minister tell the 
House exactly when the government plans on reviewing the 
Canada Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the government is planning a conference with all the people 
involved in health services and I will be presiding over it.
<P>
	We said we were having this review. We are holding 
discussions with the provinces at the moment and the first 
meeting of this continuing conference on health problems in 
Canada will be held in the middle of June.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> Mr. Speaker, the health minister 
was quite clear yesterday in her comments. She said there would 
be changes to the Canada Health Act and that those changes 
were necessary.
<P>
	Yesterday the health minister also said that health funding 
was holding steady under this government but the fact is that 
federal funding as a portion of total health spending has dropped 
from 50 per cent to 23 per cent and continues to drop. As a result 
the provinces, handcuffed by the Canada Health Act, are being 
forced to cut health services.
<P>
	I repeat, when and how will the government amend the 
Canada Health Act?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
the financing of these programs is done by through a formula. 
Sometimes the figures that are used are confusing because the 
money transferred has been reduced, but there has been a 
transfer of tax points to be used for the financing of these 
programs.
<P>
	Over a period of years people have stopped thinking that. In 
fact we have made more room for the provinces to collect more 
money. The transfer of cash has diminished but the participation 
of the federal government has not been reduced, as some people 
say.
<P>
	What I was very pleased with yesterday was seeing the 
Reform Party asking the federal government to spend more, 
more, more.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Grant Hill (Macleod):</B> This is a good day, Mr. Speaker, a 
good day.
<P>
	The actions and inactions of the government amount to a total 
abdication of responsibility toward the health care system. The 
Liberal government keeps telling us about the sanctity of 
medicare but cannot answer as to how it will be preserved.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3705"> 3705 </A></B>
<P>
	Why is the government now trying to snuff out creative 
attempts by provinces, doctors and patients to preserve the 
health care system when the government appears to have no 
answers at all?
<P>
	<B>Right Hon. Jean Chrétien (Prime Minister):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
question that statement. We have one concern that is very 
important to this party. We do not want to fall into the trap of 
finding so-called new solutions, new approaches that very soon 
in Canada it would be like in the United States: good service for 
the rich and poor service for the poor. We will never let that 
happen in Canada.

	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, this 
morning we heard that a number of auditors with the Department 
of National Revenue complained about political interference 
when auditing Canadian companies.
<P>
	The president of the Professional Institute of the Public 
Service of Canada said, at a press conference this morning, and I 
quote: ``Auditors received instructions to back off from certain 
files''.
<P>
	My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime 
Minister intend to investigate these very serious allegations and 
could he give us the assurance that all provisions of the 
Canadian Income Tax Act apply to all companies in Canada, 
without exception?
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, the survey that was 
released today is very general in nature. There are no specific 
allegations revealed whatsoever.
<P>
	The department is very committed, as is the government, to 
fair taxation for everyone. If concrete evidence of political 
interference is provided, the department will definitely 
investigate.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pierre Brien (Témiscamingue):</B> Mr. Speaker, I may add 
that 250 public servants complained about this kind of political 
interference, which to me is pretty factual.
<P>
	Would the Prime Minister agree that these serious allegations 
may cause the public to doubt the impartiality of our tax system 
and will he undertake to clarify this question by calling for an 
independent investigation by the Auditor General, whose 
findings would be released as soon as the report is tabled?
<P>
<B>(1135 ) </B>
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Ms. Susan Whelan (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of National Revenue):</B> Mr. Speaker, the department is aware of 
the survey and has a meeting scheduled with the union on May 
11. It was scheduled before the announcement today. We will 
proceed with  that meeting. The survey is an item on the agenda 
at that meeting.

today.

	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, my question is for the Prime Minister.
<P>
	According to a recent study by the Association of General 
Surgeons, 23,000 people in Quebec are on waiting lists for 
surgery. Half of them have been there for over 18 months. This 
waiting list has doubled since 1985 and 626 of those individuals 
are cancer patients waiting for urgent surgery.
<P>
	In light of this will the Prime Minister acknowledge that 
health care in this county is collapsing. The act is obsolete and 
reform of the act is crucial. We are not asking for more money.
<P>
	I would like the Prime Minister to please guarantee that 
federal transfer payments for funding for health care will stay at 
1992-93 levels at least and not decrease any more.
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, on the one hand the member 
says he does not want us to spend any more money. On the other 
hand he is pointing out the difficulties being faced by the 
provinces.
<P>
	The Minister of Health met with provincial ministers in 
February. She has another meeting scheduled in the next few 
weeks specifically to discuss making sure that every Canadian 
has access to health care services at no cost to themselves.
<P>
	Frankly, if we followed the suggestion of the Reform Party to 
cancel the Canada Health Act, every fibre of the work that we 
have done over the last 30 years in building one of the best 
health care systems in the world would be flushed down the 
toilet and we do not intend to do that.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we do not have the best health care system in the world 
right now, but we should.
<P>
	The government on the one hand is denying the provinces the 
right to get health care under control by forcing them to adhere 
to an obsolete Canada Health Act. On the other hand it is not 
living up to its commitment by continually decreasing funding 
for health care over the last 15 years.
<P>
	Will you give us and this country, and on behalf of my 
patients-
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Oh, oh.

question through the Chair and put his question, please.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. Speaker, will 
the government guarantee that it will live up to its commitments 
and provide federal funding for health care for Canadians based 
on 1992-93 levels and not continually decrease it?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Sheila Copps (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister 
of the Environment):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would certainly not agree 
with the member's statement about the state of Canada's health 
care.
<P>
	Yesterday I had the privilege of discussing with the wife of the 
President of the United States their health reforms. She was 
asking me how they could put in place a system which would 
mirror or be similar to the system we have in Canada. The 
Americans are coming to this country to see a system that works.
<P>
	Obviously the system has to respond to new realities.
<P>

<P>
	We were very happy to see that midwives were finally 
accepted by physicians in some provinces, including Quebec 
and Ontario. It is very important that changes be brought to the 
system.

Mr. Speaker, we can understand that the President of the 
Treasury Board is more eager to put on a show with the 
infrastructure program than to address the real problems.
<P>
	My question to the President of the Treasury Board is this: Is 
he going to wait until the work of the commission is over to give 
an answer to the Canadian Hemophilia Society? What is the 
rationale behind such delay, given that granting additional funds 
requested by Justice Krever would allow the commission to 
carry on fully its mandate and to get right to the bottom of that 
scandal?

the first degree murder of six year-old Dawn Shaw. Evidence

labelling is required on products coming into Canada at the

vegetables or fruit to be labelled whether they are a product of 
Canada or another country. Also produce that is repackaged in 
Canada must have its Canada grade designation on it.

	In a letter dated November 15, 1993 the Thunder Bay Harbour 
Commission Port Authority warned the minister that the rail car 
shortage problem had been some time in the making and was due 
in part to the policy of dispersing the rail car fleet into trades and 
routings outside its original purpose. This is just one of the 
several warnings the minister received.
<P>
	Could the minister please explain what measures were taken 
in light of these warnings?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, on 
behalf of the Minister of Transport I will take the member's 
question under advisement and undertake to get a reply to him as 
soon as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jake E. Hoeppner (Lisgar-Marquette):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
further to that I would ask the government whether it is doing 
something with demurrage charges that are piling up on the west 
coast. Grain and oilseed sales have been lost. Japan is in search 
of a reliable supplier to grow more canola next year.
<P>
	Would the government indicate what measures it intends to 
take to keep Canada a reliable grain and oilseed supplier to the 
world?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, all government 
departments are aware of the situation in grain handling in 
western Canada today. The minister of agriculture will be 
announcing later today that as soon as he returns to the country 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3708"> 3708 </A></B>
<P>
he is bringing together the key players in the grain handling 
industry in western Canada to resolve that issue.
<P>
	The rail car companies have informed us they will be putting 
several more thousand rail cars on the rails. They have already 
started. It is our intention to solve this so we can better serve our 
customers as we have in the past and will continue to in the 
future.

	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, my 
question is for the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>
	On April 10, the City of Montreal and the key players in social 
and cooperative housing made a plea to the Quebec and federal 
governments, asking for a non-recurring $40-million program 
to renovate 1,000 dwellings every year in that city.
<P>
	Considering that the Quebec Minister of Municipal Affairs 
reacted positively to this project called ``Resolution Montreal'', 
is the federal government prepared to make a commitment to the 
Quebec government and to Montrealers, and help meet the 
urgent needs of the population?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the hon. member for her question. The minister 
has already met with his counterparts and will meet them again 
soon. The minister is holding consultations and will make a 
decision later as to what new initiative the government can 
undertake in co-operation with the provinces and territories. 
Obviously, the above mentioned project is one which will get 
very serious consideration.
<P>
<B>(1150) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Monique Guay (Laurentides):</B> Mr. Speaker, since the 
beginning of this Parliament, no concrete action has been taken 
regarding social housing. Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree 
that, by unduly postponing necessary funding to implement this 
innovative program, her government is avoiding its 
responsibility to the poor in Montreal?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, we have to consult with the provinces; we are asked to 
do so. We have met with ministers and we will continue to do so. 
I said that the project would be carefully considered; we will see 
what other ministers propose.
<P>
	To say that the government did nothing for social housing is 
not true at all. Across the country, there are over 559,000 units 
costing annually $2.1 million to the federal government. Also, 
we will spend $100 million, over a period of two years, to 
renovate dwellings. There are several other projects which I do 
not have the time to mention. There are several projects, 
including in Quebec, and I would appreciate it if the opposition 
recognized that great efforts have been made. Moreover,  the 
minister said that the savings of about $100 million would be 
used to support other initiatives.

	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
my question is for the minister of agriculture.
<P>
	Recently the United States enacted article XXVIII of the 
GATT in response to what it perceived as unfair imports of 
Canadian durum wheat. The fact is that American prices for 
durum wheat have increased approximately 90 per cent in the 
past year. This totally refutes the claim that the American 
industry is being harmed by Canadian durum wheat imports.
<P>
	Could the minister please explain what actions his 
government is taking to dispute the U.S. claim that Canadian 
durum wheat imports are hurting its farmers?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, we certainly regret 
the Americans took the action they did a week ago today by 
putting in place article XXVIII. I want to assure the member and 
the industry that this does not close the border; what it does is 
move the negotiations to another stage.
<P>
	We will continue to negotiate as strongly and as firmly as we 
have with the Americans on this issue. We have won a number of 
challenges and panels since 1990. The score for Canada on the 
trade disputes on wheat with the United States is 4 to 0. And at 
this time of the year when a hockey score is 4 to 0 it is a pretty 
decisive win.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Jay Hill (Prince George-Peace River):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
as the hon. member indicated, four previous investigations have 
exonerated the Canadian Wheat Board of unfair pricing. Despite 
this we now have a scenario for counterproductive retaliatory 
tariffs between the U.S. and Canada.
<P>
	Is this government prepared to insist that the root cause of this 
trade disruption is not Canadian durum wheat imports but the 
distorting influence of the U.S. export enhancement program?
<P>
	<B>Mr. Lyle Vanclief (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Agriculture and Agri-food):</B> Mr. Speaker, we have made it 
very clear to the United States if it decides to go ahead and take 
unilateral action at the end of the 90 days that we will respond in 
kind. We have indicated some of the areas where we might do 
that.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3709"> 3709 </A></B>
<P>
	I also assure the member that we had representation yesterday 
in Washington at the International Trade Commission hearings. 
This should be of some comfort to us.
<P>
	We must remember all of those commissioners who are 
attending that hearing are American and as one of the 
commissioners said: ``We have only received two documents 
from the department. Both are essentially statements devoid of 
analysis and one I could barely understand''. I think that bodes 
well.

my question is addressed to the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<P>
	Remembering Canada's record of leadership in the United 
Nations General Assembly over the whole post-war period 
under St. Laurent, Pearson, Paul Martin Sr. and Trudeau, in the 
movement for nuclear and general disarmament under 
international law, will the Minister of Foreign Affairs consider 
intervening in the World Health Organization process now 
pending before the World Court in The Hague on the illegality of 
nuclear weapons?
<P>
<B>(1155) </B>
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage):</B> I 
thank the member for Vancouver Quadra for his question.
<P>
	Indeed Canada was always a leader in the field of 
non-proliferation. We can take pride in the fact that we invented 
strangulation of nuclear weapons.
<P>
	The question the hon. member raises this morning is a very 
legitimate one. I am informed that it is up for consideration by 
the foreign minister who will make a decision in due course. 
However, there is no evidence in sight that Canada is going to 
change its traditional support for non-proliferation and to stop 
its fight against nuclear weapons.

who happens to represent the riding next to mine.
<P>
	The Société des auteurs et compositeurs du Québec appeared 
before the Copyright Board this week to ask for a 2 to 5 per cent 
increase on royalties paid to songwriters every time their songs 
are performed.
<P>
	Would the minister give us a progress report on the review of 
copyright legislation currently underway in his department, as 
well as in the Department of Industry, and tell us when he 
intends to introduce a bill to modernize the outdated provisions 
of the current act?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Michel Dupuy (Minister of Canadian Heritage): </B>Mr. 
Speaker, I agree that the current legislation is outdated. I think it 
is important we make all necessary changes.
<P>
	The proposed amendments are being reviewed, not only in my 
department, but also in all other departments concerned. When 
all the preliminary work is done, we will be happy to report to 
the House.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval-Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I am glad to see that my neighbour and I both agree that 
some of our laws are outdated.
<P>
	Recently, the Minister of Industry announced the membership 
of the National Advisory Committee on the Information 
Highway. We noticed that creative artists and songwriters are 
not represented on this committee.
<P>
	Would the Minister of Canadian Heritage tell us if he intends 
to suggest to his colleague, the Minister of Industry, to appoint 
such a representative to this committee?
<P>
	<B>Hon. John Manley (Minister of Industry): </B>Mr. Speaker, I 
think the minister responsible for this issue should answer the 
question.
<P>
	On the committee I set up to advise my department are 
representatives of the cultural industries. What the hon. member 
just said is not true. We have on this committee some very 
important Quebecers, who contributed a lot to the overall 
cultural industry, such as Mr. Chagnon, of Vidéotron, who 
implemented in the Chicoutimi area a very important pilot 
project for the building of the information highway, as well as 
Mr. Bureau, former chairman of the CRTC, and many more.

<P>

<B><A NAME="3710"> 3710 </A></B>

<P>
	Can the Prime Minister please tell the House if there is any 
truth to this report?
<P>
	<B>Hon. Arthur C. Eggleton (President of the Treasury Board 
and Minister responsible for Infrastructure):</B> No, Mr. 
Speaker, I am sorry. It is good news and bad news. A provision 
has been made for summer students to be hired.
<P>
	In the red book we said we were going to cut the budgets of 
ministers by some $10 million. We have not only done that but 
we have actually exceeded that amount.
<P>
	I am pleased to be able to say that as part of the savings we are 
able to provide ministers with an opportunity to hire summer 
students and, most important, to create job opportunities for 
those students to help to prepare them for the job market when 
they are finished their education.
<P>
	I would hope that all members would applaud that move.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Chuck Strahl (Fraser Valley East):</B> Mr. Speaker, we 
applaud any savings that the government can get in place. Our 
concern was that there may be an announcement later on in the

<P>
	According to a report in the Montreal <I>Gazette</I>, Canada's 
economy is outperforming that of the United States. 
Specifically the report indicates a 4 per cent growth during the

projections contained in the government's budget?

have the question and the opportunity to confirm that those 
numbers are good news for Canada.
<P>
	We have had a series of good news reports. Our economy has 
performed better than it had before and a number of forecasters

<P>
	I have had a chance to look over the ``blues'' and <I>Hansard</I>

the heat of debate. At the time the hon. Minister of Industry in a

<P>

anyone for using quotes, especially from Shakespeare. 
However, in the context in which the words were used, I have of

they were used are in my view unparliamentary.

words he used. In fact I would ask him to withdraw the statement 
which he made yesterday on page 3648 when he referred to the

	The House resumed consideration of the motion of the 
Minister of Transport; of the amendment; and of the amendment 
to the amendment.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Péloquin (Brome-Missisquoi):</B> Mr. Speaker, 
before I was interrupted by Question Period, I was mentioning 
that Stanley Ryerson, a political scientist, was arguing some 
fifteen years ago that the Canadian federation was created, in 
1867, because of pressure by certain interest groups. I would 
like to quote him.
<P>
	``Macdonald and Galt were representing the general interests 
of English Canadian business circles. And Brown was the 
spokesman for Toronto's commercial and industrial circles. 
Finally, Cartier represented the conservative wing of the 
French-Canadian bourgeoisie and of the clergy. The new 
political structures were tailored to the economic and politic 
interests of the dominant social groups''.
<P>
	Our proud Fathers of Confederation were therefore Canadian 
bankers, financiers and businessmen pressuring the British 
Parliament to unite the Canadian colonies in order to widen their 
markets and protect themselves against the economic threat 
posed by the U.S. According to that view, Canada was created by 
lobbyists, and successive governments have perpetuated that 
long tradition of favouritism. Since then, the two main national 
parties have always relied on large corporations to finance their 
political activities.
<P>
	The Pearson airport privatization proves that things have not 
really changed since Confederation, except that interest groups 
have gained more and more influence on the decision-making 
process in the Canadian government.
<P>
<B>(1215) </B>
<P>
	Today, our society is organised around a corruption system 
perfectly institutionalized. The voice of the people is getting 
weaker in the hallways of the Parliament of Canada, and Bill 
C-22 does nothing to prove it is not so. On the contrary, it makes 
the system even more susceptible to manipulation by interest 
groups.
<P>
	The names that keep cropping up concerning the sale of 
Pearson airport show how the system works in Ottawa. Here is a 
list of friends of Mulroney and Conservative organizers: Otto 
Jelinek, former Conservative minister; Don Matthews, former 
president of the Conservative Party; Bill Neville, Joe Clark's 
former chief of staff ; Hugh Riopelle, lobbyist and friend of Mr. 
Mazankowski; Fred Doucet, former chief of staff of Brian 
Mulroney; John Llegate, lobbyist and friend of Michael Wilson; 
Pat MacAdam, lobbyist and friend of Mr. Mulroney; Bill Fox, 
lobbyist and friend of Mr. Mulroney; Harry Near, lobbyist and 
Conservative faithful; Scott Proudfoot, Conservative lobbyist.
<P>
	On the Liberal side we have: Herb Metcalfe, former organizer 
for Mr. Chrétien; Leo Kolber, a Liberal senator.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order! I ask the member 
to refer to those who presently hold a seat in the House by their 
title. For example, when referring to Mr. Chrétien, he must call 
him the Right Hon. Prime Minister, since he happens to be 
speaking about the head of the Liberal government. I am 
committed to maintaining tradition whether members are 
present in the House or not. I know the member for 
Brome-Missisquoi has gained a lot of experience in a very 
short time in the House but I ask his further co-operation in this 
matter.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Péloquin:</B> All those people were more or less implicated 
in the secret dealings surrounding the sale of Toronto Pearson 
International airport up to this point. Because of their political 
contacts those lobbyists succeeded in having the government 
sign a bad contract. In order to thank them, our government is 
now considering compensating them because they could not 
carry their shady deal to fruition.
<P>
	That is exactly the kind of situation that confirms the 
population's cynicism towards politicians. According to a 
popular saying, a politicians's promise is a broken promise. This 
brings the credibility of the whole Canadian parliamentary 
system into question. Bill C-22 will certainly be adding to the 
contempt and scorn with which Canadians regard politicians. In 
fact, Cana-
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3713"> 3713 </A></B>
<P>
dians should not be surprised to see the Liberals act exactly the 
way they do each time they form the government in Ottawa.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Maurice Bernier (Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to participate in this extremely 
important debate. This bill concerns the cancellation of the deal 
signed by the Conservative government. But it also puts to the 
test the government's credibility and the integrity of the 
parliamentary process.
<P>
	The point I would like to raise in the next few minutes 
concerns the compensation provided for by bill C-22. When I 
read this piece of legislation, I had serious doubts. You, and all 
the members in this House, will surely agree with me that when 
parliamentarians make legislation, they must respect certain 
principles to ensure that our legislation is clear, the wording as 
precise as possible, and the clauses consistent.
<P>
<B>(1220) </B>
<P>
	Clause 7, regarding compensation, reads as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No action or other proceeding, including any action or proceeding in 
restitution, or for damages of any kind in tort or contract- may be instituted by 
anyone against Her Majesty, or against any minister or any servant or agent of Her 
Majesty-</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In other words, clause 7 means that no compensation may be 
paid in connection with the Pearson deal.
<P>
	But when reading clause 10, we find that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>10.(1) If the Minister considers it appropriate to do so, the Minister may, with 
the approval of the Governor in Council, enter into agreements on behalf of Her 
Majesty to provide for the payment of such amounts as the Minister considers 
appropriate in connection with the coming into force of this Act, subject to the 
terms and conditions that the Minister considers appropriate.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	And further, still under clause 10:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(3) No agreement may be entered into under this section after one month after 
the coming into force of this Act.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	When comparing those two sections, in my area, we would 
say that ``there is something missing'' because on the one hand, 
we have the impression that no action may be taken by anyone 
against the government in relation to any possible agreement or 
compensation while on the other hand, the minister may, with 
the blessing of Her Majesty, enter into an agreement, but only 
within one month after the coming into force of the bill.
<P>
	After rereading those sections, I finally managed to find some 
cohesion. Basically, what the bill is suggesting to us in terms of 
compensation is that there is already a done deal. We now have 
to find a way to go ahead with the deal. We have to be careful not 
to fall into two or three traps. First, according to section 7, we 
must not give the impression of giving away compensation. 
Better still, we say to people: ``Don't worry, you will not have to 
take us to court because we are going to forbid that. So, there's 
no problem, you see the minister-under section 10-and you 
make a deal with him which does not seem to be related to the 
transaction itself but which will basically allow you to achieve 
the same result''.
<P>
	The reason I say that in all likelihood the deal has already 
been made is because of the obligation to come to an agreement 
within one month after the coming into force of the bill. 
Therefore, there seems to be some urgency because the 
legislator, who does not usually speak for nothing, comes to the 
conclusion that all agreements must be entered into within one 
month. That is what I wanted to point out.
<P>
	I will go on about this deal, which has obviously already been 
struck, although we know nothing about it. As was mentioned by 
some of my colleagues, including the hon. member for 
Brome-Missisquoi who just spoke and others who repeatedly 
said so this week, lobbyists belong to every party and feed at 
every trough, whether it be with this Liberal government or with 
the former Conservative government. They just turn coat, then 
go meet the minister and get the same results.
<P>
<B>(1225) </B>
<P>
	Everybody remembers the famous $1,000-a-plate dinner 
held during last election campaign. Charles Bronfman, 
unquestionably a francophile emeritus who, in 1976, the day 
after the election of the Parti Quebecois, had nothing better to 
say than he would move the Expos out of Quebec, attended this 
dinner party and was told by the Prime Minister that the 
agreement concluded for the privatization of Pearson airport 
would be cancelled.
<P>
	During the election campaign, the Prime Minister took great 
pride in saying that Mr. Bronfman paid $1,000 to hear that his 
agreement was no good. The dinner must have lasted a little 
longer that this conversation, and Mr. Bronfman surely got 
guarantees for what was to follow.
<P>
	Several people reached that conclusion, especially the 
chairman of the board of inquiry, Mr. Robert Nixon, who said in 
his report: ``My review has left me with but one conclusion: To 
leave in place an inadequate contract, arrived at with such a 
flawed process and under the shadow of possible political 
manipulation, is unacceptable. I therefore recommend that it be 
cancelled''.
<P>
	Also, still with reference to the famous $1,000-a-plate 
dinner, I would like to quote the comment made by André Pratte, 
a journalist for <I>La Presse</I>, during the election campaign: ``If a 
$1,000 gift can help you drop a few words in the leader's or the 
potential prime minister's ear, what privileges do people who 
give $5,000 enjoy?''
<P>
	And what does a business like Canadian Pacific, which gave 
$64,000 to each party last year, get? These questions have to be 
asked; and they have to be answered! There is an old saying, ``A 
man is known by the company he keeps''. We have to know the 
facts, we have to find out about these relations.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3714"> 3714 </A></B>
<P>
	Therefore, it goes without saying that I support the Bloc 
Quebecois's amendment and the Reform Party's 
sub-amendment requesting a commission of inquiry. Mr. 
Speaker, it is one thing to come and legislate in this House, even 
if we support the purpose of the bill, which is to cancel this 
ridiculous contract, but we must also ensure that the government 
and politicians never again find themselves in such a situation.
<P>
	And to ensure this, we have to know the facts. To find them 
out, since we have the report prepared by Mr. Nixon, who 
conducted an <I>in camera</I> inquiry but still came up with some 
serious conclusions, it is absolutely justified to appoint a 
commission of inquiry. I repeat that we must not permit this bill 
to end a process which, in my opinion, reveals some troubling 
facts.
<P>
	We have to know the truth because those who elected us 
throughout Quebec and Canada want to know what this is all 
about. The credibility of the government and of all 
parliamentarians is at stake, and that is why we need a 
commission of inquiry.
<P>
<B>(1230) </B>
<P>
	<B>Mr. Bernard Deshaies (Abitibi):</B> Mr. Speaker, I welcome 
this opportunity to take part in the debate today on Bill C-22 to 
explain how my constituents may be indirectly affected, by the 
more or less successful privatization of this major airport.
<P>
	Pearson airport in Toronto is Canada's largest airport, with 
nearly 20 million passengers coming through annually, which is 
nearly 57,000 per day. Pearson airport has a direct economic 
impact worth nearly $4 billion annually on Ontario's economy.
<P>
	Considering these figures, Pearson airport is considered to be, 
and indeed is, a very profitable airport. That is good news, 
because in a big country like ours, where equalization is the rule 
so that all citizens get a fair share, profitable airports in the 
south make it possible to finance the operations of airports 
further north.
<P>
	We need a commission of inquiry to investigate the 
transactions that took place and those that might have been 
concluded to realize the real financial potential of this 
airport-whether or not it is sold to private interests-in order 
to measure the financial impact and ensure profits can be used to 
finance the maintenance and development of northern airports.
<P>
	Air transportation in the north is a vital part of local 
communications between communities and provides a vital link 
between communities in the north and the south. Considering 
the fragile economy of these communities, free competition 
could adversely affect the security and autonomy of the people 
in these regions. In fact, I would like to take this opportunity to 
discuss the privatization policy the government wants to 
implement in Canada and Quebec. I think that in both cases, 
Pearson airport and the government's plan to privatize air traffic 
control, the result will be a loss of services for people in the 
regions.
<P>
	Some time ago, the Minister of Transport announced that 
studies would be conducted on the privatization of air traffic 
control in Canada and Quebec, to be followed by consultations 
with users, unions and groups with an interest in Canada's air 
navigation system.
<P>
	The Bloc Quebecois is concerned about the implications and 
especially about the lack of transparency around this project. 
The information we are getting is extremely vague. The Bloc 
Quebecois is therefore anxious to find out the real reasons 
behind the government's plan to transfer nearly 6,000 jobs, 
including 2,000 air traffic controllers, to an as yet unknown 
entity.
<P>
	Will this be a Crown corporation, like Canada Post, or a 
completely private enterprise?
<P>
	Does the minister intend to give us the names of the 
companies, commercial groups or interest groups that have 
shown an interest or even tendered bids for an air navigation 
system in Canada or parts of that system?
<P>
	We think it is important that the public should know who 
wants what and what the conditions will be for the sale of the 
system, if there is one. We do not want the scandal of the Pearson 
airport privatization happening again.
<P>
	Air traffic safety. If there is a transportation area where 
decisions concerning the safety of the travelling public should 
not be delegated to the private sector, it is certainly air traffic 
safety. Can the government explain to us how it will force this 
new company to offer air traffic control services where they are 
needed?
<P>
	Will the government force this new company, or these 
companies, to offer air traffic control services even in regions 
where air traffic is not lucrative? Let us take, for example, an 
airport with thousands of small plane flights every year which 
does not bring in much money in terms of landing fees and 
which is not economically viable, but where the volume of 
flights is such that the danger of air collisions is high. Will the 
government force this or these new companies to offer air traffic 
control services even if they were to lose some money on that 
part of their activities? We are not too sure about that.
<P>
	How will remote areas such as Abitibi or the North Shore, or 
any other Northern or remote area, be treated? How will the 
government force this new commercial entity to monitor the 
level and quality of services provided?
<P>
<B>(1235) </B>
<P>
	You will recall the Dryden crash, where it was demonstrated 
that Transport Canada had had trouble enforcing laws and 
regulations. It has been proven that self-regulation does not 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3715"> 3715 </A></B>
<P>
work and is unacceptable, especially in air travel. How will the 
government enforce air traffic safety?
<P>
	If there is a service which is of national interest, such as the 
Armed Forces, how can the government think about transferring 
this responsibility-I am talking about air traffic control-to 
commercial interests?
<P>
	By the same token, can the minister tell us what will become 
of the travellers protection, given the fact that he is now 
considering putting an end to the presence of permanent and 
professional fire fighters in regional airports in Canada?
<P>
	We have not forgotten the cuts in services that followed when 
Canada Post became a Crown corporation. In remote and 
isolated areas mail service was drastically reduced in order to 
save money and in the name of profitability. Does the 
government intend to do the same thing in the case of control 
towers, flight service stations and fire fighters in regional 
airports? Will we end up with airplanes being controlled from 
Quebec and Montreal? In a nutshell, is the government getting 
ready to shut down regions by reducing services to a minimum?
<P>
	Furthermore, can the minister explain why his government is 
still going ahead with its project of ``modernizing'' the air 
traffic control system by closing thirteen control towers in 
Canada? Why does the department want to close four towers in 
Quebec, or 44 per cent of all towers in Quebec? Must I remind 
the minister that three out of those four towers are located in 
peripheral areas, namely Val-d'Or, Sept-Îles and 
Baie-Comeau? What a coincidence!
<P>
	In addition to air security, how air traffic controllers and other 
workers who are currently public servants will be treated is of 
great concern to our party. Can the minister tell us what will 
become of those men and women who have given 5, 10, 15 and, 
for some, 20 years of faithful service to the Canadian public? 
Will the minister dismiss those who refuse to join the new 
private corporation or company? Does the minister intend to 
offer them maybe a ``grandfather'' clause which would allow 
them to remain public servants although working within the new 
air traffic control system?
<P>
	Is the minister aware of the fact that many believe the air 
controllers working for the new entity could have the right to 
strike, which they do not have now? Can the minister confirm or 
deny that rumour? Can he tell us what he intends to do to clear 
things up concerning that essential service? Will the 
government require that seniority and other benefits 
accumulated by theses employees as public servants for the 
Canadian government be respected or will these people be at the 
mercy of every whim of the new managers?
<P>
	If the government maintains that project of privatizing the 
Canadian air control system, will it force the new company to 
abide by the Official Languages Act with regard to services 
offered to users and employees? Will the pilots, private or 
professional, still have access to air control services in the 
language of their choice? Will the employees enjoy the same 
work rules as they have now, for example the right to receive 
training and  communications in French wherever the 
legislation permits?
<P>
	I mention these points, Mr. Speaker, to stress the possible 
impacts of loss of income in the south which would allow grants 
and support for the northern regions.
<P>
	Any privatization project which is of national interest, be it 
the Pearson airport or the air traffic control system, should be 
reviewed with everyone's interests in mind and in such a way 
that citizens in the northern regions or remote areas would be 
treated fairly.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Antoine Dubé (Lévis):</B> Mr. Speaker, I would like to take 
advantage of the debate on Bill C-22 to show how the Quebec 
City airport has been unfairly treated by the federal government 
up until now, to the point that it is slowing down the 
development of Metropolitan Quebec City.
<P>
<B>(1240) </B>
<P>
	What is striking in this bill is the double standard applied by 
the Liberal government when dealing with the airports in 
Toronto and Quebec City. In the case of Quebec City, the Liberal 
government is dragging its feet. But in Toronto, it uses a 
steam-roller approach, overlooking a lot of things, probably 
under the pressure of lobbyists.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, I am starting to understand what some 
Liberal candidates in the Quebec City area meant, during the last 
election campaign, when they mentioned the corridors of power. 
They probably meant the corridors used by lobbyists. But do 
people really want to leave the task of influencing the 
government's actions to the lobbyists? Or would they rather 
have their elected members make representations to the 
government? I believe the latter.
<P>
	Otherwise, Quebec should probably consider speeding up the 
HST project or upgrading the Quebec City airport, to shorten 
delays, since lobbyists for Quebec City appear to be less 
powerful than those for the Toronto airport.
<P>
	For some time now, the federal government has known that 
the Quebec City airport infrastructure is totally inadequate to 
meet the needs of an area where the capital city of all Quebecers 
is located. On June 23, 1993, on the eve of Quebec's national 
holiday, representatives of the federal Conservative government 
held a big ceremony during which they unveiled a new sign and 
announced that Jean Lesage airport in Quebec City would 
henceforth enjoy the status of an international airport. Without 
wanting to minimize the promotional impact of this new status, 
plans to expand Jean Lesage airport are still collecting dust on 
the responsible minister's desk.
<P>
	A simple sign identifying the airport in Quebec City as an 
international facility will not resolve the bottlenecks that occur. 
The international flight passenger waiting area is so small that 
overcrowding occurs on a regular basis, particularly when 
several international chartered  flights carrying hundreds of 
passengers arrive at the same time. To avoid total chaos, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3716"> 3716 </A></B>
<P>
passengers on the last incoming flight must all too often wait to 
disembark.
<P>
	A circus atmosphere prevails when hundreds of passengers 
converge on the sole luggage conveyors in the area reserved for 
international flights and on the customs area. How can we hope 
to attract major international carriers when a short stopover in 
Quebec City on a Paris-Los Angeles flight can mean a delay of 
several hours for passengers who must patiently wait until those 
wishing to disembark can do so and the flight can resume?
<P>
	Under the circumstances, it is not surprising that the many 
past attempts by airline companies to establish international 
links to Quebec City have been quickly abandoned.
<P>
	Another good reason for expanding the airport is Quebec 
City's bid for the Winter Olympic Games in the year 2002. 
According to the Association des gens de l'air du Québec, Jean 
Lesage airport is too small to handle the traffic that would be 
generated by the Olympic Games in eight years' time.
<P>
	The association is of the opinion that, because of its 
bush-league airport, foreign travellers will be left with the 
impression that Quebec City is, and I quote, ``a banana 
republic''. In fact, in our region, people can hardly believe how 
little was done to fix the airport in recent years.
<P>
<B>(1245) </B>
<P>
	Again, the president of the air transportation workers union 
was quoted in a Quebec City daily newspaper as saying: ``The 
main runway was widened so 747s could land. It is all very well 
but runway lights were not even moved, so if that heavy aircraft 
veers slightly off course, it will hit the lights and the necessary 
repairs will slow everything down''.
<P>
	A brief that the air transportation workers union sent to the 
people responsible for the Quebec City airport development 
plan and to Corporation Québec 2002 lists four major 
deficiencies that need to be addressed quickly. First, a runway 
less than 4,000-feet long running parallel to the main runway 
would separate heavy aircraft from lighter aircraft for better 
safety and efficiency.
<P>
	Second, a taxiway network should be developed to allow 
aircraft to quickly leave or enter the main runway, thus reducing 
waiting periods. Third, access ramps must be widened as they 
are getting more and more congested. Passengers must walk 
long distances outside, an embarrassing and sometimes 
dangerous situation, especially in winter.
<P>
	Fourth, customs personnel must be increased. The lack of 
customs officers sometimes creates long and tiring line-ups at 
peak times for international passengers.
<P>
	It is worth pointing out that these recommendations were 
tabled on December 8, 1992. We are still waiting for a concrete 
response from federal officials, something other than simply 
designating as international an airport with such a status but 
without the necessary facilities. Whatever we do, we must not 
make the mistake of minimizing the importance of an adequate 
airport for the 2002 Olympic Games.
<P>
	Salt Lake City will certainly be Quebec City's fiercest rival. It 
even has a truly international airport with all the amenities 
likely to sway the people who will pick the winning city among 
the applicants.
<P>
	The applicant's guide to hosting the 19th Winter Olympic 
Games in 2002, issued by the International Olympic Committee, 
says under ``transportation'' that, as previous experience shows, 
one of the keys to successful Games is an efficient 
transportation system. This guide recommends that applicant 
cities focus on three key areas, namely the transportation of 
people, equipment and luggage, as well as customs clearance. 
This is a very good reason to increase the number of customs 
officers and put in new baggage conveyors at the Quebec City 
airport.
<P>
	Of course, the decision to expand the airport should not be 
based only on the possibility of hosting the 2002 Winter 
Olympic Games. We must consider above all the needs of the 
Quebec City region, before and after the Games. The figures 
quoted in this House on Wednesday by my colleague from 
Louis-Hébert demonstrate the need for expansion due to the 
dramatic increase in transborder and international flights at the 
Quebec City airport between 1988 and 1992.
<P>
	According to Transport Canada's own figures, as quoted by 
the hon. member for Louis-Hébert, transborder flights have 
increased by 179 per cent in Quebec City. In comparison, they 
went up 12.5 per cent in Halifax, 13 per cent in Winnipeg and 15 
per cent in Calgary.
<P>
	I can hear from here the government side argue that 
investments were made to upgrade the runway to accommodate 
jumbo jets like the Boeing 747. It was a very minor 
reconstruction project, a $7.5 million project, while the $33.5 
million five-year capital plan announced in September of 1990 
called for the construction of a new control tower, among other 
things.
<P>
<B>(1250) </B>
<P>
	Now what has come of that plan? I fear that, as usual, this 
government will say it is under consideration, the classic excuse 
to avoid admitting that, again, nothing was done.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3717"> 3717 </A></B>
<P>
	The fact of the matter is that millions of dollars were spent to 
reconstruct the runway, just to prevent grass clippings blown 
away by the 747s' jet engines from blowing back on the runway. 
That is the kind of upgrade the Quebec airport has undergone!
<P>
	But the business community in the Quebec City region have 
been calling attention to the deficiencies of our airport for a 
great many years.
<P>
	Our region's development depends for a large part on 
technological enterprises open on the world and on tourism. 
Quebec has acquired international stature after it was 
declared-the only city in Canada, by the way-World Heritage 
City by UNESCO. Its cultural life and festivals make it a choice 
destination for tourists from around the world. However, our 
development is being compromised because, once again, a 
central government out of touch with local needs is dragging its 
feet.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, like 
my colleagues, I am pleased to speak in the debate on Bill C-22 
and, following them, to shed some light on this bill. This bill 
absolutely must be clarified because, as you heard in everything 
they said, there are grey areas, some very dark grey areas, in this 
bill.
<P>
	A major topic of the government's red book, the real political 
manifesto of the Liberal Party of Canada during the election 
campaign, is to question the disproportionate and decisive 
influence of behind-the-scenes lobbies on government policies.
<P>
	The purpose is to restore the image of this same government 
so that the people again trust their political elite and democracy 
will experience an unprecedented renewal. The Liberal bible 
says: ``We will develop a Code of Conduct for Public Officials 
to guide cabinet ministers, members of Parliament, senators, 
political staff, and public servants in their dealings with 
lobbyists''.
<P>
	Indeed, a key word in the Liberals' election campaign was 
openness. However, the reality is quite different. Instead, it 
shows this party's shameless opportunism and its thirst for 
power with a view to consolidating the political and financial 
establishment in Canada.
<P>
	In the attempted privatization of Pearson airport in Toronto, 
there is a series of troubling facts that make one seriously 
question the openness of the Liberal government and of the 
previous government.
<P>
	Bill C-22 is a unique opportunity for the Bloc Quebecois to 
shed light on all the lobbyists who are the real leaders in the old 
parties, a shadowy area in Canadian politics, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	When the federal government published its policy on airport 
management in Canada in the spring of 1987, it showed that it 
intended to turn airport management over to local authorities, 
such as provincial governments, municipalities or boards 
authorized by federal or provincial legislation. Transport 
Canada is to provide a  safe and efficient airport system. This 
can be done through appropriate legislation and financial 
support, without Transport Canada owning an airport.
<P>
	In the summer of that year, the Conservative government 
designated Claridge Properties Inc. to build and operate 
terminal 3 at Pearson. Since then, this consortium owned by 
Charles Bronfman has had a monopoly. In the first half of the 
1990s, he, with the help of the Conservative Party, was in a 
position to become the sole manager of the airport's three 
terminals. Not more than a month after his triumph in English 
Canada last November, the Prime Minister, acting completely 
contrary to a spirit of openness, asked a former Ontario Liberal 
minister, Mr. Nixon, to conduct an inquiry behind closed doors, 
yes, in secret, on this incipient monopoly. As you know, doing 
something behind closed doors is just the opposite of ensuring 
transparency. Yet, this is the way these old parties work. Mr. 
Nixon writes in his report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Terminal 3 will be privately based and operated for a further 57 years. To 
contemplate the privatization of the remaining two terminals of this public asset 
is, in my view, contrary to the public good.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1255) </B>
<P>
	In March 1992, the government blatantly contradicted its 
political statement by officially requesting proposals for the 
privatization of terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson airport. The 
deadline for proposals was 90 days. A 90-day period in this case 
was not normal, because this was no ordinary call for tenders, 
since it involved a very complex contract over 57 years. So, why 
have such a short bidding period, if not to favour those firms 
which had already expressed an interest, including Claridge 
Properties Inc. and Paxport, which had already submitted a 
privatization plan in 1989?
<P>
	Let me give you some details on Paxport. The Don Matthews 
Group, which has a 40 per cent interest in this consortium, has 
links to the Progressive Conservative Party and the Liberal 
Party. Mr. Matthews was chairman of Brian Mulroney's 
leadership campaign and is a former chairman of the 
Conservative Party. When Paxport made its bid following the 
government offer to privatize terminals 1 and 2 at Pearson, its 
president was Ray Hession, a former deputy minister of Industry 
and senior civil servant with Supply and Services where 
contracts are awarded. In other words, all the key players were 
related to the previous Liberal governments. The president of 
Paxport Inc. himself hired the group of lobbyists which was to 
work on the privatization project for the benefit of the company. 
He then resigned from his position as president in 1992, once 
approval of Paxport's bid was confirmed by the government. 
And there you have it.
<P>
	In February 1993, Paxport and Claridge Properties Inc. 
merged and became T1 T2 Limited Partnership. One of the 
reasons Paxport's bid had been accepted was that it would create 
healthy competition between the manager of terminals 1 and 2, 
Paxport, and the manager of  terminal 3, Claridge. 
Consequently, the merging of the two companies had the effect 
of totally eliminating any such competition. Not to mention that 
Claridge 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3718"> 3718 </A></B>
<P>
managed to acquire a 66 per cent interest in the consortium. So, 
this is a monopoly.
<P>
	Claridge Properties Inc. has very close ties to the Liberal 
Party of Canada. Senator Léo Kolber, who sat on the board of 
directors of Claridge when the agreements were signed, is the 
same guy who held a benefit dinner at his home, in Westmount, 
for the Liberal Party, at $1,000 per guest, where the guest of 
honour was the current Prime Minister. Now you see why they 
tried to keep this benefit dinner secret.
<P>
	Herb Metcalfe, former party organizer for the current Prime 
Minister, is a lobbyist at Capital Hill Group and represents 
Claridge Properties. Ramsay Withers, former deputy minister of 
Transport at the time the request for proposals concerning 
Terminal 3 at Pearson airport went out, is a Liberal lobbyist who 
has very close ties to the current Prime Minister.
<P>
	Given these facts, we have to wonder about the nature of this 
government and about its ties to the Toronto financial 
establishment. What about the openness they promised us? 
What about the ethics? Be serious. What we have here is 
cover-up and patronage benefiting some private interests at the 
expense of Canadian taxpayers, and particularly middle-class 
citizens, which the government always picks on, and the 
underprivileged. Let us be blunt. The Liberal Party of Canada 
has always been in cahoots with the financial establishment.
<P>
	On October 7, 1993, the legal agreement on the privatization 
of Terminals 1 and 2 was signed. However, Claridge Properties 
had taken control of T1 T2 Partnership Inc. a few months before, 
in May of 1993. So, the October agreement was between the 
government and Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1300) </B>
<P>
	What is Pearson Development? It is a joint venture 
partnership which manages operations at all three Pearson 
airport terminals. Claridge Properties, which is the contractor 
for terminal 3, holds a 66 per cent interest in Pearson 
Development and is also the majority shareholder in Paxport, 
which was awarded the contract in December 1992 for the 
privatization of Terminals 1 and 2. Once again, so much for 
transparency and ethics! The least we could say is that the 
Pearson deal is nothing more than the takeover of all three 
terminals by a financial power that has a friendly relationship 
with a so-called democratic government.
<P>
	Clearly, whether the government is Liberal or Conservative, it 
is all the same. Today more than ever before, it is increasingly 
obvious that powerful financial interests, to achieve their ends, 
will put at the head of the Canadian government a friend who 
will stop at nothing to stay in power, a person who will have 
absolutely no regard for the most fundamental rule of 
transparency and ethics.
<P>
	Due to the troubling circumstances under which the 1993 
agreement was negotiated and executed-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I am sorry but your 
ten-minute period has expired. We have to move on.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> May I conclude my 
remarks?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> I will leave it to the hon. 
members. If they give unanimous consent, I have no objection.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to allow the member for 
Richmond-Wolfe to conclude his remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Leroux:</B> Mr. Speaker, because its credibility is at stake 
here, the government has no other choice but to confirm the need 
for a commission of inquiry to examine this matter as soon as 
possible. We need an inquiry.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Roger Pomerleau (Anjou-Rivière-des-Prairies):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, most of my Bloc Quebecois colleagues who have taken 
part in the debate on Bill C-22 so far looked at it in terms of 
government openness, and all of them came to the obvious 
conclusion that a royal commission of enquiry should be set up 
to look into the whole issue of the privatization of Pearson 
airport.
<P>
	In the speech he just made, my colleague for 
Brome-Missisquoi brought out quite well the large number of 
friends of the government, both Conservative and Liberal, who 
were involved or had a hand into this matter, which represents 
millions of dollars.
<P>
	My colleague for Mégantic-Compton-Stanstead told us 
how this piece of legislation before the House today was put 
together: under clause 7, no action may be instituted against the 
government by any company that could have grievances against 
it, but clause 10 allows the minister to make a direct but secret 
settlement with people who might want to claim some small 
compensation.
<P>
	Besides, the Nixon Report, commissioned by the Prime 
Minister, concludes along the same lines. I would like to quote 
its conclusion:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My review has left me with but one conclusion. To leave in place an 
inadequate contract arrived at through such a flawed process and under the 
shadow of possible political manipulation is unacceptable. I therefore 
recommend that it be cancelled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Leading to that conclusion, Mr. Nixon said: ``Failure to make 
public the full identity of the participants in the agreement and 
other salient terms of the contract inevitably raises public 
suspicion''.
<P>
	In my opinion, when the government proposes to privatize a 
Crown asset, openness should be mandatory and the public 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3719"> 3719 </A></B>
<P>
should be entitled to know all the details in the agreement. That 
is why, on the whole, we are asking for an enquiry in that matter.
<P>
	I would also like to quote some remarks made by the hon. 
member opposite for York South-Weston and reported in the 
media. They were reported in the November 26, 1993 issue of 
the <I>Ottawa Citizen</I>, and I quote:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``I didn't spend the last nine years in Ottawa bashing Tory 
sleaze to have it occur in our party or for our party to condone 
it''.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Some other remarks were also reported by the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
where he was quoted as saying:
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	``This will be a true test of Mr. Chrétien's commitment to 
integrity in government and I have considerable confidence in 
him that he will kill the deal''.
<P>
<B>(1305) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Of course, this is the bill that kills the deal. The only problem 
is that giving the Minister of Transport discretionary powers to 
compensate people party to this behind-the-scenes deal is 
tantamount to having the fox in charge of the chicken coop, and 
the Bloc is obviously against that.
<P>
	Why was the privatization of Pearson airport ever considered 
to begin with? It is quite simple. Pearson airport makes money. 
Incidentally, it is one of the very few money-making airports in 
Canada. Why does it make money? Because everything was 
done to put it in that position.
<P>
	The Mirabel airport was built many years ago because the 
Montreal airport was crowded with international flights. A few 
months after Mirabel was built, the ban on international flights 
landing directly in Toronto without a stop-over at Mirabel was 
lifted. After that, all international flights could land directly in 
Toronto without stopping first in Mirabel.
<P>
	What did that mean? It meant killing Mirabel and increasing 
the number of international flights landing directly in Toronto. 
Today, Mirabel airport is a white elephant and we are on the 
verge of expanding Pearson airport at the cost of millions of 
dollars, several million of which will come from Quebec.
<P>
	The same pattern can be seen in the case of the port of 
Montreal, with the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway. Over 
the years, that system diverted traffic from Montreal to Toronto. 
The port of Montreal is failing and the one in Toronto is thriving.
<P>
	The same thing happened with the Borden line. It was 
recommended by the Borden commission, on which not a single 
Quebecer sat. It resulted in the petrochemical industry of the 
east end of Montreal being transferred to Sarnia.
<P>
	The Auto Pact is another example. It was signed with the 
United Stated, which goes to prove beyond the shade of a doubt 
that a small country like Canada can strike deals with a giant 
such as the United States. But that deal was made for Ontario. 
Quebec did not get anything out of it.
<P>
	What is the logic behind all this? They want Ontario to be the 
economic heart of Canada. This is a Canadian way of thinking. 
Concentrate all the economic activity in Ontario. Unfortunately, 
this concentration is to the detriment of Quebec. In the four 
points I just mentioned, thousands of jobs were lost in Quebec.
<P>
	Once Toronto's and Ontario's international attraction is 
established, many companies deciding to come to Canada will 
follow the same logic which says: ``If you want to do business, 
go where the business is''. So they all go to Toronto or elsewhere 
in Ontario because that is where the business is.
<P>
	Once this attraction has become extremely strong, it even 
drains Quebec's own companies. And I am referring to 
companies like Cadbury, Black and Decker, Electrolux, 
Habitant Soups, which all left Quebec because there were better 
opportunities in Toronto. Of course, this endless corporate 
exodus is responsible for the loss of hundreds of thousands of 
jobs in Quebec. As we speak, the media report that there are 
790,000 welfare recipients and 400,000 unemployed workers in 
Quebec. And the media-and I heard it again this morning-tell 
us about an economic recovery.
<P>
	There is no economic recovery, Mr. Speaker, let us not kid 
ourselves. The Prime Minister of Canada, under the 
circumstances, must find a culprit because he does not want to 
admit the phenomenon I just described. Of course someone to 
blame is always found, as we saw recently in the House: the 
unemployed and the welfare recipients, they are to blame.
<P>
	So they are officially accused of being beer drinkers slouched 
in front of their TV, this after their jobs have been taken away. 
Unfortunately all these people are in fact looking for a job. Since 
he got a very strong reaction, the Prime Minister is attempting to 
find other reasons why the situation is bad, even if the corporate 
exodus from Quebec to Ontario is very clear. And now the Prime 
Minister has called all of Quebec's legitimate and historical 
demands whims.
<P>
	I would like to say a few words on this. All the Premiers of 
Quebec, whatever their political party, as far back as I can 
remember-and I am not very old, but I still remember 
it-always said the same thing.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3720"> 3720 </A></B>
<P>
	In the mid-1950s, Maurice Duplessis wanted Ottawa to give 
Quebec back its due. This was not a whim on his part; he said it 
because he believed that we were being had by Ottawa.
<P>
<B>(1310) </B>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Jean Lesage liked to use the expression 
``masters in our own house''; that was no whim. He was simply 
convinced that we were not in charge of our own affairs and that 
Ottawa always controlled everything.
<P>
	A few years later, Daniel Johnson used the expression 
``equality or independence''. That was not a whim either. He 
simply felt that, with the way things were in Canada, Quebec 
was not getting equal treatment. The situation was such that 
ultimately Ottawa always decided what was best for Quebec.
<P>
	Of course, several years after that, René Lévesque began to 
champion the cause of Quebec sovereignty. And that was no 
whim either. He believed that sovereignty was the only way for 
Quebecers to become masters in their own home.
<P>
	The Bélanger-Campeau Commission came to the same 
conclusion. Either Canadian federalism undergoes a radical 
change to ensure that Quebec is given its fair share, or Quebec 
becomes sovereign. That conclusion was certainly no whim. It 
reflected the clear consensus of all Quebecers who appeared 
before the Commission.
<P>
	I see, Mr. Speaker, that you are indicating that I have one 
minute remaining. There is so much more that I could say. When 
we say that we do not want the federal government to intrude 
into our field of jurisdiction with respect to vocational training, 
it is no whim. This is the unanimous position of the National 
Assembly.
<P>
	The Prime Minister claims that disaster will ensue if the 
separatists-this is the word he used-are elected. Need I 
remind him that Moody's, which is certainly not a den of nasty 
separatists, has pointed out to him that the debt, not the political 
situation, is responsible for what ails Canada. When the Liberals 
came to power in 1980, the debt stood at $80 million. They 
managed to increase it to roughly $200 million. Under the 
Conservatives, the debt rose from $200 million to $500 million. 
Now the Liberals, in office once more, are saying that the debt 
will come in at about $600 million.
<P>
	It does not take a genius to figure out why our bankers are 
nervous. The fault does not lie with the nasty separatists. They 
are nervous because they are owed money. May I conclude, Mr. 
Speaker?
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> If I recall correctly, I was 
asked yesterday if, by allowing one hon. member to speak 
longer, I was in fact impinging on another member's speaking 
time. We are supposed to adjourn at 1.30 p.m. this afternoon. I 
will let your colleagues decide whether they will let you 
conclude your remarks, briefly.
<P>
	Is there unanimous consent to allow the hon. member to 
conclude his remarks?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Pomerleau:</B> To make it short, Mr. Speaker, I will skip a 
few things. Let us just say that we request a royal commission 
into the Pearson airport transaction. It is obvious from all the 
facts stated in this place that there has been some degree of 
scheming. We do not want any dealings to take place outside of 
this House. If certain facts need to be disclosed to the public, we 
want them to be made public here, before this House, so that the 
people can have a good idea of what this is about.
<P>
	<B>The Speaker:</B> I wish to thank the hon. member for his 
co-operation. On debate, the hon. member for Jonquière.
<P>
	<B>Mr. André Caron (Jonquière):</B> Mr. Speaker, in the last days 
of its second mandate and in the middle of an election campaign, 
the previous government privatized Terminals 1 and 2 at 
Pearson airport in Toronto by signing an agreement with a 
company called T1 T2 Limited Partnership. After defeating the 
Conservatives on October 25, the Liberal Party came to power 
planning to cancel this deal, as promised during the election 
campaign.
<P>
	On October 28, the Prime Minister commissioned Mr. Robert 
Nixon, former treasurer of a Liberal Ontario government, to 
investigate this controversial agreement. The bill before us 
today gives effect to Mr. Nixon's recommendation to cancel the 
privatization agreement made between the government of 
Canada and the T1 T2 Limited Partnership consortium.
<P>
	Let me remind you that the principal shareholders of this 
company are the fabulously wealthy Charles Bronfman and Mr. 
Don Mathews, Brian Mulroney's leadership campaign manager 
and former fund-raising campaign president for the 
Conservative Party.
<P>
	In light of the exceptional circumstances under which this 
agreement was made and the many disquieting facts 
surrounding it, and also in light of the findings of the Nixon 
Report, simply cancelling the contract will do very little to 
clarify matters for the public, which is expecting more from the 
government.
<P>
	The public wants light to be shed on the role played by lobby 
groups in this whole business. According to the Nixon Report, 
lobbyists had put a great deal of pressure on the Conservative 
political staff as well as on senior government officials.
<P>
<B>(1315) </B>
<P>
	Mr. Nixon says that lobbyists, by their actions, led the 
government to make dubious decisions. He said, and I quote: It 
is clear that the lobbyists played a prominent part in attempting 
to affect the decisions that were reached, going far beyond the 
concept of ``consulting''. With regards to lobbyists' influence 
on government officials, he added: ``When senior bureaucrats 
involved in the negotiation for the government of Canada feel 
that their actions and decisions are being heavily affected by  
lobbyists, as occurred here, the role of the latter has in my view, 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3721"> 3721 </A></B>
<P>
exceeded permissible norms''. Permissible norms were 
exceeded in the Pearson airport affair. Such statements cannot 
remain unanswered.
<P>
	Obviously, excessive lobbying was used with Conservative 
politicians and federal officials in order to influence their 
decisions. It seems evident that the public service integrity and 
impartiality are being questioned by the findings of Mr. Nixon's 
inquiry. In view of these circumstances, the government cannot 
turn a blind eye on this affair and just cancel the Pearson airport 
privatization deal, by secretly compensating people who may 
have lost money, as it intends to do with this bill before us.
<P>
	A royal commission of inquiry must be established to shed 
light on this dubious transaction which looks increasingly like a 
political and financial scandal as the facts come out. Quebecers 
and Canadiens must be told the truth about the role attributed by 
the media to Bill Box, Pat MacAdam, Fred Doucet, Harry Near, 
Hugh Riopelle, and Garry Ouellette, all lobbyists linked to the 
Conservative Party, former senior officials or members of Mr. 
Mulroney's party political staff. One could add to that list 
Ramsey Withers, a Liberal lobbyist and former deputy minister 
of Transport, and Ray Hession, former deputy minister of 
Industry and senior official of the Department of Supply and 
Services under Trudeau.
<P>
	A royal commission of inquiry will be able to throw some 
light on this whole affair and on the role played by these persons. 
If nothing reprehensible is found, great, we will be pleased to 
know it. This is not all. The government has to learn a lesson 
from all this and to take this opportunity to conduct a 
comprehensive review of the legislation governing lobbying in 
Canada.
<P>
	In a free and democratic society as ours, where citizens have 
the right to express their views, lobbying is part of the 
decision-making process. Citizens as well as organized groups 
may influence the government decisions if they feel it is in the 
public interest. In the United States, lobbying is 
institutionalized, part of the political scene and well regulated. 
In order to prevent undue influence of lobbyists on the 
government, it is essential that their activities be governed by 
stricter legislation than what we presently have in Canada, 
which has been totally inefficient as far as the Pearson airport 
issue is concerned.
<P>
	The present Lobbyists Registration Act identifies two 
categories of lobbyist groups. These are: professional lobbyists 
who have contracts with third parties and approach politicians 
and civil servants in order to influence them; and the other 
lobbyists who, because of their functions, may have to approach 
federal civil servants or politicians to defend their interests; 
those are, for instance, unions or professional associations 
seeking the support of the government on a specific piece of 
legislation.
<P>
	As for disclosure of their activities, professional lobbyists 
must give the name of their employer, the name and address of 
their clients and the purpose of their approach. Those of the 
second group are required to give only their name and the name 
of the organisation for which they are working.
<P>
	Like the Standing Committee on Consumer and Corporate 
Affairs and Government Operations in its report, I think that 
interest groups of all categories should be required to follow the 
same rules of disclosure. Since the purpose of interest groups is 
essentially to influence the decision-making process of the 
government, it seems normal that they all be subjected to the 
same rules.
<P>
<B>(1320) </B>
<P>
	In brief, time has come for lobbyists to be required to disclose 
the nature and object of their activities with governmental 
authorities, as well as the financial benefits they receive for 
their services.
<P>
	Moreover, we must protect senior public servants against the 
schemes of interest groups.
<P>
	As a matter of fact, the Nixon report reveals that many senior 
public servants were exposed to considerable pressure by 
lobbyists who were trying to influence their decisions regarding 
the privatization of the airport. It even points out that, and I 
quote: ``Indeed this element of pressure resulted in several civil 
servants being re-assigned or requesting transfer from the 
project''.
<P>
	The investigator found that some government officials 
involved in the privatization of Pearson airport had to quit 
working on that matter because the pressures from lobbyists 
were too strong and their integrity was in jeopardy.
<P>
	Given those disclosures, which are very disturbing-to say 
the least-and in order to avoid any recurrence of such things, 
Mr. Speaker, all public office holders must be required by law to 
disclose all contacts they have with lobbyists. Canadians and 
Quebecers have a right to know who is trying to influence 
government officials, and why.
<P>
	In conclusion, at a time when our fellow citizens are asking 
governments to be more open, we have no other choice than to 
demand that a royal commission of inquiry be established to 
clarify the strange events that surrounded the privatization of 
Pearson airport.
<P>
	The government must also clean up lobbying in Canada. It has 
to, because of the scandal that surrounded the privatization of 
Pearson airport. We have to put an end to the maneuvering by 
friends of the government and to influence peddling, which 
tarnish the reputation of our democratic institutions and that of 
the people working in those institutions.
<P>
	<B>Mrs. Madeleine Dalphond-Guiral (Laval Centre):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, Bill C-22 has been the focus of debates in this House 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3722"> 3722 </A></B>
<P>
since April 26. It is now at the second reading stage before being 
referred to a committee.
<P>
	However, it seems the decision of the House will have to wait 
because the Official Opposition clearly intends to show that 
supporting Bill C-22 is tantamount to supporting 
non-transparency. Otherwise, the Prime Minister, who 
professes to be the best advocate of transparency, would never 
forgive us.
<P>
	Since October 25, 1993, things have been happening in 
Canada; among others, the House received a new group of 
members for whom political transparency is just a ploy if there 
are no strict statutory rules governing the democratic financing 
of political parties. The impact of our arrival was traumatic for 
Canada. But just like some hard-to-swallow pill, I believe this 
impact can only be beneficial.
<P>
	This debate on Bill C-22, driven firmly and efficiently by the 
Official Opposition, is also educational since it proves clearly 
that the present laxity of the federal rules on political parties' 
financing is contrary to the best interests of society.
<P>
	Traditionally, oppositions, like those of the 34 previous 
Parliaments, hesitated, with good reason, to point a finger at 
friends of the party in place because any accusation on their part 
had a 90 per cent chance of turning into a boomerang as fierce as 
the attacks themselves. But the opposition in this 35th 
Parliament intends to prove that the absence of legislation on the 
financing of political parties can only create a vicious circle 
with a very simple and clear-cut rationale.
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, no one has the right to bite the hand that feeds 
him, much less this government. It's an open secret: this 
government considers that corporate contributions to the 
election funds of traditional federal parties are as essential as 
bread and butter. There is enough butter left to clog the most 
performing liver. Otherwise, how can we explain the presence of 
clause 10 in this bill, which, for all intents and purposes, 
authorizes the Cabinet to compensate Limited Partnership, if it 
considers appropriate to do so? I looked into my crystal ball and 
I could see, without any doubt, that the government will pay a 
reasonable compensation to the groups connected with the 
Pearson Development Corporation.
<P>
<B>(1325) </B>
<P>
	But can a reasonable government take upon itself to pay a 
reasonable financial compensation when the whole contract, 
according to Mr. Robert Nixon, was anything but reasonable? 
You can judge for yourself, since Mr. Nixon wrote the following 
in his report:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>My review has left me with but one conclusion. To leave in place an 
inadequate contract arrived at with such a flawed process and under the shadow 
of possible political manipulation is unacceptable. I recommend to you that the 
contract be cancelled.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	In his wisdom, the Prime Minister followed the 
recommendation of his investigator. Indeed, Mr. Robert  Nixon, 
the former Treasurer of Ontario under the Liberal government of 
David Peterson, and a prominent member of the Liberal Party of 
Ontario, knew what he was talking about.
<P>
	I will repeat my question: Is it reasonable to pay 
compensation as a result of the reasonable cancellation of an 
unreasonable deal? Any citizen with any degree of common 
sense will answer a resounding no. Why would the government 
be tempted to answer in the affirmative? We can safely assume 
that the reasons are many, but I will suggest two.
<P>
	Answer no. 1: You do not bite the hand that feeds you, 
especially when that hand is called Charles Bronfman, whose 
links with the Liberal Party are well known; or Leo Kolber, a 
Liberal senator and host of benefit diner at $1000 a plate during 
the election campaign; or Herb Metcalfe, well-known lobbyist 
and, surprisingly, former organizer of the present Prime 
Minister, one job preparing the way for the other I suppose; or 
Ramsey Withers, another Liberal lobbyist; or Ray Hession, 
former Deputy Minister of Industry during the Trudeau era.
<P>
	Answer no. 2: You do not bite the hand that feeds others. You 
never know. Even if the others seem to be dying, there might be a 
miracle, they might come back to life. Don Matthews was 
chairman of the leadership campaign of Brian Mulroney in 
1983.
<P>
	I have other names, but time is getting short and since I want 
to give you my conclusion, I will skip them. Besides, they are 
well known.
<P>
	So, we have come full circle. The government, which has been 
bragging for a long time about openness, has no choice but to act 
according to its commitments.
<P>
	Since October 25, the government has made a number of 
decisions. In Quebec, it cancelled the helicopter contract, but 
where are the compensations for lost jobs? Do we have any 
expectation of industrial reconversion? No. True, Quebec 
workers are not the ones who contribute the most to the finances 
of the Liberal Party of Canada.
<P>
	In Toronto, the Pearson airport deal is cancelled. In that case 
we know where compensations are going to go. Canadians and 
Quebecers know it too. The jobs will be saved, and friends of 
Pearson Development Corporation will be rewarded-I mean 
compensated, Mr. Speaker.
<P>
	On the one hand, contracts are cancelled and on the other 
hand, verbal agreements are carried out, which is hardly 
conceivable. Members will understand that I am referring to the 
Ginn Publishing deal.
<P>
	I can appreciate that our colleagues opposite think it is time to 
stop quibbling about the issue. In my career as a teacher, I have 
learned that even a clear message will not necessarily be 
understood by everyone. We believe that, if we repeat it enough, 
the population of Canada will finally come to understand and 
will ask the government  to implement a law on democratic 
funding of political parties, for the sake of transparency.
<P>
<B></B>
<P>

<B><A NAME="3723"> 3723 </A></B>
<P>
<B>(1330) </B>
<P>
	The government should take the Quebec legislation as a 
model in that matter. Besides, there is no reason to be ashamed 
of trailing behind Quebec on that issue. In that field as in many 
others, Quebec does not see things the same way, perhaps on 
account of its difference.
<P>
	I can assure you, Mr. Speaker, that when Quebec decides to 
cut the Canadian trailer loose, my country will be glad to 
collaborate with its neighbour in order to help bring more justice 
and equity to our world.

an act to provide for the recall of members of the House of 
Commons, be read the second time and referred to a committee.
<P>
	She said: Mr. Speaker, for a moment I thought we had 
unanimous consent to put it straight through the House; that 
would have been absolutely marvellous.
<P>
	It is a real pleasure for me to stand in the House today to bring 
forward an issue that many Canadians, at least outside the 
House, are talking about probably far more regularly than some 
of our colleagues would like to acknowledge.
<P>
	Canadians are seeking dynamic and constructive change in 
their political institutions; not just tinkering with this or that but 
real change. They are demanding that political institutions and 
politicians listen to them, consult with them, and ultimately be 
accountable to them.
<P>
	Over the past 25 years governments have expanded their 
scope of activities enormously and touched people's daily lives 
in many ways. Canadians want an increasing share in decisions 
that affect their lives and their pocketbooks. During the same 25 
years governments have become very large, very complex, and 
are often out of touch with ordinary citizens.
<P>
	One need only reflect on the findings a couple of years ago of 
the Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, of course referred to as 
the Spicer report, to sense the frustration and anger felt by 
Canadians toward government in the recent past. The defeat of 
the Charlottetown accord in October 1992 was seen by many as a 
massive rejection of the typical or traditional style of leadership 
in Canada.
<P>
	Members will know from media reports, from a wide variety 
of polls and from their own door to door experience in the last 
election, that many Canadians do not even think it worthwhile to 
participate in the political process. Too many have become 
disillusioned, alienated and cynical about political parties, 
politicians themselves and government in general, perhaps in 
some cases with good reason, sad to say, through failure of 
politicians to listen, failure to consult, and failure to be 
accountable at all times to the people who elected them.
<P>
	We in the 35th Parliament have an opportunity to change this, 
to rectify these shortcomings, and to improve the quality of 
representative democracy in the country. Through a series of 
modest, pragmatic, parliamentary reforms we can improve this 
in future parliaments and work to restore confidence and pride 
among Canadians in our political institutions. Nothing would be 
more refreshing than that. We would have people coming from 
sea to sea to the Chamber and saying: ``Yes, this place is real; it 
is practical and it works''.
<P>
	Recall legislation is one of those sensible, pragmatic, 
progressive parliamentary reforms that the House should 
legislate. Recall is a parliamentary reform whose time has 
come.
<P>
	There is much misinformation about recall. I would like to 
quash some of the misinformation about recall legislation. I 
certainly hope this may change the speeches on the other side of 
the House that are already prepared. I would like to talk also 
about the virtues of recall legislation because I believe they far 
outweigh any misinformation or myth. Otherwise I would not be 
introducing the bill.
<P>
<B>(1335) </B>
<P>
	I think is important that we remember the key words again, to 
listen, to consult and ultimately to be accountable to their 
employers, the voters in their particular districts who hired them 
and brought them into office.
<P>
	Recall legislation would make sure that there was benefit both 
to our constituents who voted us in and to ourselves. There has 
to be benefit on both sides. It is not going to be just all good for 
them or all good for us who sit within the sanctity of these halls.
<P>
	The opponents of recall suggest at least three bogeymen in 
expressing their opposition. First, they say that recall is a 
procedure that has failed when tried in other jurisdictions. In 
other words it has not worked so it will not work. That certainly 
is inappropriate.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3724"> 3724 </A></B>
<P>
	Second is that recall would be used mischievously for partisan 
purposes. For example, high profile government members such 
as cabinet ministers or my friend from Broadview-Greenwood 
who certainly is high profile would be subjected to harassment. 
We would hate such a thing to happen.
<P>
	Third, people will say that recall would encourage short term 
or parochial thinking by members to the detriment of the long 
term common interest of all Canadians.
<P>
	If we fall for any one of those three myths we are saying that 
the Canadian public does not have common sense. I am not sure 
there is anyone in this House who would dare say such a thing, 
especially after the fall of Meech Lake, after the fall of the 
Charlottetown accord and after last fall's general election where 
we saw incredible changes in this House of Commons.
<P>
	Hon. members will know that recall has been a facet of the 
Swiss system of direct democracy for a long period of time and 
it is well regarded in that country. Fifteen states in the United 
States of America employ recall for elected state officials and 
two additional states, Hawaii and Utah, are now actively 
considering recall legislation.
<P>
	This is not ground breaking, this is nothing totally radical. It 
is not the Canadian way of course to do anything radical. We 
would be following other countries that have brought in 
legislation on recall and which have proved substantially that it 
works well. Thirty-six states provide for recall of locally 
elected officials. No American state has ever repealed recall 
legislation once it was established. I think that tells us volumes.
<P>
	The United States has 36 states that have recall in place. They 
have never once repealed recall legislation. Something about it 
must work.
<P>
	Of course we as members of Parliament know that it is not 
maybe so much the exact act of recall but it is the threat of recall 
where members must be looking over their shoulders all the 
time, not so much with a fine bunch as this, but people are 
saying: ``We do not think he or she is doing their job well''. We 
would be continually looking over our shoulder realizing that 
somebody stands there with a chain to bring us back into line if 
we stand out of line.
<P>
	That whole thing is so important. There would be members in 
this House as they have done any number of times even in the 
life of this Parliament, who would say: ``Oh, yes Deborah, but 
Alberta brought it in and then repealed it''.
<P>
	As we know recall legislation was brought in by Premier 
William Aberhart in 1936. It was repealed. But it was repealed 
because of some very serious weaknesses in it. They were 
basically that people could buy off names for a petition. My 
recall bill has made sure that cannot happen. When that bill was 
repealed, and we want to make sure that it is on the record in 
<I>Hansard</I> one more time, Premier William Aberhart and Ernest 
Manning who was a senior cabinet minister then, the father of  
Preston Manning the leader of the Reform Party, the hon. 
member for Calgary Southwest, in fact voted against the repeal. 
We can honestly say it was not their fault. They brought in the 
legislation but it was repealed by a bunch of backbenchers who 
thought there were real serious weaknesses in it.
<P>
	Let us turn and look at the positive side because that is where 
we gain the most. Let us look at Switzerland and the 36 
American states in assessing the success of recall. The charge 
that recall would be used in a frivolous manner by defeated 
parties or special interest groups to harass high profile 
government members such as cabinet ministers does not stand 
up under examination. Who would benefit by such actions?
<P>
	Political parties do not wish to appear frivolous. Dear knows 
they may wish to appear to be any number of other things. But I 
am not sure that political parties go out to seek the goal of being 
frivolous. Not one.
<P>
<B>(1340 ) </B>
<P>
	Second, not all the losing parties in a constituency have an 
interest in a byelection at a particular moment. They would not 
say: ``Let us defeat that person immediately and have a 
byelection''. As all of us well know, we are exhausted after a 
general election and much work has to be done for the new 
Parliament. By making the threshold high enough people will 
not be tempted to be foolish and say: ``Let us unseat that 
person''.
<P>
	Most important, political parties do not have the degree of 
authority over their members between elections for such 
nonsense to occur. There is no way anyone from any political 
party in this House of Commons would have their leadership 
say: ``We demand that you trigger a byelection to force that MP 
who won the election out of office''. I do not believe that would 
happen. It takes an incredible amount of time, energy and money 
to get the process going. I do not think political parties would do 
that just to appear frivolous.
<P>
	The second myth, the view that voters can be shamelessly 
manipulated between elections, shows little trust in the electors. 
If anything has been learned from the last five or ten years of 
Canadian history it is that we should trust the electors. Some of 
us might think they made some wrong choices at a particular 
time. There are some Reform Party candidates I would have 
loved to have seen in office because they would have made 
excellent MPs.
<P>
	At the same time, I know we must trust the common wisdom 
of the electors. Therefore, when we say the people have spoken 
on election day we must mean it. We must be able to say that the 
electors spoke and this is the way it is. Sure, maybe those of us 
on this side of the House wish the numbers had been different. 
Who knows, maybe some on that side wish the numbers had 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3725"> 3725 </A></B>
<P>
been different as well. However, they were voted in by people 
who care about their country and we must not dispute that.
<P>
	These are the same electors who showed wisdom and 
judgment during the general election. Surely they can be trusted 
to show the same wisdom and judgment when faced with a 
petition for recall.
<P>
	It cannot be said on the other side of the House: ``We were 
voted in with a huge majority so we think all the electors are 
very wise'' and then this afternoon stand up in this House of 
Commons and say: ``MP recall is ridiculous for any number of 
reasons'', by intimating that the electors could not fall for such 
foolishness. It does not work.
<P>
	The third charge against recall and another myth I would like 
to dispel is that members might become very parochial to the 
detriment of implementing the government's mandate. Similar 
to my previous comment, this view shows little trust in the 
intelligence or the judgment of the electors. In addition, it shows 
no confidence in the ability or judgment of the ordinary member 
of Parliament.
<P>
	I think it is always seen by MPs who are safe and cosy in this 
place after being elected that they are on the payroll as it were 
for four or five years, to say: ``Well MP recall is negative. It can 
never do me, as a member of Parliament, any good''.
<P>
	Let me talk about the positive side of recall for an MP. If I am 
doing my job to the best of my ability or if my neighbour is 
doing his best job, then why would they be able to get an 
enormous number of constituents to sign a recall petition 
against him? There would be a great deal of difficulty in getting 
the number of people necessary to sign under my Bill C-210. It 
would then show a vote of confidence in the member for 
Kindersley-Lloydminster. If they were not able to rustle up 
enough names to vote against him that would not be a negative 
thing, it would be positive. It would show he has the confidence 
of his electors.
<P>
	It would be a marvellous exercise to see recall in action. For 
constituents not to be able to get enough signatures together on a 
petition, what a vote of confidence that would be for my friend 
here to say: ``Wow, they could not get enough people together. 
That means they generally believe in me and what I am doing''. 
That would be healthy, refreshing and long overdue at this point.
<P>
	The charges against recall contain little substance and much 
misinformation.
<P>
	There have been quotations in the House in the last several 
days. Let me add a quote by Thomas E. Cronin in his discussion 
of the pros and cons of recall in his book entitled <I>Direct 
Democracy: The Politics of Initiative, Referendum and Recall</I> 
put out by Harvard University Press in 1989. Thomas Cronin 
states:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Today's critics of the recall device-</BLOCKQUOTE>
I suspect there may be some of them in the Chamber today.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>-continue to view it as an invitation to unruly, impatient action and as a 
potential hazard to representative government. They also say it is another media 
age factor that could weaken the party system.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>(1345) </B>
<P>
	Then he says, to close his comments:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>No evidence exists to support either contention.</BLOCKQUOTE>
	Beware anyone who might stand up in the Chamber this 
afternoon, and say that such a thing would not work because 
Thomas Cronin has said there is no evidence at all to support the 
contention that member of Parliament recall is weak.
<P>
	When I last spoke on this bill, as I have done several times 
because I believe in it, I emphasized that members have nothing 
to fear from its introduction. The bill contains a number of 
sensible provisions to prevent its mischievous use and ensures 
strict regulation in its application.
<P>
	Perhaps the bill in Alberta in 1936 was not tight enough and 
that is probably why it was repealed. However, we have come up 
with sensible legislation.
<P>
	These are some examples of why I think it would be taken 
seriously by the electors and would not pose any personal threat 
to probably most members in the House.
<P>
	First, the petition must be signed by a sufficiently high 
number of electors in a constituency to prevent mischief. If I 
needed 100 names or 5,000 names or whatever I could find them 
very easily. However if we looked at the number of voters who 
voted in the last election and then took 50 per cent plus one, that 
is a powerful number of names that we would need. It is a high 
threshold because we have a multi-party system.
<P>
	In the United States it is just one way or the other. You vote 
Republican or Democrat and the person needs 50 per cent plus 
one. It is about as simple as that. But we have four or five parties 
running here. A seat can be easily won without 50 per cent of the 
vote, so I have put the threshold high, that 50 per cent plus one of 
the number of people who voted in the riding in the previous 
election is needed. That number of names is very difficult to 
come up with and the Chief Electoral Officer would need to 
make sure that all those names were legitimate.
<P>
	Also I have incorporated a period of grace into the bill, an 
18-month waiting period after the general election before a 
recall petition can be initiated. That also would destroy the myth 
of people turning around and saying, ``let's go get her'' after she 
has been elected for two weeks. We would need a period of a 
year and a half in the bill for people to prove themselves. This 
would make sure that MPs are given a chance.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3726"> 3726 </A></B>
<P>
	Naturally unusual circumstances such as criminal charges, 
fraud, et cetera could shorten this period in the case of blatant 
misrepresentation. Also, recall could be used only once in a 
constituency during the life of a Parliament. If people got this 
tool and went wild with it, they would be able to say: ``Oh, let's 
get him'' and ``let's get her''. Let us put some sensible 
guidelines in place. Another one is that it could only be used 
once in the life of the Parliament.
<P>
	Anyone who is still dubious about this should remember that 
people are sensible. If we are talking about power to the people 
we need to give it to them whether we like it or not. As we have 
witnessed around the world people are taking power into their 
own hands. Canadians are no different. They have proved it time 
and time again: Charlottetown, 1992. That side of the House was 
in opposition then, they all said ``yes'' at least publicly. I know 
of some, I will not mention any names, who had a great deal of 
difficulty with it and they voted ``no''. But publicly they all 
came out and said ``yes''.
<P>
	It depends how loudly we talk publicly, but nonetheless we 
would make sure that if this only happened once in the life of a 
Parliament that would be healthy. The recall process also would 
be subject to strict regulations, verified by the Chief Electoral 
Officer. For example, there should be procedures for verifying 
that all signatures are genuine and obtained through legitimate 
means.
<P>
	Of course the first thing somebody would say is: ``That's 
going to cost an incredible amount of money and you Reformers 
are always, always saying cut, cut, cut''. There would be some 
dollars involved in this but I ask the question to all of those 
cynics: How much will it cost if we do not do that? What will the 
ultimate cost be if we do not initiate recall and see some 
incredible situations as we are witnessing even today where 
members of Parliament are going to sit as independents or 
whatever else? What is the cost ultimately to the constituents, to 
the particular member, and to the Canadian political system in 
general? We are all going to be harmed. I think this would be 
cheap and would make sure that we have some healthy balance 
in here.
<P>
<B>(1350) </B>
<P>
	Let me talk about some more merits of recall. I have a feeling 
I have not convinced everyone on the other side of the House.
<P>
	<B>An hon. member:</B> They are coming.
<P>
	<B>Miss Grey:</B> They are coming, though. Let us remember that 
recall will strengthen the link between individual 
representatives and their electors. That is a good thing to to have 
happen in the country.
<P>
	It will provide the disillusioned or dissatisfied voter with an 
instrument and public process for practical action. We saw it in 
the Charlottetown accord where people said: ``I have a vote'', 
and vote they did in incredible numbers with an incredibly 
resounding n-o from sea to sea. It was not just us rebels in the 
west; one  of the maritime provinces voted no as well and 
Ontario as good as voted no.
<P>
	That is exciting to me because people realize that they can 
hold the reins of power; it is not just in the Chamber. People will 
be able to do more than just sit and complain as they wait for the 
next election. One can deduce from this that recall will ensure 
political parties and politicians listen more.
<P>
	I can think of nothing more to say to wrap this up. If 
politicians would listen more, if they would consult more, 
ultimately they would be accountable far more to the people who 
actually voted them in, who actually are paying their 
paycheques, and who are actually saying: ``We want some 
mechanism in place whereby you are accountable to us''.
<P>
	We have heard time and again from across the floor the Prime 
Minister and others saying that we do have accountability, that 
we do have recall; it is called general elections. No, it is called 
MP recall. I would be thrilled to see the bill pass through the 
House of Commons as quickly as possible.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Vancouver Quadra):</B> Mr. Speaker, it 
is a pleasure to follow the hon. member for Beaver River. She 
speaks with thoughtfulness. She is always interesting and she is 
good humoured. I hope to enter the debate with those same 
qualities.
<P>
	It is an interesting question. I think we are all interested in 
participatory democracy. It was, after all, Pierre Trudeau who 
coined the term. This Parliament is marked by a feeling that 
transcends all parties to change the system to get more direct 
involvement by people, more participation by members.
<P>
	It should be understood, though, that we operate within the 
context of two different antinomies or sometimes conflicting 
principles of liberal constitutionalism today in western societies 
and western influenced societies. One is the concept of 
government by assembly, which is returning power to 
Parliament after more than half a century in most western 
societies of executive dominated regimes.
<P>
	The other is direct democracy, getting people involved in 
decision making in its logical conclusion or what my friend, 
Professor Mirkine-Guetzévitch, called plebiscitarian 
democracy. Sometimes those two trends run counter to each 
other. Without anticipating the work of the Standing Committee 
on Procedure and House Affairs, the committee of the House of 
Commons now studying these issues including the institution of 
recall, I would refer to some changes that are already apparent.
<P>
	The office of prime ministership is in the process of change. It 
is always true that the office depends on the man or woman in it. 
The prime ministership was different under Mr. Churchill from 
that under his successor, Mr. Attlee, or under Margaret Thatcher 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3727"> 3727 </A></B>
<P>
and her successor whose name is often forgotten. The same is 
happening in Canada.
<P>
	The Chrétien model of the prime ministership is a very kinder 
and gentler Prime Minister who rests on collegiality, consensus 
and a heightened respect for Parliament. Some would say after 
the last eight years that was very much needed. It is the Pearson 
model and it is changing Parliament interestingly and 
constructively.
<P>
	There is also a heightened sensitiveness among individual 
members of their responsibilities to their constituents and 
getting their opinions and, by the way, no particular fear of 
referenda as such.
<P>
<B>(1355) </B>
<P>
	I happen to think referenda are fully part of democratic 
constitutionalism. The Quebec referendum of 1980 was healthy. 
It cleared the air. The Charlottetown referendum was healthy. I 
never accepted the view of the prophets of gloom and doom that 
the country might come to an end as a result of that referendum. 
The decision has been accepted loyally and with goodwill by all 
concerned and we are now on to the economic business of the 
country.
<P>
	Referenda should not of course be used as an instrument to 
harass governments or to preoccupy the public agenda. I would 
warn that there are constitutional limits. If referenda proposals 
are deliberately ambiguous and confusing or they are repetitive, 
repeated every year, there are ample constitutional means for 
controlling them through the Supreme Court. Maybe at some 
future stage some people, including myself, may have to return 
to that issue.
<P>
	Let us get on to recall, the institution as such which the hon. 
member raised with such ardour and such persuasiveness. It is in 
many respects antithetical to the main liberalizing 
constitutional element I have already referred to: government by 
assembly giving more powers to members of Parliament, not 
merely opposition but government members, getting away from 
this presidentialized prime ministership we see in so many 
British influenced societies.
<P>
	I would have to raise some questions to the hon. member. I 
have lived in Switzerland as part of my professional life. I have a 
great admiration for the Swiss system. However I am always 
reminded of the particularity of constitutional institutions in 
their own society and the difficulties in translating an institution 
from one society to another, unless the basic societal and 
cultural conditions in the one are sufficiently replicated in the 
other. It is one thing to have recall in a Swiss canton where 
everybody knows everybody. I knew all my neighbours; I knew 
everybody in my canton, I think.
<P>
	Try translating recall to a constituency. Not even speaking of 
the hon. member for Ontario's seat which has 220,000 voters, 
but a seat like my own of 100,000, how do you prove 50,000 or 
40,000 signatures on a recall petition? It does not even take a 
good lawyer to tie an issue like that up in the courts for 17 years 
requiring everybody to prove their signatures.
<P>
	I can foresee very great difficulties, endless litigation and 
expense in carrying this proposal out if it were to be adopted. I 
wonder if the liberalizing thoughts of the hon. member might 
not be better directed to other institutions of participatory 
democracy which I think are already receiving some early 
favour with the standing committee.
<P>
	There are more effective ways for Parliament itself to control 
its own procedures and to ensure dignity and mutual respect 
among its members. It must never be forgotten that Parliament 
is a high court of Parliament. It is a vestigial judicial institution 
too. It has enormous disciplinary powers which are sometimes 
forgotten. It has the power to scrutinize its own MPs.
<P>
	There are constitutional limits to this and political dangers. 
As an academic commentator I warned during the U.S. 
impeachment debate about confusing legal grounds for 
impeachment with political grounds for impeachment. That is to 
take us back to the bad days of the 18th century instead of the 
golden days of the 17th century in which constitutionalism in 
England was more vibrant. One is also reminded of the last days 
of the Weimar republic when majorities used their power to 
exclude minority members.
<P>
	Nevertheless, this having been said the standing committee 
would do well to re-examine Parliament's power itself to 
discipline its members. It could look at these issues for taking 
care of some of the pathological examples the hon. member 
cited where recall in the absence of other more effective 
mechanisms might be the constitutional instrument to look to.
<P>
<B>(1400 ) </B>
<P>
	I would ask the hon. member if she could put her proposals in 
the context of a larger constitutional vision which includes a 
revived Parliament where members do have something to do, 
where the executive exercises modesty and self-restraint in 
relation to opposition members and government members.
<P>
	There are changes here that we are on the verge of making. We 
have a sympathetic Prime Minister. I cite again the example of 
Mr. Pearson. He and his great colleague, Paul Martin, Sr., were 
great parliamentarians. This can be a House that will literally 
reform itself.
<P>
	Contributions such as the hon. member opposite has made are 
constructive and helpful. They start the debate. They are the raw 
material for the overburdened standing committee with a 
strange double barrelled name. Nobody dares use the word 
constitution but let us face it, it is a constitutional committee 
that we have in Parliament, the Standing Committee on House 
Management and Procedures, and it can act.
<P>

<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3728"> 3728 </A></B>
<P>
	Her contributions will add to the debate and I do believe she 
will see results, perhaps not the particular institution she is 
advocating. It does need more thought on the modalities, how to 
get it through, how to overcome those battalions of lawyers who 
will descend and those 17 years delays but it can be done.
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	<B>Mr. Gaston Leroux (Richmond-Wolfe):</B> Mr. Speaker, I 
welcome this opportunity to speak in the debate on Bill C-210 
and consider certain aspects of this bill.
<P>
	Speaking on behalf of the Bloc Quebecois, I would like to 
start by saying that the essence of the act to provide for the recall 
of members of the House of Commons may be expressed as 
follows: ``any elector ordinarily resident in an electoral district 
who wishes to seek the recall of the members for that district 
may file with the Clerk an application for the recall of the 
member in a prescribed form''. The recall procedure which 
exists in 15 American States, allows for the dismissal of a 
member of Parliament or public servant.
<P>
	I would like to provide some historical background. A similar 
system exists in four swiss cantons. Significantly, the procedure 
exists only with a very restricted socio-political framework, and 
even at that level, its use is extremely limited. In the United 
States, for instance, the system only operates at the municipal 
level. At a higher level, we have only the case of a Governor of 
the State of Oregon who was recalled in 1921.
<P>
	To define more clearly the position of the Bloc Quebecois on 
this question and to explain the political background of the 
recall concept, I think it is important to go back in history, and I 
intend to go back a little further than the hon. member from 
Vancouver Quadra, in fact, to the end of the 18th century. It was 
the Age of Reason in Europe, a philosophical movement that 
dominated the world of ideas and gave birth to the broad 
democratic principles that would guide western societies and 
still do. In continental Europe, the principle of sovereignty was 
transferred from the absolute monarch to the people. Although 
this movement started two centuries ago in England, France and 
Germany, it has gained in depth and acquired a more universal 
dimension.
<P>
	For Jean-Jacques Rousseau, for instance, sovereignty is the 
``general will'' which is always fair and equitable and thus a 
very effective concept. We see the idea of democracy emerging, 
where the people decide. But is democracy, in the sense of power 
to the people, the best form of government? And by the same 
token, is the right to recall based on the concept of power to the 
people a good way to control the actions of politicians? If this 
right to recall existed, would politicians be more likely to 
answer to constituents for their actions?
<P>
<B>(1405) </B>
<P>
	As for the foundation of government legitimacy, after royal 
authority was abolished at the end of the 18th century, in 
Rousseau's opinion, the people became the ultimate holders of 
the decision-making power. That is why he rejects the idea of 
representative democracy whereby the people can only wield 
their influence at regular intervals. About the English people, he 
said this: ``The people think they are free, they are sorely 
mistaken; they are only free during elections. As soon as the 
members of Parliament are elected, the people revert to being 
slaves, to being nothing''. That is why Rousseau wanted to give 
people the right to recall their representatives on a daily basis.
<P>
	So, as we can see, recalling elected representatives is not a 
new idea. I think the main flaws of representative democracy, in 
particular the principle that citizens can only exercise their right 
to vote once every four or five years, deeply troubles all 
democrats since the beginning of universal suffrage.
<P>
	The question raised at the dawn of representative democracy 
can still be raised today: ``How can the sovereign power 
exercised by a few parliamentary dignitaries result from 
people's sovereignty?'' The notion of democracy expressed 
through people's sovereignty, through the idea that every citizen 
of a sovereign state can influence the decision-making process, 
that everyone wields political power, will quickly take the form 
of state sovereignty with the application of democracy.
<P>
	Throughout the 19th century, especially with the advent of 
universal suffrage, we see that the people's will expressed 
through the election process does not coincide with the general 
will. This is important: it does not coincide with the general 
will. As we move away from the great revolutionary movements 
that swept Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, the notion of 
people's sovereignty gradually gives way to the more absolutist 
concept of parliamentary sovereignty.
<P>
	Given what I just said, the Bloc Quebecois considers this bill 
to be fully justified and symptomatic of people's misgivings 
about their representatives and of the massive failure of the 
Canadian political system. Actually, this bill would be 
impossible to enforce, but it shows a democratic conscience 
deeply disillusioned by over 100 years of a system that simply 
does not work. Parliamentary sovereignty has lost all 
credibility, and making members of Parliament subject to recall 
will not restore its credibility.
<P>
	Clause 4(<I>d</I>) of Bill C-210 says that a statement of 200 words 
or less would be sufficient to trigger the recall process. This 
provision would necessarily lead to anarchy in many ridings. 
Further on, clause 6(<I>b</I>) mentions the requirement to have a 
petition signed by a majority of the constituents of a riding in 
order to recall a member. Such a procedure would make the 
democratic process too costly and completely uncontrollable. I 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3729"> 3729 </A></B>
<P>
note what the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra said about 
this.
<P>
	This bill is not practical throughout a country whose 
population numbers in the millions. It results from a nostalgic 
feeling about the democratic idealism which arose in 
18th-century Europe. That is why the Bloc Quebecois is 
opposed to this bill and prefers, along with some of our fellow 
members, like the hon. member for Vancouver Quadra, to take 
the option of developing within the institution of Parliament 
itself all the mechanisms for recalling members who are unable 
to do their job and represent their constituents democratically.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Ronald J. Duhamel (Parliamentary Secretary to 
Minister of Public Works and Government Services):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, first I would like to congratulate the hon. member for 
Beaver River for raising this issue, which is a very important 
one. This is not a new idea; in fact, it has been around since at 
least the 19th century. As you know, we have always wondered 
about the possible benefits and the effectiveness of such a 
measure.
<P>
<B>(1410) </B>
<P>
	This idea seems to be very attractive, even popular, but we 
still do not have any proof that it would work. Personally, I do 
not believe that a simple act would change a great deal the 
behaviour of hon. members. I would like to believe otherwise, 
but I think that the behaviour of hon. members cannot be 
managed by legislation.
<P>
	In the United States, for example, since 1908, if my memory 
serves me correctly, there has been only 11 recalled elected 
officials. You are certainly aware that hundreds, even thousands, 
could have been recalled, but since 1908, only 11 were.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	There are a number of questions that I think need to be 
answered before we could possibly support this piece of 
legislation. I will go back to something that the leader of the 
Reform Party said and I would like to be corrected if I am wrong. 
The leader indicated that whenever a new initiative is 
undertaken one has to ask at least three questions: What will it 
cost? How many people will be involved? Where will the money 
come from?
<P>
	I have read the legislation. I have had some people take a look 
at it. I have had independent parties do an analysis for me. These 
questions have not yet been answered and they are important 
questions.
<P>
	I want to raise another couple of points. Perhaps there are 
answers to these points. If you look at the last elections in 
Canada you will find that some members of Parliament were 
elected with majorities in excess of 80 per cent. Others had 
majorities of 30 per cent plus a little bit. Is it appropriate to treat 
both of those individuals, if they were to be made subject to 
recall, in the same way even though there is a 50 per cent 
difference in their win? That is a point that I raise that concerns 
me.
<P>
	The other point of course, and I indicated that initially in my 
remarks in French, is it is appealing. There is no question about 
that. I think the notion by itself is an appropriate one. However it 
is much more complicated than it appears. How litigious would 
it be? I suspect that anyone who would be the object of recall 
would have many opportunities along the way to question 
whether or not the process had been followed and whether or not 
it had been followed properly. I think it could probably be 
stalled for weeks, perhaps even months.
<P>
	I will give a simple example. Once you were the object of such 
a process and someone brought in the required number of names, 
you as an individual would probably want to make absolutely 
certain that every single one of those names qualified. First, 
putting that list together would be a mammoth task and, second, 
ensuring its absolute accuracy would be extremely important 
otherwise we could be open to litigation. Of course all of that 
would be extremely important to do and extremely expensive. 
Some of you will know that the Lortie commission, after having 
taken a look at it, indicated that this was not the best way to 
proceed.
<P>
	Some of you will know as well that Dr. McCormick, who is a 
supporter of recall, left a lot of questions unanswered. In fact he 
could not persuade people that this was the way to proceed.
<P>
	I want to remind the House that on February 7-I believe that 
is the accurate date-the government asked the Standing 
Committee on House Affairs and Procedures to examine a 
number of measures. Among them were, and I quote: ``Measures 
to achieve more direct participation by citizens, including 
citizens' initiative, the right of constituents to recall their MP''. 
Therefore, there is a process in place in order, I hope, to address 
that very question in a very serious kind of way.
<P>
	Until that report is in, until the questions that I have raised are 
answered-how much will it cost, how many people will be 
involved in such a process and where will the money come 
from-it seems to me that it would be wise to withhold support.
<P>
	I come back to a point that I made initially. While it seems 
terribly appealing to think that such a process, such a law, such a 
bill would reform Parliament or the behaviour of 
parliamentarians, I am very, very cautious about that. I say it in 
no way to denigrates the idea, an idea I think which is motivated 
by a member who believes that if it were to work, as she believes 
that 
<P>
<HR>
<B><A NAME="3730"> 3730 </A></B>
<P>
it might, it could bring about some additional refinement to 
Parliament. We all know that on particular days it could stand 
additional refinement.
<P>
<B>(1415) </B>
<P>
[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, as I said a moment ago, even if the idea seems 
attractive and even if there is some good in it, there are a number 
of questions about its effectiveness, its advantages and its cost, 
that must be studied before going ahead.
<P>
	But the main reason is that the government already launched 
an initiative which will deal with a number of questions. I 
personally think that the matter must be considered as a whole. 
If it is not considered that way, I am not convinced that it will 
change very much the behaviour of hon. members.
<P>
[<I>English</I>] 
<P>
	Mr. Speaker, I should have said initially, and I hope that you 
and the members will permit me, to share my time with my 
colleague from Broadview-Greenwood.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> There are five minutes 
remaining in this block of time and if that is agreeable to the 
House, the member for Broadview-Greenwood would have the 
floor until 2.20 p.m.
<P>
	Is it agreed?
<P>
	<B>Some hon. members:</B> Agreed.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Dennis J. Mills (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister 
of Industry):</B> Mr. Speaker, I begin by congratulating the 
member for Beaver River for advancing debate on this very 
important issue.
<P>
	Part of the reason why I will not support your motion is 
because I believe you have been an example-
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> Order. I know the member 
for Broadview-Greenwood brings a great deal of enthusiasm 
and other qualities to his interventions, but the Speaker would 
want to maintain the usual traditions and be somewhat-
<P>
	<B>Mr. Mills (Broadview-Greenwood):</B> Mr. Speaker, through 
you to the member, I did not want the member to think that I was 
all of a sudden becoming impersonal.
<P>
	I believe that one of the unique qualities of the member for 
Beaver River is the fact that the member has always had the 
courage to go against the wind. I want to pick up from the 
member's speech where she talked about the Charlottetown 
accord and tried to bring the relevance of the Charlottetown 
accord experience to this recall debate.
<P>
	I was elected in 1988 for a very specific reason in downtown 
Toronto. I ran opposing the Meech Lake accord. I believe in a 
strong national government. I was ideologically supportive of 
the Pierre Trudeau vision of this country and I still am. I was 
given the trust in 1988 by the people of 
Broadview-Greenwood, which had been an NDP riding for 25 
years, because I took a very specific stand on that important 
constitutional issue. I also thank John Turner for his terrific 
debating skills. That was the other great reason I believe that I 
won.
<P>
	Two years ago, when we had the Charlottetown accord, I was 
sitting in this House of Commons with a position on the 
Constitution, a strong national government. If I were to 
maintain the trust of my electorate, and the member for Beaver 
River always says listen to your electors, I had to sit in this 
House in opposition and I did not support the Charlottetown 
accord. I sat here and I did not support my party's position. It 
was a very painful experience.
<P>
	I then went into my riding and I campaigned on the beliefs that 
I had. My beliefs were personally that I did not believe in 
dismantling or decentralizing this national government any 
more than it had already been dismantled. I campaigned, not 
vigorously, but I campaigned. I was not trying to get into a 
confrontation with my leader or my party colleagues. It was just 
something that I had been given a trust on in 1988 and I had to m 
maintain it.
<P>
<B>(1420) </B>
<P>
	During discussion of the Charlottetown accord I put my 
position forward. A majority of my constituents at that time did 
not share my view of the Constitution. Every night I gave my 
reasons. Our office was open seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 
for that period of time. It cannot be said that I hid behind the 
curtain or anything like that. People knew.
<P>
	Because of the incredible thrust of advertising and because of 
the media, we were gobbled up by the big hustle on the 
Charlottetown accord. During that campaign period many 
people in the community went along with the pack. Those of us 
in my own community at the time of the election who did not 
share the view lost by 2 per cent.
<P>
	I could have been at that moment in time, because of the 
Charlottetown accord, a victim of a recall action. My 
constituents could have initiated a recall action. They would 
have had the basis for getting a recall motion going.
<P>
	It is important that we debate the issue, but the real test of our 
accountability does not come in the short term. It comes with 
our four-year actions in the House. That is when we get our 
recall test.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, it is truly an honour for me today to support my 
colleague from Beaver River and Bill C-210. I will start with a 
quote, if I may: ``People, it has been said, want a government 
that listens, not lectures''.
<P>
	When I was younger one of my goals in life was to represent 
my country in a responsible fashion through entering the 
political arena. I was lucky enough to do that through my 
constituents in Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3731"> 3731 </A></B>
<P>
	Prior to the Reform Party coming into existence, I did not feel 
there was any political party around that truly stood for 
democratic principles, where the politicians truly represented 
the wishes of their constituents.
<P>
	One of the things that attracted me to the Reform Party as 
opposed to any other political party was its commitment to 
democratic reforms, reforms that would give the power back to 
the people. I feel putting the power back where it belongs is 
fundamental to a truly democratic society.
<P>
	A primary example of this is the ability of the public to recall 
elected representatives when they are misusing their position or 
are not representing their electorate in the manner they were led 
to believe they would be represented. This is not pie in the sky 
reform but is a very real part of democratic reforms in a number 
of countries. We need to look at our neighbours south of the 
border to see that reform, democratic principles and recall are 
integral parts of both state and local politics. As mentioned 
before it also occurs in Switzerland, a model of democracy.
<P>
	What is the mechanism of recall in Canada? First, as has been 
proposed by my esteemed colleague, there would have to be a 
relatively high petition threshold of 50 per cent plus one. This 
would be an attempt to avoid any spurious attempts at recalling 
MPs by the opposition. I hope this allays some of the fears of my 
colleagues across the way in government.
<P>
	Second, members of Parliament must be given adequate time 
to get a track record, that is recall cannot be instituted before 18 
months in the tenure of a member of Parliament.
<P>
	Third, recall can only be applied once during the tenure of an 
MP in any four or five year period of time.
<P>
	Recall is a remedy of the partisan block voting that has 
plagued Canadian politics for decades. Members vote now in 
many cases according to what their party wishes them to vote. 
This is the antithesis of democracy. Hand in hand though with 
recall there is another excellent opportunity for the government 
to democratize the system. That is, we must see that every vote 
in this House on a bill is not a vote of confidence in the 
government. Rather, if a bill were defeated, we would have a 
vote of confidence. This is a liberating thing and would enable 
the members of this House to truly represent the wishes of their 
constituents and they would not be hamstrung by party lines.
<P>
<B>(1425) </B>
<P>
	It would only take the Prime Minister a couple of minutes to 
make a statement in the House to liberate the members in this 
House and enable us to do that. I implore him to do that.
<P>
	A concern about recall that has been mentioned by my 
colleagues in the government that I will put to rest right now is 
that it would enable special interest groups to manipulate the 
electorate and exert undue influence in  the political process 
through continually exercising a petition to have a member 
recalled.
<P>
	The reality is very different and will not occur because the 
electorate is not gullible, It is not mindless or ill-informed but 
then it does not bend to the whims of special interest groups. We 
should have more confidence in the ability of the electorate to 
not fall for spurious attempts at defeating a member of 
Parliament. That is why this bill will be excellent for democracy 
in this country.
<P>
	This has been borne out many times in studies and is one of 
the reasons why it has been so successful with our colleagues to 
the south of our border.
<P>
	My esteemed colleague from Beaver River has brought about 
and is raising this matter partly because the people desperately 
want recall. A few examples are evident right now and 
appropriate.
<P>
	In my home province of British Columbia in the 1991 
provincial election the people were asked do they or do they not 
want recall. Eighty-one per cent of the people in British 
Columbia said that they want recall now.
<P>
	We in the Reform Party asked 1,500 Canadians across this 
country if they wanted recall or did not want recall. 
Seventy-five per cent of them wanted recall. This is something 
the public desperately wants. I think we should exert our 
influence, our duty and our role to adopt this great bill.
<P>
	There are a number of other initiatives that I think we ought to 
address in tying in with our ability and our wishes in the Reform 
Party to democratize the system. One of those is binding 
national referenda and the other is citizens' initiatives, both 
democratic forums that I think would strongly improve the way 
in which business is done in the House.
<P>
	Some would argue that these reforms somehow enable elected 
officials to shirk their responsibilities and get them off the hook 
in making difficult decisions. I submit that there is no higher 
power in this land, in a democratic society, than the will of the 
Canadian people.
<P>
	We elected officials are merely agents of that will. It is true 
that we are elected to make decisions on their behalf but I still 
hold very dear to my heart the idea that the power of the people 
is of primary importance.
<P>
	I quote Thomas Jefferson who said in 1820: ``I know of no 
safer depository of the ultimate powers of society but the people 
themselves and if we think them not enlightened enough to 
exercise control with a wholesome discretion, the remedy is not 
to take it from them but to inform their discretion''.
<P>
	It is our Reform Party belief of direct democracy which 
distinguishes it from the other three mainline political parties. 
These democratic reforms are what I believe in and are what we 
as a party believe in. It is what we will fight for.
<P>
	I hope other like-minded democratic parliamentarians will 
think likewise, know that this Bill C-210 is integral and 
important for democratic reforms and is equally important to 
making our Parliament more effective.
<P>

<P>

<B><A NAME="3732"> 3732 </A></B>
<P>
	I implore them to adopt this worthy bill.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> With the bit of time we 
have left, the hon. member for Fredericton-York-Sunbury.
<P>
	<B>Mr. Andy Scott (Fredericton-York-Sunbury):</B> Mr. 
Speaker, I will try to be as brief as possible.
<P>
	I commend the member for bringing this debate forward. I 
believe in her sincerity and I believe also in the underlying 
principles around which the recall concept is being promoted. 
Unfortunately I cannot support it. I see the exercise of recall as 
an adversarial exercise.
<P>
	The public is tired of that kind of adversarial system. I 
genuinely believe we can come up with positive measures to 
involve people. In my constituency we have held a number of 
very successful public meetings that were well attended, well 
received and non-partisan. It involves the constituents in 
Fredericton-York-Sunbury in public policy discussions. 
There are those kinds of positive approaches to involvement.
<P>
	I agree with the member that the public feels powerless and 
alienated from the system. I spent nine months going door to 
door in the constituency and I have to say with honesty that the 
concept did not come up as a mechanism, although the concerns 
the member expressed certainly came up very often.
<P>
	As a member of Parliament I felt an obligation to respond to 
that and I have. On February 27 we had a large forum in the 
constituency on health matters. In March we had a forum on 
national defence matters. These were well attended, well 
reported, televised public policy discussions. Just last Sunday 
the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Human 
Resources Development visited the constituency and we had a 
non-partisan public meeting on HRD issues.
<P>
	The need to change the system is real. I believe the public 
expects us to do that. I also suggest that there has been evidence 
so far in this Parliament, as brought to the attention of the House 
by the members on the side of the member proposing this bill, 
that changes have been made, for instance the debate in terms of 
Bosnia as one positive change.
<P>
	With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank you for your indulgence.
<P>
	<B>The Acting Speaker (Mr. Kilger):</B> The time provided for the 
consideration of Private Members' Business has now expired.
<P>
	Pursuant to Standing Order 96(3), the order is dropped to the 
bottom of the list of the order of precedence on the Order Paper.
<P>
	It being 2.30 p.m., this House stands adjourned until Monday 
next at 11 a.m., pursuant to Standing Order 24(1).
<P>
	(The House adjourned at 2.30 p.m.)
