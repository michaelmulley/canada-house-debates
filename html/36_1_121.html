</I></B></P><P align=left>These were amendments that were made when this bill was at the 
Senate.  There has been concern about the amendments.  The 
amendments raise serious concerns for Transport Canada and the 
new NavCan corporation.  Both are very worried that they will 
lose access to information which is essential to carry out their 
respective safety roles.  The CATCA president, after discussion 
with the union's executive, stated that the CATCA would not 
oppose the removal of Senate amendments and NavCan requested the 
opportunity to explain its concerns in more detail to the 
Standing Committee on Transport only if the amendments in 
question were not removed.  Therefore, I have moved that they be 
removed.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, on November 4, 1997 the deputy chairman of the Senate 
committee on transport and communications made a rather 
remarkable statement with respect to Bill S-2: “We will be 
making history this afternoon in that this is the first bill we 
will be dealing with ab initio since this is a Senate bill.  We 
will then pass it along to you in whatever form that may be”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What a satire of parliamentary democracy.  The unelected, 
unaccountable troughers in the other place are initiating 
important bills and sending them off to us, in whatever form that 
may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I admit that Bill S-2 does not differ to any great extent from 
its previous incarnation as Bill C-86 in the 35th parliament. But 
in theory the senators could have done anything they wanted with 
this bill and sent it off to us here.  That is wrong.  I fondly 
hope we will not see in this parliament any further bills with 
the letter <I>S</I> prefixing them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Senate should be limited to its function of providing sober 
second thought, and even in that role it is illegitimate because 
of the manner in which its members are chosen.  Only yesterday 
the Prime Minister had the effrontery to appoint five more, 
thumbing his nose at public opinion.  However, Bill S-2 is a 
housekeeping bill and it is basically sound.  It does have a 
couple of failures which I would like to bring to the attention 
of the House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 4 which specifies the terms of employment for board 
members and establishes that there shall be no more than five, of 
whom three shall be full time members, there is no provision for 
a transparent merit based system of appointment.  Members will 
continue to be chosen at the discretion of the minister, just as 
they are for a plethora of other boards and agencies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one in common with, for example, the National Parole Board 
and the Immigration and Refugee Board, has the capacity to do 
harm if the wrong patronage choices are made. There has to be a 
better way. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second fault is that this board will continue to have the 
discretion to not investigate fatal accidents if it feels that 
such an investigation would be unlikely to lead to a reduction in 
risk to persons, property or the environment.  But if no 
investigation is made how can such presumptions be reasonably 
made?  Of course to investigate more accidents the TSB would need 
more money.  It would need more investigators.  Its current 
investigative staff is only 135 and its budget for 1998-99 is 
only $22 million. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>One has to question the priorities of a government which has 
hundreds of millions of dollars for grants and forgivable loans 
to corporations that build aircraft but only a pittance to 
determine why aircraft crash.  Bear in mind that although air 
crashes are spectacular, the TSB also must put together the 
puzzles of fragmented trains, ships and pipelines.

</I></B></P><P align=left>Those 135 investigators are stretched too thinly.  I urge this 
government to remedy the situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 does not address the intrinsic problems of the board 
but its defects that I have drawn to the attention of this House 
are defects of omission rather than of commission.  Reform 
members will therefore support it as a housekeeping exercise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Marlene Catterall:</B>  Madam Speaker, I rise on a point 
of order.  There have been consultations among the parties and I 
think you would find unanimous that during the present sitting 
when the questions are put for third reading of Bill S-2 and Bill 
C-38, in each case it shall be deemed to have been carried on 
division. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Acting Speaker (Ms. Thibeault):</B>  Is that agreed? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Agreed. 
<P align=left>[<I>Translation</I>] 
<P><A NAME="LINK11"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond (Beauport—Montmorency—Orléans, BQ):</B> Madam 
Speaker, I want to say from the outset that our party fully 
supports the idea of proceeding this morning with the second and 
third readings of the bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>No one wishes to see any accident happen in the transportation 
sector. However, if some unfortunate accident does occur during 
the summer and requires a quick intervention by the Canadian 
Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board, it will 
now be possible—thanks to this bill—to have improved 
investigations to—as I mentioned in a previous speech—make 
sure that prevention measures are complied with. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When an accident occurs, we would like to make sure, through the 
recommendations that may be made following a serious and 
impartial investigation, that such accidents do not recur. Once 
again, the purpose of this measure is to protect the health of 
Canadians and Quebeckers, who have confidence in our 
transportation industry. So, let me emphasize again that our 
party agreed to the quick passing of this bill, before the House 
adjourns for the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As I mentioned before, I think it was last Friday in my speech 
at a previous stage, our party regrets that this bill was 
initiated in the Senate by unelected representatives, political 
hacks, both Liberals and Conservatives, who think they have the 
authority to impose legislation on this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In Canada, we have a bicameral system. We hope this system can 
be replaced, but we have our doubts. Surveys in Quebec have 
shown that the vast majority of Quebeckers—74% or 78%—want to 
see the Senate abolished, whereas the rest of Canada wants a 
triple E Senate, a strengthened Senate. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This confirms what the Bloc Quebecois has been saying for a long 
time, namely that the system does not work. We are telling Quebeckers 
who want to see the Senate abolished and to recover part of the 
$54 million they pay in taxes for that institution that Quebec's 
political sovereignty is one way to achieve that goal. The 
Senate would no longer exist.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>We deplore the fact that this bill was introduced in the Senate 
and that the government did not seize this opportunity to fix an 
archaic and outdated system whereby members of these 
quasi-judicial bodies are appointed by the governor in council. 
We know what this means. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For those who are watching us and who do not know, the governor 
in council is the patronage machine of the PMO which determines 
who are the most loyal friends of the government. We may think 
of Senator Ross Fitzpatrick, who was the fundraiser for the 
Liberal Party in the western provinces— 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B> A distinguished Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> Evidently, we are hitting a nerve.  The 
Minister of Transport had not said a word since I began, but 
when I mentioned the name of Senator Ross Fitzpatrick, the smoke 
started to rise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will continue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. David M. Collenette:</B> He is a great Canadian. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Michel Guimond:</B> We know that Senator Ross Fitzpatrick, who 
was a Liberal Party bagman in the West, was made a senator by 
the Prime Minister.  That is a reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We think the government should have taken advantage of this bill 
to ensure that members of these boards are appointed on the 
basis of merit alone, not as a political reward. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As for political rewards, there are sometimes ambiguities. 
If people are wondering why a well-known Conservative was 
appointed by the Liberal Party, it was to give the appearance of 
transparency. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Mulroney years, there was the hon. Ed Broadbent, former 
leader of the New Democratic Party, who was appointed to a human 
rights office in Montreal.  Appointing someone from another 
party helps divert attention from the 30 appointments from their 
own party. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the example of the member for 
Beauport—Montmorency—Orleans, whom I had the pleasure of 
defeating in the 1993 election.  He occupied the position you 
now hold, Madam Speaker.  I am referring to Charles DeBlois. 
With the help of Marc-Yvan Côté, a well known political organizer 
in the Quebec City region, he was appointed to an immigration 
commissioner position in Montreal. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>People wondered how a candidate who had been a 
Progressive-Conservative for five years could be handed a reward 
like that by the Liberal Party. 
It is the classic example. They appoint one from the other gang 
and then feel free to appoint 30, 40 or 50 of their own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The best example of all is the chairperson of this 
transportation safety board.  His name is Benoît Bouchard.  He 
was the Minister of Transport in the Mulroney years.  Just 
before the Conservatives were defeated—they were obviously headed 
for defeat in 1993—Mr. Mulroney appointed him Canadian ambassador 
to Paris.  The Liberal government, having its own political 
appointee in mind for the Paris embassy—Jacques Roy—brought Mr. 
Bouchard back to Ottawa and appointed him chairman of the 
transportation safety board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is another way of appointing someone of a different 
political stripe, so that we can appoint 30, 40 or 50 others of 
our own. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>That about wraps it up for me.  I would like to take this 
opportunity to wish Quebeckers, Bloc Quebecois members, and 
members of our teams who work both in the ridings and in Ottawa, 
a pleasant summer.  Rest up with your friends and families.  I 
am sure that your families would want you to take care on the 
highways and waterways.  There are always unfortunate accidents. 
I know that your families would rather have you alive and well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Enjoy the summer.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Ms. Angela Vautour (Beauséjour—Petitcodiac, NDP):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, the safety board act was originally passed by the 
Mulroney government in 1989. 
It brought a number of different federal bodies responsible for 
transportation safety under the same roof. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1030"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT6"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT6"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1030
<A HREF="#LINKT7"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT5"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The NDP opposed the original act for three reasons.  First, a 
newly created safety board was underfunded and underequipped to 
carry out its broad mandate to investigate all air marine, rail 
and pipeline accidents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, the act allows ministers and interested private 
companies to review drafts of the board's reports and submit 
comments.  This unduly influences the board's final reports and 
compromises the board's independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, the original act did not adequately protect the privacy 
of workers who gave testimony to the board.  Without privacy 
workers were at risk of retribution if their testimony was 
damaging to their employers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 is an act to amend the original Safety Board Act.  Most 
of the changes are of technical nature to clarify language and 
adapt the act for technological advances.  We support these 
aspects of the bill.  There are some new provisions in the bill 
to extend privacy protections to people who give testimony to the 
safety board.  We support this because it addresses one of the 
three reasons the NDP opposed the Safety Board Act in 1989. 
However, despite these positive changes we still oppose Bill S-2 
because it makes a bad act even worse. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The safety board is still underfunded.  Across the country there 
were over 2,000 air marine, train and pipeline accidents last 
year.  Yet the safety board only employs 135 people to 
investigate these occurrences.  Even though many of these 
accidents do not require in-depth investigation, the board 
nevertheless has a massive backlog.  The backlog is so bad that 
the board has had to start rushing its investigations to catch 
up.  This is a threat to public safety.  The board requires more 
funding so it can hire more investigators to properly safeguard 
the health and safety of Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 would allow the government to turn some of the safety 
board appointments from full time into part time positions.  This 
would leave the board with even fewer working hours.  The 
dedicated public servants of the Transportation Safety Board of 
Canada are coping as best they can.  The Liberals owe it to 
Canadians to give these public servants the resources they need 
to do their important work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>By far the worst aspect of Bill S-2 is that it puts a shroud of 
secrecy over the process by which private companies are allowed 
to influence the safety board.  It is bad enough that they are 
allowed to review draft copies of the board's reports and make 
submissions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 would make these submissions secret.  If the private 
submissions of the safety board were not unduly influencing the 
board there would be no reason to hide them from the Canadian 
people.  This process is elitist and anti-democratic.  The 
Canadian people depend on the safety board for their health and 
safety when travelling.  They have a right to know what these 
private companies are saying to the safety board. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The entire process of Bill S-2 has shown how out of touch the 
Liberals are with the Canadian public.  First they introduced the 
bill in the Senate, a patronage ridden and anti-democratic 
institution that the Canadian people have no confidence in.  The 
bill makes a bad piece of legislation even worse by putting a 
shroud of secrecy over the safety board and thereby compromising 
its independence. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The provisions of the bill to hide private sector submissions to 
the safety board are scandalous.  The very fact that they have 
this opportunity to influence the board is a farce.  The Liberals 
should have used this opportunity to remove this ridiculous 
provision from the act.  Instead they are trying to hide it from 
the Canadian people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canadians rely on the transportation safety board to make sure 
that the rails, skies, waterways and pipelines of the country are 
safe.  Transportation safety is vitally important to the movement 
of goods and passengers across the country.  People need to be 
sure that the board is doing its job effectively if they are to 
have confidence in travelling or doing business in Canada.  Thus 
the Liberals owe it to Canadians to make the safety board 
transparent and accountable.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Charlie Power (St. John's West, PC):</B>  Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak today on behalf of our caucus to support Bill S-2. 
It is an act to amend the Canadian Transportation Accident 
Investigation and Safety Board Act and to make consequential 
amendment to another act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety 
Board Act was passed by parliament in June 1989.  The act 
established an independent federal agency, the Canadian 
Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board, or as it 
is commonly known the TSB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The TSB has the mandate to investigate accidents into marine, 
rail, pipeline and air modes of transportation.  A major feature 
of the TSB is its independence from the regulator, Transport 
Canada, and from all other departments of government.  Its sole 
objective is to advance transportation safety, and this is indeed 
an admirable objective. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The original Canadian Transportation Accident Investigation and 
Safety Board Act contained a provision in section 63 of the act 
that required the mandatory review of the operation of the act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This review was initiated in January 1993 by the Canadian 
Transportation Accident Investigation and Safety Board Act Review 
Commission and its report was tabled in parliament in 1994. 
Meanwhile the Moshansky commission of inquiry into the March 1989 
accident at the Dryden airport had completed its work and made 
recommendations pertinent to the Canadian Transportation Accident 
Investigation and Safety Board Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 is the result of these changes suggested by both the 
Dryden investigation and by the Canadian Transportation Board 
Accident Investigation and Safety Board Review Commission.  Bill 
S-2 proposes to do some tidying up of the already very solid 
piece of legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Bill S-2 was introduced in the Senate on September 30, 1997.  It 
went on to the Senate transportation and communications committee 
in which Bill S-2 received three amendments.  One of these 
amendments was made by the Progressive Conservative senators whom 
at this time I would like thank for their hard work on this 
important piece of transportation safety legislation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Progressive Conservative amendment made in the Senate now 
allows the TSB to have two part time members.  The current board 
consists of only four members and has one vacancy due to some 
trouble in finding a fifth full time member.  The new provision 
is to allow part time membership as a positive step in 
maintaining a healthy TSB. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Liberal senators made two amendments to Bill S-2.  One was a 
very good one and one was a very poor amendment.  The first 
Liberal amendment was a transitional clause which ensures that 
pending or ongoing legal proceedings would be able to continue 
once the bill is passed.  This is a positive move which protects 
against any gaps while Bill S-2 comes into force. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The second amendment made by a Liberal was not such a good idea. 
In fact it was so bad the Liberal government is now back-tracking 
and asking to have the amendment deleted.  The amendment deals 
with the protection of land line recordings made in air traffic 
control systems. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The amendment was made without legal advice without 
transportation safety board consultation or, as far as we can 
tell, without consulting anyone about the possible the 
detrimental impact this amendment could have.  The unintended 
affect of this amendment would deny the employer and the 
regulator access to information which the government has admitted 
is “necessary to ensure the quality and safety of some elements 
of air traffic service”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government in this case was asleep at the wheel.  It should 
have been better prepared to deal with the bill.  It has been a 
long while in the making.  To let this occur shows just how 
little force that the government has had on the issue.  It has 
been promised that the government will delete the amendment 
today.  I hope it does that today because it is important that it 
should be done. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We are on top of the transportation safety issues in Canada and 
we will be ensuring that this legislation and any future safety 
legislation passed by the House will be positive step for Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I should also like to note that our party's 
transportation critic, the hon. member for 
Cumberland—Colchester, has done an extensive investigation into 
the bill.  It has been found to be solid and should warrant our 
support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While it somewhat irregular for a bill which has been referred 
to a standing committee to brought back to the House without 
allowing the committee to do its work, hear any witnesses or 
perform the valuable work of parliamentary committees, we will be 
supporting this move today with regard to Bill S-2. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The reason for this is the need to give the transportation 
safety board the necessary changes to fine tune its operation as 
well as to make minor although important changes to the governing 
act.  These changes will increase transportation safety for all 
Canadians.  For this reason the Progressive Conservative Party 
will be supporting a quick passage today.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK15">&nbsp;</A>
<P><A NAME="LINK16"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Fred Mifflin (for the Minister of Canadian Heritage)</B> 
moved that Bill C-38, an act amend the National Parks Act, be 
read the third time and passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK17"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Andy Mitchell (Secretary of State (Parks), Lib.):</B> 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to have an opportunity to rise today 
on third reading of Bill C-38, an act to establish Tuktut Nogait 
National Park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I begin my comments by repeating something I said in the House 
yesterday.  I thank all members from all parties who worked 
diligently in committee and otherwise toward the passage of this 
piece of legislation and toward an important objective that we as 
Canadians all share, the establishment and continuing 
establishment of our national parks system and toward fulfilling 
what is a very important goal and objective for all Canadians, 
the protection of special places in the country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This park will join the family of 38 national parks to date and 
will, as I said, work toward the completion of our national parks 
system to ensure that we have the representation of at least one 
park in each of the 39 natural regions designated across Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These are indeed special places.  In this case of Tuktut Nogait, 
the process that has been developed in this park is being put 
forward to protect the bluenose caribou herd, the core calving 
grounds of the caribou herd, and to protect the tundra landscape 
of the northern Arctic.  It is one of the most beautiful and 
spectacular locations in Canada, particularly in Canada's north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The establishment of this park has been a very long, extensive 
and public process in arriving at the place where we are today. 
The original idea for this national park was in 1989 when the 
community of Paulatuk undertook a study.  It came to Parks 
Canada, to the federal government, and suggested that one way to 
protect the area was through the establishment of a national 
park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From that point there was a period of some seven years of public 
hearings, negotiations and discussions so that in 1996 all 
parties were in a position to sign an agreement to establish the 
national park.  What we are doing with the bill is taking that 
agreement and bringing it under the National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since that agreement has been signed a management board 
committee has been established to oversee the park.  It includes 
representatives of the local community as well as of Parks 
Canada.  This is a full management procedure by which to manage 
the park.  I am pleased that the board is up and running and 
providing us with timely advice on the operation of the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will not speak too long to this issue but there are four key 
points I want to make briefly. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1045"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT9"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT9"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1045
<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT8"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>One is the importance of establishing this park to protect the 
important calving grounds of the bluenose caribou herd.  This was 
one of the raisons d'etre for the establishment of the park.  The 
science which we have seen shows clearly that the park is used by 
the caribou for their calving. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It helps us as a government and as Canadians to fulfil an 
international obligation which we have talked about. This 
government and Canadians have been very insistent with our 
American counterparts that they protect their caribou on the 
Alaskan side of the border.  We have worked diligently within 
Canada to ensure that we have protected the calving grounds.  We 
have asked that the Americans do this.  To date their land in 
Alaska, commonly known as the 1002 land, still does not have full 
protection.  I think we are sending a very clear message 
internationally that we are willing to stand behind our 
international statements by protecting the caribou here in 
Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I touched on my second point in my introduction.  This park 
establishment is going along in terms of an agreement that all 
parties came to in 1996.  This agreement was made, and there has 
been some discussion about this, knowing that there was an 
anomaly in that area that would indicate there may be some 
mineral potential. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1994 the resource company itself was part of that decision by 
voluntarily, at the request of the Inuvialuit, relinquishing its 
mining claims to that area.  We understand that this was not 
because it was not an area that there may be mineral exploration, 
we did not think that the area was not valuable, but a collective 
decision was made that we would protect this area despite the 
fact that it may have some mineral potential.  That was the 
decision.  It was not made in ignorance.  It was a conscious 
decision made to protect a very special place in Canada and to do 
so knowing full well what the results of that may be. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I also want to touch very briefly on the status of Tuktut Nogait 
as it stands today.  There have been some suggestions that this 
is not really a national park and that any concern over 
protecting the integrity of agreements is not a real concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Many of what we commonly call our national parks are in exactly 
the same status as Tuktut Nogait is prior to the passage of this 
legislation.  Places like Pacific Rim in British Columbia, 
Grasslands in Saskatchewan, Pukaskwa in Ontario, Gros Morne in 
Newfoundland all are more or less in the same legal status as 
Tuktut Nogait is today. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important that we demonstrate clearly that we are going to 
protect the integrity of the boundaries of our national parks. 
If we were to move away from that and say we would entertain 
logging interests in one area, oil and gas interests in another 
area or mining interests in another area, then we would have 
great difficulties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We decide collectively as Canadians to protect certain special 
places in this country.  As the Secretary of State for Parks, I 
had the honour and the responsibility of ensuring the integrity 
of those decisions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This last point is one which I spoke on briefly yesterday at 
report stage.  We are committed as a government to work with the 
local community to ensure that it has an opportunity to develop 
economically in terms of the park.  We have made a commitment 
that we will be spending some $10 million over the next several 
years with the establishment of the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have also said clearly that we are going to work to ensure 
that the native community, the local community, has the first 
opportunity for the jobs that are being created in that area.  We 
are also working with the Government of the Northwest Territories 
to ensure that we can proceed with the economic development. The 
fact is that some 80% of that mining potential I talked about 
earlier is outside the park and may present an opportunity as 
an event that may unfold in the future.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In conclusion, I am pleased that we are about to pass this 
legislation and see another important part of our national parks 
system come to fruition. 
<P><A NAME="LINK18"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Keith Martin (Esquimalt—Juan de Fuca, Ref.):</B>  Madam 
Speaker, it is a pleasure to speak on Bill C-38.  The Reform 
Party will be supporting it in our efforts to support 
conservation in Canada.  However, I am greatly disappointed in 
the activities of this government over the past year with respect 
to protecting our endangered species and our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I wonder if the hon. secretary of state knows that what is going 
on in the Arctic today is truly a tragedy.  Teratogenic and 
carcinogenic materials in the form of radioactive isotopes are 
coming across to the northern Arctic.  They are poisoning the 
Inuit people who live there.  Those materials are bioaccumulating 
in the flora and fauna and causing serious trouble for the 
environment.  Some of these isotopes will not go away for 
hundreds of thousands of years.  We hear absolutely nothing about 
it yet the government has been warned repeatedly over the years. 
I would strongly recommend the government look into that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over 240 species are at risk in Canada today, including the 
prothonotary warbler, beaked whales, Mississauga rattlesnakes, 
black-footed ferrets, Vancouver Island marmots and many others. 
The people who are trying to preserve these species are not 
getting the help they require. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The minister of heritage has taken a knee-jerk response to 
Banff.  She has done the exact opposite of what she should be 
doing.  She should be enabling the people of Banff to generate 
the necessary funds to not only protect their wild spaces but 
also to expand the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have heard the hon. secretary of state speak eloquently about 
this so he knows very well that the degradation of our 
environment and the destruction of our habitat seriously threaten 
endangered species. In a nutshell, we have to give endangered 
species a home.  We cannot kill them.  We have to protect them 
and we have to work with the people to do that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are many serious threats, from the destruction of our 
habitat to trafficking.  Canada is one of top 10 countries in the 
world in the international trafficking of endangered species. 
There is trafficking of tiger parts, black rhino horn and many 
other endangered species around the world.  That is not part of 
the Canadian legacy and it is not something we should be proud of 
having within our midst. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is the issue of lack of support for our conservation 
staff.  There are difficulties and jurisdictional problems 
between the feds, the provinces and the municipalities. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>These issues have to be cleared up in a very substantive way for 
many reasons.  One reason is that we have derived many medicinal 
and other benefits. We will derive more in the future if we can 
preserve these species for the benefit of all, not to mention the 
philosophical benefits of being able to give to our children what 
we have received from our parents. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are some sensible solutions.  What has worked around the 
world has been to get parks and wild spaces to generate their own 
funds.  If parks and wild spaces can earn revenue, that revenue 
can be ploughed back into the parks.  This is a very sensible and 
eco-friendly way to preserve and expand the parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Buffer zones could be created around the parks and the people 
living in the surrounding areas could derive benefits.  When the 
people in the surrounding areas derive a benefit from the park 
they can use the area as a poaching buffer zone around the park. 
Different parks around the world have used this strategy.  It has 
worked very well in Central America and elsewhere. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It could also be a very useful way of engaging developing 
countries in creating revenues in an eco-friendly way.  Parks in 
south central Asia and Africa could generate revenues that would 
benefit the people in the surrounding area in a sustainable way. 
It enables people to support themselves.

<A HREF="#LINKT10"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of the jurisdiction of the environment we have to clean 
that up.  Currently federal regulations only cover 4% of the 
Canadian land mass.  Species do not know boundaries.  They cross 
over municipal, provincial and national boundaries. They need to 
be protected within that context.  We have to remove the 
jurisdictional entanglements that prevent strong legislation from 
coming forward to protect our endangered species. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The trafficking situation is appalling.  We have to have enough 
conservation officers and we have to give them the powers to 
enforce the laws.  They are not getting the support of the 
justice system.  They must do this for Canada to end its 
miserable legacy that it has before the world in being a conduit 
for wild animal parts. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I recognize that there are no new moneys, but funds can be 
generated through using the parks in an eco-friendly way.  One 
example is to put a 2% levy on hotels deriving benefits from the 
parks.  Those moneys could be poured back into the parks for 
conservation measures, habitat protection, extending the habitat, 
doing scientific research and education. In this way we would not 
have to ask the government for more money. The money would be 
there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hunting is actually useful.  I do not hunt as I could never kill 
anything, but as has worked in the past, if money could be 
derived from hunting, those moneys which could be quite extensive 
could be poured back into the parks and used to preserve many of 
the other species.  It might sound cold hearted but it is 
pragmatic and it does work. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We also have to deal with enforcing our obligations under CITES, 
the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species. 
We are a signatory to this convention but as I said before, we 
have been an embarrassment with respect to our enforcement of 
those issues. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have a number of opportunities within our midst.  The power 
of the federal government is enormous.  It has to sit down with 
its provincial counterparts to establish jurisdictional 
differences.  Perhaps it would be best for the federal government 
to take the responsibility and work with the municipalities.  It 
also needs to work with farmers and land owners.  They could be a 
natural support for conservation measures.  Where that has been 
done on the prairies it has worked very well. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Generally speaking land owners do not want to see the decimation 
of the biodiversity within their midst. They would like to see 
that preserved for many reasons, yet they need people to work 
with them.  If the government could manage to work with them then 
we would be able to expand our biodiversity and use the private 
land owners as friends rather than as enemies. This could be a 
useful way of expanding today's situation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I will go back to the situation on trafficking.  We live in a 
world that is intertwined; what happens half a world away affects 
us here at home.  Canada has taken a leadership role in signing 
international treaties on biodiversity in the past.  The world 
needs a leader in working with other countries in this area. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We have to put aside our prejudices and deal with some very 
pragmatic ways in which we can support our environment. Yes, it 
does take money.  One of the things we could examine is that the 
environment can generate revenues in an environmentally sound, 
pragmatic and sustainable manner and those moneys could then be 
poured back into the environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When the minister prevented development within the city 
boundaries of Banff, that was not sensible. This did not involve 
an encroachment on the park. The minister could have taken a 
leadership role.  She could have said that it would be allowed 
within the park so long as it fit certain federal regulations 
with respect to the environment.  If the minister had done that 
and taken a leadership role in putting forth sensible ways for 
the park to generate revenues which could be poured into the 
conservation measures, Banff National Park would be stronger 
today.

Speaker, the Minister of Health would have us believe that there 
are no funds available to compensate hepatitis C victims, but in 
his previous portfolio he had no difficulty committing the

hundreds of millions of dollars for no discernible benefit, a

the so-called leaky condo crisis in British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The R-2000 program is not to blame.  There is absolutely no

been no wall failures reported in R-2000 certified buildings in 
British Columbia. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The R-2000 program provides a basis for the design and

working together to come up with appropriate technical solutions 
that can be applied to repairs of affected buildings.

</I></B></P><P align=left>On Wednesday the minister mistakenly suggested that the funds 
were cut because the unemployment rate for youth has dropped in

</I></B></P><P align=left>Finding a summer job is the only way many New Brunswick students 
can afford to pay for the skyrocketing costs of education.  Many

yesterday the share value of Canada's dollar hit record lows. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Our floating exchange rate is being used by this government as a 
camouflage for flawed domestic economic policies. One of the 
forces exerting downward force on the Canadian dollar is that 20% 
of Canada's debt matured this year and yet this government has 
yet to commit to firm debt reduction targets. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When will this government commit to those firm debt reduction 
targets that would send out the appropriate message? 
<P><A NAME="LINK82"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Tony Valeri (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

that have been impacting on the performance of the dollar 
recently, lower commodity prices and the uncertainty about 
economic developments in some Asian countries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, let us be clear that the underlying fundamentals are 
behind a Canadian economy that remains strong.  The OECD, for 
example, estimates that Canada will have the best fiscal 
performance in the entire G-7.  Output and employment growth have 
been robust and inflation continues to be low.  We are on a track 
that will continue to see this country grow right into the next 
millennium because the fundamentals are right.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Scott Brison (Kings—Hants, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, this

leadership in Indonesia, blaming the guys in red suspenders for 
the weakness in the Canadian dollar. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would ask this government to do what it has done over the past 
four years and take advice from a Conservative because this 
government has used Conservative policies, including free trade, 
the GST and the deregulation of financial services in 
transportation, to reduce the deficit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I now beseech this government to again take advice from a

needs.  We need reduced taxes and we need a commitment to lower

would have record high interest rates and inflation.

Speaker, the situation in Kosovo is rapidly deteriorating with 
thousands of refugees fleeing their homes.  The international 
community has an obligation to act and to act quickly.  Will the 
Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Foreign Affairs report 
to the House on what precise actions this government is taking to 
help stabilize the situation in that troubled region of the 
world? 
<P><A NAME="LINK115"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Ted McWhinney (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, we are concerned about 
the level of violence and the plight of refugees in that region. 
At this moment the foreign minister is meeting with the G-8 
foreign ministers and we are agreeing on collective measures. 
These include security enhancement in neighbouring countries and 
an immediate increase in humanitarian aid. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>At the national level we have frozen all Serbian Yugoslav assets 
in Canada and we have banned all export of funds to Serbia 
Yugoslavia but we will act in concert.  It is a grave problem for

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Duncan (Vancouver Island North, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, we see on the front page of the <I>Globe and Mail</I> 
that the minister of fisheries is going to throw more money at 
the fishing industry. We agree that money is necessary but there 
must be a plan on how to spend it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The all-party fisheries committee tabled a plan for the west 
coast over two months ago but we still have no direction from the 
minister.  Now we are only two weeks away from the start of the 
salmon season.  Why is the minister so reluctant to address the 
particular problems of the industry? 
<P><A NAME="LINK118"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Fisheries and Oceans, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the minister is not 
at all reluctant to address the problems in the salmon industry. 
He has met with fishermen consistently.  He has gone through the 
fisheries committee report and he certainly thanks the committee 
for the report. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The other day the minister announced a conservation framework to 
protect and rebuild B.C. coho stocks starting with more action as 
needed to protect and restore the salmon habitat itself.  More 
action is needed to address the structural problems in the 
commercial fishery, including overcapacity and economic 
viability. 
<P><A NAME="LINK119"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. John Reynolds (West Vancouver—Sunshine Coast, Ref.):</B> 
Mr. Speaker, the former and present ministers of fisheries have 
watched the demise of the east coast fishery in Canada to the 
shame of all Canadians. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Can the minister or the government advise this House of what 
they are doing differently in British Columbia to make sure we do 
not have the problem in British Columbia five years from now that 
we presently have in eastern Canada? 
<P><A NAME="LINK120"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Wayne Easter (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of

member opposite has not been following what the government has 
been doing on a number of fronts as opposed to what has happened 
in the past when he was a member of the former B.C. government 
before he became a Reformer. We are taking strong conservation 
measures.  We have learned some lessons from the demise of the 
Atlantic cod.  As the Minister of Veterans Affairs answered 
earlier in relation to the ongoing TAGS problem, we are looking 
to address that, to address the structural problem, economic 
difficulties and community problems.

</H3><P align=left>

<P><A NAME="LINK128"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, a serious 
situation exists in the marketplace today.  It is so serious that 
it undermines the race against the clock that government and 
industry have been waging against the year 2000 millennium bug. 
Incredibly it is still possible for consumers to unknowingly 
purchase Y2K non-compliant computer products. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My question is for the Deputy Prime Minister. Will he agree to 
set a date for Y2K compliance of all computer hardware and 
software devices and incorporate it into the Canadian Standards 
Act? 
<P><A NAME="LINK129"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Walt Lastewka (Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of 
Industry, Lib.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member opposite knows 
full well that the work on the Y2K program has been extensive 
within this government and outside with business and industry. 
The continuous programs as brought forward by the Monty report 
and the soon to become Statistics Canada report on the progress 
of the Y2K program is very effective for making sure that this 
country is ready for Y2K. 
<P><A NAME="LINK130"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Jim Jones (Markham, PC):</B>  Mr. Speaker, that is an 
unacceptable answer.  Caveat emptor is an unacceptable response 
to an issue of this magnitude. Governments and business continue 
to invest too much money and effort into this battle against the 
millennium bug to accept such a hands-off approach. October 1, 
1998, sell any Y2K non-compliant product after this date and pay 
the price.  What is wrong with this solution? 
<P><A NAME="LINK131"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Hon. Ronald J. Duhamel (Secretary of State (Science,

sure that there is no Y2K problem in the year 2000. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Internally and externally we have been communicating with all 
the people with whom we do business.  We have been advising them 
of the problem and it is up to them to take the action required. 
In fact, they can do so even more easily as a result of the 
announcement of the Minister of Finance yesterday.  They can now 
deduct those initiatives.  They can demand that these items be 
compliant and they will do so.

as part of the federal public sector youth internship program, 94 
interns are now acquiring skills at federal worksites in Halifax, 
Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Vancouver. This year we are 
creating an additional 551 internships for graduates, 579

to aboriginal people where we identified to those people who 
suffered physical and sexual abuse at residential schools that it

Parks Act by adding Tuktut Nogait national park to the list of 
national parks in schedule I of the National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuktut Nogait is located in region 15, tundra hills, as 
designated by Parks Canada in its national park systems plan. 
This region is highlighted by a number of spectacular features. 
More than 95% of the region is tundra, rock barrens where only 
the hardiest plants can survive.  Wildlife in this region is 
mainly comprised of summer migrants.  Musk ox, wolves and caribou 
can be found in this region.  It is also the home of one of the 
rarest birds in Canada, the Eskimo curlew. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All this is to say that this park will play a critical role in 
helping to conserve Canada's biological diversity through the 
protection of the bluenose caribou herd, concentrations of tundra 
peregrine falcons and rich niches of vegetation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Tuktut Nogait is Canada's newest and fifth largest national 
park.  The passage of Bill C-38 brings Canada's park system one 
step closer to completion.  It is this government's objective to 
have a national park in all 39 natural regions of this country by 
the year 2000.  It is also a very unique national park in that it 
was a community that initiated the idea of the national park. 
Most candidate sites are identified by Parks Canada. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inuvialuit are to be praised for their conservation efforts. 
In fact, 29% of their lands are protected areas whereas the 
government has not even achieved its goal of setting aside 12% of 
our lands as protected areas. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Six parties entered into agreement to establish Tuktut Nogait 
national park in June 1996, the Canadian government, the 
Government of the Northwest Territories, the Inuvialuit Game 
Council, the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, the Paulatuk 
Community Corporation and the Paulatuk Hunters and Trappers 
Committee. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While they were negotiating the agreement and at the time they 
signed that agreement the Inuvialuit groups understood that it 
would be possible for them to make changes to this agreement in 
the future. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Last winter the IRC approached the federal government to ask 
whether it could modify the boundaries of the park to allow for 
mineral development.  The government's response was to wipe the 
dust off the Tuktut Nogait park agreement and attempt to slip it 
through parliament. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All parties agreed to the passage of Bill C-38 in principle but 
were preoccupied by the request made by the Inuvialuit Regional 
Corporation to remove 415 square kilometres of the established 
16,340 square kilometres to permit mineral development. 
The government and conservation groups have argued that this land 
which represents only 2.5% of the park falls within the core 
calving ground of the bluenose caribou herd.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>During first reading of this bill I told members of the House 
that I was in favour of this bill in principle.  I thought then 
and I still do that we cannot start carving up parts of our 
national parks for any reason.  Immediately following my remarks 
I was contacted by the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation to advise 
me of the Inuvialuit point of view. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It quickly became apparent that this issue was not as cut and 
dry as members of the House were first led to believe.  It was 
very important for me to hear both sides of the story so I urged 
the committee to hear witnesses affected by the park.  It was an 
honour for me to meet with the representatives of the IRC and 
from the community of Paulatuk when they appeared before the 
Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The committee was told that they had been lobbying the 
government for the past six months because they see the 
development of a mine as the way to end the dependence of their 
people on social assistance. The community of Paulatuk has a 
population of approximately 300 people. The majority of those 
residents are under age 25.  The people of Paulatuk have 
traditionally lived off the land.  They understand the danger 
that might be posed by a mine but they argue that the development 
of the mine could help their people. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Being from a region where many people have had to diversify due 
to the downturn in fisheries I can certainly appreciate the 
Inuvialiuts' difficult situation.  However, my initial decision 
has not changed for a number of reasons. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>First, the agreement was signed by all parties.  Second, since 
only 10% of the anomaly lies within the boundaries of the park, I 
really do not understand why it is imperative for them to develop 
that portion.  They would be much better to develop and exploit 
the remaining 90%. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Inuvialuit also argue that the Tuktut Nogait is not a park 
but a proposed park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I told witnesses and I have said in this House my party is not 
against mineral development.  On the contrary, we support mining 
and other development in the north.  However, I feel that 
changing the boundaries for Tuktut Nogait to allow for mineral 
exploration after the agreement has been signed would set a 
dangerous precedent for this and the other seven national parks 
that are not protected under the National Parks Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In my humble opinion if we start decreasing or 
reducing the boundaries of our proposed parks for immediate 
benefits, we will be short changing future generations. Our 
children's children deserve the right to enjoy our national parks 
and national treasures, be it the right whale in the Bay of Fundy 
or the bluenose caribou herd in Canada's north. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Although I am in favour of this bill, I am not in favour of the 
way this government has treated the people of Paulatuk. The IRC 
and the people of Paulatuk ask this government for time to 
explore the prospects of mineral development pursuant to their 
understanding of section 22.1 of the Tuktut Nogait agreement 
which states: “Any party may request a review by the parties of 
part or all of this agreement.  If all the parties agree, they 
shall initiate the review within 90 days of the request”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This government's cavalier response was to ignore the IRC's 
request and to try to whisk this through the House.  Will this 
government ever learn to treat people with respect and dignity? 
Furthermore, this government has recently shown yet another double 
standard. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>While arguing that mineral development in Tuktut Nogait would 
have a negative ecological impact on the environment, it is 
allowing Canadian Pacific Hotels to build a 156,000 square foot 
conference centre and hotel expansion on the shores of Lake 
Louise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is the latest but not the last announcement in the new 
development boom in Banff National Park.  How can this government 
expect Canadians to take it seriously on environmental issues 
when it flip-flops from one park to another? 
<P><A NAME="LINK233"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to lend support on behalf of the New Democratic Party 
to Bill C-38, an act to establish a national park and establish 
the boundaries of Tuktut Nogait. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The process began with a letter on March 10, 1989. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1230"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Wildlife Management Advisory Council of the Northwest 
Territories wrote to the minister responsible for Parks Canada 
and proposed a study to consider the possibility of creating a 
national park in the vicinity of Bluenose Lake. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The context of the request was for the Paulatuk community 
conservation plan.  The plan identified caribou and particularly 
the protection of the calving grounds of the bluenose herd as the 
foremost conservation concern for a community that has for 
generations depended for their livelihood on the caribou herd. 
Indeed, as mentioned throughout the debate on this bill, the park 
name, Tuktut Nogait, means caribou calves in the Siglik dialect 
of the Inuvialukton. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Seven years of analysis, consultation and negotiation followed. 
There were extensive discussions with local stakeholders, 
including the Paulatuk community corporation, the Paulatuk 
trappers and hunters committee, the elders committee, the 
government of the Northwest Territories, the Inuvialuit regional 
corporation and the Inuvialuit game council.  These consultations 
led to an agreement signed in Paulatuk on June 28, 1996. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The federal government and the territorial government, together 
with the four other parties, agreed and the boundaries were set. 
That was the start of the birth of a park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Then, after much fanfare, nothing happened.  The federal 
government moved on with more paper signing, without follow up or 
action. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suddenly Tuktut Nogait became an issue again.  Over the winter 
the mining company that had removed exploration from within the 
park boundaries changed its mind.  The anomaly proved to be a 
worthwhile investment within the boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Suddenly some of the local stakeholders who were looking at the 
environmental impact it would have on their communities were 
willing to take a risk on an economic venture into mining, and 
stating this whole concern under a park agreement, as the parties 
had agreed they wanted to make a change.  It was quite a 
confusing state of affairs. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>But the main problem was created by the government dragging its 
heels, especially when it knew that money would have to be spent 
to start the park.  The government was not fulfilling the promise 
it had made. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The risks were not limited to the potential loss of critical 
area within the proposed park.  The principle of developing 
within national park boundaries has opened up a great issue. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada witnessed just last fall the Cheviot mine case in which a 
huge strip mine will be developed beside the national Jasper 
Park, a very prestigious world heritage site.  That brought a 
terse response from UNESCO, asking the government to reconsider 
and reverse its decision to allow a mine to be located at such 
close proximity to a pristine valley. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In this decision the minister used his discretion and as a 
result the fish habitat was damaged.  It was the spawning ground 
for the western bull trout and it has been a sacred tenet of 
environmental protection to keep such a crucial species in this 
country. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This brings us to an important point as parliamentarians today 
consider Bill C-38.  We must consider the remaining natural 
regions that are not protected.  Failure to do so would be a 
great demise. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I bring members back to the Tuktut Nogait National Park.  The 
existing park boundaries, as presented in Bill C-38, will create 
a park inside a settlement region, the Inuvialuit settlement 
region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This region and the majority of its community members have 
compromised their settlement of lands to create a national park. 
But the federal government and the parks agency people, as they 
will soon be called if the parks agency bill is passed, have 
promised that Tuktut Nogait will protect the integrity of the 
bluenose herd. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There are other proposed boundaries to this park which involve 
the Nunavut settlement region and the Sahtu Dene settlement 
region.  Why are those proposed regions not included in the bill? 
Why does it not state that the Tuktut Nogait National Park will 
be a huge protected area involving three settlement regions?

<A HREF="#LINKT30"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Principles of co-management are part of the commitments the 
government is making with the people of northern Canada, 
especially in the northern region where economic wealth is based 
on traditional lifestyle.  For the economy to change to an 
eco-tourism based economy for the protection and enhancement of 
the national park with potential mineral development in that 
area, co-management and community involvement are required. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement included a parks agreement which stated that the 
Inuit impact and benefits agreement would be considered when this 
national park comes into being.  Employment and training 
opportunities must be considered. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>All these issues will have a major impact on this community and 
on the northern region.  The integrity of the ecology, the 
history and the biodiversity of our country must be protected for 
future generations as we create national parks.  Development is a 
crucial risk for these national parks.  We are witnessing 
decisions on requests being made for the Banff National Park. We 
must take these into serious consideration and not make decisions 
for the sake of the economy. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The root of the word economy is eco, which means your home.  We 
know what money means, so it means the home of your money.  But 
ecology means the home of your environment.  Without this 
environment and this vast country we call Canada there would be 
no money made, there would be no people calling it their home. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This environment and this land must be respected.  The national 
parks are a sacred way of protecting this land for future 
generations.  They keep in tact the many generations of 
sustainable development that the aboriginal peoples of this world 
and this land have retained for their people.  That sustainable 
development or that non-parasitic way of utilizing the land and 
resources for our own immediate needs without putting back is a 
crucial lesson for future generations. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I call upon other parties to take heed.  The investments we make 
as a nation are not necessarily from park created revenues.  As 
the Reform Party was quick to point out, the integrity of a park 
should be maintained by revenues created from within it.  We must 
find investment from other sources within this country to 
maintain the integrity of the national parks of the far north 
which will never have the same revenue base which Jasper, Banff 
and other national parks have the privilege of creating. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This federal government has dragged its feet in creating this 
park, which has resulted in some controversy in a community that 
has other vested interests for economic reasons.  It must also 
deal with the inequity.  It must deal with the Nunavut settlement 
region and the Sahtu Dene settlement region to include the whole 
park boundary as originally proposed and not just within the 
Inuvialuit settlement region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am happy to state that we are in support of Bill C-38 which 
would begin the creation of the Tuktut Nogait National Park.  The 
other settlement regions will contribute further boundaries and 
further vast tracts of land to protect the integrity of the 
bluenose herds and the integrity and the biodiversity of that 
land, so that it will remain sustainable for future generations 
of the north.  May the ecology of this country not be compromised 
for the sake of the economy.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>NATIONAL PARKS ACT 
</H3><P align=left>

<A NAME="LINK241">&nbsp;</A>
</I></B></P><P align=left>The House resumed consideration of the motion that Bill C-38, an 
act to amend the National Parks Act, be read the third time and 
passed. 
<P><A NAME="LINK242"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mrs. Suzanne Tremblay (Rimouski—Mitis, BQ):</B> Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today at third reading of Bill C-38 introduced by the Minister of 
Canadian Heritage and entitled, after our motion at report 
stage, an act to amend the National Parks Act and establish 
Tuktut Nogait park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The aim of this bill is to create a national park in the 
Northwest Territories, more specifically, in the Inuvialuit land 
claim settlement region. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>To understand the situation fully, members have to know that, in 
1984, the federal government signed an agreement with the native 
peoples traditionally occupying and using the region of the 
Beaufort Sea.  This agreement was known as the Inuvialuit Final 
Agreement and accorded the Inuvialuit ownership of part of the 
lands they claimed. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In exchange for their transferring to the crown their interest 
in other lands they claimed, the Government of Canada undertook 
certain obligations with respect to the Inuvialuit living in the 
region.  This agreement was implemented with the 1984 passage of 
the Western Arctic (Inuvialuit) Claims Settlement Act. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As part of the obligations the federal government undertook with 
respect to the Inuvialuit, the agreement provided, and I quote 
“The granting or setting aside for the Inuvialuit of certain 
lands in the designated region, their right to hunt, to trap and 
to conduct certain commercial ventures there”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>So, the government begun negotiations concerning the 
establishment of a national park in this region in 1989 partly 
to honour its obligations to the Inuvialuit. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The six parties involved in the negotiations were the federal 
government, the Government of the Northwest Territories,  the 
Inuvialuit regional corporation, the Inuvialuit game management 
council, the Paulatuk community corporation, and the Paulatuk 
committee of hunters and trappers. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In 1996, after seven years of negotiations, the parties to this 
lengthy process signed the agreement to create a national park 
in the region covered by the Inuvialuit land claim, in the 
vicinity of Paulatuk, Northwest Territories.   The short title 
for that agreement is the Tuktuk Nogait agreement. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In the Siglik dialect of Inuvialukton, Tuktut Nogait means 
“caribou calves”, which is not surprising since the park is at 
the heart of the Bluenose caribou herd's calving grounds. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As everyone knows, the reason for creating a park is that it 
protects a specific geographical aspect. 
The 16,340 square kilometers of Tuktuk Nogait Park will 
represent the natural region of tundra hills. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is characterized by a rich biodiversity, for its hills and 
valleys offer lush vegetation and therefore an excellent habitat 
for the caribou and muskox.  Its many cliffs and ramparts 
provide ideal nesting areas for birds of prey. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Within the park are archaeological sites which confirm that 
there was a human presence thousands of years ago.  There have 
been settlements in a large part of the park at various times 
over the last millennium. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The region provides visitors with an opportunity to discover 
untouched Arctic landscapes, and to observe wildlife and plant 
life. Activities include hiking, camping, birdwatching, nature 
watching and photography. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>According to the agreement, the objectives of the park's 
creation are as follows.  First, to protect the Bluenose caribou 
herd and its calving and post-calving habitat. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Second, to protect in perpetuity a natural area in a region of 
tundra hills, and encourage the public to understand and 
appreciate the region in such a way as to leave it intact for 
coming generations.

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Third, to promote co-operation among the Inuvialuit, the 
Government of Canada and the Government of the Northwest 
Territories in planning, operating and managing the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fourth, to encourage and support the creation and maintenance of 
jobs and businesses in the region by permitting hunting within 
the park solely for subsistence purposes. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fifth, to promote greater understanding and respect for the 
Inuvialuit cultural heritage and the natural surroundings of 
this nation. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Sixth, to create an environment suitable for long term research 
on the ecological and cultural history of the park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>And, seventh, to preserve the park's ecological integrity. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park will be managed jointly with the Inuvialuit community. 
The park's board of management will comprise five members, two 
appointed by the Inuvialuit, two by the federal 
government—including one on the recommendation of the Northwest 
Territories government—and a chair appointed with the approval 
of all parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park board of management will reconcile the various 
objectives of natural preservation, economic development and 
respect for native traditions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The agreement provides for the formulation of a training and 
community assistance plan to help the residents of Paulatuk 
develop tourist and economic resources for the park, the 
priority hiring of qualified Inuvialuit employees and the 
priority awarding of contracts to Inuvialuit businesses that 
meet the terms of the contract on the provision of quality goods 
and services. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In short, the establishment of the Tuktut Nogait park should 
benefit the Inuvialuit community and all Canadians by protecting 
and developing this region for generations to come. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, the park project recently was the focus of a dispute 
between the Inuvialuit and the government. 
On February 19, Inuvialuit Regional Corporation CEO Nellie 
Cournoyea wrote the Secretary of State responsible for parks, 
asking him to revise the park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In light of recent information on the geological possibilities 
of one region, which occupies 2.5% of the park's area, the 
Inuvialuit were asking to have that area excluded from the park 
in order to allow future development. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On March 25, the Secretary of State responsible for Parks wrote 
back denying the request to review park boundaries. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Since then, things have speeded up.  On March 30, the government 
introduced Bill C-38 at first reading.  It was debated at second 
reading on April 3.  On May 26, 28 and 29, the Standing 
Committee on Canadian Heritage held hearings on the bill. 
On June 1, a clause-by-clause examination of Bill C-38 was begun, 
and yesterday, June 11, we passed it at the report stage, while 
today we have moved on to third reading. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The rapidity of this process, given that the agreement was 
signed two years ago and that nothing had been done since then, 
makes us uncomfortable. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We regret that some information was not available to us, 
particularly the text of the final Inuvialuit agreement and its 
implementing legislation.  As well, we got the text of the 
Tuktut Nogait agreement only very belatedly. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The very brief hearings did not allow us to get a complete 
picture of the situation and to fully weigh the arguments of the 
parties involved. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Let us look now at the arguments from both sides. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For the Inuvialuit, the mining potential represents a much 
needed opportunity for economic development for their community. 
They were convinced they could obtain a revision of the park 
boundaries under section 22.1 of the agreement, which states 
that the agreement may be revisited with the consent of all 
parties. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There has been no environmental assessment proving that mining 
would compromise the park's integrity.  The Inuvialuit were 
prepared to accept the findings of a study on this.

</I></B></P><P align=left>In section 16 of the agreement, the federal government undertook 
to promote full Inuvialuit participation in the northern 
Canadian economy, and Inuvialuit integration into Canadian 
society through development of an adequate level of economic 
self-reliance and a solid economic base. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>From their point of view, the refusal to amend the park's 
boundaries constitutes the loss of an opportunity to realize 
their economic development without having to rely on federal 
government subsidies. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>For its part, the government is opposed to re-opening an 
agreement that took seven years to negotiate.  It does not wish 
to amend the boundaries because this could set a precedent and 
lead to other requests for changes in unmanaged parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The government often holds out the park plan to protect caribou 
breeding grounds as an important and vital argument. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Canada is also trying to limit mining projects on the American 
side of the border. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The park's board of management has asked the government to go 
ahead and create the park. 
Both sides' arguments have merit and it is difficult to decide 
clearly which option would most benefit all three groups, the 
Inuvialuit, the federal government and the general public. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is hard to decide whether the environmental or the economic 
arguments should take precedence, because a number of questions 
remain unanswered. 
Here are some of these questions. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Will changing the park's boundaries as requested by Inuvialuit 
officials compromise the main objective sought in creating the 
park, which is the protection of the Bluenose caribou herd and 
its calving and post-calving habitat? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Is the area affected by the change a sensitive area that is 
essential to the park? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What would have been the results of environmental impact studies 
on mining projects in that area? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Are the prospects of sustainable and long term development for 
the Inuvialuit community as a whole—through the creation of the 
park and their participation in its management—better than 
those provided by a mining project in a part of the territory 
that is supposed to become part of the park? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In spite of all these unanswered questions, the government 
decided to go ahead with the creation of the park, with the 
boundaries that were originally set. I deplore the fact that the 
government could not find a compromise that everyone could live 
with. 
There is no doubt that the creation of the park will have a 
positive environmental and economic impact on the region, but we 
will have to make sure the Inuvialuit are not penalized by the 
government's decision. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This is why I urge the secretary of state responsible for parks, 
and also his colleagues for Indian Affairs and Northern 
Development, Natural Resources and Human Resources Development, 
to make particular efforts to meet the federal government's 
commitments under the Inuvialuit final agreement, which are to 
promote the Inuvialuit's full participation in northern Canada's 
economy, and to help them reach an adequate level of economic 
self-sufficiency.

</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison (Cypress Hills—Grasslands, Ref.):</B>  Mr. 
Speaker, I will be dividing my time with the member for Calgary 
East. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Creation of the new park of Tuktut Nogait is a good idea.  We 
should have some tundra hills preserved for posterity.  However, 
I would hasten to point out that this site certainly is not 
unique. There are hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of 
virtually identical terrain.  The boundaries that were 
arbitrarily developed are not necessarily the ideal ones.  It is 
very unfortunate that they were established without any 
environmental assessment and without a resource inventory. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As a matter of fact, with respect to the resource inventory, 
there was a mining company with exploration rights on a portion 
of that park.  It was proposed as the hon. member for 
Rimouski—Mitis has just explained to have a small portion of the 
proposed area removed so that the mining company's exploration 
program could proceed. 
The proposal by the Inuvialuit was actually presented by no less 
a personage than Nellie Cournoyea. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1255"></A>
</P><P><A NAME="LINKT35"></A><A HREF="#RETLINKT35"><IMG SRC="/common/images/arobas.gif" border=0 alt="."></A> 1255
<A HREF="#LINKT36"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow1.gif" border=0 alt="+"></A>
<A HREF="#LINKT34"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Nevertheless the government in its wisdom has decided to press 
on.  The mining company was pressured to “voluntarily” 
relinquish its rights and here we are. It is the usual story of 
urban know it alls from central Canada dictating to the local 
people with respect to parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Unlike the great parks of the Rocky Mountains which have 
negligible mineral potential, Tuktut Nogait may contain 
economically important deposits.  Nobody knows because nobody has 
ever made a serious effort to find out. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Fortunately future generations will be able, I suppose if it is 
deemed in the public interest, to change the boundaries of the 
already established park.  But why not start out correctly from 
the very beginning?  There should have been an assessment.  This 
should be true of any new park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There should always be an economic and environmental assessment, 
a cost benefit study to decide where the park should precisely be 
and then cast the boundaries in stone.  Do not just draw lines on 
maps and say “Gee I think it is a good idea to have a park 
here”.  It requires a bit of science and a little thought. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As far as the possible disturbance of the bluenose caribou by 
this exploration proposed in two and half per cent of the park is 
concerned, my personal observation is that caribou are quite 
compatible with human activity.  I have seen them browsing in the 
shadow of a mine headframe.  It is well-known that prospectors or 
explorers in the barren lands have had their tents knocked down 
because the caribou find that they are very convenient rubbing 
posts.  Caribou are not shy animals; they are anything but. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The local people regard them as being a little on the dumb side 
and easy pickings for hunters. There is not much glory, not much 
honour, going out and shooting a caribou.  It is like going out 
and milking a cow on the farm. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Talking about interfering with local people, just a few days ago 
our revered heritage minister vetoed a very carefully thought out 
and democratically approved development plan in Banff park. The 
local people looked at this very carefully.  They decided what 
they felt was needed, decided what was suitable for their own 
particular environment.  But no, our heritage minister gets up on 
her white horse, comes roaring in and says “They shall not do 
it. Never”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same people in Banff had to fight for years to preserve 
their airstrip.  Fortunately they were able to enlist the 
assistance of the Canadian Air Line Pilots Association who 
pointed out that the airstrip in Banff as well as the one in 
Jasper are very important for safety reasons, for emergency 
landings. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>They have been able to keep the airstrips but one wonders what 
the furore was about.  Both of these parks are bisected by a 
highway and a railway.  They were going to shut down a little 
3,000 foot grass strip, which is highly essential to the 
preservation of human life, because somebody got a bug in their 
ear. Anyway, that battle has been won. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Hopefully when the present minister is sent to her reward with 
whatever patronage appointment she will get, this airstrip will 
again be returned for the local people to use.  There are people 
in Banff who fly and use their aircraft for search and rescue. 
They have done so for many years. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Eventually I think they will get their airstrip back.  It 
probably will revert to the situation which existed wherein they 
did the maintenance work at no cost to the federal government. 
Since these airstrips are going to be strictly for emergency use, 
the federal government's parks department will have to cut the 
grass and plough the snow. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have another example of the local people being run over 
roughshod by Parks Canada. 
<P align=left>&nbsp;<A NAME="T1300"></A>

</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>This one is rather near and dear to me because it is in my own 
riding, the Grasslands park in southern Saskatchewan.  The local 
people are really frightened by this vast area of ungrazed 
prairie which is beside their farms and ranches.  This is a 
powder keg, a potential fire hazard of unparalleled proportions. 
They have begged and pleaded with Parks Canada to allow limited 
grazing of cattle in that park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The natural condition of the prairie land is to be grazed by 
large ungulate. They used to be called buffalo.  We have no 
buffalo any more.  So not only does the prairie grow wild and 
present this terrible fire hazard, but it is deteriorating 
because in the natural balance certain species tend to overcrowd 
the others when ground is not grazed.  Any rancher knows this, 
but the academic geniuses in Parks Canada who have never probably 
seen a cow or a buffalo or a blade of grass do not know what is 
happening out there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The same parks people also continually get into unpleasant 
situations with the local people simply by being bad neighbours. 
They unlawfully impound stray livestock, for example.  They 
refuse to participate in the maintenance of line fences.  They 
say “that is your problem”. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>On one occasion they actually were convinced under great duress 
to put up a fence.  A fence the local ranchers had moved off the 
survey line for generations was then placed exactly on the survey 
line right down the middle of a creek. Brilliance.  So naturally 
the first spring it went away and there was no fence at all and 
the rancher had to rebuild the fence back on his own land. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The problem with stray livestock was taken seriously enough 
that the local municipal government has passed the only open herd 
law in Saskatchewan that I am aware of.  You can now run your 
cattle anywhere, including on your neighbour's front lawn, 
between I think October 1 and April 1, simply because Parks 
Canada is so obdurate that they will not get along with their 
neighbours. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I have to leave some time for my hon. colleague but I could go 
on for a long time about people at Parks Canada, some of my 
favourite whipping people. 
<P><A NAME="LINK244"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I find it hard to restrain myself from commenting in respect of 
other members. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I take exception to the hon. member's statements on a number of 
occasions.  The first is that there is no honour in hunting. I 
beg the member to reconsider this.  Sport hunting and sustenance 
hunting are two different forms of hunting. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When northern people enter the tundra and kill a caribou to 
bring home and feed their child and sustain life for their 
family, for their generations to come, there is no greater honour 
than entering the woods, surviving the elements and bringing back 
the meat and the sustenance for that community or for that 
family.  One does not need honour to be up in a chopper with a 
telescopic gun aiming at unprotected species on the ground. 
There is no honour in that.  But when you sustain your family, 
when you hunt for the privilege of honouring and respecting the 
land, there is great honour in that. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We no longer have buffalo, as the hon. member said. There was no 
honour when the hunters climbed on to the trains and used 
automatic weapons and killed and piled buffalo bones on the banks 
of Wascana Lake, as it was later created.  Wascana means piles of 
bones. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>[<I>Editor's Note:  Member spoke in Cree</I>] 
<P align=left>[<I>English</I>] 
</I></B></P><P align=left>There is no honour in that. But when you retain the national 
parks and the integrity of the national parks, there is some 
security for the future generation.  They can see in the past 
what ecological measures were taken.

</I></B></P><P align=left>I challenge the member to travel along the west coast of the 
United States.  He will see the cathedral red woods standing in a 
protected area of northern California.  Then he will arrive in 
Oregon where it is clearcut. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>In terms of resource inventory, environmental impacts and 
challenging Parks Canada to retain its integrity and resources 
this costs money. The Reform Party time and time again has tried 
to be accountable. This government has made cutbacks that have 
had an impact on Parks Canada.  Let us invest and put money in 
our budgets to retain the future of our parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Lee Morrison:</B>  Mr. Speaker, the hon. member should dig 
out his ears and listen to what other speakers are saying. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>When I spoke of the caribou being an easy mark, I was not making 
any disparaging references to native people. I have had 
conversations along this line with Inuvialuit people who know 
that the caribou is a stupid animal and easy to shoot. That is 
all I said.  Please pay attention. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The member was talking about wiping out the buffalo with 
automatic weapons.  That would have been quite a trick inasmuch 
as automatic weapons were not developed until about 20 years 
after buffalo were nearly extinct.  But that is a sideline. 
<P><A NAME="LINK245"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai (Calgary East, Ref.):</B>  Mr. Speaker, I 
have risen on this bill on many occasions and talked about the 
importance of national parks in Canada for future generations. 
We have supported this bill in the past.  We are now aware of the 
controversy that took place about taking out a portion of the 
boundary due to the mineral finds in them. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would say that both sides have good arguments.  I would like 
to agree with my colleague from Cypress Hill who said future 
generations can change this if so desired.  Although he says let 
us do it right in the first place, I would venture to say that at 
this time, due to the fact that this area has also been 
identified as a calving ground for the bluenose caribou, we not 
change it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>It is important to recognize that national parks are an 
ecological treasure.  We are the custodians of this ecological 
treasure for our future generations.  Therefore the Reform Party 
says we should support the concept of environmentally sensitive 
zoning. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>The Reform Party supports cost effective and efficient 
initiatives that protect and preserve Canada's wildlife and 
wilderness areas for future generations to enjoy.  Based on this, 
my party is in agreement with this act and will support this 
because it follows what we support. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>However, I would like to talk on another point on Parks Canada. 
This is the user fee, the entrance fee into the national parks. I 
come from the riding of Calgary East which is at the foothills of 
the greatest natural treasurer we have in Canada.  It is the 
Banff National Park at the foot of the Rockies.  A tremendous 
amount of traffic goes through that park. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Over the 20 years since I first came to Canada I have marvelled 
at that area.  I have noticed time after time that the user fee 
keeps rising.

<A HREF="#LINKT37"> <IMG SRC="/common/images/arrow2.gif" border=0 alt="-"></A>
</P>
</I></B></P><P align=left>Today it has come to the state where there are serious concerns 
as to what is the aim of this national park.  One U.S. ranger 
said U.S. parks are set aside for the specific purpose of being 
available for all people, not specific people who can afford to 
go there. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>We support our national parks as they are our national treasures 
for all Canadians.  We should not raise the user fee to a level 
where only those who can afford to go can. That has happened.  I 
do not go frequently to Banff National Park but I did at one 
time.  Now I do not because of the high cost of going into my own 
national heritage. This is a cause for concern. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>Imagine going through Banff and having to use the washroom.  Our 
bodies do not say we are in a national park and cannot go to the 
washroom unless we have paid the user fee.  If we have to go and 
we stop we are liable to a $2,000 fine. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>As was quoted in the Calgary <I>Herald</I> one out of four cars 
going through Banff National Park does not pay the fee.  Why? Do 
we think they do not wish to comply with Canadian laws? Nonsense. 
They do but the user fee is too expensive. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I am asking the government to consider that user fees for 
national parks is not revenue generating. We pay taxes.  Taxes 
have not been reduced.  Therefore this government should not use 
user fees as another form of taxation.  It is important we 
recognize this fact. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>User fees should be at a level where all Canadians can afford to 
go into national parks to enjoy themselves. Members of parliament 
have just been given pay raises of 2% so I presume they can 
afford to go to national parks. But I am talking about general 
usage. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>My party supports this bill.  We agree with this bill. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I would like to wish a happy summer to all my colleagues in the 
House.  Go back to your constituencies and work for your 
constituents.  I would like to pass a motion to adjourn the House 
for the summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  That will happen in due course in any 
event.  Before questions and comments, the hon. government House 
leader.

all occupants of the chair, our very able staff from the clerks 
to the pages and all the support staff on Parliament Hill for the

very best to all hon. members of this House. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I think each one of us has deserved a bit of a break, some more 
than others perhaps if I can put it that way, but it has been an 
excellent session.  I congratulate all hon. members and hope they 
will work very hard doing constituency work until we get back in

Speaker, I would like to ask my colleague a question not so much 
for my own benefit but for the benefit of members in the House, 
most of whom are central Canadians who have never seen Banff. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>What is the current day rate to enter Banff National Park?  I 
also remind my colleague that it is pretty difficult to maintain 
accessibility of the public to a park when all that money is 
needed for Bombardier. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, yes, it is pretty 
expensive.  I have the 1996 rate, which I think has gone up, by 
the way.  It says $6 for adults but I think it has gone to $10 
per day for adults, if I am not mistaken. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I remember when I was there it used to be $1 per day.  Now it is 
$10 per day and $10 per day is pretty expensive.  It is $75 a 
year to go to that national park.  Again I appeal to the 
government to revisit that fee. 
<P><A NAME="LINK248"></A></P>
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Rick Laliberte (Churchill River, NDP):</B>  Mr. Speaker, 
I have two points to make.  The Reform Party spoke about its 
support for the ecological integrity of the Arctic region.  This 
park is certainly one way of guaranteeing it. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>This past week we had a motion ready to be introduced on an 
international agreement on persistent organic pollutants that 
affect endangered species of northern Canada.  Why would his 
party not support an international agreement on persistent 
organic pollutants? 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I congratulate all members on the successful parliament of the 
last year and ask them to enjoy our national parks.  I look 
forward to a safe summer. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Mr. Deepak Obhrai:</B>  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the 
question.  I think everyone is concerned about pollutants and the 
ecological damage done to national parks. 
</I></B></P><P align=left>I was born right next to national parks in Africa and I treasure 
national parks and animals.  I share the sentiment that we should 
be very careful to ensure that pollution does not damage our 
ecological environment. 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>The Deputy Speaker:</B>  Is the House ready for the question? 
</I></B></P><P align=left><B>Some hon. members:</B>  Question.
